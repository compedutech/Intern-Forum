[Capstone],Animeshirk,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ik9px4/am_i_in_over_my_head_capstone/,"I'm in my senior year of a mechanical engineering bachelors degree and  am currently in the first half of our colleges capstone project. We've been given a list of projects to choose from, two of which stood out to me. First was designing an automated thermoforming testing bed, and the other was designing  a Friction stir welding fixture for a CNC machine. Both seem really interesting but the problem is we need to first email the professors about our interest and convince them why we are qualified for this project before we can join a team. To be honest, I don't believe i'm qualified for any of the projects listed.  I never managed to land any internships nor have I had any other experience  or prior knowledge related to any of them. The most I have under my belt are my core classes and even then I am average amidst my class with mostly  B's, one or two C's, and the odd A. I feel like everyone is way ahead of me.  I'm afraid that my lack of experience will hinder the group  and I don't want others to fail because of this. What do I do?  Am i just not cut out for engineering?"
ikas59,3,2020-08-31,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (8/31/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/ikas59/weekly_job_qa_thread_8312020/,"Hi all,

Here is the twenty-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

I've been fortunate enough to visit on 3 separate occasions and found it a place in which I could see myself living in the future - in addition to other personal factors which provide a strong motive to eventually make the leap (girlfriend is from SG). 

On the other hand, I've just started a junior level role today (SEO, SEM in Fintech) - this is my first FT position but I do have other experience from other roles that focus on different areas of digital MK (as listed below). 

\- U.S. Citizen living in major Southeastern city, 24 y/o Male

\- B.A. in Econ, Marketing minor from state school (Summa, top of class). English as only language.

\- 1 and 1/2 yrs (and counting) experience in analytics/tag management implementation, SEO, customer experience roles as intern (worked in all org sizes, can adapt to either)

\- Alternative is okay within proximity (increasing prospects for LT goal to work in SG)

\- Thinking longer-term (say 10+ years)

\- I'm currently working on enhancing my programming and database querying skills (Python, SQL) to improve my technical skillset.

I did want to see if anyone in Singapore / surrounding countries has any insight into:

(a) What is the demand for talent within the digital MK space (in SG/SEA countries)?

(b) What experience from foreign talent do you see as advantageous to securing a role in Singapore? 

(c) Does experience from working in other SEA countries (thinking Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand) serve as advantageous? I'm not opposed to working in such similar countries (as I have visited) providing this increases my chances of eventually making that geographical leap.

(d) Is this a realistic long-term goal to possess? It's something I feel passionate about and finally feel is working towards. 

Thanks to all that respond - I do appreciate it!"

I came into university with the hopes of graduating with a computer science degree, however my university has you compete grade-wise to get in at the end of second year and I did not make the cut. 

I guess what I want to know is: is the prestige worth it? Is it worth it for me to stay at the prestigious school and graduate in computational cognition and statistics, or is it smarter for me to go to a not as recognized school and receive a degree in computer science? 

I can name a few companies who have specified that they hire interns from the university I am currently in, as well as some others, but never mention any less recognized school and I am afraid that’s the case for many companies. A lot of students from the less recognized school also say that they have trouble finding work even with a cs degree because students from my school are given more opportunity, which I don’t see fair, but there’s nothing I can do about it.

A lot of people also tell me that if I keep taking programming courses and do projects on the side, I could get a position as a developer just as students with a cs degree can. I know it’s possible, but I was really fixated on a cs degree. My goal is to work in artifical intelligence! 

I just don’t know what would be the best option. Computer science degree at a less recognized university, or computational cognition and statistics at a prestigious university."

So she asked for my help on finding her a new laptop. She's a biomedical engineering student and despite the pandemic, she still needs to go to campus to work on her labs. Since I have a PC, I'm lending her my laptop for now so that she can do the stuff she needs to do.

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
Her budget is $1000-$1200
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Battery life is most important because her lab sessions last about 4 hours. She also works an internship at a hospital, so the battery life needs to be long enough when she does her rounds.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
As long as a small woman can carry it
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
15""

She uses Labview, Solidworks, Comsol, Matlab, Word, Powerpoint and Excel.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Sims 4, Teamfight Tactics, Valorant, Civ 6
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Good keyboard, color accurate screen, accurate touchpad, big storage, doesn't slow down when she has a lot of tabs open and a display that wont give her a headache when she works on something for a long time.
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
She's not rushing to get a laptop, but she wants to get a curbside pickup so that I can get my laptop back. If a curbside pickup is not possible, she can order it online and wait for it to arrive."

As title. I am preparing my resume for the role: Financial Analyst and I felt like I am lacking in experience. I have had my fair share of part time jobs, seasonal jobs various from hospitality to Mechanics. I want to get into financial world so I think it is best start out as an Intern specially I have not really had any experience in the field.

Couple Questions:

1. Should I have include one of my seasonal/ part time job instead of relevant course? Once I eliminated unrelated experience, I was left with too much room that I filled with Relevant Course. I used to be Supervisor in Fast food Restaurant, is it better to include it in my experience instead?
2. Should I leave \*Willing to Relocate\* on top of my resume like how it is as I really want to relocate somewhere new. I am all about changing and experience.
3. I am taking Investment Management this semester (Fall 2020), should I still include it as relevant course if by the time I get accepted by employer I have finish the course?

I want to take this opportunity to try working in the public sector before I graduate and start looking for a full time position. After poking around the web a bit, it seems that there are internship positions and programs available at places like the department of defense, the NSA, the sate department and so on that are exactly the kind of thing I am interested in. However, information about how these programs operate,how to apply to them, and what exactly the work entails is disorganized, out of date or both so I figured I would ask here to see if the Reddit community can answer a few basic questions for me.

1. Are there any software internships run by the various federal departments/agencies that hire interns year round, or at least in the spring? The ones I have seen appear to be summer internships only.
2. Is there anywhere where information about these positions is centrally located so I don't have to go to a different website for each program? If not, which websites give the best information for their respective internship program?
3. In general, what software and other technologies are these places using?  What other knowledge or skills do they look for that normal companies don't ask about ? 

I would appreciate some advice from someone who has worked in this space or has gone through one of these programs."

I'm a senior this year and I'm very certain I just landed my first internship(part time during this semester) as the interview went quite well. It's a firmware engineering position and I think I'm pretty happy about it, I mean, I'll take any internship I can get at this point. I'd say my resume is a bit impressive; I have many projects and a high CS gpa, just no work experience. Here's my dilemma:

I would really really really like to leave home as soon as possible. I want to live on my own. I have a large poor family and we all live in a small house. On the other hand, I don't want to graduate without enough internship experience so, if I really have to, I'll stay home for another half year. I've been thinking about doing a full time software engineering co-op for the spring semester and graduating in December 2021 instead of May 2021. I originally wanted to do back end or maybe full stack web development but I'll do whatever I have the opportunity to do that will also pay me well.

Another thing I could do is apply to new grad positions starting now. If I get accepted to a new grad position, I won't have to delay my graduation. The thing is, I don't know much about the process. Will I get responses from companies for summer 2021 new grad positions before I have to make the decision of whether or not I skip the Spring semester? I'd hate to have skipped the semester and then gotten a new grad offer.

What do you all think?"

I need some advice hopefully from experienced engineers or managers on how to proceed. I just graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. During my degree program I held two internships at two companies I will call Company A and Company B.....I also held a teaching assistant position for a semester. My first internship was in medical device reprocessing at a local startup(Company A) during my sophomore year. My second internship was in construction(Company B) and led to a full time offer....they waited until a week before my official full time start date to call me and let me know I would have to work in a part time scenario temporarily due to COVID 19 and how it has impacted my department. My offer was not necessarily rescinded because my hourly pay increased but I am losing out on benefits and the ability to work full time which in turn does not give me enough financial stability to move out and live on my own yet. I am frustrated because I turned down some interviews during the time period between my internship with Company B and the date I expected to go full time with Company B since there is no way I would have imagined my offer being reduced to part time especially since they waited until a week out. Now the interviews I rejected are all ghost and Im sure positions have either already been filled or closed due to COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck because I am lucky to still have a part time engineering position but I feel like no company wants to interview me because I have ""technically"" just started a new role(less than 2 months at this job as listed on my resume). I have been applying to jobs with no luck so far and I have also asked other friends to help me by recommending me at their companies but nothing has ever came of it. I also cannot attend my schools career fair because I am going to be in a different state for some site observations the day of my schools virtual engineering career fair. Another thing I should mention is that I applied and was accepted into a MS program in mechanical engineering at the same university I just finished my undergrad in and thought of working part time with Company B while finishing a masters. Doing a masters right now is my least favored option because I am mainly looking for financial stability now and i have heard that doing a masters with no purpose can pigeon hole me into a specific market and limit the jobs I can apply to. Can someone give me some advice on how to leverage my current situation? I appreciate the help anyone can give to a young engineer."

iketm7,60,2020-09-01,Advice from a Fifth Year to Freshmen,michaerlscottttttttt,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/iketm7/advice_from_a_fifth_year_to_freshmen/,"I saw the earlier post about advice to freshmen and I highly agree with the points. I'm going to add some points from my own experience, especially pre professional experience(particularly for those going into stem fields). I'm double majoring in two stem fields so I'm staying for a fifth to lessen the stress and loading but I'm currently also starting to apply/interview for jobs so I have some insight on that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **You don't need to come into school with an exact plan or career planned out.** The beginning of college is a time for you to explore, have some fun with new things and try new interests out. Don't be scared of trying new things as this will help you discover what you want to do in the future. Even if you aren't 100% sure, having something is better than nothing. Note that this applies to usually your first 2 years of college. You'll obviously meet people who have a whole 10,15 year plan set out but don't be deterred! Realistically by the time you're a third year and maybe fourth year(preferably not), you will have a more concrete goal of what you want to do and the direction you want to go to. If you want to know what you might be interested in, look on glass door, handshake, indeed or any job recruiting sites and look at the descriptions for those jobs. They will tell you the responsibilities and requirements of certain jobs. You can work from there to see what you need to do to land the job you have in mind.
2. **GPA does matter.** For a lot of entry level jobs, especially those in the stem fields and are high paying, they will require a minimum gpa(usually between 3.0-3.5). A good gpa shows diligence and an understanding of the material you are learning. You should try as hard as you can to understand your class material as you may need it in your future career. (Note that this matters a lot more for those in business or stem fields). If you find yourself struggling in class ask yourself ""am I studying the right way or do I just not get it?"" If you TRULY do not get/understand a certain amount of classes for your particular major then it might be time for you to change majors. Furthermore, not just for job recruitment but every form of post graduate schools care A LOT about gpa). It's good to have fun but don't forget that you're in school to learn and to finish with a degree. Although your gpa usually doesn't matter after your first job, having a decent/above average gpa will make your life a lot easier.(Note: say that your gpa isn't good by the time you're recruiting then don't put it on your resume.) 
3. **Networking does matter.** Networking can get you very far when you're looking for a job. A job referral can make a lot of a difference in getting an interview and no interview. You should network with those in your year and especially upperclassmen. Upperclassmen will be the ones who will graduate first and thus have to actually go through the recruitment process for jobs. If you have connections in certain fields you want you work in you can also ask for advice and help by the time you are job hunting. I highly recommend setting a linkedin account as soon as you can and using linkedin to network. You can send message invites/connects to people to ask them about their jobs and experiences. Also networking includes faculty as well. Try and build lasting relationships with professors so that you can learn more about any field you're interested in and also to get good recommendation letters/references. Lastly, GO TO JOB FAIRS AND ON CAMPUS RECRUITING. This is one thing that a lot of people don't realize enough. Major companies do a lot of their work through on campus recruitment. Especially the big names you see in the news. Don't be afraid to try and connect with recruiters and build long lasting relationships with them. If you want an easier way to find a job out of college or to get an internship position, go to on campus recruiting events.
4. **Internships matter A LOT.** A good internship can offset a lower gpa. A good internship can demonstrate to companies or recruiters that you have certain skills they are looking for and you that can do the required work. No matter which field or direction you want to go to such as getting a job or a graduate degree, you will need an internship to prove your skillset. Obviously some internships will be regarded as better than others in terms of recruiting. Major companies such as big tech companies(google, microsoft, facebook...etc), big 4 accounting firms, and any leading company in their own respective industry will be regarded as the BEST for your resume. I highly recommend applying to these whenever you can as their applications might be a bit lucrative and VERY selective. Research is also a very good field of internships you should consider. A good research position can get you 3 main things. 1 is good research experience no matter your field which translates to often times technical skills. 2 is that you can potentially get a publication out of your research which is a big plus for your resume. 3 is that your professor will most likely write you a good recommendation letter if you don't do too poorly.  When you're looking for internships look for ones that teach you TRANSFERABLE SKILLS you will need in whichever profession you want to go into/potentially go into. If you find an internship and you end up not liking it, quit and find a new one! There are lot of opportunities out there so don't feel restricted in certain roles and look out for your own best interests. Also note that doing internships for long periods of time will look a lot better than doing multiple internships for short periods of time(especially for research).
5. **Have a priorities.** This is especially important since coming into college you will have a whole new level of freedom and choices. You will be presented with new experiences and new friends at a place you've most likely never been to. This makes it easier for a lot of people to lose sight of their priorities or what their priorities should be. You should never forget that you are in college to learn and graduate with a degree. Thus, your education should be your #1 priority. Never skip class or skip out on studying(when you're unprepared) because you want to have a little more fun. Have a plan and tell yourself that you can work and study hard but also have fun. Set goals for yourself a long the way so that you can make the most out of your time but also enjoy the college experience. Small goals can lead to good habits and those habits can help you accomplish big goals. If your plan is to get a job out of college, you want to develop pre professional skills that you can bring to the market which will come from internships and classes. Develop your resume and set realistic goals for yourself on how you want to get there. If your goal is to get into some form of graduate school then maximize your gpa and internship experiences and build good relationships with faculty so you can get good rec letters. You will be bound to fail at some point but remember to pick yourself back up and learn from those failures. You can easily adapt in the future with your experiences. Note that in most directions you want to go into, the technical skills you know(Often learnt through internships) and your gpa should be your #1 priority.

&amp;#x200B;

This is pretty long but it's my key advice to being successful in college/after college. Shoot me a PM if you have any questions."

I need to receive my first salary and I am confused on how to do so. The amount is approximate 500eur/month.

As far as I've read online direct bank transfer results in a bad conversion fee. 

My second option was Transferwise but it seems that we cannot receive currency in India. 

My third option was Paypal but again we cannot receive or send to/from personal account in paypal and the business account takes a fee of 4.4% + fixed fee based on the currency (0.35 EUR in my case). 

My question is to all freelancers or people receiving money from foreign in India. How do you accept money? How much does that cost you? What do you prefer I should do in my case? Also how important is taking an FIRC certificate? Should I opt for one?"

I sent him a message asking to forward me their resume and I can pass it to the right people at my company. 

Now I am the CEO of a very well known direct to consumer tech company and have exited few startups successfully prior to that. I did not reveal any of that, rather I told him where I work, and I said I can forward the resume to our CTO.

He asked me to add him to LinkedIn. Which I did, next I receive a question regarding my profile and get blocked by him.

Moral of the story, if someone asks you for your resume, please send it and don’t shy away. That’s the only way you can get a job. Your resume is not a secret and does not fit under HIPPA compliance.

Network as much as you can, I haven’t had a single job interview since 2009. Been networking since. One job leads to the other and one startup leads to the next.

I hope you find this helpful"

ikjm8m,11,2020-09-01,"I'm a basket case, can I recover?",Unlucky-Elephant-530,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ikjm8m/im_a_basket_case_can_i_recover/,"I'm 35, and some years back had some physical and mental health problems and consequently had a nervous breakdown that I'm still pulling out of.

I've done 2/3rds of a CS undergrad, but it would take 2 full years to finish because of prereqs and when the courses are offered. The courses I'm missing are mostly fluff like ethics and business, the only ones that are core CS are AI and compilers.

My work history is abysmal with big gaps and most recently doing gig work.

I do however have, or had at least, pretty strong CS fundamentals. I was a good student and did a lot of extracurricular projects like doing part of the Eudalypta Challenge (kernel dev.) and writing an NES emulator.

I like C (C++, Java..) and lower level stuff. I'm not cut out to be a full stack dev or similar; I don't have any design intuition or like web stuff. [And since I like C I find myself really frustrated using frameworks where I have little idea of what's going on under the surface, but I get that I might have to get over that.]

I had a chance social encounter with a guy who was a project manager at Microsoft a couple years back and his conclusion at the time about me was: that I could solve problems while keeping complexity in mind and was ""sitting on a goldmine"" but because of all the red flags would have trouble getting in the door.

He suggested trying to get an internship at a startup and convert that into a paid position. Obviously with the current state of things, and my atrophying skills, that's probably not going to work now.

Friends have suggested I tried to either get a job doing entry level helpdesk support or sys admin. The idea being getting my foot in the door and also having the opportunity to pick up small internal projects and/or study in my downtime. I would strongly prefer *nix admin if that's a possibility, I've been using Linux since I was in my teens and by osmosis have developed a pretty good grounding in making boxes work; but I have no certs (though I'm all for getting them) or work experience there.


I know I'm never going to land a job at a Fortune 500 company like a lot of guys posting here who are just out of a top 50 school with a 3.8 GPA are going for, but is there any hope for me at all?"

I am graduating next year and am worried that I have hardly any experience. I have done two internships at pretty decent firms as a research and data analyst but those roles only lasted a month. I will be extremely grateful if anyone could advise me on any side projects I could participate in related to economics or data analysis (I have decent understanding with Python and consider myself very adept with Excel). Thanks and have a good day!
ikk0e6,7,2020-09-01,Should I accept promotion if I plan to leave in January?,DKF22,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ikk0e6/should_i_accept_promotion_if_i_plan_to_leave_in/,"Some background: I've worked on the production floor at a manufacturing job for 8 years now. In this time, I have been going to school part-time to get a Bachelor's degree that I am 2 semesters away from completing.

Since last April, I have been coming in 1-2 hours early every day and training and helping out with office work in the purchasing department. I enjoy the work and people and have picked up the responsibilities I have been given pretty well. Just last week, a job posting was made for a full-time employee to work in the purchasing department as an Administrative Assistant. The job posting was made with the idea being that I would be the employee to take and fill the role. The job pays decent for what it is ($16-$18 an hour) and all in all isn't a bad job at all. 

There is only one hold up on my end: in June, I was offered an internship that starts in January. The internship pays very well ($25 an hour) and will last 14 weeks. The company itself is known to not hire very many interns, but the job I'd be filling is exactly what I would want to do in my career. Even if I wasn't offered a full time role, the experience would be good for me and add a lot to my resume. I have decided that this internship may be a one-time opportunity and that I would like to accept the internship. 

How do I go about this with my current employer? Do I take the new role and accept that I'll be putting in a two weeks notice in two months? Or should I just decline the job and take the internship in January? My current employer has no knowledge of my internship offer. Would it be possible or professional to request a 14 week pause in my employment instead of out-right quitting my job?"

I do well in most subjects except for chemistry and physics. I have a passion for computer science and I've taken multiple internships. I've also led multiple team computer science projects and have given speeches at MUN's and gotten awards. I've participated and won lots of competitions and have received certificates for many of these.

 I really need to study abroad, maybe in a country like Australia. My parents hope to move there but they don't know what qualifications I need to have."
iklalm,11,2020-09-01,Never Too Early to Start Network Building,UltimateTeam,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/iklalm/never_too_early_to_start_network_building/,"This is especially geared towards younger engineers, but it may be useful for more people. 

When you're a freshman and a sophomore, build a network of juniors and seniors at your school. This helps not only with classes, but hearing about internship experiences and job openings. 

Once you are a junior/senior you'll know a lot more people who have recently entered the workforce and get insight into their transition and the companies people enjoy working for. At that point you can branch out to people who've been in the industry 3-5 years. 

You can get an idea of who is hiring and advice on the next steps to get involved in the recruiting process. 

For example there are career fairs coming up, like 30-35 companies in my discipline(s) and I will have sessions with like 25. Ideally maybe 2-3 are warm ups, but the vast majority I want to have talked to 2-3 employees there and gotten some insight into why I am good fit for the position the skills I can bring/develop


**IF you are looking for full time**

Don't risk being the schmo that shows up have spent 15-20 minutes the night before reading the front page and posting, you're asking for a huge investment in your abilities. Act like it."

ikmawz,5,2020-09-01,Interested in Embedded Systems,symbotic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ikmawz/interested_in_embedded_systems/,"Hi,

I've been accepted to OSU's post-bacc in computer science. I'm interested in going into embedded systems after graduation. However, the curriculum does not offer much on this. I'm wondering what kind of supplementary courses, certificates, MOOCs or something that I could do to position myself to obtain an internship in embedded systems when I'm nearing the end of the program?

EDIT: My previous degree was in Biology.

Thanks"

Regarding bad GRE score, the night before I had panic attack followed by only a 5 hours of sleep. I knew I could do well on Quants but I was sleep deprived.

Cant retake GRE due to financial predicaments. I'll be dependent on scholarships/waivers both from uni and from my country. 

What are my odds that I get into a few of these?

ikn5og,3,2020-09-01,"About to graduate, and feeling very uneasy on my abilities",csidlauskas,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ikn5og/about_to_graduate_and_feeling_very_uneasy_on_my/,"Hey guys! In advanced, thank you so much for taking the time to read this post!

Backstory: I spent 5 years in the military, after high school and started college after I finished my contract. I was a little late to the party, but I am finally due to graduate in May from college with a bachelors in Computer Information Technology. 

One of the requirements to graduate is to have at least 3 credits of a paid IT internship, which is equivalent to 480 work hours. I was hired for my internship right before COVID hit. I was in the office for one whole day and then the company told their employees to work from home. We have been working remote ever since. Thus, my entire internship thus far has been remote. I just got news that the company I have my internship with is temporarily ending their internship program due to COVID and the inability to properly mentor their students. My last day is Friday. 

Thankfully, I have completed the necessary amount of credits. However, I really do not feel confident. I really hoped I would feel more confident in my programming abilities by the end of my internship, but obviously my situation is a little unique since I was remote the entire time and I’m left feeling really uneasy about any future job I take on after graduating. Like I said, I have 2 semesters left, with a graduation date of May 2021. I have been on the Dean’s List every semester since I began college. I do have a project I am extremely proud of, which I think employers would be impressed by.

I assume uneasiness is a normal feeling for all soon to be graduates. I just do not feel confident in my abilities and I feel doubtful that I’d get a job after college. I know I have 2 semesters left but that is only 6 classes. 

Do you guys have any recommendations on what I could do to increase my knowledge or feel more confident in my abilities?  Or are most junior developers who are hired still feeling this way?"
ikn8qj,1,2020-09-01,Should I accept a 2% raise going into my third year of work?,Soldarex,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ikn8qj/should_i_accept_a_2_raise_going_into_my_third/,"I asked to meet with my boss to discuss a raise. I am an independent contractor working for a 60/40 split (me/company). This is the first raise I have asked for and have been working professionally for 2 years. I was an unpaid intern with this company for 7 months prior. Last year I made about 24k before taxes working 3/4 time. I have a bachelor's in a specialized field. 

Since I am going into my third year I was going to ask for a 5% raise. I didn't expect this to be the final amount, more like 3-4% after negotiations. My boss did not offer to meet with me but did offer a 2% raise. She emailed this to me late afternoon yesterday to be effective today. If I accept I would be getting 62% of all monies paid by my clients. This is of course before taxes. The company prices are generally a little low compared to others in the field. My boss did increase prices for clients by a couple of dollars in the spring (still only about $4 more per month per client at my current 60%). She used this as justification for the 2% increase. In the email she did agree I needed a raise and noted how I am a valuable asset, etc. 

Two huge reasons I asked for a raise:
1. I incur most of the operating costs for my clientele. I work out in the field and cover a large geographic area. The expenses for wear/tear and gas are on me. I am anticipating driving 400-500 miles/week this year. I do use our (rented) office space but pay a monthly rental fee to my boss for this separately.
2. I have gone above and beyond in this position: directly mentoring interns due to my boss's absenteeism, directly working with clients and related personelle, maintaining clientele through the COVID disruptions... the list goes on. I had planned to discuss these areas in a face to face meeting with my boss. 

This is a small company with just a few independent contractors. My boss owns the company and is the sole figurehead. Our clientele have dropped off somewhat due to COVID but I have worked to maintain clients, including being directly involved in transitioning to tele-services. Prior to COVID this job was barely enough to sustain me financially, but it is in my chosen field and I have stayed to gain experience. I unfortunately am unable to find another job in the field without moving, which is not possible until May 2021 at the earliest. I will be working this job 3 days/week and will look for other part time work until more work (IF more work) becomes available here. (Oh and to note my boss is planning to bring on our current intern and possibly one other person as contractors, despite having little to no work coming in. She is not actively seeking out clientele and has not made attempts to begin services with clients I have attempted to bring in. I feel like she's running this business into the ground... but that's a story for another day.)

I work in a small field so I'm trying to not ruin this relationship (which is already rocky due to the company's nonpayment for my services for several months in 2019, which has since been resolved). But I also value myself and my work and don't feel 2% plus the marginal price increase values me monetarily. I know times are tough but when I see things like new office furniture/decorations, and not legitimate suggested improvements by myself/others it feels like she could afford the 5% and is trickling my pay increase with this 2%.

Should I be grateful (and in my mind lick the boot) and accept her offer? Or should I counter with my 65% and state my reasons? I know for a fact the highest she will ever pay a contractor is 73%. 

Sorry for the long read. I'm having a difficult time sorting out my emotions and logic regarding this situation. 

TIA. 

Tl;dr I asked to meet with my boss to discuss a raise, and was planning to ask for a 5% increase. She did not offer to meet but offered a 2% increase, which I don't feel covers my worth and expenses."
iknjb4,1,2020-09-01,Did I (21F) do the right thing? Breaking up with my best friend (21M).,Ok_Pop7817,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iknjb4/did_i_21f_do_the_right_thing_breaking_up_with_my/,"I met my college best friend a few weeks into freshman year. We very quickly started spending all our time together and we became super close. It was an amazing friendship at first. Over the years I started to pick up on some red flags about our friendship, and whenever I tell this story people insist that he was in love with me, but I really don’t think that was the case. Anyway, the first red flag I noticed was when he wouldn’t want me around when he had met new people. For example, if he was sitting at a table doing hw I couldn’t come join. He would make comments about how I wasn’t his type when people would ask if we were dating, say his type was skinny girls other times (I’m mid sized), but then grab my ass and boobs in private and try to kiss me when he was drunk. 

One summer I drove 1.5hr to visit him at his internship and he was uncomfortable with me going inside his apt to pee because he wanted the other interns to know he was still available (not sure why just telling them i was a friend wasn’t good enough). Clearly this was unhealthy, and I realize that now but at the time I had very low self esteem and we were able to talk about super personal stuff and I felt safe around a friend for the first time in basically ever. We understood each other so it was easy to look past the warning signs. 

Fast forward to Junior year, I had decided to join a sorority because I wanted to meet new people and this took up a lot of my time. I also started dating my current bf, so I was busy a lot but between school and friends etc I was doing the very best I could to maintain our friendship. This seems he was living with another friend of mine. Whenever I wanted to see my friend and go over to their apt I had to go through him first because otherwise I would be invading his space. Obviously this was controlling of him but I choose to look past it because I thought our friendship was worth fighting for. Any time I would try to talk about my relationship he would get mad and be super rude. He never liked my bf and even tried to turn another friend of ours (she was studying abroad when I first introduced him to my friends) against my bf, and it worked briefly but she has since apologized for believing him. 

Towards the end of that year he started hooking up with a girl, and I didn’t take it that seriously because he would constantly talk about how he was just using her and make fun of how she acted during sex to our entire friend group. That summer I was very stressed and juggling a lot, and we had a falling out because I told him he couldn’t expect me to be available every night to talk to him for hours. That summer he made that girl his gf, and we didn’t talk for a few months. We made up right as senior year started and everything seemed fine for a little but it was obviously he didn’t want to see my bf and he would make a point to not make plans with me (a few exceptions but he was definitely pulling away). He made double date plans with another one of our friends but never me, and was overall difficult to make plans with. We both made a point to see each other during the day between classes, so I thought we were fine. 

COVID happened and he moved across the country during the lock down so there weren’t any goodbyes. After moving, I still thought our friendship was fine, but because of everything going on many of our conversations were about politics. Usually we agree on our political opinions but not anymore. I thought we were engaging in interesting informative discussions but I guess he didn’t feel the same. I realized a few weeks ago that he had unfollowed and then blocked me successively on twitter. I was never rude, or disrespectful of his opinions, but I do use twitter as my own personal sounding board (I have maybe 6 followers so not really a big deal to retweet whatever I want). I’m not surprised that he didn’t want to see my activity but I am surprised that he couldn’t just tell me that he didn’t want politics to come between us. He also wasn’t responding to my texts during this time. 

After I realized unfollowing turned into blocked, I decided that I had had enough over the last 4 years, and I quietly unfollowed him across all social media platforms. For my own mental health I didn’t want to see another story or post and wonder why he wasn’t talking to me. Should I have tried to talk to him? Did I do the right thing? Unfollowing him wasn’t out of anger it was more of a calming thing I felt I had to do. Sorry for such a long post, but it’s a long story. Please advise, I miss him and our friendship, but I’m tired of being an after thought. 


TL;DR My best friend stopped talking to me so I removed him from my social media, ending our friendship. Should I have talked it out and tried to fix things yet again?"

I am currently trying to find my last year internship. 
I'd like to know if some of you have ideas on how are we supposed to cope with the confidential side projects we've worked on. In my situation, I worked as a freelance for a SaaS startup and I basically developed their software. The confidentiality is defined the following rules :
- I can quote the company name and affirm that I developed what I developed.
- I cannot share the source code. 
- I can share the website adress but as it requires to be logged in, no recruiters will be able to see anything interesting. 
- I cannot share the specs book. 

I was wondering if it wasn't somehow dangerous to put this on resume, since if a recruiter ask for some informations or the code I won't be able to deliver, thus being considered as a liar.. 
What do you think? 
Also, is it a good idea to talk about the price the company paid for it? As it can give the recruiter quantitative idea of the workload, sort of?"

It was my first real job experience and while working here I have become the only person in the company able to develop Power BI reports for departments across the company. Ever since the internship ended in August 2019, I was promised a full time position but whenever I emailed my manager and director about a full-time role or even a slight raise it was ignored and when I brought it up in person, it was brushed off with a we'll talk about it and get back to you. I did see on our company directory that I was given the title of a Manufacturing Analyst though without anyone mentioning it to me, which I found strange.

Our department has been WFH since March and during this time I have been applying to countless jobs with a few bites here and there but nothing solid. I even decided to apply for a quality engineer role within our company as it seemed certain nothing was coming from operations. I was asked to go in and help out the quality team as a trial of sorts but on the first day my director called me and told me he heard the QE job was being given to someone else. He was able to pull some strings and approved another opening and asked the quality department to interview me last week and I thought the interview did not go perfectly, but I didn't really care because I got a interview for a job I would actually like last week as well.

I think this interview went pretty well, and was able to get to the next round with the hiring managers but it's not until September 11. As it would turn out though, the quality department sent me a offer letter out of the blue last night and they want an answer by Friday. I know the other job is not a guaranteed thing but I would hate to take the QE position and then bounce on them in a few weeks. Since it's my first actual job, I'd hate to burn bridges with the quality team and possibly my current bosses in CI. Any advice?

Thanks!"

So the question(s) is:

I've had a ton of folks talking about how to creatively word ""skills"" but to be honest I don't really feel like I have a lot of skills to even fake. I don't want to list classes I've taken or even assume that I could do some things I've learned are things I could do in a live fire situation.

We have this event where companies come to recruit students through tests and interviews. Looking at my friends and classmates resume's I've seen that many of them have learnt multiple trending technologies, frameworks and made projects on them.

In our 4yr degree we've had basic subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, RDBMS, 4 sems of math etc. However they have learnt and made impressive projects in fields like AI, Data Science, Blockchain, MERN stack, Cloud, Django, NoSQL etc. They've done this through MOOCS, youtube i.e. basically self-taught.

My knowledge and projects are decent but nothing special, made using basics like Java, Python, C, PHP, JavaScript, SQL etc. Compared to theirs my resume looks pretty plain.

I've only now started to learn a couple of these in demand topics and I've sketched a plan to learn them but at the same time it feels like I'm learning only for the sake of it and trying to cover them in just a year. I might not choose to major in a field related to them so what's the point ?

Don't get me wrong my friends are very hard-working and take great effort. I really respect them. I'm not a very hard working person and have been trying to overcome it for the past year but I have extremely difficulty in focusing. The projects I make are ones that i really like and are passionate about. I do enjoy programming but I won't like to spend every minute doing it.

My main question is how do I deal with the competition and others who are more accomplished. Will I still be able to get a decent job.

I don't have any internships because I've been worried that my knowledge wouldn't be enough and I haven't got the few I applied for. Sorry for the rant.

TLDR; Would I still be acceptable for a decent job despite only knowing CS degree basics VS Others who know In-demand and trending technologies and frameworks. Should I start learning now or is it too late ?"

research internship at state flagship where i did a project using machine learning tools to forecast and analyze elections. no related awards, but I presented it

some minor political volunteering

not sure if I'm forgetting something there

**Recommendations**

AP Lang teacher 8/10 - wasn't extremely close but she liked me and my writing, knew a good amount about me, and was a good writer herself. I was also kinda weak on the first essay but had one of her class's highest grades 2nd sem

AP Calc teacher 6/10 - she liked me somewhat, I put in effort in the class, and she usually gives decent recs but I had a B for most of the year

Counselor 7/10 - I had a few good conversations with her and she knew a decent amount about my interests but not probably a GlOwInG rec

**Essays** 

My common app was very reflective in nature and it started out with a funny anecdote and transitioned into a discussion about my background and how it made be passionate about urban planning, public policy and data science. The people who I showed it too said my voice came off very authentically and it was one of the best they saw, but I didn't get take any expert or professional advice on it or spend too much time revising. Probably 8/10, not the amazing 'HoW I gOt iNtO sTaNfOrD' but pretty good

Supplements were a mixed bag. I can't spend enough time going into every single one of them but they were all fairly unique... but I feel like not in a good way for all of them. I wrote a few 'hail mary' supplements of sorts for the very most selective schools I applied to but they were all kinda cringe looking back. Otherwise I kind of kept the same style throughout but I mainly talked about my interests and maintained a reflective tone rather than relating my relevant experiences / activities enough which could have been a weakness for some prompts (mainly JHU's).

Swarthmore

Princeton

Stanford

Johns Hopkins

Northwestern

*Waitlists*

Colby -&gt; declined WL offer

GWU ($24k/yr merit but STILL my priciest option lmao)

**Other notes**

I'll be attending NYUAD in the fall, full ride combined with a diverse and close-knit community, great facilities and unique experience was too good to pass up. My parents can't/won't contribute much so Emory or Williams would have left me somewhere $30k-50k in debt"

il4m2k,34,2020-09-02,Horrible internship experience and boss expected me to stay after which I told her I might not be able to.,ohmygodwhatsthiss,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/il4m2k/horrible_internship_experience_and_boss_expected/,"Hey guys! (Long story short at bottom)


I got an internship mid-summer at a loan center which ended on August 27th (classes start again). It was HORRIBLE. I had NO real training except for my boss telling me what to do one time and expected me to do it for the rest of 300 clients and every time I asked her a question she would roll her eyes and tell me that I don’t retain anything (yet she didn’t tell me because I write everything in my notebook.

I also could NEVER get ahold of her because she’s so busy. I had to rely on my notes although there’s many scenarios for each client which I wasn’t told.


I have been working on about 5 projects which I haven’t been able to finish because she would need another hand with another project and she would make me work on those instead (also minimum training for that).

One time she made me do something and the next morning I continued to finish it but my boss asked me if I remembered what to do and I said yes while bringing up my excel spread sheet. She then started smacking her hand on the table screaming  “are you listening to meeee hellooooo?!!!”. And she said I didn’t sound confident when I said that

Another time I was working with her letter paper sized copy machine and she wanted me to make a copy of her letter sized document. She got mad at me that I was having a hard time figuring it out and she told me to be careful with the machine because it’s sensitive like me.

Also I’ve had to drive to restaurants to get her food for pickup. 

She then asked me if I can stay after the internship 2 weeks before it ended and I said I’m not sure due to my class schedule already being in the middle of the day Monday - Thursday and since they are now online I need to see if the times can be changed.

So I vented to one of my coworkers who told me that two girls that worked with her left her because she was a horrible boss and this place is very disorganized.  One other worker last day was that Friday too and he said he couldn’t stand her.

So then August 26th came and I found out all my classes are going to be synchronous and at normal times.

I emailed my boss because she wasn’t there the last day (I only come in when she works) and I told her that my classes will be at bad times and I won’t be able to stay afterwards. I also said I would be contacting her after I graduate and told her thank you. 

Now the problem:

She DIDNT take that as an answer and started saying “you have unfinished projects that you need to complete”. Yet, the reason I wasn’t able to finish my projects is because she is short staffed and made me jump onto other projects. Also, she knew that my last day was the 27th for my internship which I made clear when I got interviewed AND on the application. She told me “see you tomorrow” at the end. 

I didn’t respond because I was shocked by her response. She knew my last day and she knew I wasn’t sure if I can stay afterwards. 

She then emailed me in the afternoon the next day “CALL ME NOW!!!!!”

I didn’t respond. 

Now she is emailing me again 4 days later telling me she’s trying to get into contact with me. 

I don’t care anymore. I’m not putting her on my resume because I didn’t feel I learned anything and she is bat crazy. 

What should I email her? Should I call her and prepare to be yelled at?


Long story short:


Terrible internship with terrible boss. I learned absolutely nothing and wasn’t really trained. She was extremely nasty to me and made me get her food in other towns. She asked me to stay but I told her I have classes midday and I’m not sure if the times will be flexible and if they are, I will stay (classes got switched to online). 

I was never able to complete projects because of people leaving her due to her management and I had to complete other people’s projects and had mine on the back burner.

Last day came up and she isn’t taking me leaving on my last day as an answer and is yelling at me to come back to work and finish my projects when she knew my last day. What do I now email her?"

il87ly,1,2020-09-02,Mid-Life Crisis?,trifold_wallets,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/il87ly/midlife_crisis/,"Not expecting answers or support just hopefully not alone in this.  I have a good marriage 3 great kids a good paying job and work with some truly wonderful people.  The problems I think begin there however.  

Backstory:  I drank myself out of college the first time i went and tried to end it all during this time as well.  through some soul searching and literally burying myself in work I changed my outlooks on life.  I started training in a new profession met my wife and was genuinely happy.  Then i broke my back on the job, during this time I lost friends who thought i was faking it went to a doctor who thought i was faking it (wasn't the only person he accused of that I think he got fired) and went through several procedures to attempt to fix it.  During this time  i had my first kid, yet even though i had this new person to provide for i physically couldn't i was heart broken that i couldn't provide for my wife and daughter.  But there was hope I had an opportunity to be involved in a new procedure and it worked for a while.  I was sent back to school was, graduated with honors awarded a scholarship to a private college ( didn't take it) and was hired before i graduated.  Then it happened the procedure that made me better also made me more likely to require future procedures my discs ruptured and cracked on my spinal cord but no one could find it.  ""This doesn't happen"" according to the doctors so i suffered for a couple years until a spinal surgeon looked at the images and found the issue.  18 hours of surgery and 6 months of recovery later i was at my new normal.  I was basically a 65 year old trapped in a 27 year old body.  I survived worked hard got an internship that led to a contract that led to full time employment, i was promoted and raises came my way again with hard work however this time i sacrificed family time I would be gone from 6 AM to 7 PM M to F and we had just had our third child.  so it was stressful that i was missing sporting events, school events and general life moments for my kids.  Then on the coldest day of the year i hit a deer.   Changed everything I was able to limp my car home 40 miles in -30 F.  I wanted something closer, something that would allow me more freedom.  I found it but i had to take a pay cut.  Benefits though more than made up for it.  Problem was part of my duties were in something i had never done before so i put myself to work and eventually became the go to guy the call at 4 in the morning oh no get down here guy again hard work paid off or so i thought.  I was splitting time between departments and one of the leads was jealous that i was asked to spend more and more time over in the other department.  Unaware of this fact i was removed from split duty and forced into a my current role full time.  During this time the wear on my joints took its toll and I needed another surgery.  This time though i would suffer for 2 years again missing events and games for my kids, snowed from the painkillers couldn't work full days physically almost broke and mentally beaten down by the situation i was finally taken off of work completely and surgery was approved.  Went on antidepressants to try and help.  

&amp;#x200B;

During this time i think is when my outlook on life began to change.  I was being berated by my lead for not being able to work full time especially since i spent all that time on the other team and now that i am all his i am broken.  Those are literal words by the way.  During my recovery 4 people from work checked in on me regularly none of them were my lead.

Anyway back to work I was recovered 100% again had a new normal, i was  off the pain meds but had new limitations. I walk slower and I am in some sort of pain every day but I was happy, and  I was able to be a productive member of a team again. 

That took about a week to kill.  My lead did not trust my ability to physically perform.  Would not and still does not respond to calls i make.  I am not one of his yes men so i and another team member are left out of crucial infrastructure planning until i have to go in and fix it. Then i am talked to about time it took me to fix his mistakes.  My ideas and questions are treated like they are completely moronic.  I was trying to show him he was incorrect about something during a training session and he went off and proved me right in front of everyone, but somehow i was still not helpful and unprofessional.  One of his yes men has taken on his traits and is now doing the same things the problem there is he knows that the things he is getting credit for are things that i did or explained to him he has in the past pointed this out but since i have been back it is no longer happening.  

So I have recently turned 40 and just moved my daughter to college.  My oldest boy is bullied beyond being functional my youngest is turning into a teen.  I just worked 60 hour weeks for a month because things that a teammate and i recommended be changed 6 years ago but were not because they were to hard to put into place and or would make my lead and the CEO change. Basically taking my last opportunity for a family vacation away.

I think i am resentful of my lead for stealing me from the other department then putting me on a shelf so that no one else can have me and not giving me anything to do.  I am scared that all my kids will remember about me during this time is being in pain and on meds.  Being to busy to just do stuff with them or worse yet no memories of me at all.  

I can't find another job that pays this well in the area and my wife doesn't want to move.  We own our home outright and don't want to make payments again, we don't have enough money to do what we want, we save because of my previous issues so we don't spend much.

Anyway not sure if my meds aren't working or if my job is causing me that much stress, or if my missing my kids grow up has caused so much ""heartache"" that i can't break free of this mood.  I could write a book on this and still not get everything.  I think just having some idea that i am not alone in what i am going through would help but i don't even know if that is true."

ilbd7m,1,2020-09-02,I got fired on the day my mum went to hospital.,soapy_diamond,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ilbd7m/i_got_fired_on_the_day_my_mum_went_to_hospital/,"Preface: I know, I could have done better and should have tried harder. It's clearly my fault, but I'm still angry at myself, my mum and my boss and need to vent.

So, I just finished an unpaid internship that put me in debt. As soon as it was over I applied to jobs and got hired as scheduling assistant of a farmer. Basically I work from home, using a business phone for calls and my own computer for emails. I'm in college, which my employer knows. That means I sometimes go to the library and my workshop at school. However I'm generally available 24/7 and call back within an hour if I happen to miss a call. I assumed it'd be enough if I checked emails 3 times a day, but quickly found out my boss checked them obsessively and would call me angrily if I hadn't replied within 3 hours.

Basically I've been working overtime from day 1 and have yet to see one cent. I wake up to the phone ringing every day. I write emails late at night. I work on weekends, even though those aren't even official service hours. My boss uses outdated software and makes me put down the appointments as memo notes instead of calendar events. That takes a long time. But he only counts my phone hours. He wants me to send him the exact times, durations, contact details and topics of every call. Not for informations sake, but to calculate my wage. I actually have an hourly wage and suspect he's trying to compromise by adding up the phone data into hours instead of just paying me for the full official service hours.

Besides that I have somewhat of a private life. I'm filing a lawsuit against my father and my mum just got a suspected cancer diagnosis. So I travelled to my hometown this week to sort the legal things out and take my mum to hospital for surgery. I didn't tell my boss, because it's something very personal and I didn't think he needed to know. I took the phone with me and continued working even though I ended up being homeless for 3 days. I thought I'd manage and it felt like it was working out.

On my first day on the road he called me and threatened to fire me. His reasons were plausible. I was behind in transferring the appointments from my notebook into the memos. He said I wasn't worth my wages if he'd end up doing my work anyways. He also got mad because a customer had called me 7 times within an hour and I'd only got back to him after the 7th time. I explained that I was still adjusting to the memo programme and had gone to the library on that one occasion, but called back right after. I also asked for suggestions on how to use the programme and how to regain his trust, but there was nothing I could do beyond transferring all the appointments until the next morning. 

Since then I've drastically accelerated my working pace. I don't use my notepad anymore and put all appointments directly into the memo notes. This means that customers on the phone often need to wait, since the software is slow and requires stable internet access to function. Nevertheless, it seemed to work out, my boss' angry calls became less frequent.

Fast forward to today: My mum had uterus surgery in the morning. I drove her to the hospital at 7, then headed home to get some rest, since I'd been lying awake worrying most of the night. I answered some emails, but ignored the calls. I desperately needed sleep and thought I could get back to the customers at 9.30 AM. Of course I'm not in the position to make these kinds of decisions. It was stupid. The first call I got at 9.30 was my boss, asking where the hell I was. I told him I was in and had already made some appointments that morning. He said one customer who by chance had his private number had informed him that I wasn't picking up the phone. I said, I had been available and had taken some calls, but this guy had not called. A blatant lie, but I didn't know how to save myself. He found it weird but seemingly accepted it.

In the afternoon I got a call from my bosses wife. At least I assumed it was her since her name was saved in the phone. I greeted her with my name, not the usual ""Hello, \[buisiness name\] here"" since I thought she wanted to talk to me personally. However she pretended to be a customer, asking me who I was as well as many specific questions that are listed in the FAQ of the company's website. I answered them anyways and gave her an appointment. I was a little concerned and immedeately called my boss to ask why someone had called over his wife's number. He said it must be a mistake.

Then he got back to me in the afternoon, told me his wife had tested me and found, they didn't need me anymore. Asking for reasons, he said, I shouldn't make phone calls in the subway and my replies to the questions hadn't gone beyond yes/no. I admit the conversation was awkward as I was extremely confused and perplex. But I had answered all her questions in detail and had actually been out walking my mum's dog in the forest, so there couldn't have been harsh background noises.

Nevermind, I'm fired now. Big deal? My father's going to prison, my mother possibly has cancer, what is a lost minijob compared to that? My mum is actually doing well. She says she feels amazing after the anesthesia and that I wouldn't even have had to come over. Also ""At least we get some family time now. That is more important that your tiny slave jobs anyways.""

I just want to lie in a corner and cry."

I'm a second year BA student based in Mumbai. I plan on majoring in psychology and then going abroad for masters because that's been my dream since day one. 

So most universities in the UK/USA require you to do an internship related to psychology, some colleges even have it in their eligibility criteria.

I recently (by recently I mean today) quit a content writing internship that I was doing to earn a buck or two because the employer kept getting pissed off with me because I kept asking her questions related to pay and distribution of work (trust me it was a wholeass shit show, she even refused to give me a certificate while she gave one to the other employee) 

Anyway, in most psychology related internships I see that you need to at least be an undergraduate. But I'm in my undergraduate and I want an internship.

Basically, does anyone know any internships related to psych that take in kids that are still in their undergrad. It doesn't have to be paid. Honestly, I had such a bad experience with my previous non psych related internship, that I've decided that I'll only take psychology related internships from now on. 

Sorry if this all over the place I'm kinda out of it rn.


TL;DR: Any psych related internships that hire people still in the second year of their BA? 

Thanks guys!!!"
ilbwhd,3,2020-09-02,I’ve (20F) been thinking about running away but don’t know where to start.,Waadaddy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ilbwhd/ive_20f_been_thinking_about_running_away_but_dont/,"TL;DR: I want to run away because of my toxic household, finding jobs is hard since I have no experience and there’s a limited amount to none intern related jobs since the pandemic and if I do run away I cannot stay in my country which is Bahrain. 

The title basically explains what I want to do so far, I’ve had the thought of running away since I was 13 and now I’m 20. I live in a toxic household, there has been many instances where sexual and physical abuse was involved in my life whether it was by my own father or step brother. I can’t handle it anymore, my mental health is plummeting, I haven’t been eating much to avoid leaving my room, I excessively work out to release all the stress and anxiety that I’ve pent up. I live in the Middle East, so moving out isn’t really an option, that’s only an option if I’m married. I’m not even allowed to sleep over at anyone’s house. 

I need advice on what to do, I want to save up money and have been looking for jobs but so far nearly every job requires experience and I sadly lack that, I’ve been looking for places that need interns but the pandemic is kind of ruining that opportunity, I don’t know what to do anymore and I have no hope on leaving this household, it’s seriously breaking me and I just don’t know what to do anymore. If I do run away, I can’t stay in the same country, it’s very easy finding run away victims since my country is extremely small. (Bahrain, for those curious.) I’ve been advised by my friends to travel all the way to the USA but I feel like that is too scary for me to do, I’ve been told I would receive help there since most of my friends do live there but I’d like to hear more from the people on here. Am I doing the right thing? Or am I just delusional? Should I just stay and endure this and see what happens later on or just I don’t know. Thank you for reading this far, it means a lot."

ilcype,1263,2020-09-02,I got my first job offer!,chewyfranks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ilcype/i_got_my_first_job_offer/,"So I interviewed with a company last September during my last year of college for an internship with a pretty well known company. I got the internship offer in October and I started in June. The internship was for the summer in software development on one of their teams, with the possibility of full time at the end of it.

The pandemic happened and I was so afraid of my internship getting cancelled, but nonetheless they decided to continue remotely and luckily I have been able to work from home since then. These past months have been tough, I wanted to quit because self doubt and just stress of learning on the fly, feeling hopeless, and most importantly imposter syndrome. However, yesterday I was offered a full time position with the company with pay more than I would have ever imagined. 

I’m extremely happy and grateful for this opportunity especially in times like this. I’m also extremely grateful to have the same company I interned with offer me a full time position as a full stack developer. I’m excited to start my career with this company. 

Just thought I’d share my excitement. :)

Edit: Thank you all for the awards. :)

Edit: I appreciate everyone’s positivity. Thank you all so much!"

I've done hundreds of hours of learning, mainly sticking to frontend JS stuff (my CSS is intermediate). I did a short internship using React JS for a startup (and got good feedback but maybe they just wanted me to keep working for free); I've applied to hundreds of jobs.  It was a dead end (outside of doing the internship); I only received one interview for a paid job from [Angel.co](https://Angel.co).  

After that I decided to go through a large part of my network to see if anyone had any connections.  Immediately I got a lead for a job for a startup company.  The person was interested in my work.  I intentionally low balled myself to get a paying job to start out.  I didn't care; I just wanted to break in; that was my priority.  Unfortunately, after a week, I realized the lead dev was a huge dick with communication issues (I have a background in real estate sales, etc., so I can take punishment) but my gut told me to get out as the guy really weirded me out with his attitude problem, and so I left.  

Back to square 1.  I've tried to remain positive but I've netted so little for my efforts.  I also was interested in hiring some sort of career coach or consultant; I can't even find an appropriate job recruiter.  Any advice would be helpful.  I'm ready to go on my own at this point almost and start a f'n start up company but I can't make sense of this and don't want to spread myself too thin..."

I’m was admitted to as the Class of 2024, with the option to take a gap year as the Class of 2025. Although I decided to continue as ‘24, many of my fellow admits decided on a gap year. Given that a good amount of the “seats” for the c/o 2025 are filled with gap years, do you anticipate acceptance rates for this admissions cycle to decrease?|Absolutely. This is the conundrum that will have enrollment managers scratching their heads.
 |There will be a clear dip in enrollment due to the sheer number of students taking a gap year for this fall. As a result of that, for the class of 2024, many colleges accepted much deeper into the WL than they were used to. This will compensate for part of the number of students who decided to defer admission until next fall.
 |For the coming cycle, enrollment managers will have to be very clear as to how they will deal with a potential influx of students. In my talks with my colleagues on the college side, this will likely result in extra emphasis on the WL for the class of 2025 just to make sure they are extra intentional with making sure they do not over-enroll.
 |The above is a discussion for the 100 or so highly selective schools, which will continue to have high demand.
 |On the other end of the spectrum, many less competitive schools will struggle to fill seats. As such, their acceptance rates will likely increase.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
For those accepted off the waitlist do you also need to allow them to take a gap year if desired? Doesn't this create a huge issue where there will be very few spots for 2025? I know my school's policy was to allow anyone to take a gap year or return to school after a gap of any number of years if desired for undergrad. Had a student who really did take this to the fullest extent and came back to school in his 70's.|Good question. Some colleges will only accept students off their WL if they guarantee that they will enroll for the fall. It is a numbers game after all.
 |I can't imagine many colleges letting students off the WL only to have them defer. I'm sure they would exist, I just don't know any off the top of my head.
 |I've only heard 1-2 year deferment. I haven't heard of more than that!
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Why will the less competitive schools struggle to fill seats? Won’t their students also be taking a gap year?|Absolutely. This will be a difficult problem for them to solve.
 |Check out this interesting chart from Professor Scott Galloway from NYU:
 |https://api.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US_Higher_Ed4.png
I signed up to take the ACT in April and it's been cancelled every month since then. Do I really need to take the test?|That depends on the school. You can read on a school website if they are test optional at all.
 |Some schools are very specific with their policy -- they make sure to state that they will not penalize students in any way if they are physically unable to take the test.
 |If this is you, you will have the chance to explain on your application that you were unable to take the ACT even though you tried.
 |Other schools will still recommend that you take the ACT/SAT if at all possible. They will use the scores for class placements, merit scholarships, or other considerations.
 |Other schools would still like to see a high test score if at all possible, especially at a slightly more selective school because they may be inundated with inflated GPAs this year.
 |So it depends on the types of schools you're looking at. If you have aspirations of more competitive colleges, then I would recommend you keep trying to take the ACT if it is safe to do so.
 |What kind of schools are you looking at?
I am architect from India and I was wondering is it a good choice for me to apply for masters abroad in US or any other country in general? Because I hear it's incredibly hard to get a job and visa to pay off the student loans in architecture especially. Also has the covid situation made the prospect of getting a job even worse?|COVID has made it very difficult for international students. As most colleges will be remote in the fall, many international students who have already enrolled will be studying online from home.
 |If you choose to wait for a year, you will have no trouble getting in to an M. Arch program. However, most Masters programs are very expensive and often do not offer financial aid for international students.
 |Furthermore, you are correct: your ability to get a job afterwards is not guaranteed. Since you are not a citizen, you will need to find a job that will be willing to sponsor your work visa. If you are not in a position to afford a masters and it will put you into a difficult financial place, I would not recommend you come to study in the US.
^(the below is a reply to the original question)|
If your dream is to move to the US I would try focus on the L1 visa, I think that is one of the easiest visas to get approved for. You have to work for a company with a significant American presence, and once you are at the manager level they can transfer you to the US for a few years, and then hopefully progress you to a Green Card. That was my path and it took about five years from deciding I wanted to move, getting hired at the right company, and then getting transferred.|That was valuable insight!
How do small liberal arts colleges like CMC differ in their admissions process compared to a bigger school like Northwestern? Given that they're roughly around the same ""tier,"" are the admissions requirements pretty similar or do you feel like they're looking for different types of students altogether?|Honestly, the process isn't very different. We used different rubrics and scoring system. But at the end of the day, all the viable candidates were discussed in committee.
 |The type of students we looked for did differ. This is something a lot of students don't think about. Each university has its own ""ethos"" that they're trying to create, so they want to attract students that fit into that. At each school, we would often reject perfectly qualified candidates because they really didn't fit what we were looking for.
 |CMC focused on leadership and drive.
 |NU focused on creativity and innovation.

ribix_cube: How can I find out what school looks for what type of kids? tinypanda0: I would look at the type of questions they ask on supplementals, their mission statement, and other info on their about page. Also, looking at the kinds of students they accept on their website, magazines, or other literature they publish.|The mission statement is huge.
 |Also direct interaction with admissions officers will help.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
How do I get into direct contact with admissions officers in a natural way? I would love to learn about officers at potential schools but I don’t know how to start the conversation in a way that doesn’t make me seem ... I don’t know sneaky? Basically I don’t want to come across as trying to get my way but instead show my natural curiosity.|Lots of AOs do fall travel and may even come to High School.
 |If not, they will go local presentations and that would be a perfect opportunity to check in with them.
 |Also, during the age of COVID there are a lot of virtual presentations!
Hello! I am applying to grad school this upcoming winter to study higher ed and student affairs. Hoping to become a college counselor or get into admissions.

This is not an answer that I would feel comfortable trying to type up because it can be super personal depending on your goals.

Do you know what computer science activities (such as summer activities and internships, extracurriculars, etc...) will impress College Admissions? Because I want to apply to be a computer science major in some colleges.|Internships are generally neutral at this point because so many internships are found through parents or through connections.
 |If you are able to find your own internship through your own means, by all means go for it. And then, make the most out of it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a student talk about an internship and then not have anything meaningful to say about it.
 |My advice to you is to take as many coding languages as possible and see if you can design an app/website/program to help kids in your school area with a tiny problem they may have.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
This is really bad advice. Get good at 2 or 3 complementary languages, learn version control, and start working on projects on Github. Learning languages for the sake of ""knowing them"" is incredibly stupid because unless you use it often you'll forget the syntax, but if you understand CS deeply you can code most languages with Google.|Noted.
^(the below is a reply to the original answer)|
karsickk: Internships are neutral? Not even slightly positive? SweetieBby: I'm guessing its because there's not a lot of companies hiring underage high schoolers as interns unless they already have some personal connection to them. Not a lot of merit-based internships being offered to 15 years olds|This.
 |In my time, I rarely saw internships that weren't because of nepotism.
^(the below is a reply to karsickk)|
If I understood what he said, he is probably talking about internships that weren't obtained through your hard work but through luck or parents, etc.. karsickk: Yeah, that makes sense. How would AOs know if it was nepotism or merit, though? enzoyasuo: Probably through what he learned and how he earned this spot in this internship? I'm not certain. There still exists a possibility that they wouldn't be able to differ between those two.|If there wasn't a possibility to distinguish between the two, that's why I would treat it as neutral.
 |I wouldn't read into it and would look at the other components of the application.
I have a son who will be starting high school this month. The school has numerous AP classes available. Do you have a recommendation as to how many AP classes a student should take?|It will really depend on what your goals are.
 |If your goal is to get as much college credit as possible so as to shorten graduation time, then the answer is as many as possible.
 |If your goal is to qualify for ""selective admissions"", then the answer is as many as you can reasonably take without becoming overloaded.
 |If your goal is to explore subjects that may be of interest, then the answer is as many you can find within your areas of strength/interest.
 |This is a long conversation I have with many of my families and it usually boils down to one of those three. I usually do an aptitude assessment early on to see which path they should take.
Do you think Standardized Testing (e.g. ACT, SAT, GRE) ought to be phased out? Is it actually a useful metric? How have you used it in your admissions analysis?|This is a contentious discussion that many of my colleagues are having right now.
 |I personally do believe that standardized tests do serve *some* validity. However, the way these tests are designed do benefit those from higher income brackets. As such, they do inform, but shouldn't be seen as an objective standard of measure.
 |In my experience, we did use low scores to weed out students if there was no indication of why they received a low score. There was an unspoken expectation that we wanted high scores, but we never would nitpick over a difference of 10 or 20 points.
 |In fact we would often reject perfect score students because it was clear from their applications that they didn't do much besides study for the exam.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
swimstar186: Sorry, you're saying you rejected applicants with perfect ACT/SAT/GRE scores because they usually sacrificed extracurriculars, etc. to study for these standardized tests? Is that a common practice across the field? sticklebat: Probably not GRE (expectations for grad school are very different, usually), but for the ACT/SAT it depends on the school. Some schools want different things, and some emphasize things like creativity, innovation. Spending all your time studying for a test doesn’t demonstrate those at all. Most schools are looking for more than just good grades and high test scores. That’s why they have essays and recommendations, to get a more thorough picture of the student.|GRE carries very little weight these days.
 |But yes, in admissions we would always say what a student did over 4 hours on a Saturday shouldn't take precedence over their weeks of commitment elsewhere.
Our son took his first AP class last year as a freshman, and scored a 2 on the exam. How badly will that hurt him for college admission? Also, if he continues to take AP classes, but doesn’t do well on the exam... will that do more harm than good? Meaning, he might be better suited to Honors classes.|I'm assuming it's AP Human Geography.
 |If he is able to continue in AP World/Euro/US History and show growth, then the 2 won't matter. Ninth grade is a transitional year anyways, so its okay if students slip up a bit.
 |If he doesn't do well on AP exams then that will be truly revealing about his study style and should impact the types of colleges he should apply for -- it would imply to me that he is not a ""traditional"" learner and wants to find a school that will cater to his strengths.
^(the below is a reply to the original question)|
Edit: I have been corrected. APs matter a little bit, but not nearly as much as other factors. AP scores do not matter at all to the college during the application review. Some things they do care about are grades, course rigor, class rank, ACT/SAT scores, background, etc. If he didn’t take the AP test, the college would not care either. If he can get high grades in the AP classes that is what matters to the admissions counselor. If your son will end up with the same grade in the honors as the AP, then he should take the AP if he is aiming for a top school. If he is not, then maybe take a few APs throughout high school, not all of them, as honors still look good on an application. Also, don’t overwhelm him. Let him make his own decisions about classes, colleges, and study habits. No one needs that kind of pressure from a parent. (This is just a friendly reminder, as my parents do this to me, and I don’t want others to experience this.)|The blanket statements that AP scores do not matter at all wasn't true during my tenure. While they weren't of utmost importance, we did consider them.
 |This may especially be true this year as standardized test scores will be lacking.
 |Also, when one of my students got into Stanford, he got a friendly reminder from admissions that they expected him to take any and all AP exams because that was what he had committed to when he enrolled in an AP class.
 |Again, these are the minority of experiences, but they should be considered.
Not related to college admissions, but what factor would you single out as the primary driver in increasing tuition costs (lack of state funding for public university systems, building fancy new buildings with frivolous amenities like new dorms, too many administrators with overlapping roles like provosts, deans, etc)?|Administration is probably the biggest cause for tuition increase.
 |Students need services like mental health counseling and career counseling.
 |Unfortunately, it's not cheap to hire these people and create these programs.
 |For large state schools, it is indeed the lack of government funding. They have had to increase out-of-state and international enrollment to make up for this budget deficit.
How much of an influence does an SAT or ACT score have on undergraduate acceptance and admittance? I was always taught growing up that doing well on these tests was crucial to get into a university, but after going to college and hearing other people’s backgrounds, I’m less convinced they play a major role in deciding where you can or cannot go to study.|THIS.
 |It does not carry as much weight as people do think. It is part of the application process but it is just 1 factor out of as many as 25 factors that admissions people consider.
 |""Important""? Yes.
 |""Crucial""? Not exactly.
Why did you decide on this career path? I don’t remember anyone enjoying applying to college when I was a senior in high school, so how is that you enjoy the process from the other side?|I went into this career because I didn't have a good support system when I was applying to college.
 |Some of my apps never went through. There were schools that I wasn't aware of. There were social issues that I faced in college that I would never have anticipated.
 |I had such a rocky road applying to college that I realize that I didn't want other students to have to deal with that. I wanted to make sure that I could provide them with high quality mentoring so they would have somebody to walk them through and avoid some of the pitfalls I faced.
Are schools anticipating a change in grad school admissions that mirror the situation for undergrads that you discussed earlier?|Grad Schools are on the decline. Their prices have gone up exponentially, and the number of young adults who see value in spending $50k plus for a return on investment that is only a fraction of that is going down.
 |As long as you are willing to pay for grad school, you will be able to find a grad school that will have you.
 |The programs that I mention are regular Masters' and MBA programs that many people use to advance their careers.
 |Other types of grad school, like Ph.D's and Medical school will continue to hold up high standards.
What is something that differentiated your admitted students from all the other qualified applicants?|DEEP involvement in one or two causes. Not just meeting with club members a couple times a week, but devoting hundreds of hours to something they are passionate about.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Can you explain why this is such an important criteria now? Looking at it from the other side if I'm trying to hire a mechanical engineer fresh out of college I care about grades, skillset and what student projects were done. I don't care at all if the person spent 50 hours a week in high school at some activity.|For a higher level engineering school, this is the only way they can make distinctions among the myriad of applicants they have -- all of whom have stellar grades.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I would be fascinated to find out how this effects Asian-American students at your institution. Based on what we learned from the Harvard case coupled with the flat-lining of Asian-Americans as a share of elite college admissions despite their growing numbers, these sorts of ""fuzzy"" qualifications are used to suppress their enrollment. Whether that is done subconsciously through internalized bias against Asians on the part of interviewers and admissions committees or is knowingly undertaken in order to place a de facto quota has been my big question all along.|I do not believe that the internalized bias against AAPI students is any more prevalent than the internalized bias many people have toward students of other races.
 |To be clear, bias will always exist in holistic admissions, but then again, bias has always clearly existed even in the more “objective” measures of grades. I can attest that there has never been a quota in my experience.
 |I would also suggest that you direct some of your questions to colleges who prioritize admission to athletes, legacies, and children of donors. They mess up the game more than you would believe.
How important is creativity in the Common App essay? Is authenticity and a compelling topic more important than creativity (ie should you pick a topic that you can creatively write about or a topic that is more personal)?|That is a personal question that we will be discussing in the workshop.
 |I think it comes down to how you write. Some students aren't at the level that they can write about something ""creatively,"" so it's easier to write a personal heartfelt essay.
 |However, if you think you can take creatively, you will always earn brownie points from me. I love a good pun.
Hello! How does being multi-interested (undecided lol) affect applications? If my ECs are kind of scattered, would it make more sense to apply as undecided or choose 1 for intended major (public policy or medicine/nursing)? (bc of this, I really like NU bc it seems like they give a lot of flexibility with how many majors/minors you can take on!)|Remember that Medicine is not a major!
 |Nursing is a major and it's almost like its own school. You have to be fully committed to nursing if you choose to go that route.
 |If you are truly undecided then you need to apply to schools that honor that. I would suggest looking at Liberal Arts Colleges.
 |You sound like a perfect candidate for the workshop because you need just a little bit of guidance and maybe some help branding your application.
 |It's okay to be undecided, but you want to make sure that you have a clear message in your application!
Hi! I am currently trying to transfer from my small local college into the University of Michigan. How do you think COVID-19 will affect transfer admissions?|Where is your small local college? Why are you looking to transfer? These are questions that I would ask in a normal year, anyways, and these are questions you will need to answer for the transfer application.
 |If you are a Michigan resident, then you should be fine as UMich is designed to serve its state’s residents.
 |If you are OOS, it may be more difficult depending on your major and what you’ve studied thus far.
 |Of course, this is also dependent on whether you’ve been doing well at your current college or not.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I am at a in-state university with a 3.6 with around 50 credits I think I have a good shot, but I am honestly not sure.|At least here in California, priority goes to community college first, then California State schools second, the other University of California schools and private schools third.
 |I’m not sure if that’s how Michigan works, but it sounds like you’ve worked hard. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to review your application.
Have the number of expected applications increased or decreased?|While the number of college age students is on a decline, the number of applications is going up because students today apply to more colleges on average.
My school is allowing us to choose between online and in person learning. I'm not sure what will happen to clubs, but if I choose online learning certain classes may not be available. Will going online hurt my application?|Which classes are not going to be available?
 |Going online will not necessarily hurt your application because your safety is most important. But the question becomes (for highly selective schools) ""what will you be doing with your off-time?""
 |Just because the classes won't be available at your school doesn't mean you can't take them. There are local community colleges, which are often free for high school students. There are also websites and online courses that you can take through other institutions if there is a class that you really think you need.
I know electives won't be available and AP depends on if the school can hire a new person in time. Speaking of taking classes through a website(like edx) is it worth if to get the certificate from the class?|The certificate isn’t necessary, but colleges want to see that you’re continuing to be curious and inspired even during this downtime.
 |If electives won’t be available, how will you choose to engage with your club members or community? If your school won’t have an AP teacher, how can you tap into your resources to make sure you get to learn what you want?
 |Don’t let your school situation limit you if you can help it.
Would circumstances caused by the pandemic (Such as having to take exams at home as well as mental exhaustion) be acknowledged by colleges as sources for a downward trend in grades/difficulty in being able to conduct any projects in the summer, or would poor grades/lack of summer projects be seen as a none COVID related matter?|Possibly. But for selective schools, this may not be the type of student they want to admit.
 |They want students who were able to excel and be innovative despite the pandemic.
 |Understandably the first month or two were really difficult for many students. The expectation would be that after the initial shock that there is time to revert back to ""normal"" -- whatever that may be.
 |From my personal experience, most of my students are back to ""normal"" now.
I have an incoming 9th grader and an incoming 6th grader. What should I/we be doing now in order for them to have a higher chance in getting in to the college/university that they want to go to?|When I work with students that young, I work with them on exploring all their potential ""passions"". Much like a Waldorf school, I expose them to different things each month and have them work on little projects within that field.
 |From there, I can start to see what they are really interested in and encourage to pursue those passions more when they get into high school.

Not OP, but a tutor. Please have them read! Anything is fine to start, but start introducing non-fiction, news articles, short stories, and maybe some classics if your kids don’t naturally seek these out. I can’t believe the number of students I work with whose GPAs are 4.0 or better but whose reading comprehension is abysmal. This really hurts them on standardized tests, but it also impacts the depth of their understanding across all subjects.|Completely agree!
 |The students that I see today are generally much weaker at reading and critical thinking.
 |This is reflected in their ability to write and come up with a coherent argument.
Hi! I’ve taken the SAT and gotten a score in the 98 percentile, but it’s a bit lower than the ranges of schools I’m interesting in (i.e. Yale, Columbia, Princeton). Should I apply test-optional?|That’s a question I can’t really answer without understanding the whole context of your application, but if I had to answer directly, I would say submit your score.
Can you shed some light on what discussions around diversity (specifically racial and socioeconomic diversity) were like in the Claremont McKenna admissions office? What do you optimize for? Given that there are only 300ish students per class, I imagine these conversations are quite difficult. I graduated from CMC in 2015 and would love to know more. Also, if you happen to know any of the folks there now, please tell Megan Latta that Becca (the rugby one) says hi.|Ah! Megan started when I was reading. Haha. She's super cool.
 |I don't comfortable sharing that on a public forum, but I can only imagine that you have some opinions having gone through CMC.
 |One of my closest friends also graduated CMC 2014 -- Marcel Hite. He works for Stanford now.
Nice to see the UD pennant in your pic. Do you have experience working with Delaware?|Yes. I work closely with Chuck L. who is the West Coast director for UD. He does a lot of great work for the school and I think UD has a lot of great programs that they are working on for students including their Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center.
 |It is one of my go-to recommendations for students who plan to go into public policy.
Do you think it will be harder to get into top 50 schools for the next year applicants, especially transfer students?|I do not believe transfer admissions will change much. It has always been incredibly difficult, unpredictable, and dependent on enrollment.
 |I do believe first-year admissions will be much more unpredictable because many conventional statistics will no longer be available or reliable.
How do you see Letter of Recommendations being impacted for the class of 26 given that many will not see their junior year teachers for most of the year?|This will really set off certain students, because the most committed and engaged students will not have let the pandemic affect their interaction with teachers.
 |Some of my students are still actively engaging with their teachers over the summer as they plan events and activities.
 |These students will end up being ones who stand out.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
[deleted]|I appreciate your comment and how you worded it.
 |You are right. I did speak from a position of privilege that has been influenced by the schooling system that I am involved in.
 |There is no expectation for a student from an underresourced school to be able to get the same type of letter of recommendation from their teachers. That would be unfair, and most of colleagues are aware of that.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
I wonder if the comfort kids have with adults has to do with their HH income and/or educational level of their parents. Last week my rising jr mentioned, off hand, that she emailed her AP Lang teacher a picture of her and her friend making heart signs with their hands, and her teacher emailed back with a picture of herself making the same heart sign. It's just a little shocking to me that she doesn't think twice to engage her teachers outside of classwork. I grew up poor and would never have even thought to do something like this. Just asking teachers questions about homework was difficult enough.|Yes. Children from a more privileged background are often told to advocate for themselves and are often informed that the difference between themselves and adults isn't so big.
 |They are often told more often that their opinions are important, and they are taught to advocate for themselves.
 |In other less privileged neighborhoods, the message can often be told in reverse -- just be quiet and figure it out on your own. :(
Is Covid going to make it easier to get accepted or harder?|Depends on the type of school/program you're looking for!
 |What type of schools/programs are you looking at?
[deleted]|Not really! It sounds like you're on the right track.
 |I guess the question is, why was your GPA so low? Is it due to issues that my prevent you from doing well at Law School?
 |There's going to be a lot of work and memorization for you to do and you need to express to the L-school committee that you have addressed those issues and have what it takes to succeed.
Hi! Thank you for doing this. I hope you’re well and safe. Can you offer any advice for the personal essay - what are some things you love to see in one / some turn-offs for admissions officers? What should seniors be doing right now to increase their chances of getting into college? How do admissions officers judge ECs (in particular, no academic ECs) and is there actual merit to the concept of a “spike” in a student’s application?|Will be spending a lot of time doing that in the admissions intensive, but, in short, start early and draft a lot.
 |Don't be afraid to get personal.
 |And a good ""spike"" can speak measures for a student.
 |There is a lot of what not to do that we will definitely be going over on Day 1 and Day 3 of the workshop.
I have friends working at Stanford and other private universities. All of these particular schools are down more than 50% enrollment next semester. Will we finally see an end to these overpriced universities?|I do not believe so. Faculty and administrator salaries cost a lot.
 |It's not cheap to pay a Nobel Laureate professor -- so I see inflated tuition for the foreseeable future.
What is your first ice cream flavor?|My first one was probably mint chip.
Hello! I’m an older dude, 36, who is deciding to go back to school and get my masters in education. I got my BA back in 2006, and have been in the professional world since then. But I just can’t do it any more. I teach night classes at the local art college, and feel teaching is my true calling. I’m in California, so I know things like preparatory tests are required, but beyond that, how much of a disadvantage am I at having 14 years between BA graduation and reapplication?|You're at no disadvantage!
 |The Cal State system is full of nontraditional learners, or people who are much older than you who've decided to return after a hiatus.
 |You don't even need to apply to the most selective M. Ed. program. You could honestly find one online and do it. You'd just need to find a place to do your student teaching hours.
How will COVID-19 impact college admissions?|This is an in-depth discussion we will be having at the workshop.
 |In short, selective admissions will become much more unpredictable while many financially unstable colleges will be forced to shutter their doors.
[deleted]|Just a note: admissions officers don't encourage the use of ""elite"" when describing schools.
 |Each school is different and has its own strengths and weaknesses. Many people don't realize how different Cornell is from other private schools -- particularly because it is a hybrid designed school.
 |I'm assuming you're wanting to transfer because you can't find the opportunities you want at Cornell. As such, you should definitely consider transferring.
How do schools view part-time jobs? My son has fewer school related activities because he works but we both feel he is getting more out of working.|As long as he is doing his job well, a part-time job is a great learning experience.
Do colleges really look at extenuating circumstances? I didn't get the best grades in first semester of junior year, because I was working at the government for ~20 hours a week. Because most work is done during the day, this required me to miss almost all of my science classes because of scheduling. I also couldn't quit, because my family needed the extra income. My grades in other subjects (including my intended major) remained the same, and all of these courses were AP. Will colleges take this into consideration?|Of course! That's why that spot is there.
 |Supporting your family is a huge commitment that colleges do not take lightly. Please share this story in your applications.
I'm an international student with stanford and MIT as my top colleges.(biased towards stanford) I want to join as a physics major. I only have a few extracurriculars(2-3 major ones in total in both science and humanities) but I have devoted a lot of time to them. I have taken the SAT only once and thankfully got a decent score. Is that fine or do I have to do anything extra now? Also, since only MIT is need blind for international students, should I apply ED there instead of stanford?|MIT doesn't have ED.
 |Even with international students, they want to see that you've excelled at your craft. So you should still be pursuing research at the collegiate level if at all possible.
You’re probably applying to a top heavy list of engineering schools if you think a couple of Bs will mess up your opportunity to go to college.|
How do colleges view students that complete their last two years of high school in early college programs? These students take college-level courses at a community college with a cohort, still take SAT/ACT but do not take APs. My question is about how are such students viewed for admission? I don't care if they transfer (or not) the college credits. My concern is strictly from an admission perspective.|No different from AP/IB.
I have a theory that it really isn’t the school mainly that is hard to get into but the program. Most schools fill up with big majors such as business or nursing which take majority of applicants. But let’s say a super competitive school can take someone who wants a niche major they need filling, they will more likely accept a lower standard. Is this somewhat correct?|Wait. Business and Nursing are usually the most impacted, so they cannot accept many people.
 |UCLA Nursing, for example, has an admission rate of 2%.
 |But yes, students who can show true passion and dedicate to a niche field may have a better chance that a student who chooses to pursue one of the more impacted majors.
What would be some steps a international student should take to enroll into a US college?|Ah! This is a complicated question that I cannot answer without knowing more of your specifics.
 |Definitely take the TOEFL and or SAT/ACT.
 |This will also depend on if you're attending an International School, American School, or just National school.
Do you think people who apply ED will be given a greater advantage due to financial commitment? Or should we wait until RD to improve our application? What’s the best use of our time right now up until applications?|That is a very important discussion to be had.
 |Yes, students do have a significant edge if they apply ED.
 |You should be using this time to work on your application and to continue to cultivate your activities and intellectual curiosity.
 |The admissions intensive will be a great way for you to get started:

How many students do you think Northwestern or other top tier schools turn down that would have succeeded if admitted? I don't get why elite schools won't increase their class size.|Just a note: Most admissions officers do not like using the word ""elite"" to describe colleges. They use ""selective"" instead.
 |There's just physically no space increase class size. The dorm rooms are support services are finite, so they physically cannot take on more students.
 |In years past, certain schools have had to book out hotels because they housed enrolled too many students.
 |Talk to any counselor and they will tell you that they could probably admit a class 3 or 4 times over with students who would equally be successful.
 |With students, instead of talking about why these schools won't admit more people, I point out the dozens of other schools that have equally amazing programs that they would do incredibly well in.
I love Northwestern! I'm actually thinking of applying ED to Medill (yay journalism). What are some tips you have for preparing a strong application if your stats aren't the best? I like to think that my extracurriculars make me stand out, but my grades are pretty average|ED is the way to go if your grades aren't strong -- just make sure that your family is okay with the estimated cost of attendance.
 |What kind of stats do you have?
 |I'm assuming that you have a lot of ECs in journalism. Your goal is going to be then to highlight them and make sure your teachers and counselor highlight them.
 |You would be an excellent fit for the workshop because then you will have time to workshop your essays and make sure they are specifically pointed and then there will be time for me to review your application personally by the end of the week."

iljo0t,1,2020-09-02,A Network Graduate with Nowhere to Go,Echomanc3r,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/iljo0t/a_network_graduate_with_nowhere_to_go/,"Hello everyone. I apologize if this post gets a bit long-winded, but I'm outta ideas and see this as the best avenue of help for myself.

I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Network Technologies and, in all honesty, don't have crap for experience and feel like I spent the last five years learning nothing of use. Not to say I didn't try, I wound up on the Dean's List every semestar sans one, walked out with Cum Laude and was voted the Network Department Scholar. And yet I feel horribly unprepared for my job and it's showing in some pretty worrying ways. Seriously, I don't even know what I don't know, I wound up that far off-track because of useless college courses.

Where I went to college didn't have any internships for networking and the college wasn't hiring in the network division pretty much the whole time I was there. I ended up settling for a Library Technician because I couldn't get a full-time job (part of the hell of FASFA paying my way through college), not like there was any jobs for networking where I was anyways. I at least got some dabbling into working with an AD along with some basic network troubleshooting but as a student worker, I really didn't do much. I tried asking the networking professors and most of them gave a shrug and pointed me to the job boards, which was useless. Once I graduated, I realized that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.

At that time, I moved back home to try and find a job in the neighboring city(?) to see if I could net some experience only to find that there was not a darn thing in the area. I don't mind revealing that I live in Midwest IL, next to Quincy. I tried sending resumes to the biggest network provider in my area and not even my friend, who's brother worked there, could do anything for me. The very best thing I could get was a $14 IT Technician job (read: Desk Jockey). I can't complain too much as I don't really do much there, but I still can't help but wonder why I'm not in a proper networking job getting paid a bit more to make up for the five years I spent in college. I'm barely able to make enough to live on as is, whereas most of my IT friends I made in college were rolling in around $24-$40 an hour. I know I shouldn't be comparing myself to others, but it's really disheartening to see.

Thing is, most of them either moved or commute an hour to get to work and none of them are in networking, they're in software development (I had a minor in Computer Science Traditional so I tried seeing if I could work with them til I found a network job, no dice). I really don't have the luxury of moving (have $10,000 in the hole on my house for repairs) and I would commute but the only jobs available in the other neighboring towns are either nonexistant or require 5+ years of experience and want a senior network technician, which if I can't even get a basic Jr. Net Admin job, there wasn't a chance in hell I was getting in there. I've thought about just sending my bare-bones resume anyways just to see if any would bite, but I'm really unconfident in my abilities stacking up to what's expected. 

So that's where I sit. I just really wanna know where I screwed up at. Was it me focusing too hard on grades that wouldn't really matter? Was it really because I didn't get the certs I needed? Was it because I didn't get involved with the right groups, or didn't invest time into a pet project to fluff up the resume with? Or do I just literally live in the worst possible place for my career path?

I don't expect anyone here to have a miracle cure, but any advice or guidance would be appreciated. If anyone has questions, just shoot them my way, I'm an open book. I want to know where to go to get myself going again. The lack of experience and ways out isn't doing any favors for my mental health. Thanks to all that help, or, hell, even read all of this blathering."

iln4ga,11,2020-09-03,I finally got a job offer with great benefits at a small company but now I am having second thoughts after accepting it for some reason. Am I being unreasonable? (I hope so),throwaway_first_job_,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iln4ga/i_finally_got_a_job_offer_with_great_benefits_at/,"After graduating this year with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, I finally got a job offer!

**Starting salary:** $75K plus benefits

**Interviews done:** only 1 and that was onsite with the upper management

**company size:** \~10

During the interview, the CEO told me how much they liked my resume and how I smiled in my linkedin profile (um) and was looking forward to my interview the most out of all the applicants and the interview confirmed that I knew what I was talking about (they only asked me couple of questions). He offered me the job halfway through and I was stunned, gave me the salary that I wanted, and continued talking about the benefits while I tried to process what just happened. After months and months of applying to jobs and going through rounds and rounds of interviews only to get rejected and ghosted, I was just speechless. Before leaving, I was told the offer letter will be in my inbox before I even reach home (which was true).

**A little about me:**

\- minority and a woman (hooray for diversity hiring)

\- I also come with 18 months of relevant experience and the position aligns really well with my background in product design, development, and production

**About the company:**

\-products for DoD customers and looking to expand commercially

\-all the engineers are white men

\-there's only one other MechE who will be my senior and also worked at the company where i did my internships (also another reason why the hiring manager wanted me)

\-very fast paced and a lot of responsibilities will be placed on our shoulders

\-more than a decade years old but most of the team joined &lt;2 years ago

\- 45 hour workweek

\-made the employees come back in May because remote work during corona was slowing everything down and would have caused lay offs

After the excitement and relief died down, I was alone with my thoughts once again. I talked to my mentor from past internship and they said the fast process is normal for small companies. After thinking and thinking I basically gave myself a panic attack (and started crying). 

It could be because: I'm PMSing ( i really hope this is it); I feel like Im being scammed lmao (unlikely because they're an established defense contractor); I would probably do shit job; not culturally fit; being the only woman; etc

The job sounds like I will be learning a lot and I will be wearing a lot of hats since it's a small company and I really love that. I am blessed to find a relevant job for my career. But let's say I don't end up liking it because of company values, management style, no support system, etc. It could also be because I went from chilling at home since March with no stress aside from having to find a job to starting a new, fast paced job next week. If I end up not liking it, should I stay for at least 2 years anyways? Am I being worried for no reason? I just want to be happy about the news but I can't. I told my parents all this and they assured me it's normal what Im feeling when starting a new job - I hope so.

What's your experience like working in a small company? Especially as a woman (if it applies)? Do you have any tips on how I could make the best of it and be the best employee there is as an entry level? Feel free to downvote if im being dumb. Please share your experiences if it's similar and your journey please and thanks!!"
ilnj67,0,2020-09-03,Which types of positions tend to offer WFH and/or downtime most often?,ShaolinShade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ilnj67/which_types_of_positions_tend_to_offer_wfh_andor/,"\[Skip to TLDR at the bottom if you don't care about the context of the question\]

Background context: I've been doing basic IT helpdesk type positions for the past 7 years - basic hardware and software installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting, mostly Windows with a little Android and iOS experience. I completed 3/4 years towards a B.S. in I.T (got some coding experience while I was there too)., left for an internship which turned into full-time work, and I haven't returned to school yet due to wanting to pay off my debts and get some savings first, and also not being sure where I want to take my computer career next.

Recently I've been considering moving over into the development side of things as my next step, instead of going directly into something my current IT experience might be more relevant for (like junior sys admin etc.). Reasoning for this is that I have a high priority on getting a WFH setup, 1) because I have a needy pet who I want to be able to continue spending my working time with, and 2) because I'm trying to find work remotely in another state (with virtually no prior connections, Seattle though so lots of tech opportunity). So positions more suitable for remote work would be ideal for me, and it seems like these kinds of roles are usually development type roles. Other reasons: I enjoy creative problem solving, the mundanity of IT support can be dull. I like being left free to tackle a problem efficiently and effectively, then enjoying the results of my work, rather than being on a constant, micromanaged schedule of repetitive hardware and software troubleshooting.

I've also got an idea for an app that doesn't really seem to exist yet, somethig related to a passion of a mine, and I really want to enable myself to create it alongside pursuing self-taught development (I've actually already got some image and audio development skills in Photoshop, Ableton Live etc so I can use that for this too). From the research and input I've gotten, Javascript would be a good starting language for the purposes of my app (due to frameworks like cordova and react native, and the language's broader usefulness). Also seems to be a highly sought-after language on resumes, I'm hoping that without official coding experience I could get a development job with that listed as a skill and an app I developed with it under my accomplishments. But I may want to go back to school and finish up my degree as a CS student before attempting that. Any input on that is appreciated.

\[**TLDR**\] Back to the original question though - in your experience, what positions have you seen that offer WFH the most (pre-covid? I know we're likely to have higher chances of it across the board post-covid, but I still want to aim for the careers that cater to it best)? I've learned this is very important to me due to my pet and personal QOL and goals, so I'd like to get myself the skills and experience needed to move in that direction as quickly as possible.

And on the second part of that question, which positions tend to offer the most downtime? I've also learned, working at a call center that has offered zero downtime of late, that downtime is very important to me since it offers time to mentally relax between work, improving the quality, and since I have multiple skills and pursuits I can use more time for during the day.

WFH comes as a higher priority for me, and tbh I'm talking kind of vaguely and long-term here - I barely have an idea what I'm going to do first (open to alternative suggestions if Javascript doesn't sound like a good entry point, or if I should get a CS degree before attempting to enter dev) - nevermind the endgame for my career path. But it would be good to know what kind of options I can work towards and skills I can develop to get the kind of a position I'm imagining.

Thanks in advance for any advice or input."

I'm on my third year of college getting my computer science degree.

On my last year of high school, I started my very first business. The business involved writing python scripts that would run on servers hosted on AWS/GC 24/7, to stream a bunch of information directly to our subscribed customers. I did a good amount of revenue with this company, while at the same time really hurting my GPA. Eventually due to ownership issues I decided to leave and start another company within the same niche, but keeping 100% ownership. I basically did the same thing, I used React/Express/Mongo to setup the website and user dashboard, and created more scripts, this time written in Node. This business did good, but not as good as the previous one. Eventually as my classes got harder, running the business and doing class at the same time became harder for me. I took a break, and got my GPA back up to 3.6. This winter I got hired by another ""not real"" (owned by young person, 2-5 person team) company within the niche, as a lead front-end developer. When I first joined the team, I was coding the front end of the desktop application to look like the mockups they had, but I realized that it wasn't really all too nice to began with so I completely redesigned the UI from bottom up. Now its extremly beautiful and something I'm really proud of. The problem is, I have not made a cent from this job over the 6 months I have been doing the work for it, because until we sell copies, theres no payment, and theres still a lot of work left on backend before we can sell copies.

As I wait for backend work to finish, I've been doing research on looking for and applying for jobs, but I really have no idea where to began with someone with a background like mine. Most of my work is private, and I am unable to share the code, and I never needed to work an internship or job because I was running my own businesses. I've applied for 2 or 3 jobs that I really liked, but I havent heard back from anyone in 2 weeks, so I'm guessing those are rejections.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm currently working on three open source projects to add to my portfolio, but I'd like to know if theres any way to land a Junior/Mid-level job without having my degree completed and without any previous internships/experience working *for* someone. I'm willing to pay for some resume/portfolio critique so if you can do that my DMs are open =)"

I’m a few months into my graduate job and I’m not too sure whether I’m settling in as expected, or whether I’m falling behind quickly. I’ve had two internships as an undergraduate; one being a summer one, and the other being a longer 6 month internship, so I’d like to think I had an idea of what to expect in terms of work when starting the graduate job. 

The work itself has been manageable to an extent. It’s a mixture of Python and JS, both of which I’m comfortable with so there’s not many problems on the language side of things. The main issues arise with understanding the code base and understanding how to approach the problems. While this was also a struggle in previous internships, I had managed to overcome this by sitting with my coworkers, and feeling comfortable turning to them and asking “Hey, could you quickly explain this?”. In my new job and team it’s quite often that I can go the whole day without speaking to anybody if I don’t ask for help. While I do make sure to ask for help when I need it, it almost feels like I’m bothering people because I don’t really know them, and being WFH, I haven’t gotten a chance to get to know them. 

Has anybody else found this aspect of remote working a struggle? How should I approach it with my manager? I don’t expect any companies to really have a solid plan in place for on-boarding remote graduates, but I don’t want to end up not passing probation because I couldn’t adjust to working from home and letting my productivity slack."

Currently I am finishing up my associates at community college, so I’m not exactly ready or able to start applying for business school just yet. This post is being made to receive criticism on my current situation and future plan, and whether or not there is any way to improve upon it, and thus improve upon my chances of gaining entry into my desired program. Within the write up I will be clear on what I have done, and also what I plan to do. Thank you for your responses

**MBA Info**

· Why I want an MBA: Since I was 11 years old I’ve always had an interest in investing, throughout my youth I enjoyed the analysis of corporations and finding diamond in the rough investment opportunities. I’ve jumped around in my pursuit to fuel my investments, and throughout my experiences I have come to realize that I have a lack of education in regard to the depth of the subjects that surround and make for a solid basis to systematically analyze a company’s current, future value, and growth prospects. I want an MBA for two reasons, one to gain the education to fulfill my desired goals, and two so I am able to gain the employment experience (real world experience) to then be able to branch off, heading my own firm. 

· Why I want one now: I’m looking to gain my stripes in investment banking at a bulge bracket before I become of an age where my body can’t take the entailed 80-100 hour work weeks, and an MBA would help me gain such employment opportunities. Additionally my family has a genetic disease known as Fals (Familial Lou Gehrig’s disease), my father and aunt both passed away from it recently and I have a 70% chance of contracting it myself, it would also seem each generation gets it sooner than the last, so with that potential risk I’d like to get into a fair financial situation to prepare my family for their future as soon as possible. 

· Target schools: M7, but more specifically CBS, and Wharton.

**Background**

· Work experience: Soon to start internship doing equity research and assisting in portfolio management at firm that manages 2.4 billion in equity. The firm is a subsidiary of a medium sized bank in the Midwest. After my BA I will look to pursue a permanent position there for the 4 years of work experience needed to complete the CFA designation. 

· Extra curriculars and other experience: Was the founder of a small social media marketing company, which taught courses on how to apply social media promotion for personal and business practices, had a total of 1500+ paid students.  Help setup and manage triathlons &amp; races for charity. Caretaker for father with ALS.  I plan to finish the CFA level one prior to getting my BA, and to finish the complete designation prior to applying for an MBA program. Two things I’m considering; I’ve recently came across the opportunity to teach basic finance and budgeting to k-12 students, and joining the big brother big sister program. 

· Undergrad school/major: Community college (associates) &amp; State school (BA) minors in finance &amp; portfolio management. 

*At the rate I am going, the total time to finish both degrees will be just under 2.5 years.* 

· Other education/coursework: Nothing official, but I study security analysis, and investment strategy on my own time. 

· Race/nationality: Caucasian/American

· Sex: Male

· Age: 22

**Stats**

· GMAT Score: I have only taken practice tests, but based on those and additional studying I should be able to score around a 720.

· Undergrad GPA: I am just about finished with my Associates and currently have a 3.8 GPA , moving forward I have no gen ed’s left so I feel my motivation to complete my course work at the highest level will only improve and therefore I expect no less than a 3.8 GPA while pursuing my bachelor’s. 

**TLDR:**

M22/White, 720 Practice GMAT,  current community college student w/ 3.8 gpa, soon to transfer to state school. Targets: m7, specifically CBS, and Wharton"

I’m stressed out right now and my ADHD is out of control, and I am maxed out on my current ADHD med. 

I’m working several jobs to make ends meet. By several, I mean two babysitting jobs, a WFH internship, and a WFH student job. My parents are getting divorced. My mom told my dad two weeks ago, and my dad is already on Match and managed to get catfished. I figured it out and told him. As much as it nauseates me to think of him dating right now, I feel like if I don’t vet these strangers, he’s going to fall for another scammer. It really disturbs me that he would rather go on a dating website than get his shit together with the divorce. They’re going to be putting my childhood home up for sale. My dad has no friends or family to talk to about this (my mom’s is all he has) so he’s been talking to me about it and some days I’m ok with it but other days it hurts me. I don’t particularly like either of my parents - truthfully they both suck - but I feel bad because my dad has no one to help him through this. He’s been open about being suicidal for over a decade now and has had immediate family take their life. He also has firearms in the home. So I’m constantly worried about what he could do to himself, but if I ever forced him to be hospitalized it would only make it worse. 

I’m also finishing my last two courses to get my degree. I’m worried that I won’t be able to secure a job at my internship because of COVID, or the election because they are a government defense contractor. I feel shitty because I will definitely get a job if Trump wins, but I know he sucks. And as much as I don’t want him in office, I want a job with this (well paying) company. I am in the tech field which is usually abundant with opportunities, but I’m still worried. 

On top of that, my boyfriend has been struggling with alcohol dependence because he is depressed. He hates his job, misses his childhood friends from the Midwest, and hates living on the East Coast. We want to move to Fort Worth after I graduate but that’s contingent on at least one of us finding a job out there which is dubious during the pandemic. 

There’s a lot going on right now and I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. My therapist upped his hourly rate, and I can’t afford to see him anymore. It sucks, because he was the best therapist I’ve ever had. 

I’m managing the stress/chaos the best that I can but I don’t want to violate boundaries or the emotional bandwidth of my friends or boyfriend. I’m dealing the best that I can but sometimes the weight of the world is just so heavy. 

I don’t expect anyone to have answers, but if anyone has any advice for scheduling/organizing/daily routines, my ADHD havin ass would appreciate it. If anyone has seen any good movies or TV shows and would like to recommend them, I’d appreciate it. If someone wouldn’t mind reviewing my resume and/or helping me with my LinkedIn, I would appreciate it. Even just a few words of support or validation would mean the world to me right now. 

I know that I don’t have it the worst but I’m still struggling."

I was supposed to do an internship with my computer science teacher (I’ve been a student of his for a few years so he’s also writing my LOR). I’m not sure what to do. The internship feels like a bit of a burden because I don’t have all the skills to excel yet (I would be spending the first few months learning certain languages). I also want to add that my teacher also offered me this internship because I didn’t have any other options at the time. 

If I decide to drop this internship, would it be bad for my relationship with my teacher and LOR? I feel really conflicted right now, and I tend to overthink so I wanted to get some perspective on this."

During my academic career I mostly focused on becoming a full-stack developer so most of my time out was spent studying C#/ASP.net and JavaScript(MEAN stack). 
I had a lot of trouble getting an internship during college mostly because of my lack of experience, and I honestly almost dropped out, but I got extremely lucky and landed an internship because of an unrelated CompTIA Sec+ certification (switched major from Cybersecurity) as a full-stack developer but unfortunately it didn’t turn into a full-time position mainly due to COVID-19.


I’ve been having a lot of trouble with getting an interview and I don’t really understand why I’m not getting any responses to my job applications. I know one of my problems is my lack of experience and many employers don’t seem to care that I completed an internship as a full-stack developer and that I’ve also completed several projects on my own.


Also, I know the whole millennial shtick about us being entitled but I’m not being crazy about my job requirements. I just want a position related to my college degree/academic career, so I’ve been applying to positions with keywords like JavaScript Developer, Full-stack Developer, Web Designer, Web Developer, HTML Email Developer, Angular Developer, etc. I’m also not expecting to get paid $60k+ out the door or even have benefits. I’m totally fine with making minimum wage just for some experience in my career field.


It’s starting to seem like I might have to continue my education and get a BA degree in CS just to get an entry level job as a web developer. I’m not really sure what to do next is it possible to get an entry level job as a web developer with just an associate degree?


TL;DR Does anyone have advice to get an entry level job as a full-stack developer or a related position with just an associate degree in programming?"

Who had an abusive, neglectful father who never loved his own son because he believes his son is ""too fat to love."" I never had any friends growing up so life was very lonely, when I was 4 my parents divorced, and shit got much worse. I was beaten, raped, and treated horribly for 8 years when I was growing up. School was the only thing I had in life. I got bullied in school so much, and never had any friends to back me up, it happend so severely I had to move schools multiple times, and fighting was the only thing I was good at; And or the only thing my father was proud of me for. When I was 15, I moved cross country with my mother and sister to Florida to find a new life. When I moved I got beaten up, and harassed by other students/teachers  because of me having aspergers makes you a ""disability"". I always wanted to end my life, because I had no joy. The only thing I had in life was birthdays and Christmas. When I completed highschool, and was about to graduate, I asked my dad I would want him to see me walk down and grab my Diploma at a stadium ( it was where the school held the graduation ceremonies) and he faked a medical emergency to not go. I felt so sad and like I was nothing.. I started college to study science and realized how horrible I am at math (due to when I was a child my father would get in my face and scream at me everytime I got a math step wrong) to be specific intermediate algebra. I was pressured to be the perfect student and pass all the time. I only had my studies. I never had a girlfriend because I was known as ""the freak."" 1 month ago I lost 2 jobs in a day, and a bunch of internships due to covid, and had a messy break up where my girlfriend cheated on me in public with 5 other guys. I had lost all hope and decided to kill myself by swallowing 800 mg of pills. And then went to sleep. I then woke up in constant pain, i.e. vomiting blood, direhea, nausea, severe stomach pain, and pale skin. I aas projectile vomiting across the bathroom like that girl in the exorcist. After the paramedics came I was berated by them saying that I was very stupid, and yelling at me saying ""how could you do that to your mom"" like I didn't feel like shit enough already. I was sent to a hospital where I had to wear shit stained underwear for 2 days. And wasnt offered a change of clothes. I was then baker acted and sent to a facility that was awful. A bunch of old skinheads tried to groom me, and someone went up to me saying that they were going to kill me. 5 days later, I made a promise to myself, and my mom I would do better, I lost weight, and exercise, slept earlier all the works, I had the previously mentioned college class come up, and had a panic attack due to me not knowing the material and having no interest in classes, I was called a bum by my family, and they kept forcing me to do it where I had anxiety attacks, and lost 3 days worth of sleep, after another 2 days I called a self help number expecting social workers to speak with me, but I was wrong, two cops came with guns drawn and shoved me into a cop car where I was thrown into a facility that had no windows, barbed wire, and a long decrepit hallway. I had no clothes, i.e. underwear and had to wear a gown that revealed everything and had to sleep in a room with no ac no fans, and open windows meaning I was always dirty from the rain, and then brought into a main lobby that had ac. Blasting at 50 degrees. I tried to call whatever number I had to get me out but I had no one. I was told that I would be in that facility for a night but I was there for 3 days. Realized that I can't tell anyone how I feel without being labeled a failire or being sent to an asylum. I had to go to a group therapy session for 4 hours a day 3 days a week, (plus school) but they do nothing, and say stuff we already know. I tried to forgive me father of the stuff he did before hand, but I could just let it go, so I sent a message letting him know how I feel. A week ago he disowned me, and won't even send a happy birthday text to me. I haven't seen him in 5 years. Today I had an awful therapy session where this girl was bragging about how she would divorce multiple men, and sell the rings that they got her. After that i had a meeting where my whole future was being decided for me without allowing me to speak, becuase there were multiple people and my mom I just wanted to leave. That was the straw that broke the camels back, and I decided to not do anything on my birthday with my family, I told them and they kept screaming at me, to go with them, and how I ruin everything. I fucking hate them. I had to threaten with calling 911 just to get them to leave me. Even as I write this I hear my mother and sister laugh out loudly next to my door as they open her presents to make me feel guilt, and took all my gifts to throw out. What a time to be alive. I have no hope in life anymore. And have just lost hope in one of the only things I have in life. (My apologies for the long text, there's alot of things to explain how I feel and, I felt that with the long story you would understand why I feel so pissed)"

My second option is University of Georgia, which would be 24000 for 2 years minimum, but I would have to quit my job, and either work a low paying part time job for 2 years or have no job and no income for 2 years along with taking loans. The rent and living expenses would also add 20000 dollars to the cost. So, Overall it would come out to 44000, but would that higher cost be worth it for the ""college experience"", meeting people, and would it lead to a better job than if I did the online college.

Or would it be overpaying for the same degree, and does the name of the degree not really matter? Would it look bad if I went 2 years without working, and is the college experience and so called internships be worth it for 3X the price and quitting my job? Which one would lead to better job opportunities/be better in the long run?"

im4njq,11,2020-09-03,Internships,neko_mint,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/im4njq/internships/,"Hi, rising junior majoring in econ here. I wanted to ask about internships in the fall. I will be interviewing for a position at a small company soon and will obviously have to accept/reject the actual offer if I do get it. However, I'm also interested in attending UCLA's virtual econ career fair in October with some bigger name companies. For some background, I've had a couple of jobs, this wouldn't be my first internship (did a couple in high school), and I do have some stuff on my resume, but I don't think I have a ton of impressive experience compared to other econ students since I spent a lot of time thinking about if I really wanted to continue in econ. Overall, I'm feeling behind in recruiting etc. since I don't have a ton of major-related experience.

Has anyone been in a similar position? My understanding is that most job/internship recruiting takes place a few months before the work start date. Any experience with fall career fairs and know if they hire a ton of students FOR fall internships? Is it worth the risk to bank on getting hired from the career fair?"

I’m getting ready to apply for a CoOp this semester but I don’t know what to expect Bcz I’ve never taken an internship before. 
I’m really good in Web development and know a bit about Machine learning but the thing is I don’t really enjoy working as a web developer and I’d really love to work on AI/ ML / DL projects.
My concern when applying for a CoOp is, do companies require you to have some knowledge or at least worked on some projects in AI/ ML / DL when they interview you?!"
im6v0j,5,2020-09-03,Need advice - what types of positions are most likely to offer WFH and/or downtime?,ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/im6v0j/need_advice_what_types_of_positions_are_most/,"I've been doing basic IT helpdesk type positions for the past 7 years - basic hardware and software installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting, mostly Windows with a little Android and iOS experience. I completed 3/4 years towards a B.S. in I.T, left for an internship which turned into full-time work, and I haven't returned to school yet due to wanting to pay off my debts and get some savings first, and also not being sure where I want to take my computer career next.

Recently I've been considering moving over into the development side of things as my next step, instead of going directly into something my current IT experience might be more relevant for (like junior sys admin etc). Reasoning for this is that I have a high priority on getting a WFH setup, 1) because I have a needy pet who I want to be able to continue spending my working time with after the pandemic ends, and 2) because I'm trying to find work remotely in another state (with virtually no prior connections, Seattle though so lots of tech opportunity). So positions more suitable for remote work would be ideal for me, and it seems like these kinds of roles are usually development type roles. Other reasons: I enjoy creative problem solving, the mundanity of IT support can be dull. I like being left free to tackle a problem efficiently and effectively, then enjoying the results of my work, rather than being on a constant, micromanaged schedule of repetitive hardware and software troubleshooting. But there are other higher up non-dev positions from what I can tell (stuff like cloud solutions architecture) that offer similar benefits, so maybe I'd be better served transitioning into something that my experience is more immediately useful for. 

I've also got an idea for an app that doesn't really seem to exist yet, somethig related to a passion of a mine, and I really want to enable myself to create it alongside pursuing self-taught development (I've actually already got some image and audio development skills in Photoshop, Ableton Live etc so I can use that for this too). From the research and input I've gotten, Javascript would be a good starting language for the purposes of my app (due to frameworks like cordova and react native, and the language's broader usefulness). Also seems to be a highly sought-after language on resumes, I'm hoping that without official coding experience I could get a development job with that listed as a skill and an app I developed with it under my accomplishments. But beyond the app, I have a feeling / fear that getting into development work would be difficult without a CS degree or dev experience. 

Back to the original question though - in your experience, what positions have you seen that offer WFH the most (pre-covid? I know we're likely to have higher chances of it across the board post-covid, but I still want to aim for the careers that cater to it best)? I've learned this is very important to me due to my pet and personal QOL and goals, so I'd like to get myself the skills and experience needed to move in that direction as quickly as possible.

And on the second part of that question, which positions tend to offer the most downtime? I've also learned, working at a call center that has offered zero downtime of late, that downtime is very important to me since it offers time to mentally relax between work, improving the quality, and since I have multiple skills and pursuits I can use more time for during the day.

I know WFH positions with downtime are difficult to find at my level, so I want to work towards that as soon as possible and I barely have an idea what I'd be best off pursuing to get there (not sure if I'd be better served getting certs and moving up towards something I can leverage my current experience towards, or finishing my degree in CS before attempting to enter dev). But it would be good to know what kind of options I can work towards and skills I can develop to get the kind of a setup I'm imagining.


Thanks in advance for any advice or input."

I am recently in the throes of changing my career. At the moment I’m employed as an early education teacher. I enjoy my work but I am ready to move on.  I enrolled in an Information Systems certificate program at a well known university. I hope to finish in a year. When I finish I would like to get a good internship or junior level position. I’m looking to software engineering but I know there are many sub-specialties  in the tech world. 

I am several classes deep into Algorithms &amp; Data Structures and Discrete Structures . DS is pretty tough so far but manageable. I enjoy the logic but sometimes my eyes go sideways trying to decipher the text book. 

Since I have relatively little experience I would love some advice about building my resume. I have been told to work on projects because this is a great place to learn. I did some project work over the summer which taught me a lot about Python. However that is probably not something I would post since I know it is a bit messy. 

Any advice or project ideas are appreciated. 

Thanks in advance."

I have auto acceptance to a school with a T-10 CS program and I have good academics so I should get into the program. 

However, I am honestly pretty discouraged from the constant horror stories I hear of junior engineers not being able to get a single call back and constantly hear the the market for junior engineers is terrible. I am committed to working hard in college and practicing leetcode because I genuinley love this stuff, but I am honestly worried how hard it will be to break into this field, so I wanted to ask for some advice to current engineers working.

How hard is it to get an interview? Is the market for juniors really that bad? Is it hard to get an internship in college (assuming you know DS+Algo)? 

Thank you in advance :)"

I understand everything I’ve learned so far but my first two years of school didn’t exactly go as I wanted them to. It wasn’t because I’m not smart enough or anything. I just have had several family and personal issues outside of school that made me extremely unmotivated and a lot of times not care about school at all. I skipped a LOT of classes and that’s why I got so many crap grades. I got A’s and B’s in classes that are important to ME (Calc 1-3, DE, Physics, Static’s, and Thermo). My bad grades came from my ChemE classes and a few general classes that I never bothered to show up to much.

Help!!,WaveNav,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/imfqq2/23_with_a_degree_but_no_opportunity_help/,"I turn 23 in a month and it will be almost a year since I graduated with a degree in marketing. I live in a small college town in the south (which is the location of school I graduated from) and I feel stuck and unsure about where to start when it comes to my career. I was able to get a job after graduating in a completely separate field from my degree and worked there for 7 months. I was laid off due to covid and Its been just over a month and I have not been able to find a job. 

There is nothing remotely near me that seems like an obvious starting point that I can build a career off of especially in my field. It feels like I cant even focus on figuring out what I need to do to move forward right now because I am broke and bills are slowly creeping up. I am worried that if I don’t find something soon I am just going to have to bite the bullet and get a job in fast food again to try and makes ends meet. Its not that I wont do what I need to make it its just that I would need to work something like that full time maybe even overtime and don’t know how I would be able to transition back into my field when the time comes. 

I feel like I need to relocate, but don’t have any capital to support something like that. Finding a relevant job right now feels almost impossible do to lack of options and covid restrictions making things more difficult. If I get something to pay the bills in the meantime I feel like I would just be putting off getting the experience I need to get to really start a career in Marketing. I would love to get an internship but I don’t know how to make that work when that would almost certainly mean relocating and I dont know if It would be possible to make enough to support myself while doing that and also working part or even full time. 

Anyone who has been at a crossroads like this, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

imhfib,8,2020-09-04,Is Data science worth the hype and is DevOps worth the burnout?,softwareitcounts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/imhfib/is_data_science_worth_the_hype_and_is_devops/,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a crossroads in my career such that I need to start specializing in a narrower field.  Up until now, I have had various engineering internships at startups in which my tasks have ranged from qa, ops, app dev, devops, data science, machine learning.  This was great as a college student because I got broad experience.  However, if I want to advance my career, I need to call myself the *something-*guy.  I love data science and I love getting results and delivering reports, but I feel like I lack the formal training some of my colleagues I have worked with have.  I enjoy devops and I have more experience there, but it feels like an absolute grind sometimes.  How do I reconcile this - in terms of career advancement opportunities, should I try to break into data science more officially, or attempt to specialize in devops?  Or does data science suck as much as devops and asking the question is moot?

What is the community's opinion on this question?  I have also heard about MLops which sounds like an awesome intersection of the two fields, but there's not that much information out there about it yet.

Let's discuss!"
imhnmc,4,2020-09-04,Does anyone else feel ripped off?,awesomega14,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/imhnmc/does_anyone_else_feel_ripped_off/,"I was told as a high school student that CS degrees were highly in demand and that completing a CS degree would be the gateway to a high-paying job. Now I’m a senior and have basically no employment prospects whatsoever. I could have spent the last 4 years building experience and trying to move up in my career, but instead I got a useless degree and now I’m starting all over from the bottom. The software industry is extremely saturated and hyper-competitive, and given that I do not go to an especially prestigious or well-known university nor do I have extensive internship experience, my degree is essentially trash and I have no prospects of landing a programming job whatsoever. I wish my naive high school self would have done slightly more research instead of blindly accepting the “learn to code, coding is in such high demand” bullshit."

I started looking at jobs in Linkedin

1  How I should know if job posting includes relocation package &amp; visa? Is jobs that written in Dutch can also include relocation package?

2- Is there any specific format needed for CV? or Europass format is enough

3- How I should include in my CV that I am outside of EU and need relocation offer (Other than writing my current location in CV position section)

4- How is tech scene currently in Amsterdam? Is there positions for med-level devs (After corona situation)

imjhgm,2,2020-09-04,Life's been kicking me down,SuperDeepFriedBacon,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/imjhgm/lifes_been_kicking_me_down/,"First of all, I apologize for any grammatical mistakes that could be present in this post as English is not my  1st language.  


I don't really know where to start, but I guess it all started when my parents had a ""divorce""...  
I wrote it like that because even tho they went their separate ways, they are married on paper and still live in the same house, however, my dad usually goes away for a few weekends and my mom doesn't tend to sleep at home, but that's not why I decided to write this.  


So, when my parents got divorced, I was beginning high school (being 15 at the time I didn't know very well what it meant for a marriage to end). In the beginning, not much was wrong, I went to school, came home, videogames, sleep, school, that kind of cycle... But I think that was there and then, it all started... I started to feel lonely and sad, and to surface from the sadness I started smoking, cigarettes at first and then marijuana, for a year straight, I woke up, got on the bus, got high, and went to school, smoking, being lonely, suffering bullying from my classmates, getting heartbroken and used by anyone I cared about until the last year of high school came, I finished my education, with shit grades, I had an internship that was horrible giving me 11/20 because I did nothing all day, even tho they didn't give me anything to do all day.  


So, I finish High School June 2018, didn't do the entry exams for college, so my last option was to find a job, but people don't like to employ 17 years old teens, so all I had to do was wait. But no, you see... it happens that my parents have a bakery, so I was forced to work there, at least I would make a few euros I thought, but it seems that my parents wanted me to be perfect, and I was essentially trading mental health for money, which isn't so good.  


Eventually, I got myself a girlfriend, and she got me off the drugs, life got a new meaning, I knew I had to things for her because that was about everything I had, we've been together for 2 years now, with some ups and downs of course, but I think it's going ok even tho she said she wanted to break up a few times now, and honestly, I think it would be best for both, but neither I nor she has the guts to end it.  


Back to my life, I worked for my parents until I turned 18, made some money, but got kicked every day because I either wasn't fast enough or because I did something wrong... but anyway... I got a job, call center, 13-21, good payout, everything was working out until COVID came and I got fired due to budget cuts, finding another job doing the same thing but for a 3rd party company, worked there for 3 months, making about 500€, but being paid about 140€, and I decided to buy pc parts and try to sell it assembled, spending 340€ on a computer, with the help of a friend of mine, he sold it for 650€ but is trying to keep the money, so right now I have about 800€ owed to me, having my bank account with 0.25€.  


So being jobless and in need of money, I turned to my father again, thinking ""this will be different""  
Well.... it wasn't, 1st days it was okay, but then I was prohibited to drink either soft drinks or alcohol after working, demanding me to pay for anything I consume inside my fathers company, which I think it's completely stupid. After a fight with my dad due to be drinking soft drinks, he fired me, leaving me with 160€ on hand and a bus to go find a job.  


So at the moment I'm sending curriculums and actually got an interview that went great, but I'm still waiting for a response, I'm left at home playing computer until it's late into the night, and of course, my parents don't like that, insulting me, calling me useless, that I won't be anyone in life and that without them I'm nothing, and now they are demanding I go work because they are short-staffed,   


Oh, I was about to forget, my parents also like to call my girlfriend and tell her I'm not worth shit and that she doesn't deserve me, even telling her I'm no good for either husband or for being a father, leaving her with second thoughts about the relationship, having talks with me, and leaving me in sadness  


I've found myself several times thinking about ending it all, even tho I don't have in me to do it, I don't wish to be alive, but I don't want to die as well...  


so, its 17:40 PM, and my mom is demanding I go fill in for a shift at 18 pm, saying if I don't do it that she will call the water and the electricity companies to cut the supply off, and I don't doubt it,  


when my father is present he likes to turn the router off at 22 pm and currently he cut off my mobile data,  


I don't really know what to type more, but I'm not good to vent anyways...  


I've been through several shrinks and I just don't find the ability to talk openly, even with my girlfriend I tend to keep me to myself having a hard time to crack my shell.  


All I wanna do all day until I get a job is be left alone, playing with my online pals, who are able to get a smile on my face.  


thank you for reading this!"

Since graduation, I have been looking for a job, and after hundreds of applications, I have finally landed a 3-month internship at an AR tech startup. My first day is on Tuesday, but during the interview, I noticed a few red flags.    
The red flags included:

\-This is a small team that is like a family.

\-We have hectic, crazy, and chaotic schedules

\-There are some weeks you may have to work more than 40 hours.

\-The CEO was over 30 minutes late to the interview, and during it, he pulled out a joint and got   
completely stoned.

This internship offers a small monthly stipend that increases each month and the fact that I need experience led me to ignore these red flags. I mean, worst case scenario it will be over in 3 months. I want to be a great employee, and do the work that is asked of me, but I want to make sure that I maintain a healthy work-life balance. 

How can I communicate with them that I don't want to work nights/weekends while still being a positive part of the team?"

imlocp,450,2020-09-04,A reminder as pressure rises: you're not wasting your time.,a2cthrowaway321123,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/imlocp/a_reminder_as_pressure_rises_youre_not_wasting/,"With applications rolling around, the stress level on this sub has spiked. People post stuff like this:

&gt;I need to get into at least one of my reaches (a massive scholarship at my in-states or an elite school) for my high school career to be a success... I didn't work hard to not get something most people would consider a reach. That's the whole point. Otherwise, why not just get a bunch of B's my junior year or a 31 on the ACT? **If I don't get something prestigious and actionable out of app season, then my high school career will have been a failure, hands-down.** (Emphasis my own).

That got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out the OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.

But it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less academically successful or less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**

# Scholarships

Thinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35 when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take ""Intro to Physics"" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.

If you don't believe me (understandable, I'm a high school junior; what do I know?) listen to [this guy at UCF who posted something along the same lines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ac881h/on_ending_up_in_the_same_place_as_someone_who_put/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) *Shoutout to* [u/Vottle\_of\_Bodka](https://www.reddit.com/u/Vottle_of_Bodka/) *for pointing out this post.*"

I go to a very well known school in Los Angeles as a Computer Engineering student. Even though my major is CS/EE hybrid I've noticed that recruiters consider ""engineer"" and ""science"" interchangeable as long as your relevant experience caters to what they look for. 

I have no internship experience(had one at IBM in NY for this summer but was canceled due to current events), but I have a number of projects and a decent amount of research experience(nothing published, however) throughout my last two years. 

Without a doubt my resume has gotten me through the door to a lot of interviews, always make sure that your resume highlights not what you know but how you used it for research, projects, internship experience, etc. 

My school hasn't started due to us being on the quarter system but I started applying since August and I've applied to about 200 plus jobs till now. I have a couple interviews pending with a number of big tech companies, but I recently got a job offer from a big auto company in Detroit. I didn't know I would even realistically consider the offer, but its very good and the benefits are top-notch, especially as a starting SWE. If I had restricted myself to Bay Area and Seattle, as a lot of my friends do, I wouldn't have something that allows me to relax a bit. It's definitely not a FAANG-SWE salary, but for the cost of living adjusted, it's impressive. So always apply to absolutely everything, FAANG is not the end-all-be-all, and I know a lot of SWE that have burnout from the higher stress companies. 

I think the thing that set me apart from the rest of the competition was my interview. Anything I had on my resume or on their job description posting I researched it and made sure I knew a decent amount about it. Another thing that I loved was Glassdoor, as they give you some interview questions that have been asked in the past. I was asked different questions, but the format and the spirit of them were very similar. 

Based on what I see here, not a lot of emphasis is focused on the human side of the interview. Once you've gotten to the interview, you have to capitalize on the opportunity. Of course, the technical side is super important and you have to perform very well in that regard, but for a lot of jobs and interviews I've been in, I've found that the soft-skills have put me ahead of the curve. Remember the interviewer's name and use it, they'll remember that. Also, ask them questions about the job that captures their passion(i.e. ""What's a project at *Insert company* that you've worked on that you found super cool?"") for their job. Also, be more human, you aren't a robot, because the managers want to hire a human being for this job, not a machine. I've found that admitting failure in some aspect of a project or explaining how something was very difficult for you that you overcame speaks of your ability to handle adversity and how you handle pressure, which is something they can empathize with. 

This might not be a general thing I can give advice on, b/c for some people it works and some it doesn't but if you can somehow connect with them on a personal level or make them laugh, you're getting a one-up on everyone that has the same technical abilities as you. Most applicants that get to the final interview stage are most likely qualified, and some are even more over-qualified. What these interviewers are looking for is not the smartest individual, but the **best-fit**, and fitting into their team socially is as important as fitting into their team technically. 

Good luck for all of us looking for jobs in this weird time, just don't give up and keep getting better."
imns2e,1,2020-09-04,Should I feel bad about Not Working in College?,Disastrous_Classic22,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/imns2e/should_i_feel_bad_about_not_working_in_college/,"Hi everyone, first post on Reddit and I need some advice.

I am 22 (almost 23) and a student majoring in mechanical engineering at my hometown university. I am currently unemployed and am living with my parents because it is much cheaper. However, I am starting to feel really bad about myself because of where I am in life. 

Let me give you a bit more information. I am currently a senior and have been living with my parents since my 2nd year of school. They are paying for my education and housing, so I don't want them to have to spend more than they need to. This explains why I live at home and not the dorms. As for the unemployment, I really want to be able to get a job as an intern and maybe move to an apartment close by but there in lies the problem. I have several learning disabilities that have plagued me since preschool. I am dyslexic and have ADD, plus dyscalculia and possibly a few others. I was first diagnosed with these when I was 3, then retested when I was 14. This has made college very difficult for me. Engineering is hard for anyone, but especially for someone like me with learning disabilities. I have to spend so much time studying for everything that I have little time to be able to work a job during the school year. I tried applying last year, but got so busy I knew I wouldn't be able to work the required hours so I stopped the process. I am doing well as a student, but at the expense not having a lot of time to work.

But studying isn't all I am doing. I am involved with my university's formula SAE team. If you don't know what that is, it's a collegiate design competition where students design and build miniature formula 1 cars with motorcycle engines. I have been involved with the team since I started college and am now the senior most member of the team. I am a design leader for a subsystem of the car as well as the chief engineer of the team. Again, here lies the problem: formula sae keeps me very busy. It is my hobby and I truly enjoy working on the team, but it takes all the available time I have when I am not studying.  It is basically like an unpaid internship. I have gotten a ton of practical experience and leadership skills, and I love the team and don't want to quite, but I would have to to be able to get a job and make money. And they are depending on me to be there for them. I am so committed and involved with the team that it would leave a big void at a crucial time if I up and left.

I don't know what to do. I love working on formula sae, but I feel very embarrassed when people ask me why I am living at home and don't have a job. It has really affected my confidence.

imo0t3,0,2020-09-04,[USA] Is this discrimination from my University?,jolifal,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/imo0t3/usa_is_this_discrimination_from_my_university/,"Hello,

I would like to ask if I am an international student attending a US public state university remotely. And as part of one of my computer engineering courses, the university pairs students with a mentor from industry to receive 1 on 1 help and guidance. I have heard this is also very good for internship in the future. However this is only provided if the student is black or female. 

Would this be considered discrimination and also is there anything I can do because I feel like I am paying for the class as well but because I do not fit those conditions that I do not control, they will give me a worse education and experience?

I know affirmative action is allowed to prefer accepting students if they are black or female or other target categories, but I did not know they do this for the actual courses as well?"

Currently 21, and have spent almost the last decade working with technology, networking, troubleshooting. Started just in the family, branched out to friends and eventually did a few things for some smaller companies. Then an internship last summer on the development side, and then an internship this summer on the security and infrastructure side. 

Got my associates in Computer science a few months ago. Have a lot of personal hands on experience with technology in general. Very solid knowledge base with just a little bit of studying needed for A+ and Net+. Internship is ending and they plan on hiring me back shortly if a position opens up (recent merger, things still getting sorted out, you know the deal)

Current plan:
Get A+, Net+, and Sec+. Should be achievable by end of year with current knowledge base, or at least shortly after. Following this if they haven't contacted me looking for another security position. They recommended FAAMG because of how impressed they were with my performance.

Any suggestions on how this should be tweaked? Any study tips? Etc."

Someone told me they  knew a 30 year old grad student who went to undergrad parties on the reg and her maturity regressed and wasn't able to socialize with adults professionally. Consequence - wasn't able to get a summer internship because she struck out on every single interview and thus, it isn't good for your professional and academic development. As well, they mentioned that they  know people (grad school and workforce) that struggled to leave college. They either hung out near their college and basically extended their college life while having a job/grad school or tried to live the college life away from their alma mata. Yes, this often meant dating college girls. Right now,  these are the people are struggling more in life with relationships, career, and etc. because they didn't lean forward to grow up beyond the college world.

As for details on myself I'm a Linux fanatic and am very knowledgeable about the platform, asides from that my only notable technical skills are Rust, Python, C, Shellscripting, JS/HTML/CSS, and an extremely trivial amount of interaction with various other languages.

Maybe I would need a technical background or an artistic background. I don't know. 

As a kid, I can recall the times that I said to myself, ""I want to be an artist"", and that I would love to work with people. In addition, I have done a lot of video editing/filming as a kid. But I would like to get some experience by making a game through Unity or Unreal Engine. 

I have been deciding a major in either film/media degree or computer science degree. I do plan on studying each career heavily and taking up internships to help me decide the career I want.

I purchased an appointment with a career counselor from LinkedIn, but that didn't work out. All I know is that I want to be in the film or games industry. The only careers that I am interested in include cinematography or game design.

Is there any way you can help me find the career that best fits me? I have been having mental issues because of this. I have been experiencing burnout, panic attacks, and lack of sleep.

I don't what I want to do for my future career.

Any advice?

earlier, and many times before that, my mom has just clicked out of the blue and got so mad at me for apparently no reason? i'm thinking it's because i was talking about how my neck was hurting whenever i turned it and that it really bothered me. instead of asking me where it hurt, giving me some advice to reduce the pain, or providing insight into why it might be hurting (in a polite and attentive way,) she started telling me how she was all tired of me playing games so much. she started talking about how games would make me some kind of lazy, useless idiot who is barely capable of doing anything. then she started listing off all of this shit about the dangers and problems that games cause. but i'm pretty certain that she thinks the only thing i do on my pc is play games. i have online school like you, the reader, probably do as well. i take several honors classes and hard electives and make a's, pretty much all the time. i have a 3.9 GPA, many extracurriculars, and a scholarship under my belt. and my mom only pays attention to the games?

i have shown her all of these cool and fun school projects that i've been doing, showing her all of the things i can do and the process behind all of it. i showed her some of the news about semiconductor and pc stuff, how it was so fascinating to me and i wanted a career in it. i started building computers and showing her that it was really fun and i was very into it. then, today, she just throws all of that out of the window and started to talk all of this shit about games. she told me that i'm going to turn out like my friend- dropped out of community college and wants to work at ups. but that's not why he turned out like that. his mom is not smart with her money and spends it all grooming her vietnam friends. she doesn't pay for his college and depends on financial aid and the government to pay for his tuition. i don't need to do all of that. i have the things necessary to be successful. and you know what my mom does? she blames all of my games and hard work i put into being an IT and talks about it like it's garbage. she tells me to read more books and see the news more, and when i tell her i have better things to do like school and homework, she SAVAGELY tells me i was so lazy and useless that i didn't finish all of my schoolwork. 

i talked about building a computer about a year ago and i've been saving up to buy one. i want a 3900x and a 3080, and i think that's what i'm going to get. next tuesday i'm going down to my local micro center to get my 3900x, and then on the 17th i'm ordering the 3080. i told my mom all about it and she seemed so supportive about it. so she DID think that all of my hobbies and interests were going to lead to somewhere. but the one time i complain about a neck injury she gets mad and puts all of that to shame? the months of work i put into my hobbies were useless to her? admittedly, i did pester her about my pc, but what part of that lets her make me feel guilty and like a burden? 

i hate it when she just clicks and turns into someone i can only describe as a savage. she tells me how i can't do all of this stuff in life, yet i'm over here getting internships at intel and countless academic awards, and my mom is working 9 to 7 at a nail salon. she tells me she wants me to have the life she never had, but she's definitely not being helpful. i'm so disappointed in myself and feel so guilty."

I love math and I want so badly to major in it, but I don't want to end up jobless. I could do a minor in computer science along with it, taking all the fundamental courses (algorithms etc) but unfortunately I've found that while I love computer science and coding, I hate learning about it in an academic setting.

I'm pretty fluent in some obscure OOP languages as well as Python, and I'm slowly learning Java and C#. I've got a few small projects under my belt and I'll probably have a quality github under my belt by internship season. I have enough AP credits to graduate college in 3 years (and with my financial situation I don't really have a choice).

Enough rambling; how would a math major + cs minor stack up against peers when applying for software engineering internships, in general or specifically at Intel? My ""junior"" year will be my second year in college so by then I will not have taken DS/Algorithms, will that put me at a significant disadvantage? How about after I graduate, can a math degree be competitive when applying, or would it be necessary to bite the bullet and slug through grad school in CS?

All that's keeping me going at this point is what is left of my will to not disappoint my parents again (I've been a very average/below-average kid all through high school and college)

I want honest opinions from people who've been in the same boat. I'm honestly fed up of these subjects that I'm supposed to like and learn. I have tried EVERYTHING. I've told myself countless times that it's gonna get better and that I should trust the process and be patient. I have studied for exams, done reasonably well in some, average in some. I have gotten through more books and articles and tutorials than I can count but I have zero motivation to continue studying and I get no time with my family or friends.

I see my peers enthusiastically answering questions in classes, interacting and being very passionate about CS and it just makes me wonder if this is for me at all? I'm an average student but I think I can make my way into FAANG. At this point, I'm not sure if this is even the right career option for me because I don't enjoy it, at all. I need help."

I am finishing up an interview for a software engineering job (final round regarding salary remaining) at a startup in Tuebingen. I am curious if it's a good idea to move there (I currently live in Munich). I understand that it's a student town with a young population (I am 25yo).

1. How is the tech scene there?
2. What could I expect the salary to be (For a new grad MSc with multiple internships in data science)? Could I save up something on the salaries?
3. Is it (culturally) considered a part of Stuttgart?
4. Any tips about the housing etc? Is finding a place as hard as it is in Munich?

Thanks!"

I am trying my best to remain realistic, so my main concern and goal is to build an impressive portfolio of projects I worked on over the next 4 years, so I can get out of my third world country, whether the portfolio lands me an overseas job, etc. Initial revenue is thus not a main concern.  Finding one or two other engineers to accelerate growth won't be hard for me. My university also has excellent opportunities for venture capital later on, so I am not too concerned with this right now.

My question is what can I realistically expect after 4 years of work? I am open to any form of software development, etc. How much will I realistically be able to grow my tech startup in the next 4 years, and what advice do you have to offer?

I can't think of another way to make me more attractive for overseas employers (or maybe a chance to get a startup visa overseas), since I don't have access to internships and other related opportunities.

Background-
I recently graduated last year with an IT degree but kinda useless since I am in web development ( I love it ). I started off as a web developer intern last year then got offered a full time position ( only because we were losing employees left and right ) I worked mainly as a front end developer in WordPress so HTML , CSS , PHP, jQuery but recently I started to work on our SaaS solution which is built currently on the .NET framework / C#. I love it but considering I'm still learning about OOP , MVC , entity framework etc , I still feel like I'm at a huge disadvantage compared to most. 

My manager and dev team are great ( manager plus 2 senior devs )  - my manager typically gives me jira tickets that revolve around my skill since he's seen me grow; tickets that are kinda challenging but totally do able for myself and I love it. Always willing to take time for meetings and go over any problems I have and explaining them to me so I can grow. 

Honestly those are the only good things about this company. I'm getting paid relatively low I feel (&lt; 50k ) , 4 PTO days a year and 1 week of vacation, terrible 401k matching , every year 50% - 70% of our workforce quits ,etc.

My question is , should I stay here until I get better skill wise or should I try my luck finding another ""junior"" web developer roles.
If so, what should I do to improve and what should I do in general?
I've updated my resume and cover letter as well as studying off hours on .NET CORE MVC C# etc.

TL;DR - should I leave my job even though I'm a junior or stay until I become better as a developer.

Thanks guys."

I contacted an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) for a research internship. This was around March and due to the pandemic, he told me to connect with him later.

I recently had a meeting with him. He has agreed to supervise me remotely for a year if I commit to joining his lab for the Ph.D. program. He says that there is no point to invest in someone if It does not benefit his group and lab although I will be able to learn from the experience. I think this is a fair deal.

I  am very interested in working with him but I am not sure about joining the Ph.D.  program.  I  just wanted to gain some experience doing research.   Although his area of work is exciting, I am not sure whether my interest in that field is enough to commit to a Ph.D.  One reason is due to the financial condition.

He has told me to think about it and reply.

I would like to know your opinion on this matter. Some of my questions are:

1. How good is the NTU CS Ph.D. program?
2. Is the stipend enough to live there comfortably? He hinted that the stipend for Ph.D. students is around 2000 SGD. One reason for my hesitance is the financial condition. I do not think I  will be able to bear expenses from my personal money.
3. The advisor is relatively new to NTU. He did his postdoc from Standford 2-3 years ago and joined as an assistant professor at NTU. Also, his background seems to be from electrical engineering. How will this affect a  student's experience?
4. Should one pursue a Ph.D. if he is not sure about it?

I am not sure whether I want to do a Ph.D. 

I am also preparing for interviews for some product-based companies. My original plan was to work as a software engineer for a few years and then maybe pursue higher studies. Not many big companies visit our campus so I am targetting off-campus."

I got an amazing 60k offer after my internship this summer to continue with a small/medium company (200 employees). The company is amazing, great perspectives, room to grow, I like the tech and really want to go 100% with them. 

The downside is that I can’t focus anymore on school, school was always bad for me. Always retaking classes, getting Fs and Ds mostly; 2.0 gpa and 30credits after 3 years (should have been at 90credits but had to retake a lot of courses after said Fs). 

I thought about having part time school and full time job but job needs a lot of concentration and learning (promised 10% increase in salary after 2months i I attain the correct metrics). I feel like i’ll loose energy for school and won’t be 100% at my capacity at work.

What is your take on this? Is it easy to stop school, try to attain a senior/mid position in 1-2 years if not, go into Master or restart Bachelor (my school offer 1year cooling period without losing your credits)? Are there masters that dont need a Bachelor?

Thank you so much for your time. Looking forward to having more direction in a stressful life."

I'm taking 61B right now and was wondering if it would be a good time to look for CS internships since a lot of the apps are opening up. Although as I read through the description of these postings, they look quite intimidating with the sheer amount of experience you might require to even qualify to get an interview.

I've had prior programming experience (even before taking 61A) and I can say that I'm a quick learner. I've also held a Physics (entirely coding based though) research position and have qualified for another one via URAP this semester.

**Demographics:** White male from the south, middle class, school is not that competitive and does not rank. No hooks.

**ACT:** 32 (Taking again this month, hoping for a 34)

**GPA(W)**: 4.31 (School does GPA weird so I'm not sure how much this is relevant but all A's and 3 B's)

12 APs total

Freshman year: APHUG(4)

Sophomore year: AP Euro(3) APCSP(4)

Junior year: APUSH(4), AP Lang(2 but appealed), AP Physics 1(3)

Senior year: APCSA, AP Physics 2, AP Gov, AP Econ, AP Lit, AP Calc AB, DE art history

**Intended Major:** Computer science (maybe physics)

**ECS:**

* Tutored math for under performing kids for all 4 years of high school(Probably 100+ hours in total)
* Summer internship with a coding company that hosts competitions. Worked with a group and developed an app that we distributed on GitHub. We used modern development techniques such as agile and scrum to complete it.
* Summer program at a T15 university for web development application.
* Coded a lot in my free time, have many different projects and websites I've made.
* Built a website aimed at helping kids learn coding and tech through projects.

* One for the teacher I had for APHUG and APUSH. We had a pretty good relationship and I did well in both his classes. Probably 7/10
* Counselor will probably be pretty generic as this is my first year with her as my counselor. 6/10

**Schools:**

* Purdue University
* UIUC
* University of Maryland College Park
* Georgia Tech
* Rice University
* UT Austin
* Virginia Tech
* UNC

My absolute dream school is Purdue so that's the one I would really like to get feedback about. I'm not sure about my chances at these schools, I'd say my application is just about average. Relative to my schools, my stats and ECs are in the top as I go to a school with very little focus on sending kids to schools that aren't state schools. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/i64mup/ancient_strategy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/imrh1c/ancient_strategy_25/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/iqf35l/ancient_strategy_27/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

The Abara family comes from a long line of military and government service. Some did so due to the expectations of parents and grandparents, but many simply felt that it was their duty to serve. It was by fate that an aspiring fleet captain and an ambitious diplomat should meet, seeing in each other a worthy opponent that promised to make them better. Soon enough, the Rear Admiral Jelani and Junior Ambassador Matilda were married. In the next year they had a son, Obi. A few years later they had a daughter, Francoise.

Matilda and Jelani both tried to keep their work and family lives separate. It was important that their children choose their lives themselves. Both agreed that the darker portions of their work would not cast a shadow on their family. Their children would not want for love, no matter what.

The Abara parents could not have been more proud of their children. They supported them in their endeavors, reminded them of their strength when they faltered, and cheered for them as they succeeded or failed. As they grew up, both children heard public service call for them and both were only too willing to answer. Obi joined an officer school and made his father, now Admiral Abara, proud. Francoise, in contrast, looked to politics and doing government service like her mother, whom she adored.

Obi did fantastic in his studies, impressing his teachers and making fast friends with his classmates. His leadership was exemplary and he found himself doing spectacularly in a crew on an expeditionary vessel. Francoise often helped with non-profit benefit groups when she wasn't studying and had done intern work for several government agencies. Already, she was making a name for herself separate from her mother.

Ambassador Matilda Abara had become well known, even having talked directly with the Gestalt Emperor. So when she had been tasked to negotiate with pirates who had been making the lives of Torvids, a small lizard-like species, quite difficult, she took it in stride. The negotiations were difficult, to say the least, but that was exactly why they had been assigned to her.

The pirates had initially been colonists who'd been sold a small system that was meant to be rich in resources and habitable worlds. When they arrived, though, the seller had taken their money and left them a couple gas giants, a few frozen planets, and a dying star. The colonists, having spent everything for the system and necessary equipment to start their new lives, had nothing left to try and terraform. The local governments were tied down in red tape as they tried to get them assistance. But red tape doesn't feed families. So they did what they had to for survival.

Matilda Abara, considered the best negotiator in the Empire, made a very human mistake. She cared. So, naturally, she wanted to show these people her trust and compassion. After convincing her husband, she invited their leader to attend a dinner. Both would bring their families to an agreed neutral location and they would share a meal together. Afterward, each would be on their way, leaving business to be done during the next scheduled negotiation.

By all accounts, the dinner was a huge success. Obi happened to be on leave, Admiral Abara made time, Francoise was out of classes. The pirate leader brought his two sons and daughters and his wife. Francoise had been a little nervous at first, but they had all been nice and the dinner was wonderful. She'd even gotten contact details of one of the captain's daughters she'd gotten along with particularly well. After the dinner, as agreed, they all left the neutral station in their own ships. Each was optimistic for future discussions.

Intelligence agents, still working to gather anything they could, found out about the more extreme sect of the pirates as the drinks had been served. They discovered the desire for sabotage of the negotiations after the first course had been laid. They confirmed the plot to attack the dinner after a particularly good joke from the son of the captain made everyone laugh. Security forces arrived in time to chase the attacking extremist pirates away from the already destroyed ships, each still exploding even as the station was breaking apart.

Admiral Abara and, posthumously promoted, Captain Abara were both given full honors for their service. The pirates, horrified at the attack on both families, surrendered unconditionally. The extremist sect attempted to resist but were swiftly put down by military forces, the intelligence given by their surrendering compatriots being pivotal to the Imperial forces.

Ambassador Abara was devastated, two lights of her life extinguished to senseless violence. It hardened her heart. But, more than anything, she was determined to not make the same mistake twice. She refused to lose her daughter. She couldn't bear if that last light faded from her life.

Francoise, too, was devastated. But in addition to having lost her brother and her father, she had lost her faith in her mother. The woman she had seen as infallible had caused their deaths, in her eyes. Her mother had failed her because she had been too ambitious, too confident.

Shortly after, the Conglomerate was found and first contact was made. Ambassador Abara was assigned to their negotiations and Francoise followed the talks with interest. When she heard that the CivSim game needed a host school, she convinced Terran University to do so. When they began recruiting for the team, she jumped at the chance. Ambassador Abara did what she could to keep her from being on the team, but even she could not deny the abilities of her daughter. So she factored her into her plans, heavy heart or not. Hopefully, she could keep her safe as things progressed. She would see every system, every nebula, of the Conglomerate burn before she let them hurt her daughter.

infwy1,2,2020-09-06,Unpaid Internship Advice (CA) (Long Post),westvalleyhoe,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/infwy1/unpaid_internship_advice_ca_long_post/,"Please forgive the wall of text:

I have recently obtained an internship that is related to my degree, and I am trying to gather information of the legality of what has happened so far, so I am prepared to talk about it after the holiday.

I applied for an internship about two months ago from an advertisement I saw on indeed.com. I heard back from them a few days later, and set up an interview.

I had a brief interview over zoom, which went well enough for the interviewer to refer me to the man who I have since realized should be my supervisor/trainer. I say this because he is the one person at the company with the title related to the degree I’m seeing.

After a second interview with my current supervisor/trainer I was referred to the CEO of the company for a final interview. The final interview was brief, and mostly consisted of him offering me the position and giving me some details about what will happen next. He ended the call by saying something along the lines of “we are looking forward to having you on board for the unpaid internship!”

I was shocked, but I weighed my options, and decided the experience was worth it. I work some part time gigs to get by, and I really wanted the experience (I’ve been looking for a foot in the door for literal years).

I start about a week and a half ago, and in this amount of time it has become glaringly obvious that I am doing the administrative data entry that no one else wants to do. Even worse, I’m being constantly pressured to work faster, and in the last couple days I have been given a deadline of next week to complete a giant project (900x50 excel sheet with links to photos etc) that would reasonably take anybody weeks to complete.

The attitude I’m getting from the CEO every day is increasing frustration and disappointment that I’m not completing his work fast enough, and I’m getting bitter about the current state of my work environment.

However, last week, the “supervisor” of mine planted a seed in my head by asking me what I thought so far (“off the record”), and explained that when he first suggested the idea of hiring an intern, he was thinking of bringing someone along that would shadow him throughout the day - something I thought sounded much more like an internship.

I have been looking online to find laws in either CA or the US that cover the legalities of unpaid internships. And while I have found many attorney-at-law.com type blogs, I’m finding very little on .gov websites. Can anyone give me something cut and dry? I know the US DOL laws changed in 2018 to become seven flexible criteria that employers should aim for while seeking unpaid interns. I’m finding nothing for California.

A few things to note:

I do want this internship, and I’m happy to complete it, but the whole point is for me to learn, which I don’t feel is happening.

I did not know this was an unpaid internship. Nothing on the Indeed ad or in my first two interviews indicated as such. I followed through because I decided the experience would be worth it (I still do, if I’m allowed to learn).

I am definitely being left to my own devices unsupervised all day to complete this task, which is really just progress on a much bigger task that was previously performed by paid employees. There was no sense of urgency to complete this shortly before I came along - my supervisor has confirmed that. It’s also a total pain.

I am not receiving any college credit for this.

My supervisor reaches out to me sporadically to show me facets of his position, and even shares YouTube videos explaining concepts he finds interesting (cool, right?). However, I was told yesterday (by someone else) that I need to establish times with my supervisor which I cannot be bothered with other things, because I need to make progress on this project.

I really don’t want to be paid minimum wage for this position, because then they can justify giving me menial tasks to complete. I want to be able to explain the illegality of the current state and explain that I am only interested in doing what was agreed upon at the time of hiring - an unpaid internship.

I imagine that some will suggest I quit, or find an attorney. I really don’t want to quit yet, as I hope to spin this into something positive, and ideally by making it clear that I have rights and will not be taken advantage of. If finding an attorney will help me know my rights, I will take that step eventually, but for right now, I only want internet advice. Thank you all for reading my long post. I really need to know where to look next!

TL:DR I am doing menial tasks for my unpaid internship, and I want to know specifically what is legal and what isn’t before I react."

ink1cv,46,2020-09-06,A startup full of unpaid interns? Is it normal?,LaVerae,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ink1cv/a_startup_full_of_unpaid_interns_is_it_normal/,"Hi, so I have a dilemma what to do. 

A week ago I started a 100% remote internship at a startup. It's supposed to last 6 months. It's registered as an LTD in the UK and I'm also based in the UK.

My role is a graphic designer. I'm still a student and I already had two unpaid internships in startups abroad (with only paid accommodation costs - these weren't remote internships) before this one.

Now when I joined the team I learned that most of the employees are unpaid interns too. There are like between 11-20 people in the team. We all work remote across various countries on 4 different continents. I think the only paid people are the experienced devs and the founder and his friend. The whole UI/UX design team are two MA students who are unpaid interns too. The marketing team consists of 3 UK-based students (again unpaid) and one Indian guy who is like the marketing executive/manager, but from his LinkedIn profile and his posts there it seems like he's unpaid too (he referred to it as an internship so that's why I think so).

The branding of this company isn't great. Frankly, it's not really developed yet. Like, their website and logo looks good, but there is no set style for the social media graphics. This week I was expected to produce some graphics for social media which I did, but I heard from one of the other designers that the boss doesn't like some of it, that ""it doesn't fit the brand"". The problem is, there are no other social media posts (they just started) to rely on for the guidelines in terms of style. There is no designer employed to develop the brand visual identity, the UX/UI people focus more on the app itself and the marketing people are just a bunch of unpaid students with no background in branding either. I could develop the brand style myself, I think it'd be good for my portfolio. However, it would take time especially with me working here only 10 hours a week and the boss is very pushy with timing and says we need to start posting social media content asap.

I also feel like this internship may interrupt my studies. Now I don't have uni yet, but it starts next week. I agreed to do this internship for approx. 10 hours a week. However, I get messages like everyday through the past week, I think I spent like 2-3 hours just on the calls/virtual meetings alone. And then in just 7 hours I'm expected to prepare all the other files for all social media channels. It makes me anxious because I feel the time pressure and I don't really want to work more than the agreed 10 hours as it will result in me having less time for my uni and college (I'm taking two courses this year). After I raised some concerns regarding lack of branding direction during the all team meeting (I mentioned I've already worked over 10 hours this week - which is true - I said it bc I felt the need to justify why I didn't manage to do some other stuff (illustrations for the app) they wanted me to do), the boss called me privately and said ""doesn't it says 10 to 20 hours in your contract?"" It's a bit of a red flag for me, felt like he tried to pressure me to put in more work hours during the week, even though the contract states ""approx. 10 hours"" and this guy himself said during the interview that ""it's 10 hours, it's like a one full-time work day a week"".

So my questions are: what do you think about situations like this? Should I leave this start up or do you think this experience is still worth it? Is it exploitive behaviour from the founder's side? Or am I overreacting? I don't mind working or doing some projects for free in order to improve my portfolio, I've done it in the past. But at the same time I don't like being taken advantage of and that's how I feel right now given that there are no senior graphic designers (or you know just normal paid designers employees) or even marketing &amp; PR people to mentor me properly in my field. In the previous startups I've been in the ratio of interns to employees was much more healthy like 2-3 interns to approx 12 paid employees.

TL;DR: The vast majority of the people in the startup are unpaid interns, including me. I'm a graphic design intern, but there is no senior/normal paid graphic designer to provide me with mentoring. The boss tries to push me to work more than agreed 10 hours a week and I'm scared it will affect negatively my studies as I take two courses this year."

inlfj9,13,2020-09-06,is a 35L loan advisable to study abroad?,[deleted],Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/inlfj9/is_a_35l_loan_advisable_to_study_abroad/,"I'm about to apply to University of Ottawa. Because I know French, I'll get a financial aid where I have to pay the same fees as local Canadians, not high fees of Internationals.

So roughly I'll have to spend around 6L per year on tuitiom fees which is roughly 24L for the 4 years. And let's add around 10L for living costs which makes around 35L foe the whole course. 

I'm adding living costs pretty less because my sister who went to study in Canada 3 years back covered most of her living costs by part time work and also paid a lot of tuition fees through internships and research. And I'm pretty determined to do the hard work when it comes to paying off fees. 

So here's the question, will it be advisable to take a 35L education loan to study in Canada? Or will it be a better choice preparing for BITSAT like I was for the past 1 year and try my luck on BITS?

Btw, I'm going to study Computer Science."

He has decided that he wants to wait a couple of years till he goes to a 4 year college.  After much prodding from my parents, he has been looking for a job.

My questions are mainly two areas.

With regards to labor laws, since my brother no longer goes to high school does he need any work permit?  Do the usual restrictions on how many hours he can work apply to him?  Is it 8 hours?

My other question is with regards to emancipation.  He was approached by an acquaintance with a paid internship offer for programming.  The acquaintance wants broski to sign a standard NDA, but that NDA wouldn't be enforceable.  Normally, this acquaintance hires seniors from high school.  Most of the time, these seniors are already 18.   But bro is a minor.  I am wondering what steps can be taken to resolve this situation.  Should my parents sign the NDA assuming liability if bro fucks up?  Can my bro get emancipated?

My parents are understandably reluctant to assume any legal liability for bro in this situation.  So they prefer emancipation.

Are there any ways for my brother to get emancipation?  Are there any ways for my brother to sign NDA and for it to be enforceable?"

For example, the projects I have right now are: a web scraper / visualization tool, a website I built for my grandparents, and a sudoku solver/generator.

(1) Should I list the ones I thought the most technically challenging, although they don't use 'popular' technologies?

I've also been looking at some stuff through my school Handshake and a lot of it is just web dev / full-stack stuff, which I'm not interested in. Is it possible to get internships without having full-stack or web dev projects? Right now I'm working on SLAM (self localization and mapping) w/ a Raspberry Pi, but I'm not sure if recruiters are looking for candidates who are looking for people who know the technologies they need or just good CS students (I am in no way a good student, just wanted to make a distinction).

(2) Should I learn web development, or just stick to things I'm more interested in?

(3) Is it possible to get internships at big companies without tailoring projects to full-stack or app development?

Any and all critiques are much appreciated as I am just now starting the application processes in search of a summer internship in the tech industry (software engineering). Although I would also love to land a 6 month internship as well so I am keeping the doors open for all possibilities.  


I do apologize for having so much of my resume censored but that information would be irrelevant to the critique as it is just my personal information and or sensitive information.

So, for a little background, I am going into my third year as a computer engineering major, but I've pretty much decided I want to switch to CS as soon as possible and pursue a career in software. I attended UCSB for a little over a year before I left and went to community college for a semester. I got accepted into Cal Poly SLO, and I'm starting there next week. My GPA is decent (3.49) but I feel like I have so little experience with actual coding, and pretty much every job description is daunting to me. I have only taken 3 CS classes, and the one I took at CC had very similar concepts to a class I already took. I pretty much just know OOP, some data structures, and really basic algorithms. I don't have any personal projects, research, or prior internship experience. I know that I should probably get an internship some time during my junior year, but frankly I don't feel like I know enough about software to land one anywhere. Also, I'm sure I'm going to probably have to take a fifth year, since I bounced around schools and am going to switch my major. Is there even a point in me doing this right now? Should I just focus on school instead of applying to internships? If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated."

Lately I have been feeling that between the coursework, my internship, side projects, and all of the industry knowledge and skills I am trying to build up, my work-life balance has become unhealthy. 

I am OK with continuing with this amount of work while I am in school. My concern is that once I graduate and hopefully land a job, that this trend of an unhealthy work-life balance will continue.

Did you find it necessary in your first job to work additional hours in order to ""build up"" your skills to be sufficient or successful at your job?

While in school how many hours a week would you estimate that you put into school, projects, clubs, internships, learning new skills, etc? 

Currently or at your first job, how many hours are/were you working a week ? Are/did you spend any additional time trying to improve your skill sets or learning industry knowledge that goes beyond say a 40-50 hour work week?

I understand in engineering that there will always be the need to improve/update your skill set and keep up with industry knowledge.

I also understand that each job is different and that there is probably the right job out there that fits my needs.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!!"
inrex1,1073,2020-09-06,I've reviewed thousands of applications for university recruiting at a startup. Here are some numbers and thoughts on the university recruiting process.,NullPointer1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/inrex1/ive_reviewed_thousands_of_applications_for/,"I've been a hiring manager for a US-based university recruiting at my unicorn of a few hundred people.

Here are some numbers and thoughts to paint a picture of what it's like being on the recruiting side:

* We are still pretty small, so we can only support about a **dozen new grad** and a **dozen intern roles**. This role was split between me as the hiring manager and one recruiter.
* Despite that, we would receive **hundreds of applications per day**. I think over the course of last fall's recruiting cycle, we had over 15,000 applications. We aren't even a household name or anything. When I went to a career fair, \~90% of the students had never heard of us.
* Because we have so many applications for such few roles, we are only able to extend offers to **\~0.3%** applications.
* Diversity is really important from the tops down and personally I 100% agree. We saw from random sampling that **40% of all applications were female**. We were always expected to match or beat that %. Granted we also invested in trying to find more women, so I’m not sure if the % will be as high for other companies.
* It was impossible to review every single application. My partner and I would try our best to review applications, but often this work would happen after work hours because the volume would be way too high. Even if we were able to review applications fast enough, we sometimes would see bottlenecks with the number of interviewers available or toward the outstanding headcount remaining. We would either have to bulk reject candidates without reviewing them or leave them ghosted. **If you were ghosted or if you were rejected even though you thought your resume was good enough, I'm sorry.**
* Because of the bottlenecks, in order to have the best shot of having someone review your application, you should always **apply as early as possible**.
* We have multiple locations across the US and the ones outside of the SF Bay Area were always harder to fill. If you're struggling to find a job in the Bay Area it might be helpful to also apply to other places.
* I have strong feelings about coding interviews. I hate interviews that require you to find some kind of brain teaser element or require dynamic programming to solve. We discourage our interviewers from asking those kinds of questions. But we do need to find ways to find candidates that are fluent with solving complex problems with code.
* The passthrough rate is a really key number for high volume recruiting. In addition to obvious tradeoffs between quality of candidates you extender offers to, if the passthrough rate is too high, then it limits the number of people you can extend initial interviews to in the first place. If the passthrough rate is too low, then you're spending too many interviewing hours. Given that we have limited headcount, but we want to give as many people a chance as possible, we will have about a **50% passthrough rate on each round of interviews**.

I'm not sharing this to boast about any acceptance rate numbers or to put anyone down who doesn't think they'd make the cut, but just to share a single viewpoint of what things are like on the other side. Also note that this is a super narrow viewpoint, I don't know what things are like at large companies or non-tech focused companies.

I know that things are rough out there and I wish that everyone that wanted to get into software engineering could get the opportunity. I hope that some people found this helpful and if there's demand for it I can also share details of what I look for when reviewing an application.

Best of luck out there."

**Intended Major(s):** Computational Biology (many schools don't have this so I might end up doing a double major in Computer Science and Bioinformatics/Biomedical Engineering)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** this is a weak point for me, I haven't been able to take any tests yet due to COVID cancellations. I am expecting around **1530-1550 on the SAT** and **34-35 on the ACT** based on practice tests.

**UW/W GPA:** 5.9/6.0 GPA, I'm pretty sure this comes out to a 4.0 UW on a regular scale... my school is just weird haha

**Rank:** school does not rank but I will be graduating summa cum laude??

**Coursework:** I took the most rigorous courses our school has - honors all the way! 

You are only allowed to start taking a maximum of 2 AP classes junior year, which I did:

AP Computer Science A (scored a 5), AP US History (scored a 4)

I am now taking 5 AP classes as a senior: 

AP Lit, AP Economics, AP Spanish, AP Physics C, AP Calc AB

**Extracurriculars:** \*\*warning- this is LONG! are these strong ECs or are they just ok-ish?  which one is the most unique/interesting? GIMME FEEDBACK PLS\*\*

Independent research - computational science

* *I've self studied machine learning and done projects on the applications of AI in toxicology and dysmorphology, planning on submitting a research supplement to most schools with more detailed info!*
* *I've gotten some mediocre awards at the regional/state science fairs, and I know that for a research EC this isn't too impressive since I'm not an ISEF finalist or anything...*
* *BUT I did do this all on my own, no research mentor, no special lab, or anything like that! I will most likely get a supplemental LOR from my chem teacher who helped me with the science fair forms to back me up (more on this in the LOR section)*

Founded my own hackathon, never done before at my school!!!!! it was sponsored by [repl.it](https://repl.it) which is a pretty big partnership!

Intern at my school's help desk/IT department 

* *I do* *tech support &amp; laptop repairs for students, staff*
* *Was a student ambassador at town-wide EdTech nights*
* *hosted a couple of large community outreach events with other interns (STEM talks, challenges)*

Student Leader/Teacher of a Girls Who Code club for elementary schoolers

* *selected for some competitive orchestras through regional music festival competitions*
* *created my own string trio with my friends, we do music therapy at local nursing homes*

Piano

* *been playing for a long time now, but no competitions unfortunately :(*
* *might submit a music supplement to show my skill?*

DanceSport - competed in some regional competitions with decent results but I'm definitely not an expert so this isn't a big focus on my application

Spanish Co-Chair of World Language National Honor Society

Member of Tri-M Music Honor Society and National Honor Society (most likely will not include on application)

**Awards/Honors/Distinctions:** \*\*unfortunately I am lacking substantial awards but whatever it's better than nothing, right?\*\*

Honorable Mention at Regional Science Fair (10th grade)

Third Place at Regional Science Fair (11th grade)

Honorable Mention at State Science Fair (11th grade)

...and then some violin competitions and a couple of honor societies as you can see above.

**Essays:**

THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE (hopefully)!! I already started working on my essays a while ago, and I have some pretty creative ideas that show off my unique childhood/background, my geeky personality and my \~intellectual vitality\~ ofc. I'm going to keep refining my drafts and pick the best one out of all my ideas! 

**Letters of Recommendation**:

Counselor rec: She basically has no idea who I am since I didn't interact much with the guidance department or talk to my counselor. I regret this, but it's too late to fix the relationship now. I sent her my resume and filled out a bunch of questionnaires that will help a little, so my rec will probably be average. Probably 6/10 or a 7/10 :(

Comp sci teacher: I've had her for 3 years, she's notoriously strict and kind of temperamental, but luckily I'm one of her favorites! Plus I'm a girl in CS which is FUN. Probably a 9/10.

English teacher: I aced this class! She loved meeeeee and she's saved a lot of my writing assignments to use as exemplary material for future classes. Also probably a 9/10.

Biology teacher: I had originally asked her for a recommendation but now I don't know if I'm going to actually need it. I'm afraid having too many recommendations will be overkill... ""thicker the file, thicker the student."" However, biology is a special interest of mine and a (sort of) potential major. This was my favorite class so I got really good grades and participated a lot. She also helped me study for some science olympiad events so we get along pretty well. Should I still use her letter of recommendation, or tell her now not to write one for me since she hasn't started writing them yet?

Chemistry teacher: I had him sophomore year, and even though I wasn't the best at chemistry, I was definitely one of his favorite students in class just because of my extroverted personality.  I work with him after school all the time for science olympiad, which is great. He also helped me with my science fair forms and has a decent understanding of all the research I've done on my own outside of school the past couple of years. He would probably give me a glowing recommendation (10/10!!!), but I also know he's not the best writer which slightly worries me. Should I still ask him for a supplemental recommendation?

**College List:** \*\*do you think these are accurate categories for schools based on my resume? any other schools that would be a good fit for a student like me?\*\* 

Ultra reach - Brown, Columbia, Cornell, MIT, Carnegie Mellon

Semi reach - Northeastern, Georgia Tech, Case Western Reserve, Brandeis, Boston University

Match - University of Toronto, University of Washington, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Worchester Polytechnic Institute

Safety - UMass Amherst, Rose Hulman Institute of Technology

**Closing Notes:**

If you read through this whole thing, YOU ARE A SAINT. THANK YOU. I would really appreciate any kind of feedback. I'm kind of clueless tbh, and I need all the help I can get. Be brutally honest please!

THANKS AGAIN FOLKS!!!!"

Young doctor on post-diploma internship here; I will soon start my radiology residency, thus I've started looking for local offerings of used professional monitors with DICOM profile (strictly for training purposes - looking at more pictures when I come back home from the hospital, not for working from home; I would like to hook it up to my Acer Aspire A717 laptop via HDMI, as a second display).

I've just come across this sweet deal on NEC MultiSync PA242W. It's 5YO and the seller claims it has been used for 5142 hours total for graphics design. The seller claims it's in a very good condition, with calibration software included.

It's $380, I've done some further research and it seems that the brand new costed $1060.  
It's in my city so it would be possible to check it out myself before buying.

The question is, should I pull the trigger in the first place? Will the image quality be significantly improved (vs the built-in display of my laptop)? What should I look for when checking it out? Alternatively, would You propose other good displays/laptops with great quality/price ratio?

Thanks and cheers"

I got more into machine learning recently and I am grinding numpy, pandas and scikit, but no projects yet to my name. I live in Poland so thats that and I just wonder whether I should stick with some more C/C++ hence my master thesis, study data structutes and algorithms further, keep grinding machine learning in Python as it is exciting to me at the moment or little bit of everything. I know I am kind of late to the game - some of my colleagues finished their meaningful internships right after BSc and now work as juniors/mids, but at the time I was kidding myself that I will maybe land something at a recording studio and wasnt all that into programming so I kept barista job which I am also currently working and trying to switch desperately.

I also don't have a flat yet and been living in cheap airbnbs/rooms rented out in other ppls flats.

The issue is I don't know what to do with myself now. I  have no friends here so it'll be really hard to distract myself in a positive way. I have to keep working, flat hunting and trying to make friends and I don't know how I'll have the energy or strength to do any of it. I feel so incredibly alone and don't know what to do.

Honestly before this pandemic I was optimistic about my chances at T30s, but now I don't know if that's possible. 

Do I have a realistic shot at: UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Stanford, Harvey Mudd, UVA, Georgia Tech, UMich, Ivies and other T20 schools?"

Lost two really great job offers because of Covid and have been jobless with very limited prospects since.

I am being offered an out-of-state job from the company I interned with last summer. The expectation is that when WFH ends I relocate there. I have no desire to move and will likely quit when WFH ends but I want to take the offer to gain experience and earn some money in the meantime. Who knows how long Covid could last. 

I’d like to accept but feel bad lying about being willing to relocate. My internship manager seemingly set this up for me as a favor after hearing I lost my offers.

Besides potentially burning a bridge with this company and my manager are there any other reasons to not take the job? Any advice or insight you guys have to offer would be great. Thanks for your time."

I am a junior in college studying to be a financial advisor. I put together a list of questions that I was hoping some current financial advisors could answer and maybe give any other helpful insight that they have. I am also hoping to network if anyone could help with that as well.

I am currently checking out some internships but leaning towards Edward Jones. Any thoughts on the company and going independent with them out of college?

* What do you do with clients who are not financially stable?
* What is your main way to start off a good relationship (first questions to get conversation going)
* Do you cold call? If so have you gotten it down to a well put together script or are there certain ways to keep the call going?)
* What types of mistakes have you made (within the relationship and investing) and how did you fix them or make the situation better?
* Do you handle your finances with the same care as your customers? Or even handle your own finances?
* How did you handle finances during COVID-19? Were customers panicking and how did you handle this?

Thanks so much guys I really appreciate it."

I am a 26 year old college undergrad with a bachelor’s in Psychology and I currently work in a customer service job in South Florida. I lost my interest in pursuing a master’s in neuropsych after coming across the subjects of machine learning and data science. I was enamored by the fact that the data science field took what I loved about my undergrad research (data collection, and analyzing tests and trials) and the possibility of training a computer to perform and automate tasks, as well as understand and process large amounts of data to make informed decisions.

**My Goal**

My goal is to break into this field to obtain an entry level position in a data science related field, such as analytics.

**Steps I Have Taken**

Here are the steps I’ve currently taken:

· Starting Back in 2017 I researched the field and learned about MOOCs.

· I took a handful of classes, and learned as much as I could using Udemy, YouTube etc.

· I learned some Python with no prior knowledge about programming.

· Took a class about machine learning, it was a bit too hard to understand but I took what I could from it and enjoyed it.

· Its 2018, I learn more about the field and I also I start looking at job postings and looking at the skills required for data analytics.

· I develop a handful of projects which are reports on things I find on Kaggle and built a portfolio website which can be viewed here: [http://asketez.com/](http://asketez.com/)

· After developing a couple of small projects, I feel confident and start applying to jobs while keeping track of them in a Google Sheet.

After applying to around 150 jobs, I get 0 calls back or responses. I understand I have no experience, or a related degree. But what can I do, to show employer’s that I could be a good entry level employee? I have a portfolio with some projects. Should I create more? Should I intern instead of looking for something entry level? Should I go back to school?

Please advise. Thanks for any assistance."

 I've started the summer 2021 internship application process and it seems like every job application requires candidates to have a CS/eng background (pretty obvious). So, I'm worried that since my major is a premed major (CS minor), I won't even get interviews. For this reason, I've tried pretty hard to do side projects, getting a CS TA job, and getting work experience in CS. But I'm still scared that I won't stand a chance. Honestly, I've been thinking of switching to studying engineering/CS for a long while and this is just another reason I'm considering doing so. Do big companies (FAANG) really care about my major? Should I switch majors to CS? 

Also, McMaster offers a ""CS as a double degree"", but the option isn't available until you complete your first Bachelor's. Should I put this on my resume instead of the major I have right now and say that I am planning on pursuing the double degree to up my chances?"

I am basically having to start over in life, having gone back to school for a CS degree last year. I have a degree in Accounting, but never bothered doing much for myself in the field as I was always generally unhappy. I have 3 internships under my belt and deployed a few mobile apps. I'm looking to have my degree by May 2022 and would like to start planning for a new potential landing spot. I do not want to stay in the south, even if it means going to one of the big cities - I'm simply tired of it and have lived here my whole life. 

I am open and would love to move to Europe (at least for a few years), but it seems from other postings on here, that's difficult to do unless I pursue a MS in CS in Europe. I have thought plenty of moving out west, but with COVID and lots of employers letting software devs start working from home, I'm thinking I missed my chance to start my career in a tech hub while things were hot. I can deal with any type of weather but mostly care about 3 things right now: 1) Job opportunities and career advancement 2) Being in an area where there are plenty of millennials and 3) Politically liberal. Looking for any suggestions and am open to areas outside tech hubs that might not necessarily be on every CS grad's radar."
io1515,1,2020-09-07,I lost the fight for my friend,DetermineM3_23,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/io1515/i_lost_the_fight_for_my_friend/,"
This is gonna be a long story, but honestly I think writing about this will be therapeutic for me.

Me and my best friend Q (that's we'll call her) starting being best friends in high school, she had a rough upbringing, I had a stable home. But, we both experienced a similar traumatic experience and it both affected us in different ways. She used to no be a very good student, but i had to be because my parents were very strict. But, we were all each other had at the time. We grew very close near our senior year of high school. I always used to be very timid and introverted, kind of awkward. She was a pretty girl, but I never had feelings for her ever and she had a strong personality, but tended to always be in bad relationships. 

We eventually graduated high school and we went to college, she went to a community college close to my university. it was at this time we were closer than ever, but we were both immature so we had our fair share of arguments, reminder that our relationship was very platonic. In college, I had another friend that would invite us to parties and this is where I started to grow more in the sense I became less introverted. We used to have so much fun and we also became more ambitious on our goals. She used to inspire me in the fact that she would grind for what she wanted. But, then the dating came... I had no problem with her dating, but there was some red flags that came up. When she started dating this guy named R (we'll name him that), she started to pick things like vaping, or certain idealogies of his. I have no problem with having different opinions ,but I did have a problem that she was changing for him. Don't get me wrong he wasn't a bad guy, but he was one of those to keep talking up a storm and get no where. I always wanted the best for her. 

It was around this time I was super insecure with myself, I wasn't in the best shape and I thought I was ugly. It was because of this that I was more distant. I noticed that they were moving really fast. Eventually they moved in together. ( a lot of drama happened within our friend group that Im gonna skip, but just know that this drama is gonna be important later).  R used to think very highly of himself, which was fine but it got to the point it was pretentious. At one point, I decided to do myself better by taking baby steps, first i decided to change my major to something I would be more passionate about and that is very marketable nowadays. I also transferred to a different university that wasn't too far but also better. It was at this point that they broke up (Im gonna save all the BS) they broke twice and got back together. I was always there for her throughout this whole process. she would stay over my place and I would help her out in anyway I could. After which, she got back together with him. I was upset about this, but I eventually accepted it. We were all good and I just tolerated him for the sake of her, always polite and striked up conversations with him.

Fast forward, I took my personal growth further, I had a period of depression and a toxic relationship (which ill admit Q did help get through), after that period, I decided to go extreme into fitness and find internships to further my goals. I was so into it and I wanted Q to be better too. This is where our friendship dynamic started to change. R was just not the type of guy to actually walk the walk, he was just all talk, I literally saw no progress with him and it started to rub off on Q. I obviously am not gonna meddle in their relationship, so I made it a goal to fight for my friend and push her to be better because R wasn't going to do it. I wanted to start with fitness (she was started to let go and everybody was noticing, and it wasn't even about looks, she could not run a block with out gasping for air, I was genuinely worried). It was constant opposition from her (mind you before she was dating R she would go to the gym a lot) to the point she attacked me by saying that I've ""changed and became so vain and that it doesn't suit me"". It was at this point that she would start getting bothered by things I say even though she would do the same exact to me (but I always took it as a joke). I just found it so unfair, this extended to even when I brought up people from our past she would get angry. I started to not feel comfortable hanging out with her for long periods of time. Before this I started to branch out and make new friends because I saw our relationship was getting to co-dependent, but she never branched out she was just comfortable with me and R. 

Now present time, I started to get a surge of ambition after my depression period during quarantine. I wanted to work with her on something that would make us both money, but throughout this whole period it was always her bringing up issues. It got to the point that we just couldn't work together anymore. I stopped pushing her on a lot of stuff because we used to get into arguments, but eventually her insecurities started showing even though she said she was comfortable with herself (I would always tell her that she should love herself and that if these things matter to her work towards it then). She would lash out at me for trying to make a point if it even slightly went against her. It wasn't until it got bad and she threatened our friendship, she said that we were done and that I won't have anyone else (which is untrue I have my family and other friends). I conceded that argument saying how much I love her and that she's my family. Then she started it up again using our friendship as a weapon a week later. At this point, we haven't talked in over a week and I'm strangely relieved, but a little heartbroken. We're in an unknown state. She was my family, but at this point I don't even know anymore, I'm exhausted and I want to be at peace. I drown myself in work so I don't think about this. What bothers me the most is that I lost, I miss when she was ambitious and wouldn't stop until she reached the stars. I miss the time when she used to inspire me. But, it looks like we both changed in different directions. I just want people to be brutally honest, is it my fault? where did I go wrong? is it worth even repairing? (Right now I made the decision to stand strong and stand for myself, but maybe I could be persuaded to reach out and try to fix things) I'm just so tired...."

I have no technical skills in the industry, so I was thinking about asking what kinds of skills I should learn on my own to be able to qualify for an internship or unpaid gig at the firm this summer. The goal here is to not come off too strong, and more to hint that I am looking for an opportunity. Or should I scratch that, and be straight up?

Would it be too late to start a personal project, or should I still try? Is it possible to add final projects I completed in my CS classes onto my resume? Is it okay to start applying to internships in a few months or should I start now? 

For context, I'm a sophomore at a state school w a pretty good CS program. I have some experience from hs, but I haven't updated my resume since coming to college. Any input or advice is really greatly appreciated!!!"

basically when i was deciding colleges I was picking between ucsd ucla and uci 
however i told myself from the start that i couldn’t go to ucsd cause so many people from high school were going there and even half my friend group was and what i needed more than anything was to go somewhere where i could truly start all over and im also an introvert and i knew if i went to ucsd id stay in my comfort zone and never really be able to step out of that zone which i really wanted and needed to 
and i didn’t wanna go to uci and i have no regret turning down uci i wouldn’t have been happy there 
so i picked ucla for lots of reasons academics wise, knew more upperclassmen there that could help me out, great way to step out of my comfort zone, good premed community a bunch of other reasons why people pick ucla 
the thing is now i think i regret it im terrified that picking UCLA was the wrong choice 
what if I’d gone to ucsd and I could have gotten a higher gpa there or the fact that there’s so many internship opportunities in the area and their cognitive science dep is great and the location is beautiful what if I had picked UCSD despite all the reasons why I knew it wasn’t for me what if I was too quick to write it off 
but at the same time I visited the UCSD campus even after committing to UCLA and i didn’t really  feel anything being on campus whereas UCLA I visited the campus while it was empty but just being there made me so happy and you know how people say to follow your heart and my heart was saying UCLA no other school got me as excited as UCLA 
I’ve made UCLA friends already and theyre great and already gotten so much help and information and I truly believe that we all end up where we belong so I feel like if I was meant to be at UCSD I would have been rejected from UCLA 
I guess my biggest and only regret is that maybe at ucsd I would have gotten a higher gpa and more internships/research otherwise in every other aspect I’d pick UCLA in a heartbeat 
so is it worth it to spend a year or two at UCLA and see how things go and then transfer to SD or should I consider community college I guess I just need some advice because this has been driving me crazy"

I graduated 1 year ago in Computer Science from a good university in my country with a decent GPA (not very good  but not bad either).

I made the classic mistake of not looking for internships and not choosing the project centered classes so my portfolio is weak and my strong side is solving coding questions.

I took a few months to practice leetcode and prepare for interviews, and I solved 200+ leetcode questions. I started interviewing around January of this year and I got far in the process in many companies, including FAANG companies. However, when the pandemic started to hit hard around March, I'm struggling a lot to find interviews and relevant junior positions and when I finally did find an opportunity last month in a good company (big N) I failed during the 4th and last interview and I have no clue why...

Now that I didn't work for a whole year I'm afraid it's gonna raise red flags in future interviews so I'm thinking of returning to university and looking for a student position as I feel like there are more opportunities for students rather than no-experience grads, and I also feel like the bar for students is lower and I need to pass less interviews. I'm even thinking of quitting grad school if and when I find a good job. I know it's not the ideal way but I at this point I just need to put my foot inside the industry and start my career at a good place.

I would never imagine finding a job would be so frustrating..."

I’m in a pickle. I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at a large bank in Canada and know I have the technical, theoretical and business acumen to be a successful Data Scientist, however I’m eventually hoping to break into the US market and noticed that there seems to be a dreaded barrier to entry, a Masters degree. I got my current job by networking during an internship. Do you guys think I should go back and get my Masters? Will I be able to bypass this barrier with the more experience I get? Any help/advice answering these questions and any general advice outside of these questions would be much appreciated."

I saw this amazing opportunity at a company that had links to my previous employer, found an internal contact who willingly referred me, I sent a follow-up email to the hiring manager and 2 weeks later, voila! They asked me to choose a slot for the 1st interview. I'm so excited!

But the thing is, I only have a humble amount of experience in recruiting, which was something that I did on the side, as my primary responsibility was acting as an executive assistant to the management board. And for this reason, I have no idea:

* What they would expect from **a junior tech recruiter** and what sort of questions/ case studies I should expect? Can any of you in the industry walk me through possible questions/expectations from the HR manager?
* As a non-EU citizen living in Germany, I have quite a bit of bureaucracy I should deal with before starting a new employment. My earliest starting date seems to be early-mid November, however, the foreign office is working very slowly at the moment due to Corona and I can not give out certain dates to prospective employers. How do I prevent this from being a deal-breaker during the interview?

Help appreciated!"

Should I apply to really good schools for a Masters?,Icries4frenchfries,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/io93pc/low_gpa_but_good_publications_should_i_apply_to/," I have a **7.85/10 GPA** from a Tier 2 college in India (2020 graduate). However I have put considerable amount of time in doing ML projects and internships. I have **2 ACL Papers, 1 NAACL Paper, 1 ACM HyperText Paper, and 1 Interspeech** paper. I am the **first author** in all of these. Apart from this I also have **2 US patents** filed with the company I interned with. These patents are also in the domain of Natural Language Processing. My GRE score is **158V 167Q.** I was also a member of the only undergraduate student team in India to build a driverless car. I'll have strong LORs from professors who know me personally. Currently I'm working as a Data Scientist in a Fortune 10 company as part of their applied NLP Research Team. My current h-index is 3 with 18 citations.

Do I stand a decent chance towards getting into CMU/Columbia for a Masters Degree in ML/Data Science ? I feel like my GPA is going to be a burden for me and all this effort may go to waste."

I currently am not in a position to make any moves whatsoever so staying employed and working another 5 months is the priority so i can put my application in for immigration. I cannot afford the education route because im not well off and I earn peanuts although i fully intend to do a masters once I successfully migrate. I will be leaving this account active for another 7 days to continue conversations but if youre someone else like me in my situation all I can say is keep hammering those phone calls till you get lucky and stick your head into a position till a better opportunity passes by.

Before I start I would like to point out that I hold a third world passport and this is the root challenge I have been trying to overcome for atleast 6 years now. Im also a third culture kid who has lived in several different parts of the world by myself for the sake of my education, Ive had to cut corners on my education costs as my family is not wealthy.

Im a Mechanical engineering graduate who graduated last summer with a years worth of experience in my field plus another year or more in part time work in different sectors. I am currently interning at a well reputed company, however Its been 6 months and the last I heard anything about my future employment was 2 months ago during a layoff session where I was informed that my internship may be extended as they would require a position to be opened for me. Another intern who has joined with me however has gotten a position within his own team early and this has caused alot of concern for my employability. Even if i were to get offered a position it would be in sales, which is far from my interest. The country has very little choices in terms of companies with a global reach for me to reach out to for employment. Local companies are known to exploit non westerners or locals and the best position I was offered was 200 pounds a month on a 6 day work week + available on call at an all times basis.

The biggest challange I face is that I have had to relocate to Qatar due to my passport being from the third world, I cannot return to my own country as we have nothing over there and one of my parents is employed in the middle east. My passport has been the biggest roadblock for anything related towards my career. In the UK, It took me 11 months to secure a placement and after my placement, I have had about 4 full time graduate offers sent to me, all of which were receded due to my passport despite the issue being discussed during interviews.

As a result of all this, I have been looking to apply for a Canadian PR and a passport down the line but have been put down by Canadian recruiters who said I have no chance with the passport I have on hand.

Im really frustrated as I dont know how to proceed forward, there are very small choices in qatar and I cant get employed anywhere else in the world because i drew a bad number on the birth lottery and have an extremely invaluable passport? I see alot of classmates from school days happily moving to Canada under their parents, yet my family has absolutely no wealth or drive to do anything positive. I really love the engineering industry but im rapidly being pushed away from it just to stay employed, this whole situation is taking a toll on me as I do not feel anything anymore, I dont want to play games, talk to whatever few friends I have left or put myself out there for relationships. I also have no idea on how to create an alternate source of income and I am coming to learn it is extremely important in this day and age, I cannot rely on my family for any of these questions as they are heavily opposed to change and get quite defensive and angry when I want advise on any of these topics, they also dont know how to help with employment but will get upset if i loose employment."

ioahre,8,2020-09-07,Things to do before starting BTech CSE 1st year (and some other questions regarding MS),JEE_AIR_0,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/ioahre/things_to_do_before_starting_btech_cse_1st_year/,"So I'll be doing my BTech in CSE and my classes are going to start from 15th of oct. So there's a little over a month of free time with me and I don't really want to waste this time.

I wish to do MS from abroad (Preferably EU+ colleges as they are less expensive) immediately after BTech. And from the research I've done, for them to even consider my application, I need a good GPA (at least 8.5+, but 9.xx is safer). Apart from that there's research papers that I need to get published, internships. And then there's the GRE and IELTS/TOEFL. Then I need to write a really good SOP and  get LORs and you already know all that. All well and good. 

But the problem is, I don't know where to start. Its all very blurry atm. To put this in Layman terms, its kinda like, ""I do know how a car is *driven*, but I don't know how *I'll* drive it"". As cringey as that sentence sounds, it exactly describes my current situation. All the things I mentioned above, be it the SOP, GRE prep or publications—none can be starting points. 

Yeah sure there's GPA and I can start studying 1st year syllabus from online lectures, but I've been told to strictly study from the profs' notes, and maybe solve similar questions from the books they (profs) prescribe. Nothing else and you can land at a 9+ GPA in this college, at least in the 1st year. It'd be a total waste of time to study unnecessary stuff. And TBH I have ZERO interest in studying Physics and Chem all over again. Please no.

The thing is, I just don't want to mindlessly start studying anything randomly without a proper logical plan. I've watched many YT videos, browsed through multiple reddit threads, most of which btw were from this very sub-reddit, and I've read a lot of blog posts and medium posts, but I can't seem to figure out what I should really be doing atm.

I can obviously start programming straightaway, but I really want to learn core basics of Computer Science, rather than jumping straight to programming. I learnt C# and VB.NET during 9th-10th grade and although I enjoyed it a lot, it never felt like I was actually understanding anything. I was more or less figuring out things *inside* of the IDE just randomly, instead of learning stuff beforehand and applying it in the IDE. Sure it did feel good to see your program finally execute, but to be brutally honest, I do not remember a thing about C#. I do know all the basics of C++ though, since I studied that in 12th grade.

Useless off-topic rant you don't need to read: &gt;!Since we're at it, tf is wrong with some people on Quora trying to shove in python in every fucking answer? ""What to do during summer vacation?"", ""lEaRN pYthON""; ""What to do on weekends?"", ""leArN pYThoN""; ""What to do on your first date?"", ""LeArN pYthON""; ""What to do right before sex?"", ""lEaRN pyTHoN"". Why tf do they think knowing python makes them cool? And literally none of these certified chutiyas post actually useful stuff about CS. Just flexing that they know python. No, not even their skills, they are proud of the fact that they can type on a black screen.!&lt;

Anyway keeping all that aside, my point is, what should I do during this one month to get a head start?

Also, what else should I do during my BTech to secure a seat in a good college (T9, ETHZ etc.), other that what I mentioned?

I hope this isn't a dumb post lol.

TIA"

\* \*\*Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 USD 2000

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you open to refurbs/used?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 No.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 I need something light (**under 4 lbs**) but with great build quality and good performance with around **6-7 hrs of battery life**.

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 It's important enough because my current job requires me travelling 4 days/week.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

 I prefer a 15"" but a 14"" will do just fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

 **web designing, programming and ethical hacking** (hacking is not part of my job but I'm currently doing online courses on cybersecurity and in 3 months (hopefully) I'll be doing internship in a small cybersecurity firm) . Since I'll be running 2-3 virtual machines, I need something that has at least **16GB** of RAM (32GB preferred).

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 I'll not be gaming on this device.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

   **good keyboard**, **reliable build quality**, **finger-print reader** and decent amount of ports.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

 A good keyboard is highly preferred and yes, I the laptop needs to be reliable since it would be basically my portable workstation but I don't need ECC memory support. An okay webcam would do just fine but a finger-print reader is  necessary since I might have to carry sensitive information from time to time.

 I have a above avg. desktop PC where I do most of my heavy tasks but I need a portable workstation and I'll be running Linux on this device."

ioeg3n,2,2020-09-07,Need advise with college planning,SwissCheeto,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ioeg3n/need_advise_with_college_planning/,"Hello everyone, getting some advice or opinions on what I should do for getting through college would be nice. I just feel kind of mixed between what I think vs. what my parents think.

Degree: Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (136 credits total; 114 credits after this semester of my first year)

Freshman semester (Currently taking): 13 credits (I had 16 but dropped a class due to feeling overwhelmed from the sudden rush of college stuff/responsibilities. Literally got a panic attack on the 2nd night of school)

I have a 4-year scholarship that covers almost half my tuition (around 20-25k/year left; some of it covered through loans as well). Right now, my parents are helping to pay but I want to get a good job after college to help pay for it as well (never gotten a job before though. I was thinking of getting one around senior year but then coronavirus safety became a thing).

My parents and I talked over how I might spread out my college classes.
I felt like having less credits per semester (maybe 12-14 or even 12-16 max) while taking 1-2 classes every summer (3-6 credits, although some summers might not provide the classes I need to take) would be a good pace for me because I feel like I work better and overall just feel healthier and happier when I take less classes (I took Running Start which had only ~3 classes per quarter and it was the happiest and possibly the most productive time of my life, productive both in school with great grades and at home with chores and hobbies).

My parents feel like I should REALLY push myself in order to graduate early/in 4 years. They're thinking that I should even try to take 18 credits next semester but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna hate my life a lot if I do that, even if I might be able to handle it due to it being online at home. I just don't think I'm the kind of person who can get through 18 credits and feel fine with it, even if I can manage my time.

I'll probably feel anxious a lot of times, possibly get another panic attack, and for sure have much less time to hang out with family and take care of myself well. I'm mostly worried about crashing down and even failing a class because that'd mean my scholarship would be taken away. I just want to be able to find a nice balance between school and life even if that means extending college to 4.5 or 5 years. I know that doing this will mean I may have to pay a lot more due to the scholarship ending (guessing around 140k to pay in total although my parents are helping which I'm eternally grateful for) but I think I'd be perfectly fine working to pay that with a future job. I generally save my money well too. But, due to the coronavirus, I'm not sure if I'll be able to quickly find a nice-paying job. I also may probably have to take some paid internships first, and I might be doing that once I graduate college. I know people usually take internships in the summer of maybe their sophomore-senior year but I might be trying to take summer classes instead (just kind of confused on if I should take classes or an internship. Probably classes so I can get a bit closer to finishing college, then do an internship before looking for a job? I don't know tbh).

So basically,

What I want: Both happiness and productivity in college (12-16 credits). Might take me longer (4.5-5 years) but I'd enjoy my life more. Also pricier (5th year will mean maybe 20-40k more), but I'm gonna work to pay it off with a future job. Idk how long that'll take me though.
What my parents want: For me to push myself (16-18 credits) possibly past my personal limit (will make me feel pretty miserable even if I can manage to push through). Can end earlier but probably at a mental cost. I may possibly fail and lose my scholarship, and I know that Computer Engineering is a tough degree in general.

I think I'll go comment below the breakdown of what I need to take per year for my degree so you can see a general overview of the classes I'll be taking. A few credits are covered from Running Start but it's only like 9 credits unfortunately (although it took care of the broadening requirement of 24 credits)."
ioek5m,2,2020-09-07,Advice on getting a job as an analyst?,hmmmmmwhatif,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ioek5m/advice_on_getting_a_job_as_an_analyst/,"Hi r/careerguidance!

I'm a 24 year old who graduated from a fairly low-tier university in Canada with a BBA in 2018. While my GPA was fairly good (3.7/4.0), I had some family issues, which made it difficult for me to take internships during my studies. Getting out of school, I came to realize how difficult it was to get positions anywhere in my desired field (finance &amp; accounting) without good internships and/or connections in the Toronto area. Fast forward a couple months of applying, I got a position working as an Accounts Payable Coordinator which I worked at for about a year and a half. However, as of August, I have been laid off due to company wide budget cuts. While I was able to learn more responsibilities and skills then my job entailed, I feel as though I became too comfortable in my position and wasted a good chunk of time that could have been used more efficiently to increase my eligibility for better roles. 

At this point, I'm looking for any advice or suggestions on what credentials required to break into an analyst position. (I know the term analyst is quite broad. I mainly enjoy working with financial statements, but i'm open to the idea of most roles that focus on preparing reports and critical thinking.)

While I continue applying to new positions, I'm currently weighing the options of: pursuing my CPA, getting a masters degree, doing temp work, volunteering and/or possibly working in different parts of Canada/US where it might be slightly easier to find work.

Any advice is much appreciated!"

So for some context, I decided whilst I was on placement as a Systems Engineer that I really didn't see myself doing systems engineer as a career and enjoyed working with software and programming (always have but due to A-level choices I never pursued it). During the internship I picked up python and got good language knowledge, messed around with the key libraries (matplotlib numpy etc) but never really made any projects (bar a OOP Black Jack game).

Back in April I was picking additional modules for uni and wanted the most 'software(y)' project I could find - this ended up being Full Stack Development in C#. I didn't know C# but have been learning that since and would say I have a good understanding of the language, C# sugar, OOP etc but again, I haven't made anything proper yet. Note that through the module at the end of the year, December time, I'll have a Full Stack project completed. 

To try and streamline my attempts at having as much programming content in my degree, I am doing a dissertation on a path-planning algo based on D* in C++. I don't know C++ but have been learning it for the past couple weeks.

I have also made the decision that I am going to do a MSc Computer Science conversation course at a Russell Group university after my degree.

I would like to do a summer internship to develop myself professionally and help myself after I graduate from the MSc.

As I mentioned I don't really have any solid projects. I will have some time to commit to creating a project outside of the C# and C++ uni projects I described above. What would I have to do to have s good chance of securing a summer internship as a software engineer? I am not bothered if it isn't a big name, I just want that experience and the ability to learn and apply the skills I have been learning.

I am conscious that this is a difficult task but I really want it and am dedicated to putting the time needed into making it a reality.

I appreciate everyone taking the time to read this, I am sorry if it is poorly written or formatted - I wrote this on my phone.

I can link my GitHub if needed. I haven't revised my CV yet as I found a good template but if you want me to expand on anything then please let me know!"
iofvro,1,2020-09-07,From an Aerospace Engineer to Software Developer,DaemonGeek,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/iofvro/from_an_aerospace_engineer_to_software_developer/,"Hello Everybody,

A little background about myself: I am at my late 20's aerospace engineer, living in Israel. I chose to study AE due to infinite curiosity around the aerospace world (Rockets, Aircraft, Satellites and etc). After graduation, I really believed that a lot of opportunities are waiting for me outside-but unfortunately I was wrong. The aerospace industry in Israel is small, and for each AE position at the market there are a bunch of candidates and therefore the competition is hard.  Somehow I have found an Entry-level position, but the job was unrelated to AE and almost do not related to engineering at all (besides some simple mechanical designs I had made). Also-The job paid really poor-around 2K USD a month. After about a half year at this job, I finally had found a job that was closer to engineering, but to ME, not to AE. The Job actually could be done by associate degree graduates because it just involved mechanical design using SolidWorks.  This job paid a little bit higher salary-around 3.5-4K USD a month and was much interesting relative to the previous job, but still, it was not AE and I am not sure if I can call this Job an ""Engineering Job"". 

After spending another 9 months at this job, I have finally found a real engineering job.  One day I can work with Matlab and Simulink, another day with SolidWorks, another day I can find myself writing Python/C code, and, unfortunately, there are days in which my boss just ask me to work ""hands-on"" and do some mechanical assemblies or repairs (which I do not like to do at all-I prefer to work with my brain and less with my hands). The paycheck is still relatively low, at least if you compare the paycheck of a US AE engineer with this of an IL engineer. Besides the paycheck and the issue with the ""hands-on"" work, I am happy with the job, I feel like I am learning a lot during each work-day. 

During the last 2 years, I become more and more interested in computer programming. At my current job, The field that I like the most is the programming one. I enjoy writing code and think about various algorithms. That passion drove me to think about a master's degree in CS.  In order to start a master's degree in CS, I have to complete some mandatory CS courses, so I went for it and started to take relevant CS courses through the Open University of Israel which allows me to work fulltime and meanwhile study academic courses. 

I will not lie-I am attracted to CS not only because I found it an interesting field, but also because of the money issue. unlike in the US, AE and ME are relatively lowly paid, In contrast to  CS major's which earn much higher salaries (Almost like their colleagues at the US).  

Nowadays I am in a kind of a junction in my life, I do enjoy working as an engineer, but I think that I will be even more satisfied as a Software Engineer.  By now I am not considering leaving my job and search for a software position, but later, after the completion of essential CS courses, maybe it will be a good idea to look for an intern position in order to have a foot-step at the tech-industry? 

I will be glad to hear your thoughts about my story.

Thanks a lot for advance."

so I've been struggling with a career / life decision which I'd like some advice on:

I (24m) was always good in school and would have had no issues (intellectual, formal, or financial) to study basically any subject I would have liked. I ended up doing a B.A. in Politics and Public Administration in a rather abstract desire to understand the world better and to stick with a more or less interdisciplinary subject area. After finishing my BA in 2018 I struggled to commit to any next steps, let most Master's application deadlines pass, and just ended up doing an internship to get a better grasp of what I want to do. I got an internship with a major e-commerce company and just signed my second follow-up contract as a project manager for special projects. Considering my age and work experience,  I enjoy surprising seniority in this job, managing a 10+ person team and projects with million-dollar budgets. While I am on a one-year contract right now, getting a permanent one is just a matter of time. All in all: This is the type of job and company, based on which you can start a family etc.

I've been with this company for two years now in total, time is rushing by, and I am getting more and more sure that I would like to learn about and do something different - probably in the area of computer science or biotechnology. I am really interested in this area privately, and if I had to choose a course of study again for my 18yo self, I would have been something along these lines. The two pain points are: I am 100% sure that this is where the future of humanity will be and I would like to be part of that. Might be a little native but what can you do.  Second, my current career seems bland and lacks an intellectual challenge. Most problems are organizational or social and thus solved through harder work, social skills, and planning instead of creating anything meaningful or sustainable.

This is why I thought about making a switch in this direction. It's not yet 'too late' at 24 + I have the personal funds required, and it would likely not be a practical issue to be admitted into a Bachelor's Degree leading me down e.g. the Bio-Informatics path.

On the other hand, I've been super lucky with my career. In my current company, I work with the German leadership team, have a high-responsibility supervisor role at my age etc. It would not only feel like throwing away something good but a once-in-at-least-a-couple-thousand opportunity.

I've been thinking about this back and forth and am not sure how to come to a decision, or whether there is a good middle way.

At the same time, as time passes, not making a decision is a decision as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think folks? Hit me with your hot takes, tell me that I am a privileged wimp to even worry about this (lol), or give some advice if you feel like it. Cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I regret not going for a comp sci / biotech career. Now I'm wondering whether I should give up a great business job to start over from scratch in a new field.

Also, if I did see a jbo in another state it was for a PT aide that paid only 8 an hour. I couldn't be a Physical therapy assistant because I had to have the license from an associates program, and my only other option was to go back to Physical Therapy doctorate school for 3 more years schooling and 80000 dollars of debt. The salary is around 70 to 80k, but I thought the debt and years of not working would have set me back, so I worked as a firefighter for a few years.

Then this year I decided to switch my career to IT. I got 5 certifications already. My first job I got at help desk making 14 an hour has been going so so, and I feel there isn't much progression at this company, but I'm mainly doing this job to have some experience for my resume. I'm now debating going back for a bachelors in IT. But, sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, my only other option would have been to go back to physical therapy school which would have been a lot cheaper than PT school, but the salary would have reached a glass ceiling around 40 to 50k, and I hear a lot of horror stories about decreasing APTA reimbursement, long hours of increasing documentation, and when I did my internships the job was a lot more boring than I thought and it mainly consisted of documentation. IT has its downsides too like nitpicky help desk call center scripts, constantly paying for certifications, and constantly learning new coding etc.

Overall tho what is a better career between information technology(system administration, business analyst, network admin) or Physical therapy assistant?"

\-i'm good with python and java , i've worked on a few projects with both of them before (with python it's mostly scripts).

\-i'm also interested in cloud computing ,i'm not sure what certifications to go for but for now i'm on their different learning platforms til i make up my mind.

\-for OS i have my RHCSA.

\-i had 2 internships one devops and the other networking.

right now i'm so confused on where to go from here.long term i see myself in a cloud solution architect type role. i'm very business oriented so that's what drew me to it.

i get that's not an entry level role but i have no idea what's the best path to take in order to get there.

from where i am i feel like i can go in so many directions (sys admin , support engineer, network engineer, SRE,cloud engineer,automation,devops....)

I've found myself lost in terms of career. Right now, I'm a international student, junior year at XYZ University (US). These are the courses I've taken as a cs major (GPA 3.95):      

Intro to Prog with Python, Computer Architecture, Php App Development, Java Programming, Databases, Data Modeling and Warehousing, C++ Programming, JavaScript, User Centered Design, O-O Sys Analysis &amp; Design, Big Data &amp; Visualization 

I understand basic concepts of OOP and programming and can relatively program proficiently in python/java. My university does not have Algo and DS classes so that sucked, and learning it through coursera and MIT OpenCourseWare. I work 60 hours a week at a pizza shop to make enough money to pay for rent and college since pandemic resulted in loss of family income and rest of the time, I spend learning (glad this semester is totally online). I also solve CS questions as a CourseHero Tutor if I even have 10 minutes free to make an extra buck. I find myself mostly depressed and I realized I have no time to socialize or network with people in the industry!

I'm literally on the applying application spree for internship for coming summer. Yet, I feel lost. I do not know what a real software engineering job looks like! Neither a particular path to follow. I love backend, mostly dealing with APIs and databases. Looking at the Job Description (even for an intern), literally scares the heck out of me with all the technical terms and frameworks.

iom3dd,1,2020-09-07,Want to go back to school to get a (Stanford) Masters,anticensorship07,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/iom3dd/want_to_go_back_to_school_to_get_a_stanford/,"Had a very non traditional route -&gt;govt-&gt;specialized consulting

not stanford affiliated in anyway but wanted to apply to the ms there. if not this year in the future. I want to work for a company where tech is the core of my day to day activity instead of in finance/insurance like I am right now as a consultant. I generally like programming and stats and am thinking of taking an NDO to prepare for t hat.

1. out of curiosity what are the highest acceptance rates from what people have heard for stanford masters? I imagine there aint much difference but i thought i'd ask in case there may be some programs that might have a reasonable acceptance rate and are reachable. My interests include economics, finance, near eastern languages, and cs.
2. if I don't have research experience (did premed research for a year in undergrad and had a capstone for another masters I did). Work in NYC. How can I possibly get a remote research position at Stanford? A lot of the CS specialities aren’t really strong here in the NYC area. I am not a student currently and have been working, which seems atypical for research positions.
3. Taking NDO courses seems to be risky, as there isn’t much pay off or guarantee as far as Masters admissions. Took Calc in a T10 undergrad. Haven’t really taken done linear algebra which is a requirement for the MSEng. Should I jump into Math52? It’s difficult because you can go two or three elvels  into preqrequisites based on stanfords class listing requirement. The Stanford counselors don’t seem helpful in this regard in helping you choose courses and just refer you to the ‘pre-requisites’ which for programs like MSCS aren’t clear.

So if you can see my dilemma: on one hand Math52 is a pre-req to a program I’m interested in and yet I like other courses such as those that can help me in interviewing (data structures algorithms 106A

) or jobs (ie networking). So which NDO courses should I take pre-reqs or something just to prove my chops? Should I take one or two just to get a good grade and prove I have the chops?

4) How do on campus recruiting and summer internships work with these part time and online degrees? Are you eligible for internships at top companies? Can you show up on campus for recruiting?"

How can one say they are 'proficient'? or what does 'x month of experience with java' mean? like how is that measured? I know some basics just like i know english. I don't know some good programming or good design just like how i don't know all the best english words or best articulation skills.

I understand that you should just apply since the its the recruiters job but I had this impression that you have to been at least one language and you are limited to jobs that look for students using those language. but then I also wondered how one would know good design or best practice if they have no experience? just from doing a bunch of tutorials? going to more other schools and courses? how do you break the need job for experience but need experience for job loop? and if you somehow get a position, how can you not look bad? I mean i know some (unfortunately) companies recognize that as  a student you don't know how things work in their environment and are there to learn.

I graduated from University Fall 2019 with a BS in Computer Science. Despite graduating, I was a pretty shit student, and have a lot of catching up to do in order to get a halfway decent CS related job (never had an internship or anything). Mostly pissed my last 9 months on games and web surfing. Guess you can call it a gap year if you want to be generous, but I know I need to get serious w/ my studies if I want to move forward in life.

I was accepted into a quality online coding bootcamp earlier this year, but delayed (twice) mostly due to procrastination, as well as COVID/anxiety/some caregiving for grandma for the past 6 months. Been meaning to hone the necessary skills for a career in Data Science (Python, Jupyter, etc.), but keep putting it off. Looking to hold myself accountable now, and do the necessary work. The bootcamp starts in 2 weeks, and I may be able to still do the prep work needed if I cram. It's a job training program, so I don't need to be an expert, but I do need to be capable.

However, I just found out over the weekend my grandmother needs a new caretaker (she want family to take care of her, but her needs are becoming pretty heavy), and I have to decide whether to travel 1000 miles w/ my dad to be with her for at least 1 week, and if I do, how to proceed with my training/studies. I'm hope to see her before it's too late (she's been in hospice care for ALS at her trailer since June), but my dad is asking me to stay and finally do my online program. But really, I do have the ability to decide what to do. If I do delay, I can still start the 3 month job training in earnest in January 2021. Need to decide travel plans by Wednesday evening. Any way, I hope to push myself like I never have before to become a successful, independent, human being.

TLDR: Need to decide whether to stick to current plan and pursue training in Data Science 2 weeks from now, or travel for grandma and delay the program until January. Either way, I need to be more serious about coding and my future career. Been posting to other subreddits for advice, feel free to tell me about other relevant subs"

I see various ""Continuing Education"" programs brought upon by Trilogy Education Services at UC's like UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, and etc. Based off only opinions and not actual reviews from people that attended the programs (Limited resources) is that it may not be worth the time and it is definitely not worth the money. Basically people would say it is much more worth it to spend money in PluralSight? courses and simply chasing certifications like Security+, CEH, and Network+. I also see that there are programs at schools such as CSULB and I am open to exploring that too. I had originally planned to take a six month program at UC Irvine, find an internship during or near the end of that time frame, and explore and get a feel for the field while there regardless of how useless it is.

My concern is that, as someone with very limited experience in the field, getting my foot in the door with something like a program would be much more practical than self studying for a unknown number of months not knowing exactly what I am doing. Even if I did eventually pass the certifications, it would be hard to find a job given that I wasn't able to find an internship at a company since I was not involved in any program.

My cousin works in cyber security at a bigger company, for the blue defensive networking team and has verified with me that he does not know anyone that employed that has done a cyber security bootcamp. He says he only knows people that have gotten their masters in computer science or cyber security, working with him, so this adds more to my suspicions on whether it's worth it or not.

Does anyone have any specific suggestions as to how to approach this career change? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Would my best bet be to try and make it into a masters program at some university and to move forward from there, or is there a less time consuming and money consuming decision that is just as little risk-averse? Possibly a boot camp not affiliated with a school since having UCLA or UCI to back the program does not actually mean anything?"

I'm currently in my last year of masters in electrical engineering and management (focus on communication engineering and obviously management) at a german university and am considering getting into data science, data analytics or even software engineering. I've picked up the basic concepts in C, C++ at the very beginning of my studies. Also I'm currently working on two projects, heavily relying on machine learning libraries in python, as part of my masters programming. Just recently I try to familiarise myself with the terminal (Ubuntu) and tools like git. Even though I've acquired some knowledge in programming, I still feel a bit anxious when i read about all the skills necessary for data science or even SE-positions. I got no SQL or Interviewing skills yet for example. Atm Im looking for internship or working student positions in data science, but haven't succeeded yet. I've still got 1 year of study left and thus some time to pick up important skills. What would you do till graduation? 

On what would you focus, if you were having some programming/engineering knowledge and still 1 year left till graduation? What skills would you brush up?

Thanks for your answers!"

Backstory: my (20F) sister (23F) has been living in another country for 4 years. Two years ago she started studying at the University. 


Her 5th semester (from August 2020 to January 2021) is reserved for stage or internships (she's obligated).
She has always desired to do an international internships with the duration of 6 months. At first she thought about going to South Africa, but her university didn't approve it, therefore they wouldn't give her financial assistance. So she paid a private agency to find her another suitable place. 

They offered her an intership in Australia. The university did approve the intership. She had to go in August, but because of the Pandemic and the  fact that Australia's borders are closed she had to pay again the agency to find an internship elsewhere.
They offered her to go to England or to Valencia. She wanted to go to London, but, again, her university didn't approve it. 
So now she will go to Valencia. She has already the contract with the agency and the 15th of this month she will travel to Valencia.

The problem is that the university will tell her this week if they approve the internship. As the situation in Spain is getting worse, me and my parents are afraid the university will not approve the internship.

She is very sensitive about this topic and she was really hyped abot going in another country. But now she's only stressed, because every option she had was declined and if also the approval of the internship in Valencia is going to end well. I don't  know how she'll react. She spent thousands of euros for the agency and she has made a tons of emails and documentation to approve all of the internship. She put in a lot of work.

What can I do or what can I tell her if also this time the internship is not approved? I want to be prepared and to know what to do to if she can't go to Valencia.

Any suggestions would be SO much appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with a BS in cybersecurity and information assurance about 3 months ago, I have about 1 year of data center experience and am denied for every job application I apply for. I've been told that my resume is pretty good by the resume help center at my university, however I think it might be my actual experience that's the issue. I was never able to land any internships (denied from all of those as well) and now that I'm out of school I cant find internship opportunities (paid since I cant afford unpaid). I've been looking for opportunities to volunteer for job experience but the only volunteer opportunities I can find don't provide any on the job experience (presenting cybersecurity to students etc). I've tried networking as much as I can in my area but I'm not seeing anything much, will be saving money to try and network at larger conferences as soon as I can find some that may be helpful here in. Due to family and health reasons I cannot just get up and leave to another area so remote or Boise, ID area are my only options.  


I'm very confident about my interview abilities but I just cant seem to get anyone to pay attention to me enough to get the interview and show my true colors.    


My current job contracted as a sort of a network circuit termination technician isn't horrible but I really really want to get myself into a permanent Cybersecurity position even if its the exact same pay because I'm scared that if I don't get in my field soon I'll be looked down upon and will never be able to work my way up the ladder."

[x-post from r/cscareerquestions],Hairy_Noodles,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/iougjl/want_to_make_a_move_from_the_hellscape_that_is/,"Hello everyone,

As the title says, I want to make a move from firmware development into web-dev. I have a lot of anxiety about the move, so I’m hoping that this subreddit can give me some advice and motivation. There's a lot here, so **MASSIVE** thank you in advance if you take the time out of your day to read and answer :)

# My background

I graduated with a 1st class (4.0 gpa) degree in electronic engineering with honours back in 2018. I am currently 26. I worked 1 year as an intern between my 2nd and 3rd year of uni, worked 4 months as an embedded software developer at a startup, and am currently working as an embedded software developer for a larger company. I am miserable at the current job due to a variety of factors including poor social atmosphere, disinterest in the product, lack of guidance or mentoring (I am the only software developer in the company, and my manager does not know C or review my code), lack of progress on project even after 1 year due to management ineptitude and my own depression/apathy, and a disinterest in electronics and embedded systems.

# Current situation

I have come to the slow realisation in the past year that I don’t actually enjoy electronics, embedded systems, and hardware nearly as much as I enjoy the software development. This change in perspective has been accompanied by me losing interest in C (my job's programming language) in favour of more high-level languages such as python and JavaScript. I have admittedly become lazy in my current job, as I’ve already been through a handful of mental breakdowns and find that apathy is my best mental defense until I find a new job.

# Where I want to be

I would like to begin working as a web-developer due to the more interesting nature of the job, as well as the greater creativity (relative to C) offered by JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various frameworks. I simply LOVE how I can create the most beautiful websites and have fun while doing it. While always initially daunting, I enjoy the process of setting up a index.js and letting my imagination run wild with UI/UX designs or staying up until 1am finding a clever way of implementing a solution using JS libraries. I am still blown away by how this almost seems like a superpower, being able to make the coolest apps I can think of whenever the hell I want.

# What I’ve been doing

I have been busy on the Odin project moving along with personal projects. I am halfway through the JS course and have completed 4 projects which I have spend a great deal of time polishing. This has brought my Github portfolio up to 13 projects which also include some simple game development using python and c++, and well as python automation for my main job.

# Questions

Here are the questions I have. I am happy to elaborate on any of them if needed.

* Should I begin a new web-dev job as a junior. I am tempted for a junior position because I believe it will give me more time to learn the basics , incline the company to provide me with a mentor, and allow me a slight breather while I learn the ropes of the new job and working in a team.
* What is it like to work in web-dev, especially as a beginner?
* Will I be frowned upon if I don’t perform as well as my experience would suggest? I’m still relatively new to software development and I feel that my current job as not done me any favours in terms of technical experience. In fact, my C skills have badly degraded since starting due to depression.
* Should I wait until I finish the Odin project, or just jump into a web-dev job asap?
* What will increase my chances of getting a web-dev job?
* Any recommendations on how I can improve?

Thank you everyone for your help, and have an awesome day \^\_\^"

Things I'm learning is testing and how to structure projects, professionally/semi-professionally. Bought a couple books on that, I also bought Knuth's and Skienna's books on Algos for LC and CP.

If you guys have any suggestions, or if you want to join if you're in the same boat as I am. You can comment as well. An internship @ a startup (or better) next year would be nice, if not there's the following year, I'll just focus on what I can control. I'll keep everyone posted as I progress."

Here is the twenty-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

I recently graduated as a Computer Science Engineer. While in college i landed a 2 month internship at a really good company as a software developer. However i had no experience in the same and all the code i had ever written was for concerned with basic data structures and algorithms. As a result i could not complete my work, and missed the ppo.

Later however i managed to get a much more humble job (full time). However, joining has been delayed owing to the covid-19 pandemic.

So i have some time and there are better job openings right now. But given my experience during the above mentioned internship, i just cannot convince myself that, even if i get the job, i will be able to do it.

So do i give myself some more time, and learn software development at my own pace and later apply when i am confident? Or should i apply right now and try to learn along the way, hoping this time i do better?

**Additional Notes:**

* My work history is a little weird because I joined when it was just a small startup (10 people) doing projects for local and regional organizations. We now have 200+ employees and do enterprise work for international corporations as well as have our own SaaS product.
   * Such a wild ride and wide variety of work has given me the privilege of tackling many problems and making significant impacts.
   * I would say ""40+ enterprise projects"", but some of them were small apps for local businesses when we were just starting out. It doesn't feel like building something for Bob's Hardware down the street is ""enterprise"". 
   * Maybe saying ""products"" is better since the app was a deliverable? 
   * I have quite a few bullet points for only one job, but it felt reasonable since it is only one. I tried separating it out into roles (Intern, SE1, SE2, etc) but that didn't work well because many of my impacts overlap a lot; like - I made those 14 libraries and 40+ apps over the entirety of my time at the company. 
* I have 5 years of Swift experience - almost as long as it has existed.
* I'd include my GitHub, but I don't use it much and only have 1 project on it. But it was written in C/C++ which is one of the languages they want. It also makes use of FFT - something I suspect a neurotech company to be interested in. So - it looks lame, but the project is pretty relevant and (IMO) pretty well written for someone with limited C/C++ experience. 
* The ""Technical"" sections feels a bit...silly? Like - it is primarily tools/platforms and other things that I would be expected to know. Maybe I should throw it out and instead have ""Languages &amp; Interests""?
* Should I explicitly say that I left school to accept the job? My parents think that I should not say that (and instead say ""Accepted full time job at XYZ as Junior in standing"") - but that seems to contradict a lot of threads I've read about this."

Dude loves to talk about privilege and is often tone deaf when he tries to be sjw to a woman who is in poverty and escaped a abusive family not too long ago. Of course I would want money because money means food, means clothes, means not having to ask people for money and them all in your business as if you are a kid. 

It means having more options as to where I live. It means being able to perhaps one day be financially independent to the point where I do not have to send resumes, cover letters like a beggar doing this stupid tap dance in hopes I will be be picked over all the other hundreds if not thousands of applicants. I want my own fucking money. And honestly people respect you more. I never was materialist, like I never cared for designer stuff, bare minerals or expensive high end stuff. But having to adult so fast and in such a rough circumstance has made me hunger for it in ways i have not felt before.. cuz I want to be able to eat sleep, dress, eat well without having to cut corners. I want a comfortable life and if that menas having to use capitalism, patriarchy or whatever as a tool to get to a position of power, sovereignty i will do it.   My friend thinks self preservation is bad but I think its necessary because being a martryr there is no glory in destroying oneself for people or a cause that could give two shits about you.

Granted, I live in a community house and I have acess to food us food stamos so im in a much better situation. Got a bulk phone plan paid year in advance. I also bought a cheap bike machine to stay healthy cuz I gaines like 12 pounds during this pandemic.  I keep applying, go to career office. Even applied to groccery stores etc. But to no avail. I hate that whenever I want to do something for my well being whether thats make money, taking time to myself, buy skincare products this guy feels need to make snide remarks about how thats empire, ""white,"" or capitalist. Or how can I be poor or broke.

 Easy. One accident or emergency can wipe my 1800 savings out in a heartbeat. And i highly doubt anyone in this house,  himself included would pay for shoes, coat, medical bills or whatever I need. Not that I expect them to, but point is it seems people are selective in when they want to be ""communal"" i.e food, entitlement to my exercise machine, my time and when they are individualistic: i.e loans I took out to pay rent, clothes are my responsbility as a individual.. but yet my friend said over and over we are not individuals but part of a community of ancestors before us. It is just interesting when people want to be communal and when people do not, yet im criticized as being ""white"", capitialist etc whenever I want ro establish space for myself away from the house and make money, buy things i need for my well being. 

Sorry for this rant, but I just feel so frustrated and unsupported."

In the first week they gave me the chance to learn flexbox and cssgrid. My first task was to make my own grid with these techniques, so I tried to recreate the bootstrap grid. It took me 3 days to do that, but I failed, because i didn't do it correctly because I didn't really understood what the hell I was doing. 

Now I am in my second week and this time they'd let me program animations using React with react-spring and react-pose. There were plenty of examples but I got stuck on one silly thing for almost 2 days

I've worked with React before so i have a little bit of experience, but this time I had to learn new concepts like React Hooks to create the animations. And got stuck again

Starting from next week I'll have to build web applications with React and css grid, but i am confused on the cssgrid concept.

  
When learning new frameworks or libraries there is an overload of information that you have to process. How do you deal with this?

Would appreciate any advice :("

ip2tti,5,2020-09-08,How do I confront my boss about micromanaging?,Meryl_Strep_Throat,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ip2tti/how_do_i_confront_my_boss_about_micromanaging/,"Hi there, new to Reddit (this is my first post, actually). Since I (23F) graduated college last summer, I’ve been working as a videographer/editor at a relatively small tech company for over a year now, but my position title has never changed from “intern” (even though I have never received proper training and was not brought on via the internship program).

The funny thing about all of this is that I’m the only video person the company has ever had (despite having been around for decades and having locations all over the world), so I’ve had to teach myself numerous programs, skills, etc to make up for all their video needs. For the past year, I’ve been told that they were in talks of hiring me as a full-time or permanent employee, but every time they said they’d give me an answer they kept pushing it out and telling me things are really busy so it has to wait. My internship was supposed to only be 6 months long, but here we are.

I’m grateful to have a remote job right now, and for a long time I had a really supportive supervisor who advocated for me often. However, his position was cut at the beginning of the pandemic to save costs. My new supervisor cut my hours (I signed something that said I could work 20-40hrs a week and spent most of my first year working full-time, of course the document I signed regarding these specific hours or the email it was discussed in are nowhere to be found) and told me I’m actually a part time, temporary employee when she had HR check the system. I had to rope HR in myself because she initially claimed I do not get benefits at all even though I have been receiving partial benefits as a part of my contract this whole time. She also told me that there will never be a full-time or permanent video position at the company, despite what my past supervisor and one of the executives I work closely with led me to believe.

My new supervisor underestimates the amount of time projects will take and questions whether there is actually 20-25hrs of work for me almost every single week. She knows all the projects I’m working on as they are listed on a sheet we both frequently update. I feel like she is suspicious of how I spend my time at work, which is especially frustrating because I’ve been busier than ever since my previous supervisor was laid off. Every day I feel like I have to prove that I’m doing the most, which is negatively affecting my mental (I have anxiety and depression, don’t we all?) and physical health (I don’t even take proper breaks for fear that my boss will think I’m slacking off, thankfully my partner is able to bring me water and meals). 

I’ve developed a trustworthy reputation for my work at the company, so I’m just confused by all this. On top of that, my supervisor knows that I can barely support myself currently as it is (not that that changes anything). How should I word my concerns and frustrations to her, if at all? I’m not sure of any way to do this without sounding rude or like an ungrateful, disgruntled employee. Thank you for reading all of this, sorry if I sound naive."

I've already missed assignments. I'm doing a major in the computer science department that I was really excited about, but my senior year classes feel so difficult. I finally moved into my dorm yesterday, and away from all the friends/support system of my coworkers for the past 5 months. From the stress of not knowing if we were actually coming back or not, moving, being alone (roommates who I love don't move in til this weekend), and feeling like I'm failing in my classes, I'm finally breaking and crying a lot. I feel like I'm not smart enough for these classes, and I'm afraid I won't graduate, and I feel like I wasted my parents' money getting a degree in something I don't even understand/can't even get a job in because I haven't done any internships. It feels like I try to start doing something, and then I'm suddenly doing something else that isn't productive. 

Does anyone have any advice for this? I'm so scared to admit it because I'm afraid my teachers will be upset (because I'm already behind in some of the classes). I'm usually such a bright, bubbly, and optimistic person, but I think the pandemic has taken away some of the parts of college that made it so wonderful (seeing my friends, doing the club I loved, etc.) So now it's just me and this classes that I'm so afraid I'm going to fail. I just feel so ashamed and sad, and I don't know how to handle it (especially because I need to be reading for a quiz tomorrow morning). Thanks for reading this far."

Could I have done better?,ksren,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ip3ubh/fulltime_job_offer_rescinded_after_internship/,"In March 2020, my current employer gave me the opportunity to take on an internship with another organization over the summer.

Excited, I thought I should apply to internships close to my dream career path. I got an interview and at that interview they offered me a full-time position at the end of the internship. They were so impressed that they didn’t interview anyone else and they offered it to me by the end of the day. I was ecstatic.

Then COVID-19 hit. It hit me and my family pretty hard. I was not doing well emotionally and to add to the problem, my dog needed a very costly surgery. I was also helping out with community efforts because, well, I felt like this was the time to be there for each other. All this to say that I was a little distracted over the internship but I completed all my tasks and received positive feedback.

However, a week before the internship ended, I asked about the full-time position. The higher ups said something along the lines of “well, we don’t know you very well”. I was baffled. I thought, well, why didn’t they make an effort to get to know me in these 3 months? I’m not sure how we were supposed to bond over a computer screen since we were working remotely. I tried my best to engage more and make my work more impressive. I received a lot of positive feedback in my last project.

Finally, they said there just wasn’t enough work to go around and that maybe I didn’t seem passionate. I was very heartbroken. If there’s anything I am, it’s passionate. I let them know this and that I was happy to have worked with them anyway. My supervisor at the time even said, if a position opens in the future we’ll definitely let you know. I was doubtful but hopeful.

A month later, I see that exact position open up and I email my old supervisor. I asked about the position and if she would recommend that I apply. No answer.

Now I understand that they were just being nice in saying all of that but why even get my hopes up? I don’t understand what I could’ve done better. I was honest and communicated everything with my supervisor. It feels very cold to be left on that note and I’m grateful that my old job took me back with a raise but I’m feeling a great amount of self-doubt.

Was this my chance to get the job and I just messed it up? I tried my best under the circumstances but was there something I just didn’t do? How do you recover from something you’ve dreamed of being taken away so quickly?"

I currently just received an internship offer for this summer (Dec-Feb in Australia) for a software engineering role at a big telecommunications and tech company - let's call it Company A. The interview process was quite long and I'd say I was proud of how I did throughout.

However, there is another internship I applied for - it's a data science internship (a field I honestly quite prefer over SE hence my major) at a big mining company - let's call it Company B. I just did a phone interview with them the other day and they told me they'd be in touch in a couple of days to let me know whether I passed to the live interview stage.

While Company B is my preferred option, I do already have an offer from Company A, and so if I don't get to the interview stage/get an offer from Company B before I receive Company A's contract, I'm pretty sure I'd be dropping Company B (really disheartening but I'm not really willing to risk it).

Now, assuming the best-case scenario happens and I happen to get an offer from Company B before I get Company A's contract, I'd be very confused on which to choose. I've read that it would be more beneficial to work for tech companies, especially when it comes to CS careers, as the roles tend to be more challenging and you wouldn't be overestimating your skills as you may do in a non-tech company.

Here are some of the pros and cons of each of the roles:

**Company A - SE internship at a telecommunications &amp; tech company:**

Pros:

* tech company,
* more diversity (gender, race, and age group),
* SE role (which I assume is a harder role to get into than DS?)

Cons:

* lower pay (for their graduate program: AU$50-60k/year)
* SE is not my preferred field (but I wouldn't mind doing it anyway)

**Company B - Data Science internship at a mining company:**

Pros:

* data sci role (my preference),
* higher pay (for their graduate program: AU$70-90k/year)

Cons:

* Not a tech company so we wouldn't be making any products
* Not as diverse (seems to consist of mostly white male men aged 30 and above) - I don't mind this, but just kinda worried it may impact on career progression if I happen to get the internship and lucky enough to get a return offer later on

I know I may not even be lucky enough to get to choose if I don't pass Company B's interview, but I just kinda wanted to think about my options now in case I do get through (worried I'd have to decide on the offer on the spot during the phone call).

Any thoughts on which one would be a better option would be appreciated!

TLDR; which one to choose: software engineering internship in a tech company VS data science internship (first preference) in a mining company (if I happen to get an offer for the latter)"

ip8lju,0,2020-09-08,Are there any good books/novels based on finance jobs and their culture?,throwaway99661,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ip8lju/are_there_any_good_booksnovels_based_on_finance/,"When I began to seriously consider medical school, I wanted to *really* understand the reality of the career. Not just the glamorous “Grey’s Anatomy” and “House MD” media portrayal that romanticizes medicine, but the real culture surrounding 80+ hour work weeks and how human beings come undone under the pressure of a high-stress and high-stakes job, all while being expected to act professional amidst the turmoil.

I picked up a fantastic book titled “House of God”, a satirical novel that has been recommended to medical interns for decades because of its painfully accurate portrayal of the life of a doctor exiting medical school and starting work in a hospital.

I decided on a business undergrad over premed, and I’ve been attracted to the coveted positions in finance such as investment banking. The more I network and grow closer to those in the industry, the more I begin to see the little quirks that go on behind the scenes. “We’re closing a $20 million deal tonight!” ... “This whole thing fell apart 3 f***ing times before we got to this point.” “I just spent the past week perfecting this pitch book, and my superiors commended me for the effort!” ... “My senior did half the work and proceeded to take all the credit for this project.”

On the outside looking in, I rarely get a glimpse of these workplace cultures and the funny little scenarios that arise in the culture. I’ve been browsing r/Accounting and r/consulting and would like to say I’ve gotten a decent idea of what the industry tends to look like, but I haven’t had a similar experience browsing financial subreddits or places like WSO (outside of the movies like The Big Short, made for an audience that’s basically OOTL on Wall Street shenanigans). Is there something that I’m missing? I get the sense that IB attracts folks that can sniff out bullshit from a mile away, and that their tolerance for it (amongst team members) is pretty low - so maybe these scenarios are handled quickly, and become less common in the industry.

This is probably a stupid question because I’m looking for exaggerated/romanticized stories of stereotypes which may not accurately represent the industry, but if anyone understands what I’m trying to convey: were there any books, fiction or non-fiction, that portrayed the genuine nature of some finance (or any other business) jobs? Were there any that taught you important lessons relating to these positions? If there’s any recommendations that you’d be willing to make, I would gladly look them up. Thank you for reading."
ip8mno,3,2020-09-08,Need advice on if I should contact my former/future boss!,anon3784920,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ip8mno/need_advice_on_if_i_should_contact_my/,"Background - I had an internship return offer rescinded due to COVID, and my boss (who I had a great relationship with) told me that they’ll reach out to me when they can hire me again but also that they don’t know the exact timeline of when (6 months, 1 year). They recommended I take some courses in the interim to be better at my role once I get hired.

My goal since then was to land a full time role, then reach out to my former boss to see if they’d be willing to hire me. However currently I’m very close to landing a part time role (~20 hours a week) which will enable me to work and take the courses. And given the ecosystem with covid it’s very hard to find new grad roles. 

Should I reach out to my boss updating them on my part time role or still wait till I find a full time role (which I’m still actively looking and interviewing for)??

ipa723,4,2020-09-09,Fantastic GPU development skills and where to find them?,openglasker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ipa723/fantastic_gpu_development_skills_and_where_to/,"(The first 2 paragraphs are just background, you can just skip)

So I've just finished my 3-year degree in IT (French-linked university) + 1st year in Master.

However, my bachelor degree feels really generic: first year is full of generic subjects like physics/chemistry/biology (and math of courses). On 2nd and 3rd year there're the standard courses like OOP, basic algorithms, software engineering, etc. There're a few more specific topics, such as Intro to ML, Image processing with OpenCV python, and basic OpenGL. But there's zero advanced topic, everything feels like it's just introductory, the projects are narrow..  If I were given a real project I think I would get lost immediately (unless it's on Google). The only ""advanced"" project I think of is NLP entity detection - the internship topic that I was given.

Academically, I'm doing fine. The university gave me a free Bachelor (normal tuition fee is high), and currently a free Master with 1-2 scientific papers in Q2 journal; the university encouraged me to go for salaried PhD position. But when I read job descriptions outside academic, I feel completely lost because I barely tick enough boxes (unless the position is fresher, which is understandable). Now I'm really hesitant about going PhD for fearing I would over-specialize myself out of most positions, and waste valuable 3 years. At this point I'm even considering to defer the 2nd year of Master to get more work-experience first.

The only things I'm confident in right now is OOP, programming logic, algorithms and data structures with C/C++, a bit of computer architecture, and a bit of Python ML. I have little experience in network/UI. For examples, the papers I have were about increasing FPS of a filter, one using just CPU and the other using CUDA (all in C++, it's just 2D prefix sum). In another case I had to rewrite sort() in C89 for a library, which is 2x faster than qsort() and 20% faster than std::sort(), at worse. Dynamic programming, graph problems, trees, (on Leetcode, Codeforce, ...), those things I can understand and do well.

I did (and still doing) a few ML side projects in image processing, but I feel like I'm late on the overcrowded ML/AI boat so I wish to focus on something else. I'm thinking about focusing on low-level such as driver, and having image processing skills as an extra. At the moment I'm learning CUDA, but I have no knowledge of OpenGL/DirectX.

So what skill should I focus on next if I wish to apply (internship at least) to Nvidia, for example? The few that I can think of are extra linear algebra, OpenGL, and assembly. But I really wish to hear opinions from the industry.  Thank you."
ipagpg,25,2020-09-09,All you youngsters looking for jobs,The_other_lurker,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ipagpg/all_you_youngsters_looking_for_jobs/,"I know many of you will not understand this, or think that I'm just an old codger, or am simply too removed from 'job hunting' to offer good advice. But, lets have a go and see if anyone finds value in my words.

I'm probably older than many of you, but I frequent this board because I like to offer helpful advice (at least I think so).

I understand that many of you graduates are still trying to fathom the enormity of the circumstances, the huge uncertainties you face, becoming financially exposed and potentially at a severe disadvantage in your first workplace- and it certainly doesn't help that there seems to be unusually significant requirements for seemingly entry level positions (not to mention those horrible internship positions that seem to want multiple years' experience).

So lets back up a bit.

Lets first revisit some ""knowns"" - I call them knowns because no matter what year you were born, and no matter where you're from, or what you do, they still apply. They are:

1. you get work when you're in the right place, at the right time, and you're ready to work
2. it's not what you know, it's who you know

These two axioms define every. single. transaction. in the job market. If you do not believe me, consider any situation, then break it down into the most fundamental format of supply and demand (you have labour, someone needs labour, they have money, you need money, you do work when work is available, you get paid - and this of course, is governed by the relationship of who you know, you know your boss, he likes you enough not to fire you, your boss has a similar relationship with his/her boss, until somewhere in that chain is the person who pays you). If you think it doesn't apply to online applications, trust me, they do, it's just that if you submit an online application you are essentially submitting to being placed in an electronic queue, where, if you finally do make it to the front of the line (note axiom 1), you'll finally meet with someone (note axiom 2).

In ""looking for a job"" many of you, I'm afraid, are trying to bypass the axioms that govern opportunity. I read the evidence of it.

I see people, day in, and day out complain about the difficulties in finding work - not meaningful work, not good jobs, just... 'jobs'.

So, how do you, as a young person with few connections and little experience leverage these axioms?

Here is where we start...

Part 1: Leverage your relationships. In order to leverage your relationship, you must understand and be able to quantify the potential. Here is an example: My aunt is a lawyer. If you have not gone to law school, your aunt can do NOTHING for you. There is potential, but it's out of your league. Next up: your best friend works at Maccas. If you don't want to work at Maccas, then again, the potential is zero. So lets expand the group, start considering extended family, friends, neighbours, professors. Basically, the idea here is to start building your network. A lot of complaints seem to be related to inability to generate or develop a network, because people think they don't know anyone in the positions that can help them. But don't let that stop you. Instead of just assuming people aren't in the positions that can help you, start a conversation. Talk with your mum about work, talk with your neighbour about what they do. You will quickly find that reactions will vary from surprise that you are interested in the subject, to positive reinforcement and a desire to help.

Grow and maintain your network by revisiting your peers.

Why do we do this? Your network is composed of people, lets call them nodes. When you have a nicely operating network, each of your people/nodes will be considering your welfare, this multiplies your exposure to potential opportunities.

Part 2 is how to leverage willingness, or being in the right place at the right time. Many people don't understand just how powerful this is, but here are some personal experiences to help provide some context:

* I was visiting a friend working in an upscale restaurant bar, the GM approached me and said he needed staff for this weekend. I started bussing tables that weekend
* I spoke to a woman at a conference who turned out to be the president of a local company, I mentioned what I was interested in doing, and she identified that my skillset would help her colleague (super value network node!) and I drafted a proposal, and got my final year of school paid for and a small salary to boot to do a study for a local company
* when I was nearing graduation, I spoke to my fellow graduating mates and asked who they wanted to work for (or already acquired jobs with), I looked into each company, chose one, mentioned I'd be applying and instead of going through the online application procedure, I requested HR contacts and arranged an interview (then brought in CV etc.) - I got that job as well

The point here (could be perceived that networks get you jobs, but that's not my point), is that presenting at the right time may generate opportunities that you wouldn't otherwise see.

There are millions, if not billions of cases of people finding work simply because they are in the right place at the right time. Submitting online applications for a position is an unusually predatory artifact of companies trying to develop a pool of critical skills from which to draw, but this means, implicitly that the skill pool is languishing, unused until drawn on. Your skills, your smile, your ability to do something useful is lost in email trails and digital hoops. So, my advice is this:

1. Remember the axioms of job hunting
2. If you're having trouble building your network, start small, and grow organically


Growing organically means that you should, in all cases, do that which is easiest FIRST: you don't like talking to your uncle? don't talk to your uncle. You like talking to your mom? talk to your mom. You like drawing unicorns and rainbows? talk to your mate who likes drawing unicorns with puddles. The point is, all people, ALL contacts are nodes in your network, and sometimes even a small network of invested people will yield big dividends because they really know you - you draw fat unicorns and rainbows, duh. And they know you aren't interested in selling valve actuators to oil refineries in texas.

Good luck my unicorn drawing bros and gals."

ipb9ub,5,2020-09-09,Where should I apply to transfer?,ghghghghg12,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ipb9ub/where_should_i_apply_to_transfer/,"Hello! 

I am currently a freshman honors student at Tulane. It’s okay here, but I don’t really think it’s my vibe and I’m looking for recommendations as to where to apply as a transfer.

Last year when I went through the college process, I didn’t have the right mindset about college applications. I was hyper-fixated on prestige over fit, and as a result my yield was not what I had wanted. I was waitlisted by many of my top choices and never made it off the list, so now I am going to one of my safety schools. 

The problem is the school I’m at now I mostly applied to because I knew I could get in, and even some of the schools I got waitlisted at I only applied to because I knew they were good schools. 

I’m looking for schools to apply as a transfer, but this time I really want it to be about fit, so I thought I would ask the ATC community for a little help!


Below is some information about my preferences and the type of person I am. I know this feels very extensive and grossly “want-y” and strangely specific, but I think one of the problems I had during my first college search was that I was so busy trying to ignore what I wanted in favor of what I thought others would like more, I didn’t really know what I was looking for and ended up applying to a big hodgepodge of random schools. This list by no means needs to be completely checked off, but I feel like it actually represents my goals/dreams rather than US News’ values.

I’m an extremely outdoorsy person who loves getting out in nature, making art/crafting, and talking philosophy. I like to read and I love being surrounded by creative people who like bringing intellectual conversation into the everyday and outside of the classroom. I’m by no means against partying, but I prefer for there to be other opportunities for fun too (not an over-reliance on alcohol).

Academically, I am interested in studying Public Health and Psychology on the Pre-Med track. I feel pretty confident in this. I am also interested in pursuing a minor in Gender/Women’s Studies, Philosophy, Literature, or Spanish but am yet to decide. In an ideal world, I would like to study abroad at some point, but I’m not sure how realistic that thought is in today’s era. I love working with kids and I want to be a pediatrician or an occupational therapist!

I’ve always lived in a city, but I wouldn’t be opposed to a more rural location so long as there was access to a population for service activities, community engagement, and hospital internships. I would want a large-ish town at least to be able to explore and hang around in.

I prefer close relationships with my professors but that could be because that’s all I’ve ever known, so maybe a big school could be cool too. I also plan on rushing for a sorority but I am not super dedicated to this and am mostly doing it out of respect for family tradition (I figure worse comes to worst I’ll just drop).

I’m a pretty social person and would love to be in a place where I could meet people who’re passionate about a variety of issues and are unique but equally dedicated.

Additional pluses would be mountains and pretty sunsets and an easy going crowd. This felt very odd to write and I’m sorry it’s just a big list of wants but thank you for reading and I hope you have a great day!

Also, as an addendum, I was waitlisted at UVA, Georgetown, and Middlebury. While I didn’t apply last year, I greatly regret not submitting an app for one of the Claremont consortium and if anyone has any recommendations as to a school within it that they think I would do well in I would love to hear it!

SAT: 1560 HS GPA: 4.2. I was in many clubs in which I held a leadership position and am already pretty involved on Tulane’s campus.

Finally, I just want to say I’m not letting this thought ruin my freshman year. Im giving Tulane a fair shake for the year and I’ll determine how I feel in a few months. I’m still getting out there and meeting new people, I just feel like the community I’m looking for could be more prevalent elsewhere. Thanks in advance!"

&amp;#x200B;

I could use some feedback on the path I'm headed right now. I graduated college 2 years ago, but never landed a real job because of the whole ""we want candidates with experience for this entry level job"" trope. It's so bullshit but I'm over it now, been working min. wage here and there and blessed to have parents support me financially.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm studying for GRE in hopes of getting into a grad school, but for a degree in IT. My one and only internship was related to IT, and I figured this is the only way I can pivot toward a different degree that was still in align with the work I've done so far(not completely starting over). Basically, my elimination method was

&amp;#x200B;

1. jobs relating to my bachelor's will never hire me due to lack of relevant work experience(legit can't make it through the first rounds of interviews). I've tried for 2 years, and every year I'm just getting more and more behind due to newer, younger, and more qualified graduates coming in the work field.
2. Jobs relating to IT won't hire me soley based off of my internship experience when there are indefinite amount of candidates with stronger internship experience and a related bachelor's to back up with.(Also it's been 3 years since the internship was completed and I haven't done anything related to it since...)

Which ultimately leaves me with working min. wage jobs forever(can't fucking make a living without sacrificing a lot), or going to grad school for IT. I realize you only go to grad school when you have a special field you're interested in, but I thoroughly enjoyed general IT work I did at my internship so I feel as long as I find the right field, I'll actually get a lot out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't even thought about the tuition costs and what schools/programs I would even have a good chance for, been just studying for GRE. If I could have some feedback on this path I've chosen, I would appreciate it."

I had a job last year that was kind of an IT job, but it was basically a forms analyst and just putting information on forms. I haven't actually had a legit IT job. I had a tech support job that I had a few months ago, but it lasted a few months. They let me go because their minimum wage was lower than my state so they couldn't pay me. I have no experience. I've been looking on job sites and a lot of the jobs require experience. I look everyday on different job sites. I've applied to about 165 jobs and I can't even get an offer for an interview. The new jobs that pop up require experience, I apply to them anyway to see if I get lucky, but never usually do. I've taken a lot of IT courses at my university and done a lot of projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have them listed on my resume, but they aren't good enough. I've looked for IT internships, but literally all of them require the person to be in school still so i'm not eligible for them. I've looked for IT volunteer work, but again, they require experience. I'm aware that to get experience, you need experience. So I was wondering what would be the best way to get experience in order to land a job.

&amp;#x200B;

 I know certifications are one option, but I don't think employers would solely rely on someone that has certifications and no experience, its good as a supplement to experience. Its kind of dumb that the ""entry level"" jobs need experience. I've looked at the basic help desk and tech support jobs, they need at least 1 year required experience. I'm networking, but no one really has any entry level positions available. Its hard to get my foot in the door. Thank you for the help."

Ever since I was a little girl I want to be a bank manager.. that's why I persuaded Accounting in high school.. n can join a bachelor's degree in Accounting now even.. but my mother wont agree .. when I bought it up she said that .. we work so hard for you to get here.. you have to finish your teaching degree next year after you finish your internship..... but my internship will end in march 2021 and I want to study Accounting.... but I am afraid if I bought it up with mom she is going to be heartbroken and angry... what should I do????

(I also don't have my BS yet because I need an internship for my capstone).  I've been trying to apply to internships to learn how programming or data scientist stuff is done or whatever.  I think I didn't do enough to get myself into a mind set that promotes just cranking out code or trivial day to day things.  If i'm not making sense this is what I'm trying to get it at.

I'm looking for a full time job in some sort of CS field.  My main goal with it is to do something in backend (servers, databases, just something that doesn't require artistic website designing) and I am paralyzed when I try to start learning something or try to start coding a single line.   Should I do one of those programs where they lock you into 2 year contract with a random S&amp;F 500 company?  Any other recommendations?  I'm kinda on my last leg with Co-vid and everything."
ipilsd,776,2020-09-09,A year ago I was fired for my adhd tendencies. And yesterday I got offered and amazing job for my adhd tendencies,Otroyan,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ipilsd/a_year_ago_i_was_fired_for_my_adhd_tendencies_and/,"In November it will be a year since I was fired from my shitty job as a receptionist. I took that position because they promised I would get to do a lot more then sit at a desk and be bored. But when I asked for more things to do my management started to talk about letting me go (to a trusted co worker). Then I stoped asking for more to do, stoped paying attention, and ended up giving them a reason to fire me. 

It really hurt my ego to feel like I failed at a job that every one thought was stupid easy. I questioned myself and my strengths and still to this day feel less confidant from that stupid job. 

Well it turns out stupid easy is not what I’m good at. I need to have a lot of things to take over my attention and keep me focused. 

I very very fortunate to get a position as an intern at a small company doing marketing. I had no experience and was still questioning who I was as a person. But they took a chance on me anyway. 

In this small company I was about to try out a bunch of different projects and roles in marketing (wear many hats as they say) and had an amazing and supportive team along the way. I was making next to nothing for a while, as they were on a hiring freeze until the company turned a profit, but it was worth it to work with such an amazing team. 

Next thing I know, we are bought out by a very well known and exciting company. I was taken on as an intern during the acquisition, making the same shit wage.  But post acquisition my whole team worked together to get my a full time position on their team with this amazing company.  I have never felt so wanted and so successful in my whole life. 

I signed a contract yesterday for a salary I never thought I would see before I was 35. As me and my partner were celebrating, he said to me “you know, you’re ADHD makes you incapable of dealing with bullshit, which is why you lost your last job, but it is also what made you the perfect person for this role”

Needless to say, I cried tears of joy. 

TLDR: got fired for asking for more to do, got an ever better job for the exact same reason. Your scattered mind is what can make you amazing. Don’t try to fix it. Embrace it and use it to your advantage ✊"

Although I have a year of experience, the firm where I did my internship didn't provide with a mentor so I couldn't have my doubts cleared, had google but reaching the company standard lacked that knowledge from google. 

By the end of 1 year tenure, i had to complete a project before I left, throughout the project, my code was never reviewed not once, at the end I was told that my code isn't at all professional and is very college level. 

I did complete the project, my boss created a folder structure and I did all the other implementations.

As the project came to an end, i asked to discontinue my tenure because not only did I give my one year in the name of experience in total stress with underpaying salary but I was left with a staggered confidence of whether I'd be able to code? That I'm not as up to the level as my peers.

I do agree my logic based side is weak, but I  get it done. I left my job in May, trying to start applying for jobs again but I'm too scared that I'm not good enough of a programmer.

Does it get better along the way? What can I do to be better ?

I’ve decided to pivot to IT. I started studying for the sec+ test, and was ready to book it, but wanted to see if anyone has prior experience similar to mine, and the route they took.

The first is, on paper, am I good enough?


• Going into 2nd year now.

• Russel Group Uni, predicted 1st.

• Going todo MSc at either the uni I am at or apply to oxbridge

• 1st year internship @ Netcraft (popular for imperial UGs)

• 2nd year internship @ Morgan Stanley (2021 summer)

• Hackathon awards, personal projects and all that.

• Been practicing leetcode for a week now and can do leetcode medium reasonably well, hopefully my progress will continue

• Spring week @ Morgan Stanley and Citadel

Another question is when should I apply?


I have signed on for Morgan Stanley next summer but was planning on applying anyway to Citadel this cycle. Does citadel emea usually accept 2nd years? Or do they expect 3rd years to apply?  I say this because most people on the Citadel spring week were 2nd year students where as I was a 1st year.

Finally, salary?

What do interns and then compsci grads earn at Citadel?

What other companies do you think I would have a shot at? Google, Palantir etc ?

When I arrived at my university as a freshman I felt invincible, like I was about to embark on some journey that would create some amazing career for me. I started out as a pre-med student planning on majoring in biology. Throughout freshman and sophomore year I had all of these doubts about whether or not I was a good enough student to get in to med school. I had these fears that I would be back with my parents at home after I graduated with no job and rejection letters from med schools. I was and A and B student but somehow the pre-med culture and this idea that the biology degree meant nothing after I graduated made me switch to something safer. I am now an information science major only because I thought it was a safe option. However, I have no interest in having a career that is centered around computers. 

Its hard for me to get excited about software development and just about anything in the corporate world. Science and art have always been the most interesting subjects to me. I am now committed to this major and it’s probably too late for me too finish the medical school prerequisites or get a degree in a field I would enjoy more. 

I feel like I haven’t been true or honest with myself about what I enjoy and find interesting. I’m now at the point where I need to look for internships and work opportunities related to my major. It sucks looking at the internships (IT, data analysis...)  and not being excited or interested enough to apply to them.

I love learning about science more than just about anything and I feel that I have lost my opportunity to find a career in a science related field."

My major is kind of niche and not one that is easy to explain to employers but I truly enjoyed it and I think I learned a lot of tools and skills that I could apply to a job. The closest thing I could relate it to would be systems engineering/environmental science. I had above a 3.0 GPA and a few extracurriculars but none to write home about.

I know that because of COVID the market has been dry but there are still companies hiring and I’ve applied to probably upwards of 40 positions in the past month and have only gotten a response from one (it was a rejection). I’m lucky enough to be in a position where I have a job right now and am making good money, but I’m miserable at work and I just can’t help but feel like the grass is greener on the other side.

I’ve tried leveraging my IT skills with companies but they still seem uninterested. Are there any avenues that I should try or any general career advice those with experience can give me?

I heard that most of the courses in Germany do not really assign projects or homeworks is this the case with CS courses as well? If anyone has studied in TUM can they suggest any top courses in the program? By a top course, I mean great course content, the professor is great at teaching and has a deep research in the subject etc. Another thing is working while studying, do the students of TUM get recruited for internships or part-time works by the top tech firms(Amazon, Intel, Google, Apple etc.) at Munich? I would be greatful if anyone can help."
ipqkes,0,2020-09-09,Is an Internship a Ticket out of College,SnooSquirrels2156,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ipqkes/is_an_internship_a_ticket_out_of_college/,"Hello reddit.  I'm posting to CS career questions because right now, I don't know where college is going.  A lot of stuff here in my computer science degree program is not relevant to the kind of work I want to do afterwards.  I would like to do data analysis.  I have just one more semester after this one.

If I get an internship with relevant work experience, would that be a potential ""ticket out of college and into this workforce""?  I know a lot of employers in this industry care more to look for what I can do than see a degree.

Please let me know what you think."

The pot of gold you're picturing at &lt;Your favorite FAANG&gt; won't last forever, so don't break yourself getting there or feel worthless if you don't reach it!**

I'm pretty new to this sub, so this may have been talked about before, but after reading people's posts on here I felt compelled to write about this topic. Whether you're still in the midst of college or if you're like me and working on finding a full-time job, the CS rat race isn't everything it's hyped up to be. It can be really easy to think from reading this sub that there are 0 jobs available and that if you're not leetcoding 24/7 to land a job at a FAANG you're gonna be homeless. This is NOT TRUE! If you're studying computer science, you have a foundation for one of the most important skills for the rest of history: working with computers. There *is* life outside the FAANGs, and there are many many many ways to have meaningful work outside of the Big Tech companies. In fact, I'd posit that it's *easier* to make bigger impacts at different companies, because you won't just be another cog in the machine. There's nothing wrong with wanting a FAANG job! But don't set all your hopes on it and then get burned when it doesn't pan out. You're a really smart individual who has a lot to contribute and who will be able to find a place where you belong and can make a difference.

Another thing to remember: *we're all at the literal start of our careers.* Please don't overburden yourself with expectations that are way past where you are in life. It's true that you have to start thinking about career stuff pretty early in college, but don't burn yourself out before you even begin the real thing! You have a ton of time to build a solid career. Don't feel like your first job is going to define who you are as a technologist and especially not as a person. Y'all are awesome and you got this!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** I'm really glad my thoughts have gotten a lot of conversations started! A quick point about ambition/hard work: I am in no way saying that you shouldn't work hard! It is nigh impossible to achieve any kind of success in life without hard work. I wrote this post as a graduating senior at a top-tier CS school who has seen lots of friends and classmates burn out on the job hunt grind. I'm a firm believer that you should try to be excellent at everything you do, and that hard work is one of the only ways to be excellent. My issue/point is that we should be wary of what our definition of ""personal success"" is. If success for you is defined in very very narrow terms, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment down the road. In my experience, having a definition of personal success in life that isn't completely tied to things like where I work has helped me maintain a decent level of joy, particularly in the area of computing. By all means work hard (and in prepping for interviews, practice makes perfect!), but I advise y'all to not tie whether or not you feel like a successful person to a dream job or internship. Hopefully that clarifies where I'm coming from!"

Tldr at bottom",ocarinaperson,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/iprzhk/not_sure_where_else_to_ask_but_anyway_some_life/,"Please share the appropriate sub if you think of one! Asking here because our community is welcoming and understands the struggle. 

Anyway I'm a married ADHD 29F with no kids, got diagnosed like 2 years ago. Before the pandemic I had 3 part-time jobs, one being an on-site property manager (PT). I still have that job now, but I do not get paid, and know it's best to get a paying full-time job to avoid being a housewife with no skills someday lol...

I need to start job-hunting but have no idea what to even apply for. At the end of day I enjoy working, but not the never-ending grind. I like jobs that have a beginning and end. So I dread applying for jobs, and I've pretty much hated every FT job I've ever had. Hence why I stuck to several PT jobs for a while. These days I have medication so I think I could handle a FT job now, unlike in the past (I pretty much would start getting depressed and miserable after a few months and my bad attitude would start showing at work and I'd be late all the time). 

A lot of my friends started at internships and shitty jobs, but worked their way up and now have decent jobs making decent money. Meanwhile I am pretty much starting from 0 again lol...

So I have experience with: Management, customer service, sales, residential matters, music, also am a good writer and know basic programming in 4 languages. A bachelor's degree. Good with computers and Photoshop. Also I am bilingual. But I feel all the things I do are not quite at the professional level that someone would pay me for.

I'd rather not go back to school unless I have a specific goal in mind that requires a specialized degree.

=============

tldr; questions!:

\- Any advice for starting a fresh job hunt at 29 after screwing around for years?

\- Any advice for the type of jobs I should apply for? Entry level only?

\- Any advice for working a FT job with ADHD and staying sane?

\- Are internships out of the question at this point?

Any advice about your experiences or helpful advice about what I should do are appreciated :)"
ips03y,289,2020-09-09,"If You Give Him A Tooth, He'll Play You A Memory",nicnoc246,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ips03y/if_you_give_him_a_tooth_hell_play_you_a_memory/,"Hi. It’s Sam Singer again.

Not far from my place in Habitsville, there’s a piano bar. It’s literally called The Piano Bar, one of those places with the ironically obvious name. I’d never been there before. I know, yet another place in my own hometown that I’ve never visited. I don’t get out much.

I had heard about The Piano Bar from our new intern at the *Habitsville Gazette*, Luke. Luke is a young, goofy kid in his second year of college. And if I had to guess, I wouldn’t say he was particularly socially skilled, or especially popular. He wore those really large, square, wire-framed glasses that made him look far too intellectual, even though in reality he wasn’t at all.

So I immediately thought it was odd that he frequented a high-end piano bar in downtown Habitsville. The music that drifted out of it was always either classical or jazz, and the people I saw entering and leaving were always dressed up.

But still, Luke continually vouched for the place, saying that it had even become a nightly routine of his to finish up his work at the paper then head down to The Piano Bar. And at first, I didn’t think too much about his newfound passion.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, I noticed the holes in his mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn’t seen them initially. I believe this was because it was the back molars that went missing first. But after a few days, the gaps began creeping in towards the center, until I couldn’t not see them. So, even though it seemed sort of rude, and I didn’t know Luke all that well, I decided to ask.

“Luke,” I had started, as we were about to leave for the night. “Do you mind if I ask you an... odd question?”

He smiled at me, that bright smile of the young and disillusioned, minus a few teeth. “Go for it,” he answered. I tried to keep my gaze from drifting to the peeks of thrashing tongue I could see through the dark spaces in his gums, and instead strove to maintain eye contact.

I cleared my throat. “What’s happened to your teeth?”

To my great surprise, he didn’t seem offended or even taken aback by my sudden inquiry. Instead, his broken grin only widened. “I told you. I’ve been going to that piano bar every night.”

I waited for more details to come, but none did.

“And that... took your teeth?”

He laughed, a wet, soft sound. “I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it’s worth it.” And then he said something, something that for the life of me I couldn’t wrap my head around.

&amp;#x200B;

“If you give the Piano Man a tooth, he’ll play you a memory.”

&amp;#x200B;

I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question, but Luke’s bag was already on his shoulder. “I’ve really got to get going,” he said hurriedly, “You’ve kind of got to get there early if you want him to play you a song. Or else... you know,” he finished, but of course, I did not know.

Luke seemed really anxious to leave, so I bid him good night. We both left, heading in opposite directions—he to the Piano Bar, and me to my home, to sit and stew over what I had been told.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, the next day, Luke didn’t show up for work.

&amp;#x200B;

We thought he might have been ill, and like the kid that he is, forgotten to call in and let us know he wouldn’t be coming in that day. But then the next day came, and still, there was no Luke. We sent someone to go around his apartment and knock on the door, but there was no answer.

I knew it was quite a leap in logic to make, but the investigative reporter inside of me couldn’t seem to shake the idea that The Piano Bar had something to do with Luke’s disappearance.

So that’s why, on a Thursday night, I found myself severely underdressed and seated on a stool in the darkest corner of the mysterious piano bar.

There were all sorts in the crowd that night, people I had never seen on the streets or in the shops around Habitsville. I wondered if they had from out of town just to come there.

&amp;#x200B;

But the main sight was in the very center of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a huge piano, grand in every sense of the word. Although the bar itself was dimly lit and a tad smoky, every ounce of light in the space was reflected against the jet black sheen of the great instrument.

On top of the piano, in an odd sort of display, were an assortment of objects. There was an elaborate hair pin with a metal bumblebee on the end, a few assorted rings, a pair of gloves—but there was one item in particular that caught my eye, because they were so familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

Large, square, wire-framed glasses.

&amp;#x200B;

I could hear bits and pieces of ambient music coming from the keys, stroked by the fingers of one of the most striking human beings I had ever seen.

The Piano Man. His hair was perfectly sculpted, and his suit was dark green velvet with a silky black bowtie. His hands moved steadily across the keys, but his eyes weren’t watching them. Instead, his irises, nearly the same green as his suit, wandered over the chattering crowd, a content smile on his closed lips.

&amp;#x200B;

*RING*

&amp;#x200B;

I jumped as a loud bell tolled throughout the room, though no one else seemed to share my reaction. Immediately, all of the patrons fell silent, and there was a great shift as each of them turned their attention and their bodies towards the Piano Man, like planets orbiting some bright Sun.

He had stopped playing, the final notes echoing in the air as he pulled his hands back and gracefully stood up from his bench. He took a moment, in the silence, to gaze over the crowd, turning a full circle around the room. There was a moment when I felt as though he met my eyes, and a shiver ran down my spine.

Then, suddenly, he reached out his arm and pointed.

The woman at the end of his finger immediately turned red, and uneasily gestured to herself. “Me?” I heard her say.

“Yes, of course you,” The Piano Man answered, in a voice as smooth as silk and warm as summer.

The woman clasped her hands together, the look on her face that of pure joy. She stepped forward, separating herself from the rest of the crowd. The Piano Man stared at her for another moment, before sitting back down to his bench.

There was a breath, a second of ringing silence. And then, he played the most beautiful music I had ever heard in my life.

I am not a big music person. I don’t know composers besides the basics, and even less actual pieces. I’m more of a podcasts guy, to be sure. But there was something about this that was different. It was hypnotic, almost. There was no way to tell how long the actual song was, because from the moment it began to the second it ended, it was as though I was suspended in a trance of joyful derealization.

But, eventually the last note was played. My eyes refocused, and I saw that although the song had quite an impact on myself, it was even more transformative to the woman the Piano Man had chosen. She was sobbing, large tears rolling down her cheeks, her shoulders shaking with emotion. When the Piano Man stood up again, she immediately wrapped her arms around him. Although it was muffled, I could hear her say “Thank you, thank you,” over and over, as the crowd began to applaud enthusiastically.

The Piano Man waited a moment, then gently pushed the woman back. The applause died down. The Piano Man looked the woman in the eyes, and then, he grinned.

And I could see, even from the corner where I was sitting, that he was missing teeth.

There were three open spaces in his mouth, two on the bottom, and one the left of his very front teeth. He smiled at the woman, who was still wracked with the emotions the performance had brought on. Then, he spoke.

“Time for your payment.”

There was a flash of something like fear on the woman’s face. But then, she nodded, and she did something incredibly strange, something that I did not expect at all: she opened her mouth.

The Piano Man raised his hand, the same one that had played the keys so beautifully and elegantly. He slowly brought it forwards, until the majority of it was in the woman’s mouth. I could hear her breathing, fast and wheezy with the obstruction. Her eyes watered even more than they had before, and she let out a few high pitched squeaks of pain. The Piano Man’s arm began to vibrate with effort. The woman’s face turned a violent shade of red, and then—

&amp;#x200B;

*CRACK*

&amp;#x200B;

The Piano Man’s hand reemerged, and I could see it between his fingertips—pink with blood, but shining all the same, was one large tooth, pulled out to the root.

A line of blood dripped from the woman’s open mouth as she brought a comforting hand to the side of her jaw. She stepped backwards to her spot in the crowd. A few patted her on the shoulder, but most had their attention still turned to the man in the green suit in the center of the room.

He stared at the tooth, and held it aloft to the light, as though admiring a pearl he’d just pulled from a clam. And then, he did something that’s so odd, I doubted I had seen it correctly.

He threw it directly up in the air, like tossing a coin, and as it fell down, he opened his jaw wide and caught it in his mouth. Then, with one heavy, wet sound, he swallowed it.

But he wasn’t done. He brought one of his hands to his face, the thumb and pointer finger pressed into a crescent. He stuck his fingers into his mouth, breathed in hard, and then exhaled—

&amp;#x200B;

There was a high pitched whistle, and then an audible *snap* resonated in the room.

The Piano Man paused. Then, he smiled for his audience, and I could see that which was impossible. One of the spaces in his bottom teeth had filled in, as though nothing had ever been missing to begin with.

It was incredible. Of course, it was incredible. He did it one more time that night, nearly the same start to finish. Only it was a man the second time, and the melody he played was a bit different, sadder somehow, but still absolutely riveting. He pulled the tooth, swallowed it, whistled, and the other spot on his bottom row was filled in.

And then, as the room watched in silence, he walked away from the piano and out the front door of the bar.

&amp;#x200B;

In a few minutes, the patrons too left The Piano Bar. They milled about on the street outside, chatting and smoking. There was no sign of the Piano Man, so I tried to glean some more information from the conversations of the various groups.

“It’s amazing, isn’t it?” the woman who was chosen for the first song was saying. “I saw her, I mean I really saw her. I *saw* my mother.”

“It’s truly remarkable,” the man she was speaking to replied. “A pity about the tooth though.” I must have been standing a bit too close to them, because soon he seemed to notice that I was lurking nearby. “Can we help you?” he asked, with an unsubtle glance at my lackluster wardrobe.

“I was just wondering—I mean, I wanted to know—” It’s hard, when your questions are so big, to put them into the confines of words. “What was that? In there?”

The woman raised her eyebrows. “Have you never been to The Piano Bar, dear?” she asked, then winced, placing her hand back onto her cheek, which was starting to swell. I shook my head. “Oh, well what a treat for you!” She attempted a smile, then dropped it once she felt the pain. “It’s really quite simple. The Piano Man takes a single tooth from you, and in exchange, he’ll let you relive a memory you’ve forgotten.”

I shook my head. “What do you mean a memory you’ve forgotten?”

The man gave an impatient huff. “Well it’s exactly as it sounds, boy.”

“Be patient with him, Rupert,” the woman scolded. She looked back to me kindly. “To be honest, no one’s quite sure how he does it. But if the Piano Man chooses you, he’s able to play you a song that will help you remember something you don’t know you’ve forgotten. Something you don’t know is important.” Her voice grew soft and misty, and her eyes glimmered. “I saw an afternoon with my mother when I was four. We had tomato sandwiches by the lake. She braided my hair. I was too young to remember. But now my mother’s gone, and I want every piece of her that I can get.”

I tried to understand what she was saying. “But... your tooth.”

She shook her head, once again fighting a smile back down. “For the chance to have a bit more time with someone you’ve lost? What would you not be willing to give up, for something like that?”

I nodded, though the entire thing was difficult to believe. But there had been something about that music, something in the air—and the fact that people were so willing to pay in pain for each performance. “Thank you. I think... I think I’ll come back tomorrow night.”

There was a falter in the woman’s expression. “Oh, I---“

The man put his hand on her shoulder, and she stopped speaking. “You do that, son. Come on Bonnie, we’ve got to be getting home.”

The woman, Bonnie, looked at me for another moment, as though she wanted to say something. Then, she turned, and the two of them walked back down the street.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the odd feeling that Bonnie had given me, I did come back the next night. I sat in the same seat, a stool near the back, and the rest of The Piano Bar was almost identical to what it had been the first night. Except for a few things.

For one, the crowd was much smaller. It was thinned out considerably since the previous performance, and those that were here had an odd atmosphere to them. It seemed nervous almost.

A certain apprehension that hadn’t been there before.

Secondly, The Piano Man himself wasn’t playing idling little melodies in the center of the room. Instead, he was playing with gusto, at full volume. There was an energy to him that evening, an eagerness, and it was coming out in some of the most elaborate piano playing I had ever seen. Still, his eyes didn’t watch his hands, and instead scanned the room. I could see the one remaining gap in his teeth, black and hollow through the thin sneer of his lips.

There was a man sitting next to me that night. And, like me, he didn’t quite seem like he belonged there. He wore a collared shirt and worn khakis, and I got the impression that those were probably the nicest clothes he had, something he wore to church on Sunday’s. Despite this, he was wearing a faded blue baseball cap that was ripped around the brim, nearly falling apart.

He was in his late forties, though his face was lined far more than his years would suggest. His hands were rough and cracked, and he picked at his fingers. He watched The Piano Man closely, and his leg shook restlessly.

“Are you looking forward to the show?” I asked him tentatively.

He gave me a sideways glance, and his leg stopped moving. “Yes. No. I don’t know.” He paused for a moment, and I thought perhaps that was all he was going to say. “I just hope he picks me.”

“Really?” I asked, trying to remain casually curious. “What are you hoping to see?”

He gave me another sideways look, and I thought for a moment that I had overstepped. This was a personal thing, after all. But then, he answered. “My son.”

“Oh,” I said, surprised. “I’m sorry.”

“Yeah, well,” he said dismissively. “He was so young when he—you know—and I wasn’t much of a father, then. I wasn’t around like I was supposed to be, and when I was...” he trailed off, and I could tell how much it pained him to even speak on the topic.  He reached up, his fingertips brushing gently against the torn brim of his hat. “This is the hat I got at the first baseball game we went to. First and only,” he finished with a sigh. He brought his hand back down to his lap.“I just want to see what I was missing. No matter the cost.”

I nodded, a brief pang of sadness resonating in my chest for this stranger. “Well, it seems like the cost is only one tooth. So that’s not so bad, right?”

The man raised his eyebrows at me, and I immediately got the sense that I was missing something. “The price is a bit steeper tonight, pal.”

Before I could ask any more questions, there it was again—

&amp;#x200B;

*RING*

&amp;#x200B;

The bell tolled, and all attention turned to the center of the room. The Piano Man finished his song with a flourish, and quite literally jumped up from his bench. He surveyed the crowd with excitement, his tongue peeking out of his mouth and licking his lips as he swiveled his head around. Again, I thought for a moment that he had caught my eye, and I fought to look away. Then, he raised his arm, and pointed.

The man next to me, who’s name I never caught, got up from his stool and made his way to the center of The Piano Bar.

“Hello, Sir,” The Piano Man said with a disarming relish. “Thank you so much for volunteering.”

The man hadn’t made any sound or gesture, as far as I could tell. Somehow, The Piano Man could tell that he wanted to be chosen.

The man didn’t say anything. The Piano Man stepped back around to his piano, sat at his bench, and began to play.

I couldn’t see the memory that The Piano Man’s song played, but I could certainly feel it. I was like a deep, aching nostalgia deep in my stomach, for something I had never experienced. Not just never experienced—something that I desperately yearned for. I felt that pure sensation of *want* so terribly, it made my eyes water.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, it was over. It was the shortest song yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked to the man. He was still standing straight, but his hands were clenched into fists at his sides. His hat was low over his eyes, but there were tears rolling down his cheeks, and though he tried to contain it, a great cough of a sob came from his throat, strangled and sad.

The Piano Man gave him a moment. Then, he stood, grinning ear to ear. He put a hand on the man’s shoulder.

“Time for your payment.”

The man hesitated, but only for a moment. Then, his jaw fell open, and he let The Piano Man reach inside. He didn’t stick his hand in far, and in fact only grabbed hold of one of the man’s front teeth. Then, he began to pull. The man let out a long groan as they struggled. And then—

&amp;#x200B;

CRACK

&amp;#x200B;

The Piano Man held the tooth aloft, an expression of sheer delight on his face. The man looked at it, his face stony. Then, just as he had the night before, The Piano Man tossed the tooth high up in the air, threw his head back, and caught it in his mouth.

He swallowed it. Then, he brought his fingers to his mouth. The whistle was so loud and shrill, the members of the audience had to cover their ears. A trickle of blood ran down from my eardrums to my neck as I uncovered them, but I could still hear it when—

&amp;#x200B;

*SNAP*

&amp;#x200B;

The Piano Man smiled, a full, complete smile. His teeth—if I can truly call them his teeth, shone like jewels in the light of The Piano Bar. Then, he opened his jaw wide. Then he opened it wider. And wider, and wider. The man who had given him his final tooth hadn’t stepped back to join the crowd. Instead he stood, his head down, his shoulder’s tensed—

&amp;#x200B;

GULP.

&amp;#x200B;

The Piano Man wiped his mouth and adjusted his velvet green suit. He bent down, and picked up the worn blue baseball cap that had landed on the floor of The Piano Bar. He glided back to his instrument, and placed the hat on the gleaming surface of his piano, right next to the large, square, wire-framed glasses.

Then, he smiled, a toothless, gummy grin.

I just wanted some feedback on my offer because I don't really have many others to go to for guidance. 

A bit of background, I was a Mastercard intern so this is a return offer for their interns. I am currently a senior in college and will be graduating in May 2021. I go to a liberal arts college and have a 3.2 GPA (yes, I know it could be better). 

**Here's my offer**: 

* $87k/year salary
* $10k sign-on bonus 
* 10% stocks (not sure if I fully understood that one)
* Great benefits

So, I think this is a great offer and I think I want to take it, but there are two things that are stopping me. The first thing is the location. The office isn't actually in St. Louis; it's 30 mins away in O'Fallon. So, there will be a commute and there is an overall lack of diversity. The second thing is the ""what if"" factor. I have recently begun the job search process and started applying for jobs online. What if there is a better offer out there? In a better location? It's only the beginning of September, so I have so much time (right?) to look for another Software Engineering role. 

What do y'all think? I want honest opinions because I am left with only my thoughts right now."

iptijm,2,2020-09-09,Switching Majors Senior Year,Ac1dSnow,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iptijm/switching_majors_senior_year/,"TLDR: I'm a 22 year junior (technically a senior age wise) that's currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Biology and I'm unsure if this the right career path for me. I'm interested in Information Technology, but I'm unsure what to do at all now.

For starters, I wasted 3.5 years trying to obtain an Associate of Science in Science at my local Community College. While this maybe surprising to some, it's was indeed the case for a lot of my classmates in my Organic Chem class that I took there. Ultimately, I gave up after failing the last class (Calculus II) that I needed for the Associates degree. Luckily enough, I was still able to get accepted into my current university even though the degree is said to provide ""guaranteed admission"". Ironically, the degree has NO VALUE if your applying the semester you're graduating since you're required to have it the moment you apply.

More importantly, a huge chuck of the classes I took there were completely worthless and don't even work with the Biology degree. I failed Calculus II, the sole class that helped me back for an additional semester, twice just to be told that I don't even need it for the Bachelors degree. I wasted money on several classes that had no value in the end. Before you guys ask, I did speak to my counselor before I applied. While the classes definitely transfer over, many either didn't correspond for the final degree or were deemed ""outdated"". I was essentially better off speaking to an actual university counselor and transferring with actual classes that worked. While I don't think college is a ""scam"", I completely understand why many believe it to be the reality.

Anyways, whiles I've always enjoyed learning about Biology, there doesn't seem to be a lot of career prospects with a Bachelors. This is because of lack of entry level jobs and low salaries. I'm also disinterested in obtaining a Masters degree. I ""choose"" Biology because of family pressure and I gravely regret not doing research on the degree and putting my foot down. I also should have questioned my brother more as to why he switched degrees just before his final class three years ago. In the end, it's my fault completely. 

On the other hand, I've also been very interested in Information Technology (IT) before I graduated high school. While I understand that it's a broad field, I'm interested in learning more and I believe that this industry has way more to offer in employment and salary growth. In contrast to Biology, is a degree vital to succeed in this industry? I'm hesitant to completely change my major to Information Technology since it would mean 2~3 more years of school starting January 2021. My financial aid will have run out by next December I believe too. I've looked at taking the IT minor that my school provides, but I'm unsure if this would ""legitimize"" in anyway in comparison to a four year degree. I've also looked into internships and certification since many people also obtain that. My school also offers a Masters in Applied Information Technology and a Masters in Digital Forensics. Neither need a IT degree to be accepted, but that's another two years and a full time IT job before I can apply.

I'll be speaking career counselor this coming Thursday, so I'll keep you guys posted about that as well.

TLDR: I'm a 22 year junior (technically a senior age wise) that's currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Biology and I'm unsure if this the right career path for me. I'm interested in Information Technology, but I'm unsure what to do at all now."

I feel so trapped, suffocated, I can’t stay out the house past 11, can’t leave home after 8pm, hell I can’t even ride my bike home from work if it’s “dark”. From 18-23 I have done everything I can but now even just to get a little bit of freedom to stay out till 1-2am “abnormal, no one stays out that late” my younger brother barely goes out so there’s no “he’s a boy” issue. 

I just feel as if I’m wasting my early 20’s, my teenage years went to waste, I’m in a bubble of anxiety, panic consistently because I don’t want to upset them. None of my academic and professional achievements are never acknowledged by them, usually desi parents like to brag about their kids but my parents I just feel like a constant disappointment, nothing I do is enough, no matter how much I clean, help them, do good in school, get professional referrals for the top engineering masters programs, nothing is ever enough. Nothing I do is ever worth their praise my self esteem is so low with everything. I got a internship with IBM this past summer and not even a single nod of approval. I am working myself till exhaustion wether it’s school, work, volunteering, cleaning the house I am TIRED, physically, emotionally, mentally I am so defeated. I just want to scream till my lungs go out. 

I just wanted to stay out for 1 night and breathe. Not panic, not feel less of myself in every relationship I have wether it’s with my friends or my bf. I just feel as if I’m not enough, I’ve never been enough. I know I’m emotionally messed up, I know I have a lot of flaws but I’m working on them it’s just hard. I just want to be able to not fight or convince them something which is completely normal but in their eyes it’s corrupt. I think I’m going to mentally snap, the amount of lies I have to tell them to do normal things is fucked up.

I went to 4 different highschools because we moved a lot so I never had that stable friend group and as for uni being a female in a male dominated program just does not help with my situation I just feel so alone I don’t have anyone to go to. 

I’m sorry if this was long I needed to get this off my chest, I just had a conversation with my dad about staying out till 1am and him flipping out saying no one stays out that late and there’s no need for me to leave the house to be out that late. I don’t get it, I just don’t understand I’m not a crazy kid, I’ve done nothing to break their trust and this is what I get in return I am nothing but a puppet."

My worry is that I've wasted the last few years of my life on several ""train yourself"" programs- in typing, customer service, and photoshop- only to find that they went nowhere.  I've taken a lot of CS courses; I can solve leetcode problems and build python classes to do interesting things, but I never ended up getting a cs degree, so my fear is that I will pursue a questionable path in teaching myself more advanced skills in javascript or java.  Then, in a year or so the upcoming recession will take out a lot of the lower paying jobs and I'll be stuck in the same position I was before- no degree, no prospect for advancement. 

 It's especially concerning because jobs I look into simply require too many skills- about a dozen different frameworks which just take too long to learn.  How do I prove that I'm competent in a framework without real world experience?  For example, building a bootstrap/php website did not impress any job recruiters enough to give me an interview.  

My alternative is law school.  I know I can well there, and I'm wondering if the job market is more secure for people without the right backgrounds or industry connections.  Is it possible for me to make it to FAANG or a well paying job just by teaching myself even more frameworks, without the industrial experience to reach some mid-level jobs?

Need help!,rishabh495,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ipy8oh/switching_careers_without_even_having_one_need/,"Hey everyone! This post is a bit long because I need you to understand the whole picture.

I have a curious case for you and i really need your help.

**TLDR**: Had job offers after graduation. But, went for a masters degree in another country, got no jobs there, so came back to my home country, no jobs again here too. Switched careers to get into Data Science. Now, I think I am lost and doubt if I ever will find a job.

I live in India. I studied **Electronics Engineering** and got a sh\*tty internship in my senior year (May 2017 grad). I basically learnt nothing and worked on something else than what I was supposed to. I was in a low tier college, so people rarely got hired for core electronics jobs. **IT** companies come during campus placements/career fairs during senior year and I got placed in 2 (Accenture, Wipro) of them. I even managed to snag a role in a tech company (L&amp;T) close to my domain. These were very low offers (most students in India get low entry level offers).

I had given GRE and TOEFL a year before, I had not clearly thought about whether I wanted to study more i.e get a masters degree. I scored well in both. I am not a good student despite what my record shows, I used to despise programming and chose electronics to get away from it. I figured out very soon that I hated electronics too and had no passion for anything. I used to work hard, so got thru finals, GRE and campus placements. I wanted to study for just for the sake of it. I took out an education Loan and went to the US.

Coming to the US, from India was a big change. Impostor syndrome, anxiety and procrastination struck me and I didn't do well. It was my mistake, I didn't try to find more opportunities on campus, didn't work hard and stayed alone didn't make many friends. I had poor grades in my first year so couldn't apply for internships (stringent rules for international students). I took more initiative in my final year and worked hard to graduate (May 2019 grad). I applied to countless jobs after that, literally spending 8 hours every day on it. I got maybe 5 interviews. I couldn't make it past the second round. Dejected and depressed, I just ate and stayed in my apartment.

Again, visa rules came into play (needed to find a job within 90 days after graduation). I had no hope so. I came back to India. It's been more than a year now, I tried but got no jobs/failed in interviews. In March this year, I decided to make a switch to Data Science. I have worked hard since then, tried to take even unpaid internships, jobs that would teach me what I need to know but again, nothing. This is worrying me because, I have no proper work experience. Who would even take me seriously? 

I am taking online courses now. I have learnt Python, SQL, Tableau, Advanced Excel, Machine Learning and am trying to target entry level data analyst jobs. If you read this far, I need your help on what to do. I have made many mistakes over the years but I am here now, I have to continue on this path.

Thanks for reading."
ipyt79,3,2020-09-10,How do you know you don't like something? Is it fear or is it distaste? Changing your major complications,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ipyt79/how_do_you_know_you_dont_like_something_is_it/,"This is going to be long so prepare yourself 

I’m 20 years old. I graduated high school in 2018 of June. Ever since I graduated I had literally no idea what I wanted to do, I don’t think I really thought about it too hard or my future because I was so caught up in the present problems. 

When my family and I almost lost our home back in 2008 my mom quickly became a nurse to support are family. I always admired her because of it, and ever since then I always had an enormous respect for nurses, more than I ever had before. I wanted to be one so I could feel proud of myself, maybe even more than actually helping people?

So I decided why not become a nurse? I have no other career path, nothing really seems appealing to me so I’ll just do that. 

I went to a local community college and I only have two science classes left, and only five GE classes to transfer to a cal state. Only two semesters left. I have a 4.0 GPA. I have at least 90 hours at a local hospital that I have volunteered at.

Everything is lining up, taking classes is so incredibly easy for me, I know how to study. Everything else is the hard part. 

The problem for me is that I’m a person that struggles with anxiety on a daily basis, to the point where it makes me inconsistent in what I do. I’ve dropped a semester here and there, I’ve bounced from job to job (part time jobs) because of my mental health. 

Nursing isn’t like that. I can’t take nursing school in parts, it’s fast paced and it’s not something I can drop and comeback to. Once I’m in it there’s no going back.  

This pretty much apples to everything in life so maybe I should just disregard that in my decision making. 

I’ve volunteered at the hospital and I actually liked it, I didn’t LOVE it, but it was cool. I got out of my comfort zone and I loved discharging new moms or taking visitors to see their loved ones or delivering lab specimens. 

Talking to patients and helping them into the wheelchair felt like I had purpose in some ways...however there still is a part of me that felt off. I don’t know where that comes from no matter how hard I think, is it because deep down I don’t like nursing? Or maybe it’s just self doubt? 

No matter what career path I choose I will always doubt myself/be afraid so how I can dissect fear from distaste? 

Ever since the pandemic hit I’ve been questioning everything. I haven’t volunteered since March of this year, and I’ve been way too nervous to go back to the hospital. However there’s this itch that I can’t get away from. Everyday internally something is telling me to go back the hospital.  I just need to be in that environment I NEED to shadow a nurse as soon as possible, and to put more reassurance in what I’m doing-however it's not because I want to help patients, it's because I need confirmation. This might be an alarming wake up call for me. 

I was so ify about the future that I actually dropped my Physio class and thought it’s best to take this time to FINALLY finish my GE classes and take this time to self explore a little bit in other areas. 

It’s confusing, because i don’t know if I can handle this career but I really have no other options it feels like. Nursing is all that I have known for the past three years. It's what's comfortable, the idea of nursing is comfortable, but when I think about actually doing a CNA program or being more involved a wave of fear comes over me. It's hard to image myself as happy if I do nursing, the more I go into it...the more I'm in my head ""no this isn't for me...what are you doing...stop this.""

When I imagine myself actually going through with nursing, taking the TEAs test (basically a test to admit you into a school as an oversimplification) I don't want to do that. Maybe it's out of laziness I thought at first but it's out of a lack of motivation. I just don't know if I can force myself to do this anymore, the conflicting feeling is way too out of control. 

Not to mention I have been in this ""Youre already this far along so keep on going, just finish this"" syndrome. 

There's only two other career paths I see myself taking; business and psychology. But as soon as I think about this then my mind starts over analyzing in shit. Business seems cool and I think it's interesting but an actual career path in business? What even is that? It's so unpredictable. 

Then I think about psychology and I'm unsure about that because I don't know if I want to care for someone's literal mind, the most precious part of someone's being. 

I'm confused. And being in this pandemic makes it worst because my opportunities are limited. 

Maybe I should take a business/psychology class within the same semester and see where that goes? Maybe try a business internship? Read some autobiographies on peoples mental disorders and how it has affected their life? Maybe I could get inspired. 

Maybe I could look around and try to get involved something business related. I've never been this lost in my entire life."

I was wondering if anyone can give me some guidance as to which one of these programs is worth it for a person like me who has only a minor in CS but would like to advance their coursework with more classes and have a higher chance of getting hired as a software engineer/product manager. I am also really interested in entrepreneurship if that makes any difference. I feel like the programs at Cornell would provide me the networking and resources to maybe start my own companies compared to other programs. I was planning on specializing in Computing Systems at OMSCS.

The program at Cornell Tech, in particular, looks much more appealing to me (other than the cost) because it is 1 year vs taking 2 years to complete my MS at GT. When I think of it, that would be one year getting industry experience rather than just doing internships. The cost of GT is also 10k compared to the potential 50k that I would be paying for the year at Cornell (excluding potential aid).

If anyone has experience with choosing OMSCS vs. Cornell, I would love to hear their thoughts!"

iq37j3,7,2020-09-10,Counting Hours of Salaried Employees,bigtruck2311,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iq37j3/counting_hours_of_salaried_employees/,"I'll start off with a little background on myself: 4 years in the Marine Corps straight out of high school. Got out and got my BSME, several internships that added up to a few years of experience in Solidworks and Inventor doing machine design, among other engineering/business skills while in school. Graduated with a decent GPA 4 years ago and have worked a combination of design, project management, and sales roles since. Some of these were very time demanding, which has its pros and cons, but must came with significant autonomy. I'm coming up on a year at my current employer as a design engineer.

When I started here, I did want I normally do and would work to a stopping point at the end of the day. That may be 5 min early or 2 hours late. In my perception, that's part of being salary. I've noticed a company culture where people avoid taking responsibility and shift blame whenever possible. There are processes for everything, with the seeming intent to have somewhere to place blame when something goes wrong. This is a small company with lass than 75 people. Primarily manufacturing with a new department trying to be successful in construction. I'm part of the const. dept. Dec-March, my coworker (des. eng.) and I worked 10 &amp; 12 hr days because of time crunches and management mistakes on several projects, while no one else did. I just chocked it up to being salary, gritted my teeth, and did what I could to help the team, while thinking that I had the autonomy of a salaried professional. When we finally were caught up, we tried to take off about 2 hrs early on a Friday, having already worked 55 hrs that week and completed the critical items... That was shut down. We were told it wouldn't be fair to other employees if we left early, even though everyone else was still working the normal 40.

As the months creeped on through this year, there have been more and more blanket restrictions put on   everyone in the company. Emails come out stating that lunch or 30 minutes and that's it, if you take longer, make sure you stay late to cover it. Regardless of overtime worked the week prior, 40 hr minimum is expected of all employees. We're currently working 9 hrs mon-thurs, 4 hrs on Fri, so the offices can get sanitized after everyone leaves. On Tuesday, an email was sent out stating that we're working an extra hr on Friday to make up for the holiday on Monday... I guess paid holidays are only 8 hrs?

I'd love to hear from some of you who have had similar experience, or understand some of the old school approaches to things. 

TLDR: As a salaried professional, is it normal to be managed the same as an hourly laborer? Am I overreacting to feel that, if I'm not allowed the ability to manage my own time, then I will work only the 40 hrs required? With that style of management, does it lead to apathy and reduced want to go above and beyond when it's needed? In the last several months, I have started to see why the people who have been here a long time tend to clock in and out, on the dot. No more, no less. When problems are noticed, they get pushed along or ignored.

Edit: I really appreciate all of the input and feedback. I have not completely written this employer off and stepped out the door yet. There are positives, like having a defined separation of work and home life (which I have worked very hard to achieve and maintain). I'm also looking at it as a learning opportunity. Every day I get paid to learn how NOT to run a company or division. There's a lot of be said about learning from other's mistakes and avoiding making them myself, in the future."

iq5s21,32,2020-09-10,Don't sign with Palantir until after September 18th,Reply_OK,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/iq5s21/dont_sign_with_palantir_until_after_september_18th/,"More for Full Time than for intern. In the end, interning at any particular place isn't going to matter that much. But, for FTE, stock compensation is especially worrying from Palantir; read #3. I would 100% wait for the direct listing and the aftermath to evaluate the package, and the future of the company.

Dark clouds have been forming as Palantir prepares for it's exit onto the public markets as a direct listing.

1) First and foremost, their S-1 is... not pretty, even for SV (or Boulder, Colorado, I suppose) startups. 2018 could be summed up for them as: ""spent 500M in advertising to get 500M in revenue while spending 500M on everything else"". That's right, a 100% net loss/revenue ratio, or costs 2x their revenue. The *500M* advertising cost was especially... worrying. For 500M in revenue? Uh

2019 was ""better"" in that they ""only"" had a net loss of 500 million while their revenue rose to 735M.

Basically Palantir is losing money hand over fist, but does not have necessarily SaaS margins, with much of their revenue sitll being based in more costly consulting-like work, nor the fantastic growth rates that something like Snowflake has. They're also a *17* year old company. That's a long time to still have a 100-70% loss to revenue ratio.

2) Palantir insiders are offloading stock at an increased rate

&gt; ""Taking a large liquidity discount when your shares are going to be liquid in just a matter of weeks seems like poor investing — unless, of course, you are trying to rush to sell before the public gets a fuller understanding of the stock."" - TechCrunch

https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/as-direct-listing-looms-palantir-insiders-are-accelerating-stock-sales/

3) Palantir being valued at half of 20B valuation by shareholders

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/09/palantir-valued-at-about-10point5-billion-ahead-of-direct-listing.html

&gt; ""Employees have a lot at stake in the coming months. As recently as August, Palantir granted 162 million stock options to certain officers at $11.38 a share, the prospectus says. That’s much higher than what investors have been paying of late, and exactly what they were willing to shell out in 2015. """

Issue is, i have two phone interviews with two separate companies coming up. I realized how in over my head I am about a week or two ago, and have been trying to come up with a gameplan since then. I know my basic programming, built a few simple games like an online clicker and added a feature to a professor's github project as an assignment. i've used hashmaps, linked lists, and a few binary trees. kind of shit at recursion. learned what big O notation even was a few days ago.

i've already accepted I'm likely not getting an internship at this point, but i started to break down what i need to study these next coming months. i'm currently reading The Algorithm Design manual, does anybody else have any direction they can point me into?

Just to reiterate, the goal is to become knowledgeable enough in Data Structures and Algorithms to get me into an internship and possibly make my life easier when i head back to school.

iq7v49,7,2020-09-10,I feel stuck,35smyrna,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iq7v49/i_feel_stuck/,"I am a computer science senior in a state university with no experience. I always wanted to do an internship, but I was not able to. I got very close to getting one last summer, but it got canceled due to COVID.

I had been doing Python tutorials on and off during last summer.

This summer is my last chance to do an internship before I graduate. But here is my problem... I have no projects (except very basic stuff like to-do list, calculator, eight ball game, etc)

So I thought I would learn to React and make some good looking projects. I started with Vanilla JS and I have been studying it for a while. But then I received this email from the company I applied for an internship. They invited me to take their Hackerrank test. I took the sample test. I couldn't pass any of the examples basic tests like ”finding a prime number” because even though my code works in my IDE when I submit it to hackerrank; it doesn't pass any of the tests and give time error or doesn't print anything etc. So I realize I am missing practice on that side as well. The actual test is 6 problems in 75 minutes. I still have time until September 15 to take it but I doubt I will pass it.

While trying to decide if I need to make some projects or learn hackerrank/leetcode; I decided to ignore both for a bit and last night I sat and made myself a portfolio website on GitHub.io playing around with some templates. While it looks good, I didn't have much to put there.

So I am all over the place. I have limited time to improve myself and put myself out there to get an internship in my last summer before I graduate, and I don't even know where to start. I feel like I don't have enough time or a structured plan and it demotivates me to do anything.

I appreciate any advice...

Edit: I suppose to graduate in May 2021 but in order to do an internship in Summer 2021 before I graduate, I am planning to postpone my graduation to December 2021"

So instead of working at an internship, I thought let me learn machine learning over the next year. The subject really interests me (the pay doesn't really matter). Now, browsing this sub and looking at fellow friends, everyone seems to be going into ML too, so I feel it would be even more competitive than a traditional web dev role. What should I do?

a) stick to traditional fullstack web development? I did an internship on this a year ago

b) learn ML and try to find internships related to that. 

c) other tech roles?"

I'm interested in the Networking side of CIS/CS. I think security is interesting and I really liked all my programming classes like Java &amp; Python. I honestly don't know half the shit some of you do but I'm determined, hardworking and willing to take any and all advice as to what to do now. I should take some CERTS, right? That'll help with grasping basic concepts and give me the confidence to actually apply for a job in the field and stop serving food while being sweaty while being underpaid. I've purchased and surrounded myself with textbooks and study guides for the A+/Net+ as well as some programming books for Python + Java. My real question is how the hell do I go about this? With everything going on I have a lot of time, hopefully not time just coasting like I have been for the past two years through this program. ( *I'd like to add that I've done really well in all my classes. I guess it's just the gaps between classes or summers where my time isn't filled with CS related self-exploration that has done me in because the memory fades and concepts become fuzzy* )

I'll need a schedule, that's for sure. But I guess what I'm really asking is: What exactly do I fill that open schedule with? Is it 6 hr YouTube videos on a ""CompTIA Full Course"" breakdown? Is it books? Is it practical learning through ""Crash Course"" examples?

I know everyone learns differently and what might be effective for one will just fly over another.. but I'm interested to see what this community did when they were somewhat of a place I find myself: Almost out of school or still in school and just generally lacking knowledge about THE route to take to becoming a master; familiar with all concepts; Experienced; getting into the field

I'd be very interested to see what any of you have to say. Appreciate you all and be well.

Now after all this thinking I don't feel anything no emotion, no motivation, no passion, I don't feel any interest in any new thing even on my old things I just wannabe left alone but this will lead me nowhere so what should I do? I mean traveling thought is still stuck to my head is there anything which I can make computer science engineering career into my passion with traveling if so what should I do any guidelines or steps to achieve that goal, if not should I quite this CS career and try to find my passion? , or should I stick with CS major? please give me some advice about it because I wanna come out of these depressing thoughts and wanna create an interest that I love doing it.

I would like to add 1 more which is best is it passion or money?

This is my first post please excuse any mistake and grammar if I have made above this, I just wanted talk about it which I haven't spoken to any of the professionals but I tried to speak with friends but I couldn't make my thoughts clear so I am trying this here too."

I really did try to do everything right, but nope, ADHD had to have its way. At the end of the internship, I was given a performance review by my manager. My technical skills exceeded expectations, and my manager straight up told me it was ""promotion-level"" stuff. He even went so far as to state that our project would not have gotten to the point it was at without my taking lead of one of its major elements. However, I got dinged on the ""professionalism"" section for being late to (and missing some) meetings. I also didn't get a lot of administrative stuff (unrelated paperwork, reflections, etc) done on time. My final review was marked as ""needs improvement"" for those issues.

Today, most of my former colleagues got their return offers, and it looks like I'm not going to be getting one. My manager had told me that he would have no problem with me returning to the company when he was discussing my final review with me, but it seems that whoever IS in charge of sending out return offers just saw the ""needs improvement"" mark on my performance review and passed me over.

This internship was actually supposed to be in person. Thanks to COVID, however everything switched online. This took my chronic lateness to a whole new level. I just didn't adapt quickly enough, I guess.

I don't usually get all broken up at things that happen as a result of my adhd, as I've come to accept my differences and struggles. However, this one really got to me. This was a chance to prove myself in a professional environment, and I completely let myself down."

So I'm a senior about to graduate with a BS in Environmental Science. So far I've taken two GIS courses (the only two my school offers to undergrads), and by the time I graduate I will also have taken classes and have experience with R and remote sensing.

Can I be competitive for entry-level jobs if I've only taken classes? I've saved all my old projects that I could use as a portfolio, and like I said, will also have experience with R and remote sensing by the time I graduate, so will this be enough? How else can I make myself competitive? (I'm sure someone will mention getting certified in GIS, but my university only offers certifications to graduate students)

The other teammates just do everything else that comes in the queue.

So if you guys don't mind please take some time to answer some questions below so that you can help me and maybe some others who may also be interested. Also make sure if you going to answer to give me your name, professional title, and some background as well as a 50-word response if you don't mind.

Thank you in advance!

1)What advice would you give people studying computer science in college? Is there a better way to approach it? What would you have done if you had the chance to go back? Which subjects are more important or harder than others? What would you have spent more time doing in school?

2) Which branch of cs do you recommend people study? Is there perhaps a better opportunity in one subfield than another? In your opinion which field is the best and why?

3) How is the cs industry like? Do you genuinely like going to work each day? What is your daily routine like at work? What's the work environment like?

4) what advice would give someone applying for a job or internship? Which skills or projects are the most important? ex. data science, swe, swd

5) give me reasons why I should or shouldn't go into either SWD, data science, and/or major differences."

(Columbia ED // T20s),KTnash,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/iqgur1/help_a_scared_senior_out_columbia_ed_t20s/,"**Personal Info:** Biracial (Mexican and White...but white is Jewish), from California, gay, woman, small private school (switched before junior year from other private school due to excessive bullying and insane hours... I had to wake up at 5:30 a.m.), middle class (will need finical aid from some, but not all schools). I also have a 3 hour daily commute which will go into my additional info section. It makes it hard for me to do insane amounts of ECs.

**Major:** Political Science and Philosophy double-major

**Academics:**

GPA: 3.97 UW and 4.51 W. Hardest course load at my school.

SAT: got cancelled 3x cos covid, but am now shooting for a 1500. I am signed up for September but if it doesn't happen, I am going to go test-optional.

APs are not offered at my school but I self-studied for APUSH (5) and AP US Gov and Politics (4). 

Have done out of school honors projects for non-honors classes to receive honors credit.

SAT II: Hopefully will have enough time to take World History, US History, Spanish, and maybe Lit

**Senior Year Coursework (all honors unless noted):**

Calc BC, Calc-based physics, 20th century history, advanced conversational Spanish, utopian philosophy, advanced literary analysis (English), Model UN (not honors and, yes, this is a real class)

**Extra Curricular Activities:**

Model UN - Secretary General of an online international conference. I spent about 20 hours a week on this for several months junior year. I am continuing it this year year (we plan on hosting 2 conferences next year). I am also going to expand this to a club at my school this year so more students can participate

Bernie Sanders Campaign volunteer - In both English and Spanish (my second language - I had to pass a test). I was also in the ""advanced texting"" program; I had to pass a test for this as well. I spent 7-10 hrs a week on this for over a year.

Internship at LA city councilmember's office: Summer before 11th grade. About 40 hrs a week for a month. My research turned into policy in LA. I am considering submitting a research supplement about this.

Work experience: camp counselor for 40+ hours a week for a month- paid since last summer- volunteer (as Junior Counselor in Training or Counselor in Training) from 5th grade through last summer. Got cancelled this year due to covid.

Creator of blog about hockey: in 7th a created an instagram account (over 1600 followers now) to talk about and analyze my favorite team, the Los Angeles Kings and in 11th grade, I turned it into a website where I now write articles covering them. This is purely a passion project as I love hockey and people like to hear what I have to say (they also always assume I'm a guy lol... who says a girl can't be more knowledgable than you about sports). It has been read by a few hockey people who gave it good reviews.

Co-Founder/Co-President of my school's GSA (Gender Sexuality Alliance): one of 2 surviving clubs at my school. We manly discuss current events through historical contextualization and promote intersectionality. Will be sole president senior year. This is a minimal time commitment, but I feel as if it is important in order to educate the community.

King's College Pre-University Summer Programme in Political Science: accepted into competitive, international pre-college program in London, specializing in international relations (one of the biggest eye-opening experiences of my life). Summer before 11th grade.

I plan on volunteering on another political campaign (local) - purposely vague so I do no reveal my identity. I will work several hours a week if possible.

I will begin volunteering with the Trevor Project in August (must be 18 to do so). This has been one of my goals for several years now... so I am glad I will be able to do it for a year before I go to college.

I also do art (painting and drawing), write op-eds and theater (have not been published... yet), and play ukulele, guitar, charango (Peruvian folk instrument), and a little bass for fun. I am currently building a supplemental art portfolio for college.

**Awards/Honors:** National Spanish Exam (NSE) bronze (freshman year) and silver (sophomore year.. scored perfectly on one of the sections). I will graduate with distinction from my school; this involves a lengthy senior thesis. Accepted into the advanced messing and Spanish group with Bernie Sanders' campaign. I know I do not have many awards... is that going to hurt me? I never really knew that they were so important, otherwise I would have entered in more competitions and stuff (rip). I have found some, but I will not know if I won before sending in some of my applications.

**Essays/Letters of Recommendation:** For my common app essay I am writing about my friendships with two international friends and their impact on my life within the greater metaphor of how saying goodbye can lead to wonderful things. My Head of School is writing my counselor rec and my honors bio teacher/MUN advisor has told me he is going to write me a killer LOR and I'll have my history/philosophy and English teachers write the other ones and they will be pretty good I think!

**Schools:**

Columbia (ED), UC Berkeley, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Brown, Georgetown, Princeton, Reed (EA?), George Washington, Boston University (legacy), Brandeis, NYU, Barnard, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Lewis and Clark, Clark, The New School.

**Last Bit:** 

So, Columbia is my DREAM school and I want to apply there ED as a poli-sci major. So for their supplements, I'm pretty well read (currently reading the *Iliad* and *And the Band Played On* for fun) and I have engaged in many cultural events over the past year (from art exhibits to an opera to international films to concerts ranging from broadway stars to punk rock) and I really hope I can get in there! I'd appreciate any Columbia specific advice as well.

If you made it this far, THANKS A MILLION!"

Covid has made a mess of our plans in more ways than we expected. Unfortunately I am one of the affected ones. This will be a long read.

I was initially did my Bachelors in Accounting. But never had any curiousity in improving my knowledge outside of what I studied in University. I always thought I was too dumb to be in computer science/IT.  So 18 year old me thought, why not become an accountant. What I never gave a thought was I have always been tinkering with computers(built my own pc, used Linux, MacOS, Windows, took an interest in hacking games, writing scripts etc). I was better off studying IT/ComSci. I struggled to find jobs where I grew up (Dubai) as a child to immigrant parents. They stopped issuing work visas which prevents me from getting jobs as the crime rate from my countrymen are high.

With no good prospects in life. I decided to change my life. Age 25 I decided to move to Australia to study Master of Data Analytics. Scored good grades, complete industry projects, landed internship at a bank. Bagged a job immediately after graduation as Junior Data Engineer.  I was hired on a part-time basis and they never converted me to part time. I worked for 6 months and was let go. Around this time I was on a work visa (2 years). With 1.5 years left. I interviewed with as many companies possible (data engineer roles) while trying to work hard towards accumulating the points I needed to obtain an Australian Permanent Residency. None of the interviews led to an offer. Gone another 6 months. Now with 1 year left on visa(2020). No companies would give me a chance. However, I prevented myself from not getting rusty by tutoring at my uni and doing projects. I have also been working retail on the side throughout since I was student to pay bills.

Enter COVID and I am 29 y.o now. Things got much more worse. My work gap is now 1 year long. I lost even more hope. I did some projects in Python on github. Bought myself a Raspi4 and setup a home server(learnt to setup database, pihole, database and host game servers). I feel comfortable with linux to the point where I actually taught one of my friend who studies Network Engineering. Had a blast. I prefer this over data analytics anyday. Began to take an interest in Sys.admin/Cyber Security. I have been looking into doing Comptia trifecta (A+,Net+,Sec+).  But whats the point I wonder? Even if I get the certs, I am not getting hired as my visa ends in 5 months. Nor can I get a job back in Dubai. I actually can't go back there. Only option left is to go back to where my parents are from and its a 3rd world country that got hit by covid the worst and never had IT job opportunities in the first place.

I wake up miserable every day, no purpose or goals to chase. Unable to see a clear path from where I am now. I have the drive to learn but the whole system just works against me to keep me from getting employed. I smoke and play games in my free time to numb my pain."

A couple years later, after finding out I actually had bipolar disorder and being treated for that, and still with no full-time job, I moved to another much larger city for an internship.  I ended up getting a job from that internship.  However, that job has always been mostly from home/online, and now with COVID, it's \*all\* online.

I don't love how big and busy this city is, and find it's harder to make connections here than in the other city, where I still have friends. Not only that, but my workplace has a second office in the city where I went to school.

However, in the intervening 8 years since I moved from the original city, my dad died and my mom still lives in my hometown with my sibling.  Both of them are very against the idea of me ever moving back to that city because I currently live a bit more than 1 hour away from my hometown, but the other city is 5 hours away.  They say they wouldn't be able to come see me if anything happened to me/I was dealing with mental health issues again (that has been mostly under control for nearly 7 years; I did have a sudden rather bout of depression last month, but am better again).

I also would feel guilty moving farther away from my widowed mom, who is getting older. At the same time, I never can quite seem to feel at home in this big city, and I'd never go back to my hometown, which is small/I no longer have friends there.

I've talked to friends slightly about this and some say I have an ideal situation where I am (I do have a really nice / inexpensive place to live, but I only rent a room and I'm very fortunate...most other places here are much more expensive, so finding another place on my own would be hard here and I don't want to be just renting a room in a house forever) while others say if I want to move, I should just do it and not worry about what my family thinks.

I don't really know what to do!  I keep coming back to the same thought of wanting to move back, and it's probably partly because I never wanted to leave in the first place. But I also don't know if it's a good idea to just relocate, given how my family feel about it and the reality that I'd only be relocating because I *wanted* to live there...not because I *had* to for a job (I think a lot of people may be contemplating this now with COVID and online work...)."
iqlkup,2,2020-09-11,New to the field. I have two companies request me to do coding assesment. Should I keep applying?,MoisoGenio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iqlkup/new_to_the_field_i_have_two_companies_request_me/,"I’m currently a full time student at Cal State East Bay. I’m starting my junior year and I’ve been applying to software engineer internships for Summer 2021. 
I’ve already received two emails from companies asking me to complete 40 minute code assessment. I have two weeks to do them
I already started to practice coding problems, but my question is, should I keep applying in case I don’t get hired, or should I wait until I do the coding assessment? 
I feel like I have a lot to do with all my classes plus now having to study and practice for two coding interviews, but I also don’t want to potentially miss opportunities. 
What do you guys think?
Can’t wait to get that first internship!"
iqn2gi,1,2020-09-11,Should I take the offer?,Ad9866,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iqn2gi/should_i_take_the_offer/,"I've been working in a big financial firm in one of the cities in the Eastern Europe for the last 3 years. Ever since I joined I wanted to get relocation to London. But in order to apply internally for a position in London, you need to have an appropriate seniority ""level"".  Also I am from the country outside of EU and it is really hard to find a job in London for me there, because I would need a working visa.

During my first year I was an intern working part time and finishing my degree. Then I got an offer to join as a full-time analyst. In this firm usually you are promoted to the next ""level"", after 2 years of experience. But company refused to count internship as an experience, so now I had to work for 3.5 years to get to the next level(which will happen only this January). Of course they pay lower for the lower level, so the logic here is to get better skilled workers for lower pay.

While on my path I also got a bad feeling that this company is really not what it seemed like. Senior management is playing games with you all the time by never telling you the full picture and lie to you you to make you do more. Once I ended up in a situation working on the weekends and till midnight. And yet, that didnt effect my promotion in the future. They only paid overtime and that's it. 

The workload was so crazy recently and I got manipulated by the manager again, so I decided to resign few weeks ago. During the discussion management said that there is an open position in London and I should apply there. They said that ""we might be able to make it through for you"". However, when I talked with colleague in that team in London, he said that they already interviewed two very good candidates. 

To be fair, the position is not what I want to do and if I could choose, I would never apply for that one. But it is in London as I wanted. Now I think that even if they give job to me they will underpay me significantly. Also I would have to stay at least one year at the new position before resigning, otherwise I would have to pay back the ""relocation fee"".

I am very confused about the situation and also really tired of the constant manipulation. Do you think I should continue with this opportunity and stick to this firm?"
iqn2wi,1,2020-09-11,Can't decide. On-site vs Virtual Internship. Help?,Firefries99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iqn2wi/cant_decide_onsite_vs_virtual_internship_help/,"I've heard a lot that virtual internships are useless since its all about getting immersed into the work environment and learning from others. But i also heard that getting a remote job makes it easier to get more remote jobs (ie. It proves that you can make it work, which would be nice).

I'm currently studying Computer Science in Malaysia and I'm supposed to do an internship in Dec 2020 till March 2021 as part of my program. I can either: 

1. Get an internship with a local Malaysian company in-office 
- OR - 
2. Get a virtual internship with a US company (through an organisation that hooks global students up with US companies)

I've heard tech and SWE jobs in Malaysia are not that great. There are limited opportunities for growth and many use outdated software. And since I'm not Malaysian, I most likely won't be working here after I graduate. 
Yet I'm also worried that an in-office internship is more valuable regardless of the hiring company. If I go with the US placement, I might miss out on the in-person internship benefits. What makes it harder to decide is that I'm not sure what US company I'll end up with through the program. AND I have to pay an application fee for the program, so I have to make sure I really am interested before applying. 


TL;DR -- What's generally more valuable for a CS career future? An in-person internship with a local Malaysian company or a virtual internship with an American company?

Feel free to ask for more clarification. I'd really appreciate ANY guidance or sharing of experience with virtual internships, thanks :)"

iqo0u7,39,2020-09-11,CV review for a German CS student,Tobinatore,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/iqo0u7/cv_review_for_a_german_cs_student/,"Hi everyone,

I'm in the 5th semester of the computer science course at the Technical University Dresden.

I'm planning to do a summer internship next year and need a bit of help polishing my CV before applying. I especially consider applying at Google, so I'm trying to optimize my CV as much as possible.

Some key points where I'm unsure what to do:

* When I look at other CVs, most of the time there are metrics such as ""improved ... by ...%"". I do not have such data for my work. Are these clauses mostly embellishment or is there usually tangible data behind these claims?
* I do have a letter of recommendation of the company I worked at. Should I include that when applying or would it just be something the recruiter won't care about?
* How important are grades when applying for an internship at Google in relation to previous work experience and private projects? Let's say I hover around 2.7 - 3.0 in grades (with 1.0 being the best and 5.0 the worst), should I even bother applying or will my application be thrown out by an automated system anyways?

You can find an anonymized version of my CV [here](https://imgur.com/a/ogLAgoh).

Thanks in advance to everyone who has a look. :)"

 Hey, here are 23 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
iqp4vi,9,2020-09-11,"job hunt, resume critique, burnout",chirag9696,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/iqp4vi/job_hunt_resume_critique_burnout/,"I am pursuing an internship right now and I'm unsure about getting it converted to full-time once the internship ends. In the meantime, I am looking for new opportunities. I have a year of experience as a junior Software Engineer in fintech back in my home country.

**My skills (as per proficiency) -**

* Intermediate: Python, C++,  JavaScript, Deep Learning, data structures, algorithms, web-application development, software engineering.
* Basic: AWS, Distributed Systems, System Design, Design patterns, Kafka, NodeJS

**Preparation** \- I've been preparing(algorithms + leetcoding + system design) for SDE opportunities from 2 months now after my internship work hours. I've applied for 200+ relevant jobs in the past couple of months, but haven't got any great +ve response from anyone.

I got through the SDE internship interviews at Amazon for 2021 but failed the full-time interviews at HRT, Citadel, and few promising startups(Glovo, Stripe, etc.)

**Need advice** \- I don't know what is wrong with my Resume. It feels I have a lot of things that make it difficult for recruiters to understand what I want. (especially in terms of domain because my experience is a mix of Deep Learning + Full-stack development). I need strong criticisms on my resume which I am attaching hereby. Please help me.

**Burnout phase** \-

I don't blame the COVID situation right now as its difficult for everyone. I work 6.5+ hours daily in my internship and then I study late nights for \~ 2 hours (leetcoding / system design) on weekdays. On my weekends I study \~10+ hours (\~4 hours: leetcoding | \~4 hours: ReactJS, nodeJS =&gt; building toy projects | \~4 hours: System design)

I am into this schedule for 2 months now and I feel extremely exhausted mentally. I always want to learn more and absorb as much as possible pertaining to CS. I am losing hopes of getting a new full-time job. At times I just keep staring at my laptop for a while and do nothing. All the job preparation thing has taken a toll on my mental health and I don't have a way to get out of this. (If I go on a break, in the back of my mind I feel, I am losing time and I start wishing I could have invested it in studying or learning something new)

I don't understand why companies expect so much from junior engineers. It just doesn't feel good being in tech and I am 25 now. I'm afraid if I can continue with this pressure for more than 3/4 years ahead.

[Click here for my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJO7zOPAzLyiZk4DT_Ytxt1WF67TRY6T/view)

Need help + suggestions + resume criticisms + advice.

Thanks, everyone."
iqpdpc,7,2020-09-11,Connecting to a server using Filezilla constantly causes the GnuTLS error -110: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated.,racrisnapra666,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/iqpdpc/connecting_to_a_server_using_filezilla_constantly/,"Hey there,

I've been interning at this company and they require us to upload all files to their FTP server. I've been using the FileZilla FTP Client and for the last 1.5 months, things have been going great... until last night. Since last night, it has been constantly returning this error to me:

`Error:	GnuTLS error -110: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated.`

`Status:	Server did not properly shut down TLS connection`

`Error:	The data connection could not be established: ECONNABORTED - Connection aborted`

I checked out with other interns and they aren't having any problems. Neither is anyone else. As a result, the superiors are saying that something might be wrong on my end. I tried out every solution that I could, but it still returns this error.

One solution that partly worked was in a blog post that asked to change the Encryption standard from **Use Explicit FTP over TLS if available** to **Only use plain FTP (insecure).** It connected me to the server and showed me the initial directory listing. But upon accessing an inner directory, it shows:

 `The connection timed out after 20 seconds.` 

Have any of you faced this problem? If so, could you shed some light on this? 

Thanks."

For those struggling out there, I hope to tell yall that life is so much better now in Uni. Yes, its not easy but I am kinda enjoying it now. Of course that's provided you guys choose something you like or at least don’t mind doing. 

So, for my fellow Alevel juniors, if yall are feeling stressed or screwed or suicidal, think of the better life ahead you will soon have. Very soon.   

No more 6am mornings to go to school, but I have started to wake up at 6 or even 5:30 just to study. Then what's the diff then? The diff is that I am waking up willingly and am very satisfied that before noon, I could usually clock 5 hours plus of studies. The biggest change is probably my attitude towards school and studying in general. I can’t say I am very very passionate but at least I like what I am studying now and I know what I am studying for. Back in JC, I didn’t know what's the point of studying especially when I hated some subjects really badly eg. H2 Chem haha. 

My point is, if yall are feeling what I felt back then, aimless and dreading to sit down and study, what you need to do is just knowing what's your purpose of studying. In all honesty, mine now is just to get hopefully a 4.0 GPA and grab as many opportunities to secure good internships, exchange and eventually my dream job. 

So what should all of your aim be now? Don’t tell me 90RP. Not that its impossible, but is that what you really want? I personally think that many of us really just want to get to Uni. Or at least that was my mentally back then when I was less than a hundred days to my first paper. So don’t ever use the 90RP to stress yourself out again. Don’t ever do that! Its really dumb and counter productive.

Another point I want to emphasize is that if yall are finding it very difficult to sit down and study, thinking that all your effort might not even be fruitful, you are so wrong. That was what I thought back then too. But after going into Uni, meeting so many people of different backgrounds, some stalking on LinkedIn and talking to seniors, quite a handful of them didn’t do very well back in sec school or even jc, but what made a diff was that they did not give up studying. So just sit you’re a** down and start studying. You never know the results until it's printed on ur cert.

Even if you can only study for 3 hours, just study that 3 hours. Don’t think that its so little compared to others and hence not studying totally. That’s really dumb. In that 3 hours, you might come across one question that may be tested and hence u may score 1RP more. And that cumulates if you get what I mean. 76 could get you into FASS but a 75 might not… 

Lastly, on a more personal note, if yall are struggling with rs problems, hear this out. Today I properly talked to my ex for the first time since we parted last year. And yes, before my As. He felt so foreign to me, just like another guy friend. Though deep down I still love him, and I know we might never be together ever again, it was good to still be able to chat him up casually over text. Yes I admit I was feeling a bit down today and hence taking some time off to chill and write this too. My point is, eventually that someone you are hung up on might just be another friend of urs. So don’t ever slacken on ur studies cos of that person. Ur RP will follow you for life even if it doesn't determine your life… U get what I mean. So just focus on ur exams pls. There will be plenty of opportunities to date or do whatever yall want in Uni. Just saying, uni guys quite desperate so girls don’t worry that yall don’t have that SO in your grad pic. 4 weeks into Uni I have already met quite a few impressive guys.

Anyways forgive me if my thoughts are all over, I just hope to share my experience and hopefully change some of your mindsets and cheer yall on to study!!! Its not fun but hopefully next time this year yall can share your growth too! 

One last thing is that, some ranting posts here are quite toxic. Yes it's a rant but to those who really just want to get the best out of this subreddit, y'all can read those rants but don't let them affect u mentally. Yes some people are struggling, but that doesn't mean it's fine that u struggle too. Try to help them if u can, but don't think that oh there are people who haven't finished revision so you are safe too! No! There's also people who are mugging and can't be bothered to waste time on reddit. U get me..




Ps. If u ever read this J, nice talking to you jn! I just wished that we met now, with both of us more matured and truly knowing how to communicate what we want and what are priorities are."

I’ve done three different data science internships during my time at college but I want to shift to Data Engineering because I feel that the goals/success metrics are more clearly defined than in DS. Also I'm finding myself liking the programming side of things more and more and growing less fond of the statistics and math sides of things.
Does it make sense to pivot, especially if I want a full-time position right after graduation? I want to commit to DE but I see that there aren't that many junior roles normally open for this type of position and the pandemic is making things worse. (If I search on LinkedIn I can find 2021 new grad DS positions... But only a handful ""junior"" data engineer positions show up and many of them require 3-5 years of experience)"

iqvxdp,2,2020-09-11,Career Advise: Quitting a full time job in an unrelated field for an internship?,dxjaguar,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iqvxdp/career_advise_quitting_a_full_time_job_in_an/,"This is going to be a long post. Find TL;DR at the end.

As the question says, I am trying to decide if I should quit my full time job so I can pursue internships in mechanical engineering. I know similar questions have been asked before and I have thoroughly searched the depths of Reddit to avoid asking the same question but I didn't find anything that was similar to my situation so I decided to ask the engineering czars.

Here is some background: I am in my mid-twenties, I am married and have a child. I studied business in college and after a few promotions I managed to get an Associate Director position at a small fin-tech company with reasonable career potential. I enjoy my job but I have always wanted to study engineering so after thoughtful consideration I decided to enroll in school again and get a 2nd bachelor's in mechanical engineering. I am currently in my 2nd year and take about 12-14 credits per semester. Needless to say, I have been extremely busy given all my responsibilities but it's been manageable. My position is fully remote so I work from home and they are extremely flexible when it comes to my class schedule. They have a ""we don't care what hours you work, as long as you get the work done"" type of attitude so they support the fact that I am a student. My wife is also extremely supportive and understanding.

Now down to the details. I have very little on the job engineering experience, other than school projects. I consider myself a decent designer (CREO, SolidWorks and Inventor) and have a solid project management experience (could probably sit for the PMP by the time I'm done with my BS in MechE) and have done well in all my science and engineering classes.

I have read dozens of posts about engineering internships and the vast majority of people say to get as many as you can. I am not opposed to internships but my situation is slightly more complex than the situation of a 19 year old sophomore that can pack up and move across the country for a summer. I have been considering quitting my full time job to do internships during the summer and then figure something else out during the school year but I am so conflicted. I am worried that I will quit my job to then get an internship that will not teach me much (I was an intern during my business major twice and they were kind of slow and the job was super easy, nothing that stretched me).

Now, I don't want to come across as arrogant, and my current pay is nothing to be jealous of but we live a comfortable lifestyle (eating out, entertainment, a few local trips a year, etc) and luckily we haven't had to scramble for money but this would definitely change if I quit my job to get an internship. Also, my wife is currently not working as she is finishing up school herself so quitting my job doesn't only affect me. I have enough savings to get us through about a year and a half  without working but ideally I would like to use that for a down payment on a house after I graduate. So far my tuition has been fully paid for by scholarships and grants but that may not be the case for the entire duration of my program. I know my job would not give me the whole summer off for an internship, so quitting would be my only option.

So to those of you that have started your careers or that hire engineers: What would you do in my position? Would you quit the job and pursue internships? Or would you let this job fund you through school and focus on personal projects you can then showcase to employers? Do you think I stand a good shot of getting hired relatively quickly upon graduation if I choose the latter? How much did your internships help you?

I will **really** appreciate any advice you have.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am considering quitting a full time job in an unrelated field to pursue internships in mechanical engineering, I am married with a child so I am financially responsible for my family. I am conflicted because I don't know how much the internships will help me and I'm worried it could just be busy/easy work. What would you recommend I do based on your experience?"

I would like to work as a software engineer because I like programming.  Currently, I am not getting any job offers but plenty of rejection letters. 

In conjunction with my previous CS coursework and projects, will a masters in software engineering help me get get hired for an entry-level programming job?  I am really close to applying for admission into a SE masters program but I would like some feedback before I do.  Hell, I am even considering getting a second bachelors in CS through Oregon State U's post-baccalaureate program."

I'm a computer science major graduating in May of 2021. I also have a job already lined up but I am afraid they will somehow find out I was fired and cancel my job. I also am worried about jobs in the future after I have worked at this one job.

How devastating is it to get fired? Does every employer I ever apply to now know I was fired? I feel like I have learned a lot but I do not know how to recover if it is ever asked about. I feel like I should omit my internship from my resume as I am a CS major but my internship is help desk support, but I just don't know. How are you supposed to describe this? Can I pretend it never happened and move on?

I actually had talked to my manager about my tardiness and absences and had worked on it for a few weeks now. However HR came to the conclusion that I should've been fired anyways. I feel like I have overcome the weaknesses in me that was causing me to miss work, so I'm less worried about how I can improve and more worried about how to get back into the work force"
iqxmzb,2,2020-09-11,Stay in University an extra year for more internships or grad and try for junior developer positions?,mvzzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iqxmzb/stay_in_university_an_extra_year_for_more/,"Hi everyone,   


I'm in my final year of Software Engineering and am scheduled to graduate in August 2021. My final year will be entirely online, which has made me consider delaying my grad by a year to avoid this. I've had 4 internships in my degree, all at smaller, lesser known companies, and have been working for the last year at my most recent internship as a (non-intern) software developer part time while I finish school.   


I enjoy my current job and have learned/done a lot in both the front and back end of webapp development, as well as mobile development, but I want to move upwards into more well-known, better paying positions in my career. In your opinion, is it preferable to stay in school an extra year to try and get some better internships, or finish up with school and begin to look as a junior developer? Keep in mind that my current job provides a safety net for me if I can't find any worthwhile internships, so the only 'loss' would be the year-delayed graduation.  


Thanks!"

I would appreciate your thoughts and opinions on this matter. But in the end I’ll still apply to these schools and shoot my best shots even if these schools are tough for me to get in. 
Demographics: 
NYC Brooklyn
Gender: Male 
Race: Asian/Chinese 
Income bracket:~32K a year 
Intended major: Biology (purely out of interest)/undecided 

Hooks: First gen?, *Are Asians minorities?*, low income?, LGBTQ? Not sure how these would help or disadvantage me tbh 

Weighted GPA: ~96.5/100 if converted into 4.0 scale I’ll say it’s 3.75+ 
Class rank: We don’t have that since it’s a big school. 
Sat Score: 1410 (640 English/770 Math) 
7 Ap classes: Sophomore: Ap comp sci principal (4) 
Junior: Ap bio (4), Ap Eng Lang (4) 
Senior: Ap Chemistry, Ap Macroeconomic, Ap Calc AB, Ap psychology 

Extracurricular Activity: (terrible bc it’s not related to my intended major and I joined some of them pretty late) 

Badminton Club: Joined 9th grade-present/Vice President Junior and senior year 
It was so darn fun playing badminton in the cafetería every Friday. We had 120+ members and I stayed really late (6-7PM) to play badminton &amp; watch over members. Ik it’s just a club but this is literally one of the best memories of my high school years and it’s very important to me. 

Community service: Library book buddy (70 hours) + Librarians of Tomorrow school year internship program (180 hours)+Summer Ambassador (85 hour) 
Joined 10th grade-Present 
*I was gonna do a carnivorous plant display and activity program for little kids for my capstone project for this internship but Covid-19 ruined it so I wrote a 15 page paper on how I would implement it. For the summer ambassador program I helped to host 3 virtual LGBTQ wellness programs covering 3 topics: Everything LGBTQ, Stereotypes &amp; Mental Health and Queer Culture, Society &amp; Religion.* 

Envirothon Team: Co-President senior year 
I joined 11th grade-Present. I competed in the annual envirothon competition and our team won 1st place regional and 5th place in NY state. 

Tutoring Service Association (School club): 
Joined 11th grade-Present. I tutored ap biology, regular chemistry and Spanish level 3 to students every Wednesday. 

Essay: I am working on it at this very moment. I am not 100% sure what I will write about but it’s probably going to be related to my childhood memories of staying at the library literally every single week and being a bookworm lmao. I think I can also discuss how much I love and appreciate libraries (they saved me from failing third grade *bc I just moved from China to the US* thanks to me actively reading books there) and how my experience there has helped me deal with homophobia and come out to my close friends as queer. Alternatively I’ll just write about how I am passionate about growing carnivorous plants… I’m not sure lol. My writing skill isn’t that good tbh so I’m pretty scared that my essay might be the weakest part of my application. 

Rec letters: 
Guidance Counselor: 
Since our school is large (6,000 students) most of us do not interact with our guidance counselor. Every junior had to fill out a survey that lets them know more about us. I wrote 6,000 words in the survey about my background and interests so I’m pretty sure my rec letter won’t be too generic. 

Precalc Teacher: I don’t think my pre calc teacher knows me well outside of the classroom but I did participate a lot in class. I got a 98/100 in her class. I gave her a 3,000 word brag sheet and she told me I pretty much wrote a rec for myself with the amount of info I gave her lol. 

Ap Biology Teacher: I’m pretty cool with my Ap biology teacher. I participated a lot and he knows how obsessed I am with carnivorous plants (I gave him a Venus flytrap during the beginning of the year) and that I really liked biology. I did really well in his class and he was pretty happy to write me a rec letter when I asked him. I provided him with a 3,100 word brag sheet tailored to how much I like nature and what I did in envirothon that would help him write about me. 

Supplemental rec from my internship coordinator: I knew him very well during my internship program. He can discuss my accomplishment and my personal qualities in my letter of recommendation. I gave him a 2,400 word brag sheet that discusses my personality, interest, accomplishments, stuff I want him to mention etc. He’s a strong writer and I’m sure he will have a lot of great things to say in my letter of rec. 
So I’m pretty confident that my letter of recommendation would help my application. 
 
Given these info what are my chances to Cornell, NYU, URochester,Stony Brook, and BU? *I wrote this without double checking so it’s gonna have a shit ton of typos and grammar mistakes.* Also thanks for reading this :) I hope you guys can give me some advice too!"

1)Should I remove the projects at the end?

2) How to lower to 1 page/what to remove or add

3)Is Calibri, size 11, with 0.5 margins ideal?

4)For my research section, should I use present tense if I am currently working on?

I want to make graduation my #1 priority, but I also know that developing experience is extremely important during university. It’s like I’m screwed either way. If I focus on school, no one will hire me without work experience. If I focus on internships and developing experience, I might not pay attention to my schoolwork and if I don’t graduate I won’t have a career at all. Does anyone else feel similarly?

For the first time in my life I feel like I have it all under control and can handle anything that comes my way. I currently have 1 more year left of college and I’m honestly excited to tackle it all, which is the exact opposite of how I’ve always felt in the past.

However, the thing that I still can’t get a handle on is my sleep schedule. It’s not because of the adderall, it’s always been a huge issue for me. No matter what I do throughout the day I generally just don’t feel very tired at night and can’t bring myself to try to sleep until I can barely keep my eyes open. I’ll get into bed at midnight, planning to sleep until 8 or 9, and next thing I know it’s 3 and I’m on my phone doing literally anything but sleep. 

It’s almost like sleep requires some level of focus that I can’t seem to muster so I just wait until I’m tired enough to do it with ease. Which would be fine if it wasn’t fucking brutal to wake up. In the past I’ve missed so many morning classes it’s ridiculous, you wouldn’t believe how many I’ve just not been able to get myself up in time for.

It’s frustrating because I know getting up early just makes my day so much more productive, and I’m also starting a part time internship soon that is going to require me to wake up early every day (7, 8 am at the latest). Anyone else have this problem and any advice that might help make it a little easier to wind down and get to sleep at a reasonable hour?"

I have been looking for work but no luck yet. 

My question(s) is: 

do I qualify for unemployment since I technically left the job willingly (I left two weeks before school started to give myself a break)? 

Does this situation still fall under loss of employment as a result of COVID-19? 

The restaurant gave me a letter in march to submit if needed. It is still not re-opened. But I am wondering if having the temporary position has made it impossible to receive COVID relief (even though the reason I worked the temp gig to begin with was because of COVID)

I started the filing today but I am worried that if I claim a loss of income the wrong way, I will have to pay it back or something. This is in Colorado.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was at uni I took a year off to complete an internship as an internal IT support. A year later I stayed with the company and moved into an infrastructure engineering role where I was working on building out our Azure cloud infrastructure, templating IaC, building automation pipelines, and working on creating production Kubernetes clusters. A year later (current year) I have moved to a top software company as a graduate consultant. I have never worked directly with clients or this company's products before and so far, the first 9 months have consisted of learning, training, and getting certified in our products.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if it's due to the nature of how the graduate program is run and lack of excitement but in the last 2 months I have struggled to stay motivated with my training and goal of attaining a second company certification. Part of recent training, as graduates we are put into teams to work on a mock engagement with senior consultants who act as our customers. The senior consultants have been brutal and are acting as difficult customers. I'm definitely feeling the pressure of delivering the project on schedule with lack of experience and knowledge in consulting. 

I was questioning if I was burnt out by all the study and learning, but I don't think I am (it's a different feeling). So, the next question is am I in the wrong role? Am I just sick of not doing ""real"" work?

In the past few weeks I've been more active in browsing for different types of roles more around cloud/Azure work and I've been questioning if I've made the right choice to move into this role. Is this also a sign of some sort?

Am I just complaining for no reason, do I suck it up and see how it goes after the graduate year.

In my second one, I got one of the most disliked question on leetcode that involved a med/hard bit manipulation. I never went past this question to find the next one.

I thought I was just unlucky, but now after talking to some friends who were STEP interns, they got array palindrome and reverse a linked list. (They were sophmores as well, same class but girls) All easy-trival questions. No medium tagged.

Now, I feel betrayed because I thought it was my fault for my rejection but Google turned out to be a sexist organisation.

After finishing school this summer I was not able to go back home because of the pandemic, and I was not able to find a part-time job, so I decided to spend my vacation working on something that will help me:

* go through the summer break without going insane :D 
* Make some  income
* Increase my chances at lending future internships at good companies (I want to intern at Google because I heard they have good engineers and I want to learn good engineering practices)

**Background:**

* Software engineering student at uOttawa going into my third year this winter
* Two previous internships, started the third one this week (mostly working on Java backend development)
* Lots of unfinished software side projects (mostly 2D video games), lots of projects (DIY and other stuff, I like solving problems with my creations)

**Project idea and motives:**

([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.fjsoftware.startend))

I decided to make a multiplayer word mobile game and monetize it with rewarded ads and in-app purchases. This will allow me to:

* Go through the full development cycle of a product
* Learn how to use remote APIs
* Learn how to use remote databases
* Get familiar with building a product and then releasing it to the public and maintaining it
* Familiarize myself with the mobile world (though it is not my end goal)
* Mobile word games can go viral and can be easily ported to other languages so the income potential is huge

**Technologies:**

* Framework: Flutter
* Baas: Firebase (Firebase Auth, Firesotre, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Storage)
* Version Control: Git and Github 
* CI: Github Actions (did not do a lot of testing though because I kept changing the design and architecture)

I heard about Flutter during a hackathon earlier this year so I decided to go with it because I found it easy to learn and it is possible to release the app for both iOS and Android with basically no additional work. Also, Firebase works really well with Flutter and is basically a free service. These also are Google technologies so that’s a bonus point.

**Features:**

* Random challenge generator (millions of possible challenges to keep the game entertaining)
* Matchmaking system to match players doing the same challenge (efficient system even with millions of possible challenges)
* Ladder system able to handle millions of players at a constant time (O(1))
* Word validation
* Avatars and background customization (to monetize the app, I made it so that I can easily add these without having the user update the app)
* Daily reward system
* Google sign in, anonymous sign in, sign in with email and password
* I have more features in mind that I will add once I have a good user base

**Architecture:**

I used the MVC design pattern and a lot of Services to handle the business logic (auth service, database service…)

**Marketing:**

I still haven’t started marketing the app yet so I still do not have a lot of users but I will work on that from now on. I wanted to build a website ([link](http://startend.fjsoftware.io/)) for the app first which I did yesterday (using React, because Flutter still has no SEO).

I fixed a deadline for myself and decided to release the app by August 31st which I did even though the app was not as polished as I wanted, then I spent the next few days fixing bugs and working on the website.

So I would appreciate some feedback on my project. Unfortunately, I cannot share my code with you because it contains my API keys. Maybe I should save them in Firebase and retrieve them on the app start to keep them safe.

Also, I would appreciate it if someone could tell me how to mention this project in my resume.

Thank you for your time!"

Need advice from people in the Industry?,I-am-a-CapitalistPig,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/irigtu/how_competitive_is_this_field_really_need_advice/,"I recently switched to a CS major this year, after getting used to programming and my classes I'm now thinking about life after college. How hard is it to get in a mid-size Co? How hard is it to get into Big N? I don't mind building a ton of projects to put on my resume, I just haven't had time for it yet. I don't mind doing a ton of LC questions either. I'm taking a year longer to graduate and give myself enough time to adjust to this field and really hone my skills because I'm coming from a non-stem major. Although I have been course-overloading and I'm on time to graduate, I rather build projects, and leetcode. 

 What I don't get is why getting internships or jobs are so difficult? Why are students trying to get into FAANG so early. Is moving from Mid-size Co. to Big N or F500 that hard. Every time I go to r/csMajors I get so discouraged, I see freshmen with tons of projects to make me jealous, stellar resume and they tell tales of sending a hundreds of applications and hearing nothing back. Now, are they just misguided or is it just that hard? I don't think you should even apply to FAANG unless you have enough experience with a smaller company, but maybe I'm wrong and its just as hard for smaller companies as well.

This goes for new grads as well, won't it be more beneficial to take a 60-70K job after school, while you leetCode and job search for Big N  than just being unemployed for 10-18 months looking for a job. Or maybe, I'm underestimating how hard it is to get that mid-paying job and LeetCode + side-projects is not alone to get you there. Or maybe Big N, blackballs you for working for a less prestigious company because that's how a lot of people make it seem.

Also, is there actually a demand in this field? I feel like I was sold the dream to programming. Now I have been passionate about computers and solving problems since I was a kid, but I always saw this as some hobby and not being able to make money from it. Where am from, Computer science is not common. I remember telling my counselor in HS I wanted to be a programmer and they put me in a business program, fucked up my life trajectory for like 6 years LOL. Found out about CS second year in college. Me being pragmatic I wanted a way to do something that was fun but still marketable, so I switched. But now I'm getting cold feet."
irivt8,2,2020-09-12,Resume,unpaul,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/irivt8/resume/,"Hello - I am wanting to get involved with applying for software internships. I do not have previous internship experience, but I was involved in the development process of a large gaming network as a quality assurance specialist in 2016, I work in retail right now, and I have taken many university classes of CS and math while I was in high school. I am attending a “target” (I think) school that has a good CS program (I’ll provide more detail in PM’s), and I am currently a freshman. 

I want to apply to some of the programs targeted towards freshmen and sophomores (STEP, MS Explore, FBU, etc.), I’m also really interested in Target Corp’s software internship (already applied, but pending), as well as other internships. I need help with my resume (maybe resume review?) and maybe some advice of some internships I should be applying for that I have a good shot towards doing. Would anyone be willing to help me out in PM’s? It would really mean a lot!"
irjodn,1178,2020-09-12,I've reviewed thousands of applications for university recruiting at a startup. Here’s a bit of what I look for when reviewing an application. (Part 2),NullPointer1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/irjodn/ive_reviewed_thousands_of_applications_for/,"I've been a hiring manager for a US-based university recruiting at my unicorn of a few hundred people. As a follow up to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/inrex1/ive_reviewed_thousands_of_applications_for/), I thought I’d share a bit about how I go about reviewing applications. Also, if you aren’t aware of the [Resume FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_resumes), this is a really amazing resource and I would check that out first. My post here represents one specific viewpoint whereas that advice is more broad and generic.

*Edit:* **One thing to note is my experience is only in the context of a Unicorn (which is competitive with FAANG). In our case we have tens of thousands of applications but we only have the capacity to interview a couple hundred.**

Here’s a bit of the behind the scenes for how I review applications:

* Frankly, application review is not my full time job, so usually I end up doing this after work hours. Typically I might spend 30-60 minutes reviewing applications before decision fatigue sets in.
* Most applications would be pretty clear after about 5 seconds of reviewing. Probably 5% would be an obvious yes and 75% would be an obvious no.
* The other 20% of the cases take up 90% of the time. If your applications is in that 20%, then I’ll take some more time to look through all the details. If you provide links like personal websites or Github, I'll probably click into that.

When reviewing a resume, here is the rough order of things I’ll look for:

* *Industry Experience.* Having an internship at Facebook, Google, or another highly prestigious company on your resume probably makes you a yes most of the time. Otherwise I'd look into the details of what you did in your various roles. If you had an internship where you just pushed code around, that doesn't show much. But if you had an internship where you built and ~~shipped something that was used by a million users, or halved the latency of all requests~~ solved a really challenging but really impactful problem, then that's probably an automatic yes. Because of this, I’ve often preferred candidates who interned at startups and were forced to play an impactful role in the company over candidates who joined a less tech focused F500 company.
* *University.* I’ll be the first to admit that I’m ashamed at how high this is. There are a number of reasons that which university should not be this high: (1) it is highly correlated to how well off your family is, (2) it only reflects on what you accomplished in high school and ignores what you accomplished in college. Unfortunately, university rankings are still the most reliable standardization out there. There is still a correlation between where your university and your success in interviews and your success in industry. If you go to a top 5 CS school, you’re a bit more likely to be a yes than a no if everything else on your resume looks solid. Granted, if you're at MIT but you haven't shown much else in any of the other categories, then you’re still going to find yourself to be a no in most cases.
* *Teaching Experience.* I've found that being a TA is one of the signals that helps separate soft skills the most. I appreciate candidates who have deep knowledge of a topic, can empathize with where someone else might be coming from in their understanding, and bridge that gap. If you haven’t done so already, **I highly recommend talking with your professor about becoming a TA.**
* *Projects.* There's a ton of nuance in projects listed, so I’ll go into more detail.
   * School project in your introductory CS sequence - this doesn't show me anything that would separate you from everyone else.
   * Hackathon(or similar) project - This shows me you probably have a genuine interest in learning new technology and building software. Also in this category are clones of apps.
   * Research project / Project teams - This shows me that you take initiative to dive deep into academic areas that interest you. It’s even better if the research project requires you to work with a team.
   * Open Source Project - There's a ton of nuance here, but if you're making contributions to a critical library or if you decided to build something from scratch and it has some traction, that looks awesome.
   * Productionized application solving a real world problem that has real users - I would love to get you an interview ASAP. You don’t need revenue, funding, or even a startup, but there is no shortage of real world problems where software can help. If you can honestly say you’ve dedicated a significant chunk of time to this, feel free to put it on your work experience too. The best part of this is that unlike internships of university, this is 100% in your control. I cannot stress this enough - **show me that you can solve a real world problem with software and have real people use what you built.**
* *Coursework.* Computer science is still the gold standard in software engineering, but you can still succeed without a CS degree as long as you show that you’re not shying away from project heavy classes and still understand basic CS theory. I generally like candidates who are taking more advanced courses (like grad level classes) and/or more programming heavy courses (like compilers or operating systems).
* *Extracurriculars.* Candidates that take initiative and can handle large amounts of responsibility are great. In addition to displaying leadership, extracurriculars also show me how you are striving for excellence in the things that you enjoy doing. Show me your passion for sports, dance, theatre, or whatever and the things that you've done to push yourself in those areas.
* *Degree.* BS vs BA doesn’t make a difference. Having a Masters is a slight bump, but if you can get your Bachelors + Masters degrees in 4 or 4.5 years, then that’s pretty impressive.
* *GPA.* Honestly, GPA doesn’t really matter too much. If you leave it off your resume, I’ll probably just assume it’s lower than a 3.0, but that also probably wouldn’t be a dealbreaker. If it’s really good, that would be a slight bump. However, I’ve seen people with a 4.0 that fail in industry roles where soft skills and the ability to handle ambiguity are important.
* *Skills.* I wouldn’t care too much if you included this. When hiring new grads we don’t hire for the programming languages they know or don’t know. However, if you have experience with iOS and you’re applying to a company with a big mobile presence, maybe you should put it on your resume.
* *Cover Letter.* I almost never look at the cover letter.
* *Work Authorization.* We don’t have a team capable of handling immigration for more than a handful of people, usually reserved for leadership and extremely senior positions. If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, it would be beneficial to add it.

General advice:

* Less can be more. I’m browsing through applications quickly, so be sure that any key words or accomplishments don’t get missed because your resume is too cluttered. Imagine that my eyes are jumping around the page, looking for key phrases. If you’re describing your previous internship, instead of describing what you did week by week, find 1 bullet point that encapsulates the work you did the entire summer. Then add 2-3 additional ones describing the most impactful or most challenging parts that made up that project. And please make sure your resume fits on one page - I sometimes don’t even think to scroll down when reviewing a resume.
* When going into the details of your work, avoid jargon that the average technical recruiter wouldn’t know. There is a fine art in communicating accomplishments without going into too much detail, but it helps to imagine yourself explaining it out loud to a friend.
* Show me the impact of your work. In general, software engineers are responsible for solving real world problems with code. I know that it can be tempting to talk about the technical details of what you did, but be sure to show the impact that it had.

Keep in mind that this post just reflects my thoughts and there are plenty of other companies and other people that review applications that are looking for different things. Please don't overfit your application to one single narrow viewpoint. If you’re in a role that also reviews applications, I’d love to hear your thoughts as well. Let me know your thoughts and if there's any other topic you'd like to learn more about."

irkv1u,1,2020-09-12,Should I take this Job or keep Venturing?,cigaretttesaftersex,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/irkv1u/should_i_take_this_job_or_keep_venturing/,"  

First off, I am a long-time lurker and this is my first ever post. I recently graduated (23M) with a bachelors In Mathematics and a double minor in economics and statistics with a concentration in Actuarial Sciences/ Data Analytics. I’m not fully sure if it was just me not getting lucky or just not having enough credentials (no Internship experience, maybe not good enough grades, no Actuarial exams passed) but I did not find a job from May until the creation of this post in my field. I recently got an offer to be a Financial Advisor at a good firm which is only paid either fully commission based or half stable half commission. Upon asking family and friends about whether or not I should accept the offer they advised me to take it to learn and gain experience and if down the line I don’t like it I could always leave and do something else. My reservations about this job are as follows:

   1. It Requires a lot of interactions with Clients (which I have to basically find by myself) 

   2. I have to create a healthy client base or ways to consistently keep finding clients which means some form of advertising or making meetings (which I don’t even know how to even begin doing so) and be extremely diligent in my own business because I’ll get paid based on the amount of work I put in per se. 

  3. I have to pass 4 licensing exams in the next 10 weeks to be considered a professional advisor, which I have to pay for (two I pay for and two the company pays for). 

I never imagined I would be put in this position I assumed I would just have to wait a few months of applying and just get something in my field (I want to blame COVID for it). I enjoy working with data and manipulating and analyzing it. I wouldn’t say I’m 100% an introvert as in I can be social if I have to but I imagined myself being somewhat in my own world doing my projects with a small team and simply presenting findings and explaining my projects in a meeting maybe once a month or so, but now my whole salary would be based off of interacting with people and basically selling my services and I don’t know how I feel about that. 

I’m torn between taking this position and basically embarking on a whole different career path then the one I imagined, considering all the studying and examinations (which you have to take yearly to stay in tip to shape) or not taking the offer and putting my efforts, and more of my money into studying for the actuarial exams and trying to pass those. 

Should I stick with my secure advising financial position or continue with my Actuarial/ Data Analyst path?"
irl7bx,1,2020-09-12,Resources for a new CS major?,BlueVelvetDoor,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/irl7bx/resources_for_a_new_cs_major/,"I was an English major up until recently. Currently in CC and wanna transfer over to UC Berkeley. Was going to minor in CS but thought I should just major in it instead with how many courses you need to take for even a minor degree.

I took CS classes back in high school as a part of the curriculum, but didn’t really like them. This is why I hadn’t thought of the CS major until recently. I, for some weird reason, got a major interest in coding. I legit have no idea why, but I did. Since then, I now know about GitHub (worth mentioning I got that student pack a few days ago), LeetCode, Codecademy, and other resources. I have some books on Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS as well that I’ll try my best to get to reading more of soon. I’m in a Python online course right now and learning how to use that.

What else can I do to increase my CS knowledge? I realize the importance of internships and the such for the future. I legit don’t know how to code at all though. I’m positive the Python course will help with this, but I’m still worried. What can I do to increase my knowledge and then go from there so I can finally code stuff? I wanna be able to do projects and and get “CS extracurriculars” in the summer at least.

I thankfully have a friend majoring in CS who is a great resource already."

irlgog,4,2020-09-12,Advice on Applying to Humanities PhD programs in the Pandemic Era,Sweet_Autumn,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/irlgog/advice_on_applying_to_humanities_phd_programs_in/,"Hi Folks, 

Thank you in advance for reading this long message! This is my first post, and I'm looking forward to engaging with the community. I graduated this May (2020) with a BA in Anthropology and minors in Economics and English from a medium sized, public university in the Midwest. As with the rest of the world, the pandemic has dramatically changed my plans. I am now home with my family and am working a remote internship. During my time as an undergraduate, I did a lot of research work in the fields of anthropology, decolonial studies, and cultural rhetorics. I really enjoy the research process and felt strongly about pursuing a PhD in the US. However, the following reasons are making me seriously rethink whether or not a PhD is the right path for me, and I'd like to hear your thoughts/suggestions/advice/considerations. 

1. Department culture and dynamics: I spent the last month conducting informational interviews with 18 current doctoral students in different anthropology programs across the nation (University of Michigan, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, Rutgers, Harvard, among others). Many troubling themes emerged from these interviews: normalization of hazing as academic rigor, little to no pedagogy training for graduate students teaching classes, serious toxicity in departments, professors and mentors humiliating students , serious issues with white supremacy. While none of this is new or surprising, it's the pervasiveness of these issues across department cultures that is making me rethink whether a PhD is the right path for me. Many of the folks I spoke to shared stories about marginalized students being bullied out of programs, students of color dropping out because of the alienation they experienced, and sexual harassment issues. Also, as a 22 year old South Asian WOC, I want to be cognizant of picking a department and mentors that will be sustainable for long term engagement as a student. 
2. Funding and Covid: I also spoke with a lot of administrators and faculty on review committees, who have indicated that all universities are entering the Fall 2019 semester with a deficit, which is only going to worsen the next academic year. Some PhD programs have completely closed admissions for Fall 2021 (U of Chicago's PhD in Philosophy program, Harvard's PhD in Education program, and UT Austin's PhD in History program). Additionally, these folks said that because of the job market and increased unemployment, more people are likely going to enter academia, which means more applications and fewer acceptances due to reduced funding. The big name schools offer better funding packages with health insurance; however, their department cultures are generally toxic and most of their faculty are not genuinely invested in their students. The smaller programs simply don't have enough funding which is further exacerbated by the pandemic. 
3. Is academia worth it?: The great advantage of a PhD is that it gives you the time and space to think about the questions that you keep coming back to. I am very invested in academic scholarship and the research process; however, I am just not sure if a PhD is worth the damage and harm that one incurs. Additionally, time to degree in anthropology is typically 6-10 years, which means the job market will change dramatically by the time I complete the program. I'm not interested in working as a professor or within academia, and I'm aware of how terrible the academic job market is. However, I am worried about the relevance of a PhD in a specific, niche humanities discipline. I am interested in questions of violence, which I recognize will always be relevant. But, it's challenging to communicate the value and relevance of a PhD to recruiters outside the academy coupled with the fear of being overqualified. While I do not see the PhD as a track to only find a ""good"" job, I do want to be realistic and think through the post PhD process as well. 
4. Masters or PhD: I can only afford a fully funded MA program. Not to toot my own horn, but many mentors have told me that I've already done Master's level work in my undergraduate time. I presented my research work 11 times at regional and national conferences. I have two academic publications (an article and a co-authored book chapter) that will be published early-mid next year. I also worked three jobs and 2 internships as an undergraduate. I know that I will certainly learn more through a MA program, but I just don't know if it makes sense to pursue a partially funded MA program. I was looking forward to a PhD to conduct my own fieldwork; however, I don't know how that is going to change due to the pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this context, I guess my questions are: Does it make sense to apply for the Fall 2021 cycle or is it advisable to take more time off and gauge how academia responds to this dynamic situation? What are the possibilities of getting accepted to a ""good"" program with a decent funding package? What general advice and suggestions do you have for me? How do you see Covid impacting funding, acceptance rates, and general department culture in academia?

I have been working on my application materials (albeit not robustly), but I'm very confused and feeling rudderless about whether or not a PhD is the right path for."

irm209,1,2020-09-12,Please help: Not sure what I should be doing now to be ready by graduation/somewhat overwhelmed by job requirements?,ibrown39,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/irm209/please_help_not_sure_what_i_should_be_doing_now/,"Hey all!

I’m frequent poster here but want to make a more general post, both to my challenges, point in education, and area of development.  For reference I’m in Centennial, CO and am 23. I have a degree in Economics, worked in retail and management, and now work a good part-time job in education (high school sub). The degree I’m working on now (BS, CompSci) I’ll be done with probably in January 2021.

I know I need a portfolio and have found a resource on Git with a lot. It makes use of a lot of different concepts (OOP, algorithms, and etc) but I feel somewhat scattered when doing it. I know I could just focus on school that’s really 3-4ish days of work for me. My program covers a few platforms, languages, and concepts which I think will help me figure out an area I’d like to develop in, but also makes me feel like I won’t particularly strong in any. 

I’ve played around with stuff like Xcode and iOS dev tools, web stuff (markup, sql, and JS). Even then though, while I had fun with them, I got the same feeling like I’m not concentrating enough on something else. I do however feel comfortable with Git.

I like the idea of freelancing and won’t have to worry about health insurance for awhile. But I’m fine with all kinds of possibilities. I like the idea of being a mobile or web app dev, but worry that it might not be great financial wise. Eventually I’d like to be project manager and/or owner of small software development company. I’m also interested in doing anything related to exercise (I looked at Computer Vision some)

I’ve looked at quite a few job and internship listings and I’ve seen the following:

Ajack
Xamarin 
XML
Git
React, angular, and bootstrap
Firebase 
Typescript
Php 
Stripe
Linux
TS/SCI
Distributed complex system
Jira
Eclipse
SOAP
REST
VISIAL STUDIO
.Net
C#
Android/Kotlin
iOS/Swift/Objective-C
Bootstrap
Frameworks
Many, many more

Additionally:
OOP, IoT development, Algorithms, Design etc

But what gets me is when they say a “deep understanding” of anything, strong OOP ( I know what it is and principles, but wonder what it entails overall), design, or etc. A lot of listings make me wonder about doing more school; but I’m not sure

I worry either I’ll be good something but not easily employable, easily employable but not great compensation, or overall not quite ready.

When do I know I’m ready for an internship and then a job?

TL;DR:
Is it better to try and find something I definitely like and become as strong I can there, just work more on whatever school throws me, or something else (if so what?). How much should I be using Leetcode (seemed more popular a few years ago) or similar services?"

The program for my major is super different, so I basically start interning next semester, and I have to complete 5 internships before I graduate. So basically that means I won’t be on campus as much as the average person.

I realized I’m just more interested and focused on my major and getting bomb internships that will get me a job I want after graduation. I m planning to stay in the sorority this year, and then drop my third. 

Is it normal to feel this way? I just don’t care about going to sigma chis next beach themed party or doing a date dash, etc, as much as I used to. Did any of you get kind of tired of Greek life? Would dropping be a mistake?"

I wanted to be a game developer for the longest time, but in contrast to its closed market for career opportunities, I swapped to something I took great interest in that also has a highly demanded market which was ethical hacking (specifically Red Team hacking). To be honest, I really don't know jack about hacking and I'm doing a ton of research through videos and articles, taking notes of every term I hear/read, looking them up and defining them and noting what they're used for even if I don't yet understand why.

I know there's a lot of code languages behind this that I'll have to learn, so I've already started with the one I've heard of the most which is Python. My questions for those who can help are these:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I want to be a Red Team hacker for a company one day in the future, or even start my own, what coding languages would I want to pursue?
2. What online certifate courses are credible for employers, and can I take them to help me get an internship or job in the near future during my BA course in uni?
3. Are there different roles for red team hackers? For example one person would have adept knowledge in a certain code language / trained for specific situations and other members of a team would have different roles that tied together?

Thanks to anyone who can help!! :)"
iroxb8,0,2020-09-12,Seeking advice on transitioning to CS Career; thinking of MSc in CS right now.,sycrp9533,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iroxb8/seeking_advice_on_transitioning_to_cs_career/,"I have a degree in the Health sector (Kinesiology, Occupational Therapy) but I've been wanting to do a complete flip and I have been self-teaching myself programming for a few months now. My friend recommended that I start with Python and so far I really do like it as I am using more logical thinking and detail oriented skill that I have been wanting. I've been hearing that self-teaching is a possible route to get into a software developer role but I like a little more guidance and I hear mixed things about bootcamps, so that is why I'm thinking of doing a formal education of some sort. 

I would like your opinions and advice based on these points:

* First, I like programming so far, but because I didn't do a BS in CS, I don't have exposure to things like machine learning or AI for example. I'm not really sure if things like machine learning or AI is off-limits since I don't have a BS in CS, and while I am not well versed in those areas yet (I mostly know of Python, CSS and HTML right now), I am hoping that a MS education would open as many career option doors as possible. **So are there any ideal MS in CS programs that you know of or at least hits majority of these points: provides rudimentary knowledge (e.g. data structures and algorithms, calculus/linear algebra), practical for job (e.g. learning coding with variety of languages) and also specialized concepts like machine learning or AI for future opportunities, and maybe even an internship built-in?**
* Second, to be fair, my liking of CS is based on my programming experience with Python. I know I am asking about MS programs and not to contradict myself but I also do want to put the brakes abit too and ask for your advice too on **what I could do to really get a good sense of all the various areas outside of traditional programming jobs and if I like it (e.g. machine learning, AI, cyber security, etc)**? Right now, I am approaching my self-teaching of Python to be almost like ""Job Shadowing a doctor to see if you want to be a doctor"" for example, so I'm not sure what better ways I can do this then self-teaching on Udemy or Coursera for example. I haven't made any big decisions yet, because I want to be smart about this so I'm hoping your advice can help me be more informed.
* Just to close out everything that I mentioned, I prefer not to do BS just because I feel like I would be going backwards but I'm not 100% against it. With that said, I hear mixed responses that going for a 2nd BS in CS is useless while some say it is useful, or that MS in CS is useless while some say that it is useful...so it's hard to get a good sense of what would be a good choice professionally/financially. I would love to hear your opinion about this on where you think would be a good direction to go.

Thanks!"

My girlfriend (21F) and I (24M) have been together for about three years. In the beginning of August, we moved in together and she started a new job. She started her last semester of college towards the middle of August and started an internship. Since she started classes, her father checked himself into rehab for his alcoholism, her great uncle passed away, a small pregnancy scare, her mother has been gone a lot for work which leaves her 13 y/o is often left alone overnight so he often ends up calling my gf and asking about how to do simple things like using the oven and stove or because he's nervous to be alone at night. Last Friday, he called my gf in the middle of the night because he was sick with strep and she drove the three hours back home (at 2 am) to take care of him. So needless to say, she's been stretched a little thin right now. I feel genuinely terrible for her and have tried to help in anyway that I can.

She's had several panic attacks over the past few weeks. One was when her uncle died. She wasn't all that close with him, but she was still upset. She was telling me that she was more upset with the fact that she would have to go back home for the funeral and the hassle of it all. Another happened, while she was on the phone with her little brother about two weeks ago. She had just gotten back from her internship and her brother called for help with his homework. She was trying to explain it to him and he didn't understand. She got frustrated and ended up just handing the phone to me and leaving the apartment. I found her in her car sobbing. I tried talking to her, but she said she just wanted to be left alone. The worst and most recent one was last Monday. She was in a mood, but initiated sex which felt really good because she hadn't done that since we originally moved in together. I was excited and I maybe moved a little fast than she originally planned. At one point, her back was towards me and she started shaking. I took that as her enjoying it and kept going for a couple more minutes. She said something quietly and I couldn't understand her and thought she was just moaning. She did this a couple more times and I still couldn't understand her. At one point I did stop and ask her what she said and she just shook her head. I took that as never mind and kept going for a few minutes longer before asking to change positions and rolled over and I found out she was crying and shaking. She didn't want me to touch her again. I found out after the fact that she was trying to tell me to stop when I had thought she was moaning. This time she wouldn't settle down. The other two lasted around 15 mins, but this one lasted around 30 mins. When she was finally starting to calm down, I made the mistake of putting my hand on her shoulder without asking and she started to panic again. The whole thing ended up lasting about 45 mins. I felt awful after I found out that she was telling me to stop.

Around Wednesday of this week, she came home in an ok mood. She seemed more relaxed and like her old self again. I figured that it would be the best opportunity to talk to her about possibly taking advantage of her school's counseling center. She got upset again and we were arguing. I went to put something in the cabinet and without realizing she was behind me, I turned around too fast and hit her in the forehead with my elbow. She ended up falling backwards and hitting her head just behind her left ear. It was bleeding pretty bad, but, thinking I had done it on purpose, she wanted to be left alone. She was completely hysterical and wouldn't let me touch her or come near her so I went over to a friends for a few hours to cool down and collect my thoughts. When I got back, she was asleep. The next day, she was dazed, seemed kind of confused, she had vomited several times, had a headache, was running a fever, etc. At first, I thought she had just caught strep from her younger brother, but after doing some research, I took her to the emergency room. She ended up needing a lot of stitches and having a pretty bad concussion.

Obviously she's been home with me the past couple of days recovering. She doesn't really talk much to me unless I speak to her first and seems a little out-of-it and even depressed most of the time.

TL;DR I still want to talk to my gf about going to see someone, but I don't know how to bring it up after what happened. I was thinking that it might be better if we were to go and see someone together that way it doesn't seem like I'm saying she needs to be fixed and doesn't seem as intimidating. Her mother and brother are coming down tomorrow so I was thinking about talking to her mom about bringing it up with her, but I don't want to share anything with her mom that my gf doesn't want her to know.

I just really want to help, but I don't really know how. I don't know if it's just the stress of the month or if there might be something more to it. I just really don't know what to do."

This was my second internship, I spent a year at my first one and I’ve been at this job since the beginning on this year. It was a prestigious company and I made $20/hr, which is above average for my field. I was so proud of myself for getting this job and especially at such a high pay. Then quarantine hit and I fell in a depression, and my anxiety was the worse it has ever been. I stopped working for a few months because I could barely handle my school work, let alone a job. I worked through the summer and my productivity wasn’t great but I always got the job done, sometimes late. About a month ago, I was assigned a project at work that I was overwhelmed with from the beginning. Working as an intern from home was very difficult since I still have a lot to learn, it is much different than being in the office surrounded by people I could ask questions. This is the project that would lead me to get fired. The thought of even starting the work would cause so much anxiety I’d feel sick, and I would deal with it by avoiding. I couldn’t force myself to do it even though I knew the deadline was coming. My boss emailed me asking what progress I had made and I lied and told him I was having problems with the program, and he replied telling me the project was being taken over by someone else. Then today I got an email saying my last day at the company will be on Friday. I hate myself. I did this completely to myself and I knew what I was doing while I avoided my work, but it felt like my anxiety was controlling me. I feel like I have no self discipline. I’m going to schedule a psychiatrist appointment on Monday to discuss starting an antidepressant, I talked about it with my therapist prior to being fired and this was the push I needed to finally schedule the appointment. I don’t want to use my anxiety as an excuse though, because at the end of the day I think I have a bad work ethic. 

How do I force myself to work? I ruined one of the best opportunities in my life and I’m scared I’m falling down the wrong path with my lack of motivation. I don’t feel like I have anything I want bad enough to work hard for, and even when I have rent to pay for I couldn’t make myself work."

However, during my last semester I realized that I enjoyed my controls class more than anything else. Also, throughout my internship I have found most mechanical engineering work to be fairly boring, and I find electrical work far more interesting. In other words, I would much rather design a control system or a circuit than draft a mechanical part. 

My interests primarily lie in controls and embedded systems, but I am also fascinated with electronics and digital circuitry. I have been told that the best way to shift career paths is to do a masters, as it is not only faster than a BS, but I will also be worth more as an employee. However, an MS degree is much more focused than a BS. I feel if I focus on controls and embedded systems, I will miss out on a lot of the electronics work that I would've taken as an undergrad. 

By the end of Spring 2021, I will have taken signals and systems, embedded systems, digital logic, circuits 1, and electronics 1 as a post-bacc in preparation for my masters. I plan on moving into my masters program in Fall 2021. However, I won't have taken any of the undergrad labs, electives, emag, power electronics, analog filters, etc. This will leave several holes in my education, and I fear that if I get an electrical engineering focused job in the future, there will be certain concepts that I will know little about because I didn't do a BSEE. 

What would you recommend I do about this? Self study, do side projects, etc? Or should I just not worry about it? 

Anyways, it just seems weird skipping around all of those topics I would've taken in undergrad, since I would assume an employer would expect me to know something about them

I appreciate your input!"

I have direct entry into a postgraduate medical degree of 3 years and live in Australia. 

These past three years have been a lot of cramming on my end when my study habits used to be excellent. A lot of credits/credit passes when I was a high achiever in high school. My mental health has never been worse and I’m almost positive I have depression and/or anxiety that has developed over the years.

I’m not sure I have the passion or commitment in me to continue for another 3 years and become a doctor, in addition to the years of residency and internship after that. I’m worried that I won’t remember anything from my pre-med degree and that postgraduate medicine will be difficult. The way my degree works is that it covers everything you usually learn in MD1 - anatomy, physiology, chemistry, pharmacology, research etc so you can go straight to MD2 and start your clinical rotations. 

However, since I have been cramming these past 3 years and never really understanding content, nothing is going to stick by next year. More importantly, I don’t see myself enjoying studying for so much longer when I have absolutely no motivation for it. 

My mum would be devastated and I think a part of that is what has driven me to complete even my undergraduate - fear of dropping out and disappointing her, as well as fear of not knowing what else I would do with my life. 

I know I will finish this current degree but I have no idea what to do after that. Should I take a gap year? Should I try and find job in population health as a development or health promotion officer? Should I swap postgraduate degrees to something else that is less intense? 

I’ve only had this epiphany over the weekend and it has caused me a severe amount of intrusive thoughts and anxiety to the point where I have no appetite and am constantly tired. I’ve never felt this down before and I feel like I’ve wasted three years of my life on a degree I was supposed to use for a medical career that I don't even know if I want anymore.

When I was made the offer, I accepted it under the impression that I would be working on an existing project (project A) that I had told the team manager I was most interested in. But somehow between signing the offer letter and starting the job, it was decided that I would be on a completely different project (project B) that I had expressed zero interest in, and only partially working on project A.

I’m fresh out of grad school and the world is on fire, so instead of speaking up, I rolled with it. But things were clearly not going to work. Instead of reporting to the team manager, I report to the lead on project B. We had worked together last summer, he was pretty hands off and let me do my thing, which I appreciated. Apparently he insisted I be put on project B, which explains how I ended up on it. 

Three months later I am absolutely miserable. My manager has completely changed his management style and is constantly micromanaging what I do and how I do it, to the point of telling me which hot-keys I should be using. He treats me like a code monkey, not allowing me to make any real intellectual contribution at all. He’s an expert in the field and has been the only person working on project B, so what he says is law. But the solutions he is insisting I implement are absolutely bad and won’t scale, and he brushes me off when I try to point it out. He also does not get along with the manager of the project A, and seems to be strategically over-occupying my time so that he can make the case that I don’t have time to be on it. 

If all of that weren’t enough, he also has zero concept of boundaries. Messaging me well after working hours, expressing disappointment when I don’t work weekends or through a holiday, and overrides me on every decision I make down to how I title/word an email or slack message.

At this point I don’t think I’ll last 6 months with this guy. And I do not imagine a conversation about switching projects would go over well, as I’ve tried to approach the topic a couple of times. I have a monthly one-on-one with the team manager (his boss), should I just bring up my desire to be on project A then?"

Can somebody explain how QA in IT differs from QA in manufacturing? What knowledge, skills and qualifications are needed for each? How easy is it to move between the two fields as a quality engineer?

My profile: 
Gender: Male
Country: India
Age: 24
Gmat: 750
GPA: 8.45/10
WE(software role at Oracle): 4 years by the time I join
6 months internship at Amazon.

Entrepreneurship experience:
1. Ran a startup during college(good number of users), 2. Part of highly selective entrepreneurship program at Oracle(pitched two ideas). 
3. Currently working on startup after office hours.

Last year I applied with the short term goal as PM and long term goal as Entrepreneurship. This year due to some deaths in my family I realized, I don't want to wait for many years to start a tech company. 

Does mentioning entrepreneurship as short term goal have any bad effect on admission decision. 

Should I mention my Plan B short term goal. 

Honestly i am seeing two years as risk free environment to pursue my dream of starting a company. If things workout well and good. Otherwise i want join as a PM and start my own startup at later point.

Can any current student or alumni help me out.

Thanks."

* I had the best academic performance in final year of my high school in the history of my school (12th Standard, I live in India). 96.6% was my score. 
* Then I took an year off to study my ass off and got one of the best colleges in the whole country, not to mention I had multiple breakdowns in the period and only with the help of my mom's support I was able to keep it together and finally make it. 
* But then, in college, I couldn't do it, my gpa took a downward curve and I just couldn't understand what the hell happened. Anyways, I dragged myself through 4 years of college barely managing to keep my shit together, constantly struggling with even the easiest of subjects. I felt I am stupid. I just couldn't understand it. I suspected it's ADHD but where I come from, awareness is next to nothing.
* Four years of college and I didn't do any meaningful internships, I didn't do any meaningful projects, I barely managed to stay sane.
* I tried a lot, but I just couldn't focus. I tried running (I run fairly regularly now, keeps my mood somewhat stable), I tried meditation (Vipassana), I tried a lot of other things, thinking it might solve my problem but to no avail.
* Because I was in one of the best colleges in my country, I managed to get a great job. But, not soon after starting the job, I again started having severe anxiety, mental breakdowns and the offcourse my constant inability to concentrate despite how hard I try (6 years untreated since high school). 
* I soon started seeing a Psychiatrist and I have been trying to figure my shit out for last 9 months. And finally got diagnosed!
* Right now I am on a month long leave at my job for depresssion, anxiety and lack of focus and yes I am contemplating quitting my job. 
* And in a week from now I will finally start ADHD medications and I am optimistic, I am hopeful that things will work out this time and If they do, I would be able to save my job. And that makes me happy. 
* This subreddit has been a great pillar of support guys, It really has been. Thanks to all the amazing peeps out there. Your struggles have made me relate like no where else. 
* I know It's just a diagnosis, but trust me it's a big deal for me. To quote Jessica here, after almost 6 years of ""failing at normal,"" this might be it. I know the struggle doen't end here. But It's a great step forward :)."

However, they’ve reached out to me about coming back as an intern mentor for this semester. While I have no intention of working in this industry in the future, I keep wondering if being able to put the leadership opportunity on my resume would be worth doing it or if I should just focus on trying to get another job-like experience this semester. The thing is, there aren’t really any options like that with COVID having a lot of organizations on campus and around shut down. 

So what do you guys think. Is it worth doing it for the experience or should I pass?"

There’s 3 things I want to highlight on my resume:

Professional experience (current full time job and previous internships)

Research assistant position

Projects (mainly senior design but maybe another project too)

Option 1: 2 sections: experience and projects. The issue is that my internships are more impressive than my research position (I’m in industry not academia, but the research is still relevant). As such, I prefer to keep my current position and past internships front and center and leave research for the end. 

Option 2: 3 sections: work experience, research experience, projects. The issue here is that the research and projects sections will only have 1 entry each, which seems kind of ridiculous to have their own dedicated sections. This leads me to option 3.

Option 3: 2 sections, professional experience, and either “other experience” or “non-professional experience”. This lets me keep the focus on my most impressive positions, while also avoiding having multiple sections with 1 entry each. However, the problem here is that a research assistant position and a senior design project are wildly different, so much so that they probably don’t belong in the same section...

Kind of at a loss here. Would love some advice!"

I'm also about to start my 2nd year of CS undergrad (working full-time, studying part-time). 

I have had the bad surprise to see that some companies have already opened and closed their internships positions for 2021 (so I would need to start applying now  for an internship) 

Before changing jobs, my plan was to do a summer internship in 2021 before doing the mandatory one in 3rd year. 
But I would really like to grow in the company I'm about to start at and I don't think that quitting/asking for a three-month unpaid leave within the first year is an okay thing to do.
Side note : the IT services of this company are in a different country so no way to easily move from one service to another. 

Second issue : I don't have any side-project under my belt right now and I'm afraid that if I apply now and get rejected because my resume is not appealing enough, I might not be considered when applying next year (for the mandatory internship). 

The realistic thing to do seems to be : do my best to grow in my company, work on side-projects and find an internship for 2022 but I would have loved to have more than one internship when graduating. 


Would anyone have any thought about the whole situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Looking to get an internship for May 2021 - August 2021, should I be applying now?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rather new to all this internship stuff and being an international student, I'm quite oblivious to the whole internship application process (back in my home country, there aren't really internships as readily available to college students compared to the US). More specifically, I'm trying to see how I should prepare and if I'm behind in the Computer Science realm of internships. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just started off my junior year.

I've completed: EECS 183, EECS 203, EECS 280, EECS 281.

I'm currently taking: EECS 370, EECS 376.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends has already messaged me about how I'm doing with internships and if I've applied already. To be completely honest, I haven't really put much thought into it right now. I do have a sample resume ready, but I do not have my LinkedIn or Handshake profiles setup. I've heard quite a lot about engineering fairs, but this semester is particularly different as I saw that everything is online. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm looking to hopefully land an internship for May 2021 - August 2021.** Does the internship application process for that date range start this early? Since my friend asked how I was doing in terms of intership stuff, I assumed that the Spring 2021 internship process has already started, or is he asking for my prep regarding December 2020 internships?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite lost on this topic of CS internship and I'd appreciate some resources or advice that you could give me! Am I late to the process and should I be setting up my accounts and start applying for internships already? Aside from the courses at UM, I don't really have much else under my belt (no personal projects), is this a crucial factor for interships?

Honestly, I consider myself a *'Pro Ultra Deluxe Reddit Academia Lurker'* because I have used Reddit for every single aspect of my application (finding free SAT/ACT practice tests, browsing other people's specs, jotting down tips from successful applicants), so I wanted to share my knowledge with the masses.

*EDIT: I put ""average"" in the title, but I just want to mention that my test scores are definitely not average on a nationwide perspective. I was simply average compared to my graduating class. There were tons students in our class with better specs than me (better scores, better extracurriculars, higher math levels, more APs, full score subject test results, legacy students, sports scholar, ect). I titled this post in the scope of our own little high school bubble, so it may be misleading.*

**GENERAL INFO:**

* **Bio:** Female, Asian, U.S. citizen, no legacy
* **GPA:** 4.5 Weighted (don't know about unweighted bc our school only shows one)
* **Class Rank:** probably in the top 10-15% out of 620 students
* **Standardized Testing:** 1570 SAT, 35 ACT (no subject tests)
* **APs:** 12 (straight As except for an A- in physics and calculus ab)
* **EC:** Class Council VP, English Honor Society President, Editor-in-Chief of the Newspaper Club, created a Shakespeare Club for lit nerds, NHS, Science Honor Society (just a casual member), 300 hours of volunteering throughout four years
* **Awards/Honors:** Scholastic Art Award Winner (Gold Key x4), Scholastic Writing Award (Gold x2, Silver x2), published poems in our local newspaper, won a few school writing contests, National AP Scholar, oh and the honor roll-thingy schools give out every year
* **Recs:** received from my AP teachers who only knew me for a year, just the average *""love how polite, kind, and smart this student is!""* letter
* **Essays:** 10/10, I shall explain why
* **Financial Aid:** Did not apply (explained later)
* **Major:** Undecided
* **Application:** all regular decision

**Why I Believed Others Were More Qualified**

The school county that I attended was known for having one of the most rigorous and competitive academics in the nation. Naturally, the students who attended reflected those ideals. I had 300 volunteering hours, but that was ***absolute garbage*** compared to the girl who had been receiving awards for 1,500 service hours since *MIDDLE SCHOOL* ! There was also a good chunk of kids who were in a higher math level than me (*and boyyyy were they arrogant...*) These same kids would create functional computers from scratch, intern in the White House/NASA, win tons of gold medals in science olympiad (and placing first nationally), and all around just impossible things for teenagers to imagine. Stanford has been my dream school, but I quickly gave up on that idea when I learned a fellow classmate (who I deemed better than I ever would be) also had Stanford as their dream school. Let's call her, Emily -- Emily was the Asian daughter that I had always aspired to be: captain of the tennis club, champion of science awards, the booty-licker of all teachers, 1600 SAT score + perfect subject tests, conqueror of multivariable calculus, perfect report card since birth, 4.7 GPA, volunteered in an undeveloped country, coded a phone app, future pre-med neuroscience legend, leader of a church youth group, bold, brave, and *oh yeah a snake*. Emily always assumed that Stanford was going to accept her and ***BY GOD*** she had all the means to achieve it. She would use caffeine pills to stay up all night to study, hired tutors to co-write her essays, went to a monthly SAT training camp, convinced teachers to let her co-write the rec letters, made up stories in her personal essays to sound more impactful, and rehearsed interview questions with Ivy League alumnus, and who knows what else... Honestly, I thought all T20 schools were meant for people like her; cut-throat, competitive, insanely brilliant, and haughty. *(I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at Stanford and most people were actually...human... but 25% of students are still Emily replicas lmao)*

I always knew that I would apply to some Ivys because I genuinely believed that I had at least a 10% shot with my standardized tests alone. However, I crossed out Stanford because that was *reserved for Emily*. In the afternoon of one wintery day, I received a surprising Facetime call from my friend. 'Yooooooo', she began in a sing-sang voice. 'Guess who applied for Stanford early decision and got denied? It was Emily!' she cackled. I think my heart stopped in that moment. I don't believe myself to be a cruel person; *I genuinely felt bad for Emily who had dedicated her entire high school career into building a resumé for Stanford.* Yet, I was proud of Stanford for being able to distinguish between an authentic student versus one with a fake persona. That night (2 days before the application deadline btw) I wrote my Stanford essays in a frenzy and sent them in. Spring brought joyous tears as I opened my application portal and read the magic word, '*Congratulations*'.

**Why I Got In (Realistic)**

* *Look at my SAT/ACT scores, bro.* Sorry to break it to you-- but your scores need to meet the average threshold of that particular college you're applying to. Applying with a 1410 to a school that has a 1520 SAT average is not realistic... unless you're a 1) prodigy who is going to change the world, 2) legacy and loaded with money, 3) famous and well known throughout the nation. I understand that it's hard, but I feel that -- if you have time-- you can master standardized testing. I haven't gone to any prep schools in my entire life, I solely relied on the internet (khan academy, sat &amp; act reddit subs, crack act) to better my scores.
* I submitted an art portfolio that matched the awards I earned. I believe that added a lot of character to my application and separated me from the *'smart Asian kid'* stigma.
* My application was well-rounded. I wasn't in a rush to submit things for the Early Decision deadline. I really took my time to polish every single word in my application to reflect my personality and who I was as a person. My advice is: your admissions officer should feel like he just went on an hour-long blind date with you and fell in love with you.
* While I wrote my Stanford essays super last minute, I already had a general idea of how to introduce myself from writing all my other college essays. I just re-used and recycled my words. Plus, I truly believe my personal essay was great. I had my AP Lit teacher review it with me several times and she teared up/ laughed every time she read it. Out of the 200 essays that she read, mine was the only one which received an A grade. Writing is hard, I get it. I'm not in a position to teach you how to write. I've been in love with writing and reading since the fifth grade so I can't give you a 'How I Improved in 6 Months' guide. However, asking for help and having teachers review it is *VERY* helpful.
* I didn't apply for financial aid. I thought it would hinder my acceptance chances because colleges would see me as a leech on their resources. I have no way to confirm whether this helped my application, but being able to pay yourself does seem incentivizing to these institutions who greatly value money.
* Interviews!! Loved them!! Genuinely laughed and had a coffee date with all of them. The key formula is to roughly introduce yourself to them for 10-15 minutes, highlight NEW things about yourself (that are not already in your application) for 15-20 minutes, and just answer their questions honestly. Also, be sure to research the school and ask them questions that they can answer in-depth. Please don't talk over your interviewer and listen to what they are saying as well.
* Again, essays are the essence of your application. Extracurriculars are great, but it's what you mention in your writing that will truly stick with the readers. The golden ratio of importance is probably 55% essays and 45% testing scores/GPA.

**My Advice for 2020 Applicants**

* Your essays matter more *now* than *ever*. Take the time to perfect it.
* If your SAT/ACT scores are bad, then this is the best opportunity to omit them.
* If your SAT/ACT scores are above average, then this is also a great time to submit them and add something new to your application.
* Believe in yourself. These schools believe in you and give you a fair chance when they read over your application. No one is more worthy or deserving than you. Please take the first leap of faith.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck! Feel free to message me with questions about college, Stanford and the Ivys, or standardized testing. I'm here for you, just like the sub was here for me :)

Both Bs are in....French....I had 2 internships in software engineering, one happened during the summer of my sophomore year, and one happened just the past summer. I was offered a job during my last internship but I turned it down because I really want to learn a little more about machine learning. I am 95% confident that I will be able to get at least above average LORs because my teacher in Machine Learning really seemed to like. I don't have any research experience, but since I am not looking for a thesis master, I am not sure if that will hurt me a lot? Other than that, I haven't taken my GRE yet but I usually do really well on these standardized tests,(ever since the days of SAT and AP tests) so I am very confident in my ability to do well on that. My primary concern honestly, is just my GPA and my lack of research experience, neither of which I can still improve upon in time for my application. What should I put more work on at this point for my application? Thanks

Edit: I am in a top 30 university(by US news) in the USA, and am a domestic student

Edit 2: Also, is it too early right now to ask for rec letter? I am worried my professors might end up forgetting if I asked them too early

I also thought about a more CS centric master, but I consider that unless I wanted to work on AI related jobs, it doesn't make much sense.

3) in high school I was so motivated to just overindulge in extracurriculars but now I know what I really love, what to prioritize in my life, and that life is about following ur passions but also keeping ur responsibilities in line

4) taught me how to ask for help from peers. Hs was pretty cake for me (no flex, just how it was ig) but some classes on college bitch slapped me across the fucking face. However I went to office hours one day in freshman year and it honestly changed my life. The TA was so helpful and knowledgeable and as a peer, was able to better relate to what I was thinking and made the topic make way more sense. Since then I go to offic hours with confidence and it’s lit. Respect to the TAs, especially my 1554 TA, he kept it real and got donuts for us too, fucking legend. 

5) I became super emotionally aware/mature because u go thru a lot in college. Breakups, death of a friend, bomb a test, argument w a friend, wild stuff. I also learned that relationships don’t mean too much in college, we are between 17-23 on average here and like u might have dated from anywhere to 3 months to 3 years, but don’t be pressured to stay in a relationship that isn’t conducive to ur life as a person and student also. I know people in relationships who are like stable at best and keep it for the sake of being in a relationship, but someone who doesn’t get u or u need to compromise yourself for should be dropped. I found that college is where I found out how to be more expressive because my Chinese household wasn’t a place I could even speak my mind. If ur dating or friends w someone who caps ur individuality or has gotten one too many chances, cancel them because u can do better.

6) used to be a tea person and I now I drink black coffee w nothing in it and it tastes like nothing

7) I got involved w random stuff I never would have done in hs like clubs i didn’t even think seemed cool or made friends w people that gave of that wack vibe but I realized that I’m equally wack and it’s lit. 

8) I’m now a fiend at catan, I dominate that bitch like I did ur mom last night, jkjkjk

9) never thought I would code in college, now imma cs major who’s had two google internships and one for apple xD

10) learned to not two flying fucks about another persons negative AND unconstructive criticism of me. This means people who randomly hate or are toxic for the sake of it, I love being constructively criticized because it shows me what I can do better, but people who inherently don’t like me i could care less about. I’m also way more confident, a highlight would be when I walked into a sweethut (not midtown’s), did the middle portion of the chika dance, bowed, and walked off

Overall, be crazy, full send, don’t hinder urself because others are trying to box u, college is about learning yourself, having fun, but being responsible and goal oriented as well. The mix of those things is probably the most conducive to having a good time here."

I spoke with a startup today and the startup is making a product. Payment is minimum wage but it is being delayed. It was stated to me that this was due to the company being in talks with a client about selling its product but the pandemic put the kibosh on that. I asked when I would be receiving the money and the person I spoke to said she didn’t know but that the guarantee would be on the contract.

The internship would last three months, but I would start this week (and I’d have to stop working as an essential worker). I still have to pay my loans (though I will be making money homeschooling a relative, for now). I have tonight to make my decision as I have to notify them whether or not I would be interested in this position. If I say that I am, the engineers would look at my resume and if they like me, they’ll give me an offer tomorrow (and I’d start Tuesday).

This all sounds very suspicious to me (obviously) but as it pertains to tech, I have nothing else going for me. Obviously, if this goes South, I am so unbelievably screwed. Is this kind of stuff par for the course with startups? Most importantly, should I move forward. Regardless of what you think, if you could tell me why you feel that way, I’d greatly appreciate it."

Thanks for coming to read my post. I need some help determining how long I should stay in my current position and if I should be asking for higher pay.

My background:

* New grad (May 2020) working at an accounting firm
* Self-taught programmer (started in elementary school w/ public roblox Lua script editing and flash games)
* BS in Finance
* Located in Bay Area
* Salary: $67,000 (same as other incoming regular audit associates)

I'm currently working at an accounting firm who is very pro-automation and pro-tech and open-minded, so I have a lot of freedom. I was initially an audit intern and showed how they could automate things with Python, and they since hired me to become a part of the new data analytics department they want to start. Being a new position for them, there wasn't really a clear direction of the position (I knew this going in) but after working for a bit I feel like I'm being underpaid relative to the average salary for people with similar skills in the Bay Area

So far, I've done the following:

* Helped set up dev environment, production environment, and database servers
* Created Flask webapp so employees can upload raw data in Excel
   * Data is then formatted into financial statement format automatically (saving 30+ minutes per financial statement generated)
   * Data is uploaded to database for helping in future audits and possible data analytics
   * Flaskapp also allows employees to search the database and edit incorrect data or use it for cross-reference in other audits

I'm also expected to help during their busy season so that I can get experience in their current processes and help make them more efficient.

I kind of feel like I'm in a hybrid DevOps/developer/audit role because I'm creating things, maintaining them, setting up their environments, and also will be helping in audit. My team meetings are essentially just me showing the features I worked on that week. There's been a lot of scope creep though and I think that may be because of my lack of planning and experience.

Questions I have:

* Should I ask for a higher salary? I didn't initially because of the lack of knowledge of what I'd be doing, and I had nothing for leverage (would not be able to pass an algorithm interview right now)
* How long should I stay? Just until I am no longer learning new things? I'd like to eventually transition to a tech company. No one here is technical and I have no guidance and I know for a fact the code I'm writing is very bad but there's no code reviews."

First off, I am a long-time lurker and I am posting this in relevant subreddts looking for advice. I am aware this might not be the correct place to post this and hopefully it doesn’t get taken down, I just want to use all my resources for as much advice as possible I really appreciate it.

I recently graduated (23M) with a bachelors In Mathematics and a double minor in economics and statistics with a concentration in Actuarial Sciences/ Data Analytics. I’m not fully sure if it was just me not getting lucky or just not having enough credentials (no Internship experience, maybe not good enough grades, no Actuarial exams passed) but I did not find a job from May until the creation of this post in my field. I recently got an offer to be a Financial Advisor at a good firm which is only paid either fully commission based or half stable half commission. Upon asking family and friends about whether or not I should accept the offer they advised me to take it to learn and gain experience and if down the line I don’t like it I could always leave and do something else. My reservations about this job are as follows:

1. It Requires a lot of interactions with Clients (which I have to basically find by myself) 

2. I have to create a healthy client base or ways to consistently keep finding clients which means some form of advertising or making meetings (which I don’t even know how to even begin doing so) and be extremely diligent in my own business because I’ll get paid based on the amount of work I put in per se. 

3. I have to pass 4 licensing exams in the next 10 weeks to be considered a professional advisor, which I have to pay for (two I pay for and two the company pays for). 

I never imagined I would be put in this position I assumed I would just have to wait a few months of applying and just get something in my field (I want to blame COVID for it). I enjoy working with data and manipulating and analyzing it. I wouldn’t say I’m 100% an introvert as in I can be social if I have to but I imagined myself being somewhat in my own world doing my projects with a small team and simply presenting findings and explaining my projects in a meeting maybe once a month or so, but now my whole salary would be based off of interacting with people and basically selling my services and I don’t know how I feel about that. 

I’m torn between taking this position and basically embarking on a whole different career path then the one I imagined, considering all the studying and examinations (which you have to take yearly to stay in tip to shape) or not taking the offer and putting my efforts, and more of my money into studying for the actuarial exams and trying to pass those. 

Relative Career Experience regarding data Analysis/Actuarial:

· SQL/SAS Entry level experience from school club workshops

· Python Projects(6) shown in my GitHub with hyperlink in resume

· Machine Learning experience from courses in college

· R coding experience also from course in college

· Was treasurer for my actuarial sciences club in college 😊

· Other: Excel, Microsoft Word, Minitab, PowerPoint, Office 

Should I stick with my secure advising financial position or continue with my Actuarial/ Data Analyst path?"

isa4ka,0,2020-09-13,Incoming Transfer Student seeking advice.,Aleventen,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/isa4ka/incoming_transfer_student_seeking_advice/,"Hey everyone!

I was recently accepted to Cal to begin in the 2021 Spring semester and the lull has given me quite a bit of time to think.

Of course, I have a lot of questions but the major question I have is actually related to something that feels far away yet eminently close all at once: grad school.

I'm a Cognitive Science major and my selection of Cal as a prospective University to complete my degree was a decision I had made based 100% on whether there was work being done that I thought was directly relevant to my deepest interests. Cal has wonderful Artificial Intelligence research and the neuroprosthetics lab makes me swoon. 

Anyway, the more I think about it, the more I am realizing how unprepared I am to compete for a graduate program. I have 0 research experience or internship experience (I came from a Community College) although I did manage to start a club and host a Philosophy of Mind symposium at UCSD before I transferred. 

Anyway....I suppose what I'm looking for is insight and wisdom on getting into these extracurricular programs that will be invaluable to me getting selected for graduate studies. I cannot emphasize enough, I did not come all of this way for a bachelor's, I came back to school at 25 years old with the goal of getting a PhD in Cog Sci as uncompromising so I am willing to do what it takes.....I suppose I just dont quite know what that is, or even what to do about it. Will the large class sizes be a problem? Will getting picked up for research be difficult because of the high level of competition? Are there websites I should be aware of with these programs and internships where I should already be applying? 

I'm pretty sure I've dug a Google hole to China and back and all I have to show for it is more uncertainty and anxiety. Any advice?"

I am an incoming junior and have started the hunt to secure an internship for summer 2021. I realized that its probably a good idea to get some recommendation letters from profs since some applications require them. I've never really asked for a recc letter from any college professor before so I'm wondering how to approach this.

Context:
I'm an Information Systems major and I took a class for Business application development which is basically an intro to C# class and I had a pretty good relationship with the instructor (he knew me by name) and I ended up getting an A in his class. I'm thinking about emailing him but not sure how to word it.

The second teacher I have in mind would be one of the instructors in which I took an important class for my major. I ended up getting an A- but I didn't really have any interaction with the prof at all since it was online. Especially with the whole corona situation is emailing a prof, who you had an online class w, for a recc letter a good idea?

Any thoughts/advice is appreciated."

I haven't been able to land an internship with any large/mid size finance/accounting firms for the summer, I wasn't applying for IB I mostly applied for financial advisory and retail banking positions, just got my final rejection call. Feeling really disheartened and honestly don't know what I'll do for my career if I can't get an internship. My stats:

\- Commerce degree, single major in Finance

\- Distinction WAM, Distinction GPA

\- Previous Bis Dev internship with a large non-for-profit

\- Extra-Curricula leadership position with a non-for-profit

\- Volunteered constantly throughout uni alongside work

\-  Worked jobs in the service industry whilst studying

\- Taken units in comp-sci and have SQL and python experience

\- No student club leadership

I got a load of hireview interview's, some in person interviews with a couple firms, no offers obviously. I got told by a partner at one of the Big4 that the only reason they didn't give me an offer is because they cut down intake to one intern this year for that particular team so I came in second (whatever good that is), another told me my interview answers were too rehearsed.

I was never able to do much with the student clubs as my studies were interrupted for a few semesters due to medical issues and I was not on campus.

What can I do with my extra year at uni (was graduating 2021, now 2022) to make me more competitive for next year's internship intake? I was thinking about adding a second major in Data Science, or Accounting, or just anything to give me any edge. I'm not aiming for IB, more retail/commercial banking and financial advisory.

Combine that with the fact that online school is very difficult for me and my mental health has been at a nearly all time low for the past few months.

On my last internship, I was making about $25 an hour but was not salary paid. Once I was done with my last internship and graduated, it was time for me to look for a full time job.

The job search has been a very slow one with covid being around but last week I got a job offer for $32,000 a year for a job that mostly included being at a computer and compiling reports and data all day.

The issue I am having with this offer is that the average starting salary for a Chemical Engineer is around $65,000 a year where I live and this job is way less than that amount. I dont mind taking a lower pay for starting salary, but is it worth taking a salary that much lower for a job that isn't necessarily what I want to do? Is it wrong to take the job while searching for another job? And does it look bad if I leave after only a few weeks?

Any advice or previous experience with the subject is appreciated!"

isfgj3,2,2020-09-14,Should I include a work experience in my resume even if I was fired?,WrussellWrestbrook,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/isfgj3/should_i_include_a_work_experience_in_my_resume/,"Hi all, I was wondering how to move forward with interviews and my resume when looking for jobs/potentially applying for grad school with the timeline of my college experience.


I went to a school in a large city, enrolled in a 5 year UG program where in years 2-4 we sacrificed our summers to alternate 6 months of classes with 6 months of internship experience, two quarter length terms each. Academically, I had trouble the first couple of years, as I admittedly got pretty hard into partying and was dealing with some hard personal issues at the time. I even failed a class freshman year, and was too drunk most of the time to realize that I could have dropped or withdrew from the class up until the last week. At one point, I had a 2.33 GPA; however managed to finish strong with a 3.22, with a 3.8 each in my major and minor. Internship wise, here is how they went:


Internship 1 - Big company. Did excellent work, have numerous references, utilized several business related skills (both leadership and technical). However, not related to what I majored in, but distantly related to what I minored in. 


Internship 2 - Mid size company. My manager went on vacation after my first week, and ended up retiring without giving notice for about a month, so I spent the better part of two months not doing anything until I was relocated to a different section within the department. Did semi valuable work, nothing to write home about, but I worked well within the new team and established good connections. Not related to major, but related to minor. 


Internship 3 - Things get spicy here. Same company as internship 2, but different department; this time within my major. This company utilized a self reported time card system. You see, during internship 2, I started to take longer lunch breaks; sometimes picking up food and taking the walk home to eat, even pushing it to a point where I squeezed naps in my day. I know, ridiculous. But the fact is that during internship 2, I was pretty much unmonitored and the work was little and not demanding at all, so no one really batted an eye. I was pretty bored at work most of the time, so I usually sided with temptation and stayed a little longer at home in my PJs. The mistake I made was that I reported full hours on the time card, when in reality I had been at work for 1-2 hours less per week. I got away with it during internship 2; however this time around, I was hired for a position that was much more demanding. I worked on a handful of projects, and was a popular and likeable figure in the office. I was balancing all these projects incredibly well, and learning relevant skills to my major. However, I was still falsifying my time card, and it finally caught up to me. Three months in, they informed me that unfortunately too much damage had been done and they would have to terminate me. In the viewpoint of my school, it was ok; I just had to complete essentially a class with weekly essay about job searching for the remaining three months. However, there was now a massive hole in my resume. 


First of all, I learned my lesson without a doubt. If you haven’t been fired, at all costs avoid it; it’s even more embarrassing than they make it seem in movies/TV. I felt like shit for a while, but moved on and accepted it, and I tried my best to make up for it by busting my ass over the last 15 months of classes, even averaging a 3.9 my last 9 months. I participated in valuable class projects that are resume-worthy and made connections with professors. The only regret I had about school other than my slow start was not participating in more clubs. I was in one (cultural related), but my outreach went as far as paying member fees and attending a couple events a year. So my resume contains a very solid upward trend academically, along with good references, solid skills, at least 6 months of valuable work worth mentioning, and one club. However, with my termination, I don’t know how to shape my resume. If I don’t include my third (and possibly second) internships, interviewers will probably ask what the other two internships are when I mention that the UG program was three 6 month internships. If I do, then I have to talk about it and likely create a bad optic. I’m wondering how to move forward with this, and normally I am an excellent interviewer, but I cannot figure out for the life of me how I would work with or around this come the next interview, as I have just hit the job market and plan on applying and attending graduate school within the next few years. 


TL;DR: Had three 6 month internships throughout school. First was excellent, second was 6.5/10, third was going extremely well but I got fired for falsifying time cards (same company as second but different department). How do I move forward with my experience from my third and possibly second internship when talking to jobs/grad schools? Is it worth including in my resume? How would I get around it if I don’t? Should I just tell the truth?

You can also genericize some of your answers (e.g. ""Top 20 CS school"" or ""Regional Midwest state school"").

* School/Year:
* Prior Experience:
* Company/Industry:
* Title:
* Location: 
* Duration: 
* Salary: 
* Relocation/Housing Stipend:
        
Note that while the primary purpose of these threads is obviously to share compensation info, discussion is also encouraged.

The format here is slightly unusual, so **please make sure to post under the appropriate top-level thread**, which are: US [High/Medium/Low] CoL, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, ANZC, Asia, or Other.

**If you don't work in the US, you can ignore the rest of this post.** To determine cost of living buckets, I used this site: http://www.bestplaces.net/

If the principal city of your metro is not in the reference list below, go to bestplaces, type in the name of the principal city (or city where you work in if there's no such thing), and then click ""Cost of Living"" in the left sidebar. The buckets are based on the Overall number: [Low: &lt; 100], [Medium: &gt;= 100, &lt; 150], [High: &gt;= 150]. (last updated Dec. 2019)
        
High CoL: NYC, LA, DC, SF Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, San Diego
        
Medium CoL: Orlando, Tampa, Philadelphia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Riverside, Minneapolis, Denver, Portland, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Austin, Raleigh

Low CoL: Houston, Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore, Charlotte, San Antonio, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Kansas City"

I was wondering what do you think about applying to summer 2021 internships for most BB IBs in London and the FAANG level companies.

I’ve been looking a bit on this subreddit and online and I’m starting to get a feeling that Mid-September is starting to be a bit late too apply.

For instance, if you were to leave it until October it would probably be too late.

I was curious what’s your experience/opinion?"

isha99,1,2020-09-14,I have a problem with sleeping in,___lit_boiii___,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/isha99/i_have_a_problem_with_sleeping_in/,"Hey guys!

To understand my issue. I’ve (M19) started to work as an internee. I’m hired by a big company in Switzerland and they have big restrictions like being on time. It means that every second counts and every minute has consequences.

Now to my problem. Since I was a kid I had a problem with standing up on time in the morning. I mostly had luck and was on time and caught my bus or train. For almost 5 years I use three different alarms to be sure to wake up on time. I use my phone with multiple alarms, a google home with multiple alarm and a not so smart alarm in the other end of my room to be sure to get up for disabling my alarm.

Still with all those alarms I’m unable to wake up on time and I’m panicking because I’m afraid to lose my internship and therefore my graduation. I don’t hear any of my alarms, even tough my parents in the third floor are waking up from it. Do you guys how i can prevent my problem?

Thank you guys"

I'm wanting to apply to internships and was wondering if anyone can help me with resume tips or templates. Like what all should I put on there? Like when I graduate and what classes I've taken?

Is this kind of template good?

isjeq2,1,2020-09-14,I need help where to best invest my money,HUNAcean,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/isjeq2/i_need_help_where_to_best_invest_my_money/,"So with the 9th generation knocking around the corner, and obviously I'm as excited about the 30 series as anyone, not to mention the rumoured/confirmed harder requirements of new games it just seems like it's time to upgrade. Problem is, scholarship and internships don't exactly make for a particularly fat bank account, not to mention the roughly 20% markup in hardware price here because of import taxes. 

So my budget would be about 600$. All well and good, the 3070 sounds like an obvious choice until a good look at my current computer is taken.

CPU: i5-6600k

GPU: Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB

RAM: 16GB ddr3

I also play on a single, 1080p 60hz monitor. So essentially the most wide-spread specs according to steam. 

So my dilemma is, that if I upgrade GPU, I'm going to seriously bottleneck it. If I buy a CPU I can't really tap into the additional power, the GPU-CPU combo right now is kinda well balanced. If i buy a new monitor, myabe bigger resolution or 144hz I cant really support it with power, and if I invest in power see prevoius 2 points.

If you were me where would you put your money? Would you just wait an extra year and get a PS?"

isjm3s,1,2020-09-14,Help wording an ultimatum?,AllIWantIsSpace,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/isjm3s/help_wording_an_ultimatum/,"I recently started college, and had a job I was hired to under the agreement I'd be working 20 hours or more a week, I had hoped for 3 days, and was clear. They said I had to work full time for a while for training, and I did the period they required. However now its abundantly clear they cant get enough people, and when I requested an extra day to ensure I could keep up with college, which I underestimated, I was told I couldnt until they have more people. If I fail or even get too low a grade, I'll have to pay back my GI bill, so the work will have been for nothing anyways, but I have a hard time not being too hard or soft with confrontation, so how should I word this? 

The job is second to college. If i do poorly, not only will I have to pay back the money, I'll also never get the internships I'm hoping to get later, so it really is the key to the future I want. Anyone got advice here?"

iskyhq,1,2020-09-14,Critique my OMSCS plans (please)?,donskoy1993,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/iskyhq/critique_my_omscs_plans_please/,"I've been seriously considering applying for the OMSCS but I'm trying to get some honest feedback on whether it makes sense for what my future career ambitions are (and where I currently am).

I graduated from a non-CS engineering degree (where I did one CS type course in my first year). During my uni internships, I did some VBA programming and in my first post-grad role, I dabbled into some Python &amp; data science MOOCs. 

In my current position, I'm helping out in the development of a new product that has embedded software (which I've been able to analyze and I have also completed edX courses related to embedded software that also taught C). I do minimal programming in my day-to-day job right now.

What I would like to do is transition into a information security role (hopefully something remote or US based so I can take advantage of higher salaries when compared to Canadian salaries). I've been reading a lot of resources (courses, blogs, articles, podcasts) with some hands-on materials as well relating to information security.

I am hoping to take information security courses such as CS6035, CS6250, CS6262, CS6263, CS6265 and CS8803 which seem like they place a heavy focus on completing practical assignments (and not as heavily weighted exams/midterms and also no group projects, meaning I'd actually have to do all the work myself) along with some others dictated by the Computing Systems specialization. My hope is that by doing this, I can display actual projects that I can discuss with employers and build my hard, technical skills. I'm thinking of doing one course per semester to begin with.

 I know Georgia Tech also offers an online Masters in Cybersecurity, but they share a lot of courses with the the Computer Science online Masters and they are more expensive (and I think a broader Computer Science degree would help me be eligible for more positions outside of pure information security). 

Do my plans make sense (from a career transition perspective, degree planning)? Would I be doing the OMSCS for the right reasons?"

Now I'm just sitting and wondering what work should i do. I just feel cs is toooooo damn hard. It was nothing like this when i did my internships. Why does it feel so damn hard and challenging in school. The worst is when you have the most unsupportive parents and no friends to help you through difficult times.

isn7fz,16,2020-09-14,Are these signs that the job is a bad fit? What are other watch outs that indicate you should search for a new job?,eternalbettywhite,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/isn7fz/are_these_signs_that_the_job_is_a_bad_fit_what/,"The answer to this question might be obvious but I’m doubting myself quite a bit here and talking myself into keeping this job. 

I took my current job in a large company and right out of grad school that my mentor from a previous internship recommended. It’s a bit out of my field since I am a scientist working in a more business oriented position. But I thought that since my mentor is also a scientist and will be on my team, I would do well in this position. 

It hasn’t panned out that way. I took the first job I could find out of school even though I didn’t have to. I’ve been here since January and wanted to give the job a fair shake but every day I wake up depressed and dreading it. How I feel about the job has bled into my personal life. 

I feel I’m not qualified and my experience is not as applicable as I thought. I was ultimately thrown into the position whereas if I was in R&amp;D, I would be mentored and trained for 6 months (typical standard for my small area of STEM for recent grads). I know that on the job training isn’t always the best or guaranteed, but I was hoping for a probation/shadowing period. That’s my fault for assuming. Ultimately, I’ve been here since January and the ramp up was quick, confusing, and stressful. I have been thrown into medium and high risk and/or complicated projects and have been floundering to learn and make the right decisions. 

I’m usually very much a problem solver and love a challenge but I have little interested in the products I work on or the company’s vision on the business side. I haven’t felt like I have been the best “thought leader” because of my lack of interest and experience. 

I used to give all kinds of presentations and spoke in front of others all the time but transitioning to a business focus has been hard since I am not interested in any of the work or topics. I’m nervous all the time even though I’ve worked in a corporate environment, just in R&amp;D.

Outside of meetings, I’m very siloed. I come from very a collaborative background. In grad school and internships, I’ve always seen or been involved in collaboration. I see it in this company on the technical side so I know it exists. I feel that I’m going insane at my desk all day with no sense of connection, urgency, or importance. Not talking to anyone while WFH for sometimes days at a time is draining. 

I pull data from past studies I didn’t even design, answer questions, work with my partners to design studies we pass onto an external vendor, and try to “optimize” what we do. I sit in on project meetings where I ask a question or two or answer the rare one here or there. I mainly made friends with our vendor than my own coworkers since we never speak. 

I am so lucky to have a job, despite being just *bored* and disengaged. I miss the lab, data analytics, research, collaboration, and leadership. Is this just typical first job blues or if I should just work to find a job that sparks joy. This job has affected my mental and physical health and I am so unstimulated I feel like I’m losing it. 

Are these signs of a job being a bad fit? What are other things you should look out for within yourself to know when to move on from a job that isn’t a good fit? I know I can get another job since recruiters have reached out. I’ve said no due to me wanting to be respectful of the training and questions I asked plus cost and time that went into onboarding and moving me out here. I would want to stay at least 9 more months but I’m not sure it’s worth it for me."
isntv0,6,2020-09-14,I just got my dream job in my dream field but the manager is extremely abrasive and curt with everything. is that normal ?,IHateTheSATs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/isntv0/i_just_got_my_dream_job_in_my_dream_field_but_the/,"so i just graduated and this is my first like real job out of college with benefits and stuff. 

Granted, i have worked all my life but they have always been internships, retail, food etc so I never really thought much about their way of management. 

However, as i have graduated, I landed a job as an ops supervisor with a fortune 500 and my manager is very rude to a lot of people and my coworkers agree that he does the same thing as them. 

For example, as i have started pretty recently, I have seen him yell at another employee because the employee talked about how one of his expectations that he wants us to meet at the end of the quarter is mathematically impossible. 

Another example i have noticed is that when a person was asking him the question the other day about something important, he never really acknowledged her and he was like ""are you finally done? you just wasted like 6 minutes of my life that i will never get back"" 

i mean, i understand that some people have different ways of handling situations, but is this normal ? am i supposed to just be quiet and let him do his thing since he is my manager ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have talked to my coworkers about this, and im NOT in the minority and my coworkers are jokingly (idk if they're honestly joking) about leaving the company and as someone who just graduated with this job, it does not really give me much hope as to how i feel about my path with the company."

isou71,73,2020-09-14,Career Fair Season Tips - My $0.02 as an Alum from the recruitment side,13375p33k,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/isou71/career_fair_season_tips_my_002_as_an_alum_from/,"Hey friends, this year's recruitment season is going to be super weird just like a lot of you experienced during the engineering career fair. With the business career fair coming up, here are my $0.02 from the recruitment side on what's going on plus a couple of unsolicited generic over repeated tips. My comments below are targeted at full time recruiting, but 95% of it is applicable to internship searches as well. Internship recruiting will be taken more seriously this year as many companies are giving full time offers to all interns.

My background: Alum 16', currently a management consultant at a large firm, supported campus recruiting at U of I for 2 years, IU for 1 year, and switching over to supporting MBA recruiting this year.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Virtual recruiting sucks ass for both you and the recruiter:** We know it sucks and it's going to suck even more for recruitment teams who work with multiple schools using multiple different platforms like CareerEco and variants.  We can't entirely blame CareerEco and other recruiting software for being glitchy because it's probably the first time they had to scale to this amount of users. Companies are still trying to navigate out this new normal so we're all on the same boat. That said, it doesn't mean we should throw our hands up and say ""CareerEco sucks so fuck recruiting this year"" - we still need to figure something out.
   * How to mitigate virtual recruiting issues:
      * **Cut to the chase on your 1:1s:** since we can't do organic face to face convos, it makes it harder to BS and shoot the shit with the recruiter. The video 1:1s will inevitably be more transactional, so get to the point and rehearse the shit out of your pitch. Have your notepad/cheat sheet with bullet points up on split screen while you're talking. For Windows users, it's Windows Key + Left or Right arrow to split screen
      * **Don't be a wimp and ask directly for interview slots:** This is applicable in a real career fair situation but even more important virtually. This isn't some weird dating event where you're trying to figure out the intention of the other person.  State clearly what you want, and having a little bit of aggressiveness here (just a little, I don't want you yelling at me) will help you jump the queue
      * **Have a Plan B:** if you run into technical issues, ended up not getting an interview slot or the recruiter tells you to apply online, go on LinkedIn and start blasting out messages to Alums who work in the companies you like and schedule 30 min meet and greets to score a referral. It'll be like cold calling but you gotta do it if you want to land the gig you want. Submitting an app online will put your resume into a gigantic pile that will likely never be read, verses cutting the line to the top of the stack via a referral. As long as you're not super weird and not being a dick, Alum will always be happy to refer. Asking educated questions helps when you're networking -- people love talking about themselves and what they do
* **Hiring pipeline for some fields will be different this year and generally not for the better:** Campus hiring plans for many companies will be impacted this year, but it won't be a complete halt because it's important to replenish some of the talent pipeline at entry-level. But because the supply of roles is going down this year, Econ 101 tells us it'll be more competitive to land a gig than previous years. Industries that are impacted this year you can probably guess -- my list below is just to confirm any thoughts that you may already have around this:
   * **It's gonna be dogshit**: the obvious suspects are hospitality and tourism. Anything restaurant-related is going to suck too. Oil and Gas, agribusiness (not only COVID related, but also macrotrend impacts as well), automotive, retail, real estate (commercial is beyond fucked, residential is a little less bad)
   * **Some impact**: software tech **(DEPENDS on what their products are so do your research, some tech areas are still doing great like cybersecurity vs Airbnb, Lyft, Uber),** consulting in general except for some M&amp;A areas (ITDD, ODD, carveouts, divestitures) and turnaround/restructuring which are doing ok(consulting impact will be focus/field dependent which is reflective of market conditions), boutique consulting firms will have a tougher time than the larger ones, industrial products
   * **Minimal Impact:** consumer packaged goods, financial services, accounting/audit, chipmakers (Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc.)
   * **No Impact:** Bio-pharma (in fact, some segments of pharma has hiring surges), healthcare providers, healthcare payers (insurance companies), medical devices
* **How do you win in this environment:** due to the competitive environment this year the only way to win is to be more focused than your peers and be better prepared. Some generic tips below:
   * **Job hunting is a numbers game:** Say you have a 10% positive response rate based on the number of apps you submit. Are you going to score more interviews with 10 applications or 100? Simple math here guys
   * **Treat every interview as your last one, there isn't room to fuck around this year:** I know some folks have the mentality of treating interviews with less desirable firms as a practice session which you can afford during non-COVID years. Due to the hiring pipeline constraints this year, I'd highly recommend not to fuck around and prep the shit out of every interview like your life depends on it. Memorize your answers, nail your whiteboard/coding interviews, re-read your case interviews 100x, practice with your parents/friends/friends on interviews every day so you're a baller at talking about your accomplishments
   * **Outside of extracurriculars, build some hard skills/knowledge:** Previous years you might've been able to slide by being a fake VP of a keg stand/bar crawl club that's disguised as a charity but to set you apart this year, it'll definitely help if you can get some certifications outside of school (even Coursera is fine) on topics that are relevant to your field, or the field you're interested in. There are many free certification tracks you can get through Coursera, free MOOCs, or very low-cost programs with student discounts. We'd much rather chat with you about the stuff you've learned, than a useless leadership story of how you coordinated an Unofficial keg party
   * **If you can't find anything, it means you aren't applying enough or doing enough LinkedIn reachouts:** If you aren't hearing back for and from interviews, it means you're not aggressive enough in the number of apps you're sending out, and not reaching out to enough alums. If you're getting interviews but not making it to final rounds, it means you need to prep harder for your interviews. Job hunting is a numbers game, period. If your success rate is 0.05%, you'll find a job after sending out 200 applications. Keep pounding away LinkedIn messages, apps, and setting up networking calls with alum until you land a gig. It's not unusual for some folks having to send out 100-300 apps or more before they land something.

Good luck to all of you. This year is gonna suck but I'm confident we'll all persevere. Feel free to drop any questions in the comments. 

Edit: One thing forgot to add is based on what I've heard from internal discussions, roles and quotas for visa sponsorship are likely reduced due to risks caused by immigration policy uncertainty. Having a bunch of folks on OPT with a potential risk of not getting a visa granted is too high of a recruitment risk for some firms to take. Visa application/acceptance metrics have been abysmal recently, and that's something completely out of our control. It's an unfortunate situation really but that's the reality. Not necessarily discouraging international students to participate in recruiting, but you may have to manage your expectations."

I am in the process of applying for the SIG Dublin Summer Internship for Trading in 2021.

The reason I have written into this forum is to gain additional knowledge on the application stages, which I am aware are pretty rigorous. The main agenda of this post is to get assistance with the SIG Quantitative Evaluation which is done through the 3rd party - MettI.

To prepare, having a (relatively) limited career in Mathematics I have came across these topics to look further into for this assessment, and feel free to state to me which ones I should consider should I have missed an area out or included an area I have not:
• Calc 1 Optimization
• Stats/probability
• Parametric Equasions
• Finding number of maximum parametric function
• Bayesian Statistics
• Brain teasers

Should there be anything I should look into before I take the application? I need to apply myself to ensure that I am successful however I am aware that it will be a challenging process and any additional guidance would be massively appreciated, e.g. online resources, books, individuals to contact, etc.

And a lot of debt.

For nearly four years after that I've been self studying computer science and programming and work whiles work a low paying physical job, I've made several projects and contributions to open source projects in that time. 

I've gone through entire textbooks on operating systems, hardware architecture, data structures and algorithms, compilers, assembly, software engineering, and more. Basically self studying a degree trying to figure out computers from first principles. Obviously I have no professional credentials to validate this.

I got a low paying job offer for an entry level dev. position for 16/$ which I stupidly rejected, and got through several rounds of interviews for other companies but was rejected from all of them eventually. 

The dreaded question is always about degree or work experience, which I try to tell them that my open source contributions and projects should constitute to some level, but that always feels weak. I am pretty confident in my bullshiting abilties, I know how to photoshop well if need be.

I really don't see anything to lose by lying, the decision matrix would seemingly always work in my favour. 

If I don't get caught, I have a greater chance of getting the job. 

If I get caught before the offer it seems unlikely they would do anything other than ghost me, suing from my research seems extremely rare. 

If I get caught after I start working at the job, it's essentially a free internship, again, being sued seems extremely rare. 

I supposed I could be shamed but I can't imagine someone going through the effort. 

If I never get caught, winner winner chicken dinner? 

I have no dignity left to lose because I'm already pretty much a pure loser degenerate.

Thoughts?"

I'll try to sanitize my resume and get it posted for feedback but I figured I'd just ask some basic questions. 

I'm about 9 years into my career now and potentially looking for a change. I've been dusting off my resume and there are some things I'm really not happy with that I don't know how to change. 

First off let me preface this by saying I've had a bit of a... odd career path I think. 

I started as an intern, got hired full time as an Associate Software Engineer (SE), got promoted to mid-level SE, took a job at a different (more prestigious) company but took a title demotion to ASE again. Then went to a bigger company where I was hired as a Senior SE (so on my resume my history goes SE -&gt; ASE -&gt; SSE).

I was at my first company for about 2 years, my second for 1.5 years, and I've been at my current company for about 5 years now. 

After about 1.5 years as an SSE, I was given an opportunity to 'stretch"" into a more business-centric role (Product Manager) and I agreed to it since I wanted to learn more about how the engineering work impacts the business. Long story short, I kind of hated the product role but stayed in it way longer than I think I should have.

Where I'm struggling is how to represent my current employer on my resume. In the 5 years I've been here I was a Senior Software Engineer, Technical Product Owner, Senior Product Manager, and now I'm trying to go back to Engineering as an SSE. 

My issue is since I was out of the engineering role for so long (3ish years) I'm afraid I won't get anyone interested in me if I list 1.5 years as SSE, 3 years PM, .5 years SSE as 3 different positions. At the same time putting it all in one big bucket (SSE and PM from 2015-2020) makes the block very big and also leads me to some tense questions (I was told to put your current role in current tense always but some of the work I did 5 years ago I don't do anymore so it feels weird to say ""Implements"" vs. ""Implemented""). 

I know this is a wall of text and I'll try to get a resume uploaded soon but based on this any tips on how to best set myself up for success? I've been back in engineering for about 6 months now and am doing well in the role (positive feedback from managers and colleagues) so I'm confident in my abilities but just not sure how to represent it on a resume. 

Thanks"

However, I feel like I don't really know what or how much I should be doing outside of course work to prepare myself. So far, in classes, I have learned C/C++ (which is what I'm most comfortable with), some OS, algorithms and data structures, a little bit of Linux, a little bit of shell scripting, and a little bit of computer architecture. Outside of class, I have learned a little bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript on my own (but I'm not very good with it) and have been Leetcoding somewhat regularly. I have looked at job descriptions for software engineer or tech analyst roles and many of them seem somewhat vague (as in not really requiring knowledge of a specific language but more like ""deep experience with technology/programming""). However, I know that it is not easy to get into these companies and I want to know what I should do. Is everything I am/will be learning in school enough?

Going through the internship application process this summer has made me feel very unprepared and inadequate for the industry; especially when seeing other people's accomplishments/knowledge, like building a whole app and using all of these languages that I may not even have heard of, while I struggled with building something small like a Chrome extension.

So I recently graduated with a bachelors degree in an engineering discipline after having changed schools from a highly acclaimed private university to a community college and finally a area public university. Granted I didn’t do well starting out at the first school and only made it through 2 years before heading back to my hometown and part timing it for 4.5 years and getting my associates then finishing my bachelors in another 2.5 years so I’m just getting the feeling that having stuck with my co-op/internship over 7 of those 9 years and leaving that job to finish my final two semesters full time and graduate that none of the potential employers, I have been in contact with, see that as a good thing. I mean I also started out with basically failing out at a 1.8 gpa then moved on to graduate with a 3.38 gpa for my bachelors. It is also very hard to find a job when all the entry level spots want 3 or more years design experience or actual engineering experience, does my internship experience actually correlate to engineering experience when it was mostly manufacturing support and quality control based? I guess I don’t really know how to market myself to a job prospect even though I am a dedicated guy who works hard and knows a decent amount of stuff and is not afraid to mess it up trying to figure out how to fix the issue but with due diligence I usually figure it out or know when to ask for help.

The career fair is significantly smaller this year than last year for computer science at my school, I've seen a lot of companies only post internships and not new grad (maybe they stagger the timing of posting new grad postings from internships?), and other factors that are unforeseen due to covid might also be playing a role in a smaller new grad posting pool i.e. they prefer hiring back the more senior software engineers that might have been let go or more senior software engineers might be forced to jump into a lower paying role which is more favorable than hiring a junior, etc.

With all that said, I'm thinking about applying for internships for companies with no new grad postings but also both internships and new grad postings if both are posted, is this a good/bad idea? Internships seem like they usually have a decent conversion rate depending on the company, if not at least buying me some time to apply to actual jobs for when the internship is over.

Here is the twenty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

but since I live in india, I don't have any actual internship opportunity in the field. 

So I have decided to upgrade myself by studying and working more. But rn, I want advice on what to do for next year internship rounds. 

I am planning for a transfer to a foreign University, but corona makes it seem impossible. Hence, I want to prepare on how to ace interviews and tests. 

The thing that hurts my profile is, low gpa. We got promoted last sem and our uni made sure to give us the shitty-est score they could. And now my CGPA is at 7.56. 

So currently I am trying to make it 8. What else should I work on that can help me get a good internship and then a job around the figures of  23,000-30,000$.

Thank you :"")"

I asked what were the things they need help with, and turned out, they were bad at using Microsoft Team, Outlook, and related products, and have problem organizing their projects, not getting email notification, etc, and need my assistant with it., and literally, my current task is to research Microsoft Team's utility for them.

tl;dr school is hard and stressful, struggling to find balance

Currently a junior studying Aerospace Engineering. I missed out on the transition to online classes last semester since I was doing an internship so this is my first experience with Zoom and online proctoring software such as honorlock. Classes (thermo, difeq, linear algebra, mechanics, dynamics) are so extremely difficult that I am struggling to find time to let down. I feel as if no matter how long or hard that I study, I am always somehow behind. I'm not a bad student, I've maintained a 3.9 for a couple years now but fear this could be my breaking semester. I understand that balancing your life is important and finding time to go brain-dead is essential when taking strenuous classes, yet I am always telling myself this is the final push in a seemingly infinite uphill path. I am not the only one struggling with this transition. Professors (mainly older ones) have no clue how to conduct zoom classes. Many of my current professors simply aim the camera at a blackboard as if it were an in person class and are unaware or refuse to use the chat functions. Some even refuse to lecture and hand out written notes. This is frustrating as I am paying full tuition while basically teaching myself these classes myself.

I am also doing undergraduate research part-time along with multiple club involvements.

Anyway I have five tests spread over the next week so I'm gonna get back to it. 

The struggle is real."

Our student-run team is currently working on a Cubesat mission called REALOP, which is projected to launch next year to be deployed into low earth orbit from the ISS! 

The electrical team's current focus is the finalization of our printed circuit board design. We have many prototype boards in various stages of manufacturing and assembly and we are looking for new members who are interested in assisting with these later stages of design. This can entail schematic drawing and PCB layout in our current software, Autodesk Fusion 360, as well as future assembly and testing of these boards. These boards will include: a flight computer based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, a battery/power management board and solar panels, and a communications system based on an amateur radio transceiver developed by [AMSAT](https://www.amsat.org/) and modified for integration by our team.

All class and experience levels are welcome (including incoming freshman) — all you need is to be willing to learn! Participation in this club is an excellent opportunity to gain experience in electrical engineering and contacts in the aerospace industry, and we have multiple alumni working at NASA or elsewhere in the spacecraft industry. I can personally attribute landing my first internship to experience I gained through this club.

My name is Brandon and I am the electrical team lead. Those interested in participating can either [email me](mailto:bealba@ucdavis.edu) or PM me here on Reddit. This post is intended specifically for prospective members of the electrical team, however anyone interested in the club can still reach out to me and I can direct you to the other teams in our project such as structures and programming."

I think I really lucked out. I've started internship prep less than two weeks ago and I submitted my first work application ever on Tuesday. Today, I heard back from Intel and I was given an interview offer. I really did not expect this at all, and my feelings are all over the place right now....

I've always been a little scared of the technical interview since first year after hearing so many people's experience and how it didn't go well. I only have about 11 days to prepare for this interview, and I'm not really sure where to start (other than to Leetcode).

If anyone could share their experiences, or answer any of these questions - I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advanced!

For the record, I've applied for the Software Engineer (C/C++, Python, Verilog) PEY position for the Toronto office!

Questions:

* Should I focus on easy-medium Leetcode questions? **Is there any need to go over trees, traversals, graph/network algorithms or anything scientific?** (I'm very worried about this one)
* My 90-min interview will be split between 2-3 people. Will I expect one part of it to be asked my soft skills, previous experiences and then do a technical portion with someone else?
* What does Intel usually do for the technical portion - whiteboarding or livecoding? 
* What can I expect when being interviewed about hardware? 

Recommendations for interview resources are also appreciated! :D"

I thought this much work is truly overwhelming.  I don't know all these things. I am interested in Data Science and I am doing a few personal projects in Data Science. I did some of my own research and I have a few questions in mind:

1. Is there any difference between the hiring process, requirements and other things for on campus placements, applying off campus, applying for a position outside India.
2. I read somewhere that companies (product based companies in India and abroad, FAANG companies) don't really care if you know any kind of development or not. They only care about DS, Algo and your problem solving skills.
3. Are certifications really necessary?
4. Are DS, Algo and problem solving really more important than internships and projects?
5. What do companies outside of India really look for if I want to work there?

If you could guide me and end my confusion it would be really appeciated."

I seriously need some help. Right now I'm a teen in school looking for some hobby to keep me busy. I also would like to get a job sometime or have some way of making money and I need help finding out how to do it. I love building pcs and so far I've built 2 and helped 3 others build their own. I want to do something related to pcs for now. I was thinking about building custom pcs for people but that comes with it's own issues. The main issue is trust. If the customer pays after the build is complete, how do I know I will get the money? If the customer doesn't want the PC, I'm stuck with a very expensive build that I paid for just sitting around. If I want the customer to pay me before, how can the customer know that I will give them the build, or how can they trust me? The only way I can think of is they pay after and if they don't i sell it on Ebay or something? It doesn't make much sense to me to have them pay before. I am aware of troubleshooting problems but don't worry about that.

Also, what are some places I can work or intern at related to building computers? I obviously want to make some money but I also want to learn more about computers.

I’ve worked a few business student jobs in the past, but I’ve landed them through applications I’ve sent on my own, rather than through contacts that have referred me. Unfortunately with covid, I know having a direct referral could be a lot more effective than sending out applications. 

I feel like I have to swallow my pride and be like, “hey remember me? I’m that intern from years ago and now need your help despite not having talked to you in months/years... you got any jobs or openings in mind for me?/could you be my reference?”

Is that rude? I find that it’s a lot easier to approach and ask for help when you develop a close relationship, almost friendship, with a boss. This is the case for my retail jobs since they tend to be closer to my age. However I find that my relationships with my internships were lukewarm at best, as I’m quite reserved around the office and there were age gaps that slightly intimidated me as a shy student. 

Also, I know it is partially also my fault for not maintaining the relationship or keeping in touch after leaving the workplace. I have developed good lasting business connections, just not with the manager I would report to. 

Sorry if this was more of a rant. Just wondering if anyone else felt the same way, or have any tips to overcome this.


TL;DR I feel rude or intrusive asking for favours from people I haven’t contacted in months or even years."

I'm a second-year computer engineering major and I'm looking into getting a minor to supplement my education. Aside from potential job benefits for pursuing a minor in communication, I believe that it can help me improve my interpersonal skill. I'm naturally shy and not good at communicating with others. This is a problem for me because it puts me at a disadvantage towards my peers who are competing for the same internships as me and having inadequate communication skills makes me feel less confident as a person. I have anxiety when it comes to conversating with people, and I believe it's due to my lack of exposure to being in a social environment. I want to be able to become an effective and confident speaker by the time I graduate from college. I also want to be capable of having and holding a conversation with anyone I talk to and hopefully become a more social person. However, I'm not sure if pursuing a minor in communication is the right path because of other easier paths I can go on, that will help reach the same end-goal. Or maybe pursuing a communication minor isn't the right path to help me reach my goals. 

So that's why I'm here. Will the knowledge and skills I gain from a communication minor benefit me in the industry? How will having one benefit me?"

I am employed at Google as a Software Engineer and work on  Search, almost entirely on software dev in c++/golang.

My research experience includes an internship at MS Research, 2 papers, 2 program committee volunteering and part time project with Google Brain at my job but these are not very streamlined (spread across NLP/Audio/Software Eng). 

The prospects of career growth/transition don't seem high with my current experience and Bachelors (India, CS, 3.5GPA) and hence, I'm considering the OMSCS program. I want to understand:

*  if it's possible to finish the 8 courses in about a year and a half, (job: 50hrs/week)?
* if the online degree will make employment in the US/EU any easier, (VISA implications of online degrees and do firms differentiate b/w online vs on-campus degree)?
* if the degree is be worth 1.5 - 2 years time that I would otherwise continue putting into my job?

I have thought about going for a PhD instead, and decided against it due to the long time commitment and if I can maintain consistent interest for a few years. OMCS seems like a safer bet.

The company is big and lots of security and benefits. I got furloughed like the rest of my department and waited around for months. Finally I got a job offer from another company. The company is much smaller, less organized but has room to grow because there are only 17 employees and like 4 developers. 

I like where I am and I work from home but the pay is a little less than I wanted at 50k. My old job (the internship) just emailed me that the department is back up and running (it’s a sports company) and that he would hire me full time at 55k. I turned down the offer because I didn’t want to leave where I am over just 5k more.

But now he is asking what salary I would want. He might go up to 60 or maybe 62k and that would be tempting. I’ve only been at my new job for 5 months so I feel so awkward having to give back the computer and telling them I’m going back to my other job. The job I’m at now I can work from home, the work is more challenging, but I’m not always developing. The other job is much easier development, probably not as much room to go but a solid good workplace."

This is quite long, so I thank you for your time in advance.

I'm in my final year of a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the Isfahan University of Tech (ranked 642 by CWUR in 2018-19). My overall GPA is 3.58, and my major GPA is 3.66. In the past few years, I've been learning ML, specifically Deep Learning, and I've got a few research projects to back this up; without going into details, and in chronological order:

* A novel technique for Structural Health Monitoring; no contribution to DL, but outperforms previous works by a small margin. One of my professors suggests to publish it, but I don't think it has any significant contribution.
* Demand prediction for cancer patients; no contribution to DL, but better than anything we found in medical journals, along with a novel dataset we want to make public. Currently working on the paper manuscript. I'm the second author on the paper (out of three, the first being my friend who had the most contribution, and the third, a professor currently working at the National University of Singapore; he was living in Iran when the project started).
* Improving performance in embedded networks; no specific contribution to DL, but we propose a novel unsupervised technique for training networks, which improved performance significantly beyond anything published before. Currently working on the paper manuscript. I'm the first author on the paper (out of two, the second being a professor from the Eindhoven University of Technology).
* In my internship program at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, we worked on a model for MS diagnostics using OCT scans of the retina, with the primary goal of interpretability. I don't think the professor I worked with is planning on publishing anything related to this, but the lab in Germany that gave us the dataset for this project is going to use this model in practice for real-world cases!
* For my thesis project, I worked with a graduate student from the Simon Frasor University on a Super Resolution Project. I initially helped out with her theory and experiments, but now, I'm solely working on a new branch of the project, separated from her work. I was told at the beginning that my name would not be on this project, and I was okay with it. I'm just to have been a part of it!

Due to the current economic state of my country, it is absolutely impossible for me to pay my tuition or the cost of living in a foreign country. My father's annual income amounts to 2400 USD! I'll be needing a scholarship that completely covers the costs of education and living if I'm to stay abroad. I've looked up some programs, and so far, I haven't come across one that even comes close to this level. I'm more than willing to take a job or work as a TA, but as far as I've understood, it's not easy to find a job with an education visa, and even if I could, there's no guarantee I'd be able to find one.

I'm looking forward to hearing your opinion on my case. Do you think I should even try, or is this already a lost cause? Do you happen to know any programs that might fit me?

I greatly appreciate your help."

I was an aspiring lawyer who switched into Computer Science after attending my first hackathon back in 2010. Before founding MLH I was a software engineer and developer advocate for 5+ years. During that time I built the first platform to help developers showcase the work they were doing at hackathons and eventually sold the company to Intel.

I founded MLH back in 2013. We're a Public Benefit Corporation (B-Corp) focused on empowering our next generation of technologists. Every year we run more than a thousand learning-focused events where aspiring developers learn practical skills to launch their tech careers. Last year alone nearly 100,000 developers attended our events, including many of you here!

The tech industry is going through a lot of changes right now. With so many companies going through layoffs and reducing budgets/headcount right now, it's especially tough for those of you hoping to enter the industry as interns or new grads. For context, this past summer nearly 20,000 developers in our community lost jobs and internships and another 25,000 weren't able to find one directly as a result of the pandemic.

We’ve been doing everything we can at MLH to support and empower those impacted. We committed to running [digital hackathons](http://mlh.io/events) every weekend of the year, started hosting virtual [skill-based technical workshops](http://mlh.io/localhost) every day of the week, and launched an internship alternative called the [MLH Fellowship](http://fellowship.mlh.io/). All of these programs are designed to help aspiring technologists gain the hands-on experience they need to build their resume/portfolio and launch their careers.

I'm here today to answer questions about how to navigate launching your career in all this uncertainty, my experience running one of the largest developer communities in the world, entrepreneurship, and everything in between. AMA!

itblnh,55,2020-09-15,How to find out if a company invests time into their entry-level/grad employees?,ColdSlayer95,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/itblnh/how_to_find_out_if_a_company_invests_time_into/,"A lot of the Software Engineer grad scheme's I see advertised are two years long, which seems like it could be a crucial period as I assume that by the end of it you would (potentially) be expected to have the skills of an upper junior/mid-level engineer. Furthermore, some of these schemes have £2k+ sign-on bonuses which I've read can make it difficult to leave the company as you'd be expected to pay it back. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

I did a 4-month internship at a small/mid company which was growing too fast to dedicate much time to their entry-level developers, during my internship I witnessed a grad developer who had been working there for 8 months learn barely anything at all, the company had no real expectations of him and he wasn't self-motivated, he sat on reddit for 90% of the week and was occasionally tasked with doing the occasional super small code change. He was subsequently and abruptly fired at the 11 month mark.

To the Software Engineers of cscareerquestionsEU, a lot of these polished and shiny grad schemes look amazing on the surface, but **if there are any, what signs/questions can a new grad look out for/ask to indicate that a company actually invests time in their entry-level staff?** (e.g. find out whether they personal development time, mentor/buddy schemes etc)

I'd also love to hear from people who signed up for a 1 or 2 year grad scheme and felt that they didn't get a lot out of it, why didn't you like it/what would you improve/did you leave early?"
itciba,1,2020-09-15,Want to change field. Should I do a 2nd Masters?,vcarpe,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/itciba/want_to_change_field_should_i_do_a_2nd_masters/,"I did a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering in Portugal and ended up at a Big 4 of consulting in Data Analytics. I did this decision without really thinking. Just thought ""It has a good name"". I ended up regreting it on my 1st day.

4 months forward I got a job in Germany. It was a company in the automotive sector, so I figured it could be interesting, since it seemed more related to the industry. At the end, they placed me on a similar field as before: Data Analytics. But this time it seemed slightly more interesting. And I would receive double the salary I would receive in Portugal.

Now, after 7 months, I realized that this area isn't really for me. I hate it. I hate things related to business and multiple Powerpoints. And this is not my strength. I am a more technical guy. R and D sounds good to me, not this Business BS. (I have already done 2 RD internships, and I liked both) 

I wish to switch to a field related to Robotics/computer Vision/AI.

My masters gave my some bases on AI/Computer Vision and robotics. But I am not sure if it is enough.

I want to switch to a more technical field in one of these 3 areas I referenced, here in germany. Not in Portugal. But I feel that it might be complicated, since I still haven't mastered German (B2). At the same time, I think that the fact that I have quited 2 jobs in less than 1 year looks bad on the CV (I have been in this one for 7 months and quited the last one after 4 months), so my chances will probably be even lower. 

So I was thinking that maybe I could apply for a masters in robotics in germany, try to get in a great university, get top level grades, try to find an internship while I do my masters. And in this way I can give myself more time to master german, will be able to get a job I like with a higher probability, and be able to work in a great company, which will open more doors in the future. So I think this investment can compensate longterm.

But simultaniously it hurt do ""waste"" 2 more years. I will be 27/28 when I start working again. It really hurts. But I feel that this can open many new doors longterm.

What do you think? Does it make any sense what I am saying?"

I'm stressed out and I don't know how to go about doing things.

For example, it seems ideal for a CS student to land his/her first internship in the summer before senior year. That would be next summer for me. As a result, I created a list of companies I'm about to apply to in the coming days, but I feel so unprepared for an interview in the scenario where I do receive a response back from a company. Im aware that these interviews place heavy emphasis on data structures, a class that I actually did well in last semester. I should've been practicing data structure problems all summer to bolster my knowledge on that subject to prepare for an internship interview, but unfortunately I lacked the motivation to do so, as I didn't know if I'd stick with this major this fall.

Im ready to do whatever it takes in order to get ahead (or is it too late?), but it seems like such a tall task to re-learn data structures on my own time this fall to prepare for internship interviews, while working a job and dealing with my other classes this semester. What should I do? Perhaps it's more feasible to get a co-op next fall, instead of an internship? That may give me more time to prepare for job interviews and strengthen my resume.

Review Help Please :),ejmejm1,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/itgogp/top_cs_grad_program_acceptance_chances_review/,"I finished undergrad December of last year, am taking a year break to work in industry, but now want to apply to go back and start grad school! Would love to hear what you think my chances are for some top CS programs (both Masters and PhD). While a PhD is ideal, I think I have no chance so I'm applying mainly for Masters with a research focus in ML. To the meaty stuff:

**Degree:** Computer Science B.S.

**School:** Top 40-75 in CS

**General GPA:** 3.58 \[ :( \]

**Major GPA:** 3.67

**GRE:** 165 verbal, 169 quant (estimate based on practice exams)

**Research experience:** Worked with grad student for 1 year on NLP, worked on independent research in RL for 1 year on a novel idea, but neither led to publications. These were both during school, not internships.

**Recommendations:** 1 great from professor that oversaw my independent research, 1 okay/good from professor I kind of know but is very well known in the field, 1 great from manager at FANG company.

**Work experience:**

* 1.2 years **part time** as ML engineer at startup
* 4 months **internship** software engineer at FANG company, with NLP focused project
* \~1 year **full time** software engineer at different FANG company

**Projects:** I have a lot of projects on my GitHub, a couple well documented, almost all in NLP and RL. I suspect I should have gathered some decent open source contributions on a big ML library by the time I apply if it matters.

**Awards:** Won several large hackathons, small science scholarship in undergrad, Dean's list every semester undergrad  (do any of these even matter in grad school?)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think the changes I get into top 5 and top 20 Masters/PhD programs are? I feel like a huge weakness in my application is the lack of publications and not great GPA. I was very adamant about not doing research until late into my junior year which I think is part of the reason I was never very focused on those things, but after my opinion changed I regret not focusing on those things earlier.

Is that something I can put in my SoP? I want to try and show that even though I started late and haven't published, I work on lots of research related projects and stay up to date on SOTA papers and the like.

I made the unfortunate and lucrative decision to work on the Salesforce platform 5 years ago.  I didn’t go to school for CS, so my CS related career options coming out of school were inevitably limited.  After wrapping up an internship and graduating, I needed to pay my bills and student loans and took a job as a web support specialist at an internet based bank.  The job was boring, but it almost paid my bills and I took it upon myself to make friends with the devs and work on some small projects at night which was pretty fun.  After a few months, I was offered the opportunity to switch teams and work as a Salesforce Developer.  Since this new job switch would increase my pay, I made the jump.  Since that fateful day, I’ve been trying to weasel my way out of Salesforce land and work as a “real” software engineer on some more interesting problems and products.

I spent the last three or so years working for a small company in a 50/50 split Salesforce/MEAN stack environment and was writing a lot of code and having some fun.  I mostly stuck around for the money and stability while going back to school in pursuit of an MS in CS (which I just started).  I also built a small app on the side a year or so ago in an attempt to learn concepts outside of Salesforce.  That little app has ended up generating a small amount of revenue every month (basically a breakeven at this point) which has been cool.  

Last month however, I was offered the opportunity to work for a large and notable tech company as a Salesforce Developer, which I accepted for financial and career development (how do the big boys do it) type reasons.  After a few weeks in, I’m already regretting my decision to stay tethered to the SF platform, but the pay is great and I could use the money.  My dream has always been to work on something tangible and core to the company I work for, yet all I’ve done for a half-decade is seemingly the exact opposite.  I thought I was setting myself up on the right career trajectory when I took that first Salesforce Developer gig, now 5 years in I just feel burnt out, unfulfilled and unqualified to make a change.  If I could start all over, I would have loved to work on embedded software systems, or on the core product offering at a tech company, instead of on the systems that support the core business and the business end users. 

How realistic and painful (financially) will it be to transition to a more relevant technology stack, and therefore work on more interesting projects at this point in my career?  Should I expect to start from the bottom again?  I’ve worked with Java, C#, and various client-side frameworks and DB technologies professionally and C++ academically, but they definitely haven’t been the focal point of my career, as Salesforce has always taken center stage.

Has anyone else made this kind of jump late-ish into your career, how much did it hurt, and how did you do it?  Looking for advice and stories.  Thanks!"

While working at a construction company is not ideal, it is still a job and may provide me with practical experience. The interviewers expressed that they really liked my ideas and told me I was a standout candidate. 

After that interview was successful, I was tasked with completing a few assessments so the company could further review my skills. I guess I did well because they asked me to come in for a final interview this week. 

While this is amazing news, I also received emails from two other companies I applied for. They asked if I could interview with them this week. Of course, I didn't turn down the offers because I want to be able to keep my options open. 

For the other two jobs, one is a part-time position as a Marketing Coordinator and the other is a paid Creative Marketing internship. I would really like to keep my focus around marketing, social media, and writing which is why I was a bit hesitant about the position at the construction company. However, the position there is full-time and has a generous pay.

I guess I'm making this post because I am nervous about how all of this will play out. If the construction company offers me a position on the spot, what do I tell them? Should I accept the offer upfront or tell them that I need to weigh out my options? I don't want to keep them hanging or make it seem as if I'm uninterested, but I want to at least have the time to be able to make an informed decision (if I'm successful with the other interviews).

Any advice helps. Thanks!"

Unfortunately i switched very late so I was already pretty behind in general. Instead of graduating on time in may of 2021, My new date is December of 2021. Do any of you have advice on what I should do to use my time as best as I can. I want to try to get an internship or something during the winter intersession to start building experience but I’m not really sure what I really should be doing. 

So far I am in Java 3 this semester. I am also learning python, Linux and am teaching myself C."

I'm about to start a customer service position in an IT company after two years in the hospitality sector. 
I'm also about to start my 2nd year of CS undergrad (working full-time, studying part-time). 

I have had the bad surprise to see that some companies have already opened and closed their internships positions for 2021 (so I would need to start applying now  for an internship) 

Before changing jobs, my plan was to do a summer internship in 2021 before doing the mandatory one in 3rd year. 
But I would really like to grow in the company I'm about to start at and I don't think that quitting/asking for a three-month unpaid leave within the first year is an okay thing to do.
Side note : the IT services of this company are in a different country so no way to easily move from one service to another. 

Second issue : I don't have any side-project under my belt right now and I'm afraid that if I apply now and get rejected because my resume is not appealing enough, I might not be considered when applying next year (for the mandatory internship). 

The realistic thing to do seems to be : do my best to grow in my company, work on side-projects and find an internship for 2022 but I would have loved to have more than one internship when graduating. 


Would anyone have any thought about the whole situation?"

I've had coding experience in high school with mostly Java, then learned C++ and Python in college. Took Data Structures last semester but I can't remember much, and technical coding interviews scare the crap out of me because I cave pretty bad under pressure, and I'm not sure if I'll remember everything.

I just feel like I'm not the best at application? I work as a tutor and tutor other students with their Java C++ and Python projects but I feel like I'm only good at getting good grades and not at actually applying my knowledge. It's making me nervous because I don't even have any personal projects (I'm planning on starting some soon because of my sudden realization that it really looks like I just sat on my ass for 3 years and did nothing). I did a research opportunity this summer and ""technically"" worked with C, but I got carried by the senior I was working with because it was my first time working with threads (or with C in general).

I guess right now I'm just wondering how tiny things like for loops or data structures help with building something huge that software engineers do. It seems like I'm so far away from actually understanding how to apply code that I don't know where to start.

Is it the end of the world if I can't get an internship in junior year summer? Is it alright that I feel so lost right now? I feel like on paper I look alright because my GPA is relatively high but I feel like I just know nothing at all."

ito3wp,4,2020-09-15,Is this even a good year to apply to Humanities PhD programs in the US?,Sweet_Autumn,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ito3wp/is_this_even_a_good_year_to_apply_to_humanities/,"Hi Folks,

Thank you in advance for reading this long post!  I'm looking forward to engaging with the community. I graduated this May  (2020) with a BA in Anthropology and minors in Economics and English from a medium sized, public university in the Midwest. As with the rest of the world, the pandemic has dramatically changed my plans. I am now home with my family and am working a remote internship. During my time as an undergraduate, I did a lot of research work in the fields of anthropology, decolonial studies, and cultural rhetorics. I really enjoy the research process and felt strongly about pursuing a PhD in the US. However, I keep reading about many schools and departments closing admissions for Fall 2021 and funding dramatically decreasing causing departments to downsize the Fall 2021 cohort. I, also, keep hearing about how the applicant pool is going to significantly inflate in the next application cycle due to closed and/or restricted admissions this cycle. Initially, I was feeling VERY motivated and energized about applying to PhD programs in anthropology, but now, I'm feeling pessimistic and discouraged about putting together my application materials as I know the competition is going be fierce this year (owing to the terrible job market and more people returning to academia) and acceptance rates will be even lower coupled with smaller funding packages. Additionally, the following reasons are making me rethink if it even makes sense to apply to PhD programs this year.   I'd love to hear your thoughts/suggestions/advice/considerations. 

1. Department culture and dynamics: I spent the last month conducting  informational interviews with 18 current doctoral students in different anthropology programs across the nation (University of Michigan, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, Rutgers, Harvard, among others). Many troubling  themes emerged from these interviews: normalization of hazing as  academic rigor, little to no pedagogy training for graduate students teaching classes, serious toxicity in departments, professors and mentors humiliating students , serious issues with white supremacy.  While none of this is new or surprising, it's the pervasiveness of these  issues across department cultures that is making me nervous. Many of the folks I spoke to shared stories of marginalized students being bullied out of programs,  students of color dropping out because of the alienation they experienced, and sexual harassment issues. Also, as a 22 year old South Asian WOC, I want to be cognizant of picking a department and mentors that will be sustainable for long term engagement as a student.
2.  Funding and Covid: I also spoke with a lot of administrators and faculty on review committees, who have indicated that all universities are entering the Fall 2020 semester with a deficit, which is only going to worsen the next academic year. So I worry about the possibility of getting accepted into a good program with a solid funding package. 
3.  Masters or PhD: I can only afford a fully funded MA program. Not to toot my own horn, but many mentors have told me that I've already done  Master's level work in my undergraduate time. I presented my research work 11 times at regional and national conferences. I have two academic publications (an article and a co-authored book chapter) that will be published early-mid next year. I also worked three jobs and 2  internships as an undergraduate. I know that I will certainly learn more through a MA program, but I just don't know if it makes sense to pursue a partially funded MA program. I was looking forward to a PhD to  conduct my own fieldwork; however, I don't know how that is going to change due to the pandemic. 

With this context, I guess my questions are: Does it make sense to apply for the Fall 2021 admissions cycle or is it advisable to take more time off and gauge how academia responds to this dynamic situation? What general advice and suggestions do you have for me?  How do you see Covid impacting funding, acceptance rates, and general department culture in academia? What Fellowship programs and/or other opportunities do you suggest looking into if I decide to hold off applications for another year? What are ways to acquire funding for MA programs? Do you recommend that I apply to MA programs instead of PhD programs?

Thanks a lot for patiently reading my post! I look forward to engaging with you all!"

If my goals were to work in SiV in the future, should i postpone grad until may 2022, find an software internship or two for winter and summer. Or should I graduate straight and try to get into software without a relevant internship?

Another reason i am considering postponing, is i would get to avoid most of the COVID recession when i'm looking for a FT postion, money isnt a big issue since i've saved enough living expenses to weather a year and a half of school

what do you guys think?"

 Hey everyone, here are 19 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
itv25m,2,2020-09-16,How do i value add as an analyst intern in a startup,jffryteo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/itv25m/how_do_i_value_add_as_an_analyst_intern_in_a/," 

My company has a data platform ( something like crunchbase ). I'm a analyst intern and my background is bachelors in computing &amp; information systems. I have decent python and sql skills but lack statistical knowledge. It's a startup so my role and job scope is not well defined so i'm pretty independent which is great and is what i enjoy but i'm having trouble identifying what would be beneficial for the company and what is feasible in terms of my skill set .

It's my 3rd week, and my main project was analyze existing text data so that we could gather insight on how to improve classifications. I was thinking of coming up with more python scripts so that it is easier for future analysts to get data preprocessed as well as have some simple visuals so that they are able to get a high level view whether the text data makes sense. It kind of feels like it falls into the category of data engineering? I've read a little into NLP as well but it kind of feels like it's above my ability and if i were to get into it, its going to take a long while.

Could anyone advise on what you would do in my situation! Would be helpful from a data analyst or data engineer perspective"
itv2za,14,2020-09-16,Good Aerospace Companies around Atlanta area to intern at this summer?,j-fen-di,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/itv2za/good_aerospace_companies_around_atlanta_area_to/,"Hey guys! I'm a second-year CS major (devices-mod/sim threads) with an aerospace engineering minor, and I was wondering some good companies I could intern at this upcoming summer? I know there's military companies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, airline companies like Delta, and some startups like Hermeus.

itvd3e,2,2020-09-16,Can't find a job in design after 6 years of studying,SteveVA182,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/itvd3e/cant_find_a_job_in_design_after_6_years_of/," After 6 years of studying design, I haven't been able to land a job and it's kind of destroying me.

To give you a bit of background I started studying DTP (This is print work in the Netherlands), after that study I studied (Media Design). My studies were relatively very easy, I was never really struggling and I  often helped my classmates or they came to me for questions about  design.

My mentor often praised me with the work I've done, also recommended me to her friends because she needed a graphic designer to make a poster for her business. She told me that I could easily find a job because I had a lot of skills. I've had internships where I exceeded the expectations of my internship mentor. I even needed to teach them how to animate and I often had to guide other internees. My last internship offered me a job, but their  offer was bad (minimum wage + 0-hour contract.) If I still had the chance I would've grabbed it. My boss at that point told me that I was  the best intern he ever had (now he could've been lying but he didn't  offer anyone the same job.)

Applying to jobs doesn't work either, I send a letter telling them that I have a  lot of skills and about my internship situation. I've even learned how to make a website for my portfolio. I either hear nothing from companies  or they send out a standard message like ""we've seen your work but I  don't think that it matches for what we're looking for."" I can't call them because 1. they don't have a phone number 2. They never pick up 3.  Their number isn't available. Lots of job offers are just full-time internships like 80% of them.

I can animate a bit, make websites with WordPress, illustrate, edit videos.  Let's just say a jack of all trades, I learned this all just to land a  job because I see a lot of job offers who have such high demand like you need to have 3 years experience and you can make websites, animate,  edit video's write posts and all such.

I  have a feeling that I won't be able to find a job at all in this market and that I've given 6 years of my life for nothing. Or that I'm just a  bad graphic designer.

Do you guys have any experience with this? Do you maybe have some tips?"

I have always had a interest in IT related stuff so I did a 4 year degree in Software Development. While Initially I struggled, I have grown to become relatively competent in programming and those modules tend to be my strongest now.

 I did a internship as one of my modules last year and I was introduced to Automated Testing. I really enjoyed it initially, I learned a new language and skills that have given me a good insight into software testing. I was asked back by the company for the summer and I have started to feel a degree of monotony now when I work. I enjoy the company and I have a great manager, its just the work doesn't interest me now after the 7ish months I've been doing it. 

We also have a issue of certain task being cancelled due to Covid and as a result I have had a few days where I had no work to do. 

I'm also always working on smaller personel projects and i feel relatively confident in my javascript, php and java which the developers work with. I just dont want to be tied down to QA work. 

I'm not sure should I bring this up to my boss? I feel that I may not get the response I want. They have said that they would love to have me back when I'm done college. But I really want to do development. Should I just wait till I get my degree and apply to a different company to do development. What do you guys suggest? 

Thanks guys :)"
itwus5,0,2020-09-16,"Junior Devs - Have you ever asked for a raise and if so, how?",lethalsid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/itwus5/junior_devs_have_you_ever_asked_for_a_raise_and/,"Hey guys, I'm a web developer working at a small startup. I'm currently making about 49k salary and I'd like to ask for a raise for 60k. I'm currently still learning on the job and off hours as well to become a full stack C# / [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) developer hopefully so this typically means the more difficult tickets I encounter I usually ask questions or plan meetings to go over how to solve the ticket sometimes but I figure that's normal for junior devs. I started off as an intern working on wordpress sites and learning HTML,CSS and a bit of php. Then I got ""promoted"" to a full time position ( someone else quit so I got their responsibilities ) and since we are a consulting company, this meant I was a hybrid of sort. Doing web dev work as well as working with excel sheets and meeting with clients now on their CMS.

One thing to note is that this startup has been very slowly growing ( 10 years this year ) and every year we go through about 50-60% of the workforce quitting. There are roughly 5 people who have been in the company longer than 2 years.

fast forward about a year and now I've been with the company for about a year and a half. Everyone's working from home and we lost about 3 people so far including a mid level dev. My manager came up to me and basically told me it's time to step out of my junior role and take the full stack C# route to work on their SaaS solution since we lost this dev. I'm def. not the best programmer out there and I understand that but I also do a ton of different things as well as taking care of my tickets. Maintaining all of our wordpress sites as well as clients, handling incoming client requests like analytics, small tweaks to their site, Azure configurations, CMS jobs etc. 

The problem is that this small startup tends to be pretty cheap with everything including everyone else's pay. I feel like if i just wait till the end of the year performance review + raise, I'm just gonna get the bare minimum like 49k to 50k. I'm exposed to so many different things and I'm learning a ton. My manager gives me tickets that are challenging but also around my skill level which I feel is rare? Also my co workers are 100% understanding of my skill level and are super patient with me and go over how things work with me , pair programming and just helpful overall so I'd love to just keep working here but with more pay. I'll be extremely happy for another year with 60k

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - How do I ask for a raise when I know the company is cheap? Should I be applying to other jobs just in case even though I'm a junior dev? OR should I just stay here and continue learning how to be a proper full stack C# [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) dev as much as I can then when I feel comfy with my skill level just leave?"

I was scared because I didn’t know what it could be about but knowing him, I had a feeling it was just going to be a lecture because he was clearly in a bad mood. 
And I was right. As soon as I sat down at the kitchen table, he starts yelling at me about how I’m 19 years old and I need to stop acting like a 6 year old. Because my room isn’t super clean right now and I have some pencils and papers strewn about the area where I do my schoolwork. 
And then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, he just starts bringing up all these different things in my life and turning them against me. Saying how I need to stop following around my boyfriend, and stop making him a priority over my schoolwork. And how it was stupid of me to even ask my parents if they could meet him, even though we have been dating for close to a year and I’ve met his parents multiple times. And then yelling at me about how I can’t room with my current college roommate next year because my dad doesn’t like that she is unfortunately part of the current situation I’m in where we are stuck in our apartment lease on campus even though college has been online and I’ve been at home. Like I’m sorry that I signed the lease back in November because I didn’t predict corona virus. And then he went on to yell at me about how I need to get my life together and stop being on my phone all the time. He yells at me for not doing enough to prepare for when I graduate college but then he yelled at me for even CONSIDERING and looking into a different career path than the one I’m currently on. Like if I was considering it then doesn’t that mean that I’m doing my best to prepare myself for after I graduate??
I’m a college sophomore, with a pretty high GPA, and I did an internship this past summer. I am constantly trying to learn more about my career path and am finding new resources. I think that compared to my peers I’m pretty on top of things in terms of what I want to do in my future. I’ve been talking to one of my college deans since March about my plans for the rest of college, and I even had an appointment recently with the career exploration office, who also told me I’m at a good spot. But not even just relating to my academics, I’ve been actively trying to get more involved on campus and have been joining new clubs. My parents don’t prioritize that as much but it’s something I refuse to not be proud of because it took some planning and it also forced me out of my comfort zone doing things alone. 

I am just sick of my parents using everything that I tell them against me. They always tell me that they want me to tell them about what’s going on in my life but as soon as I muster up the courage to do so (like when I told them about my boyfriend), they end up using it against me in the future. I wish I wasn’t the forgiving person I am who tends to forgive and forget about these things because deep down I’m so desperate to have a normal healthy relationship with my parents. But every time I try and think it might be different, they prove me wrong. I hate how they always just jump to conclusions and act like I’m the laziest, most worthless piece of shit out there. I’ve been working hard and I was actually really proud of myself up until quarantine hit and since then my mental health had gone to shit. I’ve been crying for the past couple of nights because I just feel so alone and isolated from my friends and from a normal college experience, and this interaction with my parents today made things so much worse. I’m stuck at home with my parents for the next few months at LEAST, and it feels like there is no escape, besides the 1-2 times I can get out of the house each week."

Earlier this year, I realized that I would rather pursue a career in marketing.

I'm extremely passionate about all things creative, and am driven to put in the work necessary to obtain a marketing/PR/communications position that allows me to work my creative and strategic muscles.

Northwestern Mutual “Internship” Just Wants Your Friends/Family Contact Info,ramjaz,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/iu2aku/i_got_played_northwestern_mutual_internship_just/,"I got played man, I really did. When I was 18, I was going through career paths and “Financial Advisor” really stuck out to me. **Great pay if you work hard, amazing work-life balance, and you essentially choose your own hours.**

I was sold, and ever since then, I’ve done everything in my power to get a Bachelor’s in Finance and look forward to get my Series 6/63 Licenses.

I’m currently a junior at a private University in Chicago. I moronically quit my amazing job as an Associate Banker at Chase right before COVID-19 started appearing in news articles. I had intended to climb up the ladder in the banking industry once I graduated, but my mental health started to take a toll because I was forced to take care of my schizophrenic mother.

I couldn’t balance work, school, and home life, so I quit. Luckily I was still able to receive unemployment benefits but it came at a cost of looking for a job in an industry that has hiring freezes across any job or internship, **except Northwestern Mutual.**

It always seems as though they can’t get enough interns working at their **“once in a lifetime internshit.”** But I digress. You know what happens after that. You get sucked in, hooked, and reeled, with your friends and family looking at you like you just scammed them.

Thankfully I’m only the first week in and read up on why any Intern Financial Advisor role is **redundant towards gaining actual experience and that you are not even going to do the things you think you’ll be doing.** 

You’re basically compromising your friend’s and family’s information and giving it to a joint-partner to which you will split commission 50/50. **And the worst part? The ACTUAL financial advisor is gonna do most of the talking while you just sit there with a shit-eating grin.** Your best friend, aunt, or whatever feel as though they are compelled to see you succeed. After all, you probably told them how much of a **hotshot you were in all those meetings prior to getting the job.**

Trust me, the internship is not worth it. I wouldn’t even consider working with them for 10 weeks because “it’ll look good to have them on my resume.” If anything, **your experience at Northwestern Mutual on your resume would cause a future hiring manager to immediately dump your application.**

So please, don’t fuck yourself over, because I did and it’s a huge waste of time. I guess it’s time to go back to when I was 18 and start looking for better opportunities because I was sold a lie. 

If this takes off, I might even record myself questioning the “Leadership Team” and put them on blast to give the other interns an idea of what’s to come for them. Who knows. If anyone has any good exit ops suggestions, I’d greatly appreciate it.

EDIT 1: Wow this kinda took off haha, I guess I gotta fulfill my promise to you guys. I have a meeting in 20 mins and I have some questions prepared to ask them like “why are they a fiduciary but offer fee-based financial plans” and stuff like that.

EDIT 2: Just finished the meeting. I recorded a 45 minute conversation where I asked questions like “Are any of the financial advisors even a Registered Investment Advisor or are you guys just glorified Insurance Salesmen?” And “If we don’t want to use our friends and family can you supply us with a contact list?” And my favorite: “What is the majority of what the financial advisors sell to the clients anyway?” [I think you can guess the answer.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_life_insurance) 

Idk if I’d get in trouble for sharing the voice recording but if you’re still interested in hearing it let me know.

(Summer 2021 &amp; Beyond),KingJodeg,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/iu30cp/computer_science_junior_what_should_i_do_moving/,"**TLDR: I know what my life purpose is 100%, but my major doesn't go so well with it now as a junior. Any advice moving forward?**

I \[20m\] am a junior at college majoring in Computer Science, currently living on campus and mostly online.

For a little background, I grew up with **social anxiety and other mental health issues**, something that held me back a lot. I struggled a ton until college came and I grew a ton, and by that point, I obviously chose my major in computer science. I enjoy programming, I’ve made a few applications in my time, came in third at my schools hackathon, etc. However, I’ve started to contemplate dedicating my life to this.

Going back to my mental health, it took an absolute nose dive back in March of this year. I contemplated suicide and had a huge emotional breakdown. I decided to start meditating (212 days in now), taking care of myself, and from the start of quarantine, I completely turned things around to today. It’s amazing.

During that journey, I started a YouTube channel dedicated to giving people life advice to help bring goodness and kindness to the world (meditation videos, open-mindedness, mental health, etc.). I worked very hard and was disciplined over the course of the 6 months at home. The main reason I made this channel this topic is because it is something I care so much about. **It is truly my life purpose**

It was about 2 years ago that I realized that I wanted to dedicate my life to this idea:

# With Great Power, there must also come -- Great Responsibility.

To this day, that idea lives just as strong in me as it did then.. Hell, even stronger. **I** have the power to learn and grow as an individual so I can provide value to others, so I take it as **my** responsibility to do this. I'm going to take this to my grave.

**Junior Internships**

Oh boy, if you’re a CS major, you know how commonly emphasized it is to get an internship during the summer of junior year. And obviously, with this conflict, I don’t see much value in spending my entire summer wasting time when I could be working on my channel, building my brand, creating an app, etc.

There’s no doubt in my mind that I’m going to be successful with helping and inspiring people, there’s no questioning that. My concern is making sense of that with these not-so-far-off decisions to be made. Do I get an internship? How do I figure out what to do? ANY helpful guidance would be appreciated.

What's a minimum requirement of time / effort you'd feel comfortable to go into an internship not to feel like a burden to a potential employer? People are also saying ; you should pick the best programming language for the task you're doing but I have no idea how to even incorporate multiple ones at the same time. I wished learning C++ and cobol I'd  guess, but one my classes requires Java but Im kinda hesitant because of that, even though the concepts of OOP are similar. Kinda problematic when I dont see junior entry level positions and even if I do there's 10-15 languages listed, kinda dishartening. 

likethis one  .NET, C#, Java Script, MVC, HTML 5, CSS 3, + SQL :p"

I am not a US citizen and would like to apply to US universities. However, my financial background is not very strong. I can possibly fund 40% of the Cost of Attendance (assuming $60k for 2 years) on my own and rest I will have to take a loan.

I am not very inclined towards taking a loan. There are thoughts in my head like what if I just fail as a graduate student, then what will happen? How will I pay off the loan. 

Ideally, if I can get some scholarship or grant that would be great.

Now the options that I can possibly think of are:
 - Take up a job for 1-2 years, save money to fund my Masters. Though, I am not very sure how much will I will able to save up. (Probably $10k/year)

 - Apply to Masters/PhD programs for Fall 21 and hope to get scholarship/grant/GAship/TAship.

What will be advisable? I literally cannot sleep thinking about all this

If my fellow redditors can be kind enough to help me evaluate my profile for MS/PhD, I will be grateful to them

GRE: 325 (Q169, V156)
Undergraduate GPA: 3.78
2 Research Internships, 1 industrial internship.
1 Research paper at Top tier NLP conference (ACL)
1 LOR from the HOD, 1 LOR from industrial internship, 1 LOR from the prof who is also a co-author of the paper.

I am thinking of these universities: UIUC, UMD, GATech, UT Austin, Cornell

I am even torn between MS or PhD, had finances weren't an issue, I would like to do MS first and then possibly think of a PhD.

I know I am asking a lot of questions, and they are incoherent. But if possible please help me!"

I have a day job doing QA - not glamorous but it pays the bills and I'd rather graduate with QA experience than none - bar potentially winning the high stakes internship gamble of 1000s of applications. I don't enjoy QA, but I am competent enough to hold down a job in it.

I'm just not sure if I want to be a Dev anymore. I do open source work contributing to a reasonably popular python application (looks non trivial on the CV), but the job market looks horrific right now. I was struggling to find a dev job before this mess kicked in.

Also, well, I had no idea the scramble for internships would be this bad. I'm grinding LeetCode at the moment and really don't think I can face grinding like this for the medium / long term. What kind of life is this? I want to pursue hobbies, meet people (women), travel, watch movies. I want to live

I like coding and will always do open-source work as a hobby, but it's never enough for employers. Nothing I do ever seems to be enough for them  

I'm thinking about dropping my degree, doing a few certs, bouncing to a help desk somewhere and then making my way into IT. Maybe network engineering. It pays quite well.

Any advice moving forward?**

Hello friends, here's my situation.

I \[20m\] am a junior at college majoring in Computer Science, currently living on campus and mostly online.

For a little background, I grew up with **social anxiety and other mental health issues**, something that held me back a lot. I struggled a ton until college came and I grew a ton, and by that point, I obviously chose my major in computer science. I enjoy programming, I’ve made a few applications in my time, came in third at my schools hackathon, etc. However, I’ve started to contemplate dedicating my life to this.

Going back to my mental health, it took an absolute nose dive back in March of this year. I contemplated suicide and had a huge emotional breakdown. I decided to start meditating (212 days in now), taking care of myself, and from the start of quarantine, I completely turned things around to today. It’s amazing.

During that journey, I started a YouTube channel dedicated to giving people life advice to help bring goodness and kindness to the world (meditation videos, open-mindedness, mental health, etc.). I worked very hard and was disciplined over the course of the 6 months at home. The main reason I made this channel this topic is because it is something I care so much about. **It is truly my life purpose**

It was about 2 years ago that I realized that I wanted to dedicate my life to this idea:

# With Great Power, there must also come -- Great Responsibility.

To this day, that idea lives just as strong in me as it did then.. Hell, even stronger. **I** have the power to learn and grow as an individual so I can provide value to others, so I take it as **my** responsibility to do this. I'm going to take this to my grave.

Over this past summer I built some fairly advanced (for me at least) video monitoring software that is to be used onsite in the machines for us to use. This software was entirely built from scratch by myself and of my own teachings with no higher up to ask questions. It uses a lot of new technologies that I taught myself such as RTSP and TCP networking, NodeJS, Electron, Flask, jQuery etc. and I am immeasureably proud with how it came out; I think it looks great. Compared to my projects on my portfolio I think this is much more impressive by far, however I am wondering how much I can actually show or tell about it to an interviewer during an interview for an internship. Ideally I could keep a copy on a laptop and show it to them, or settle for screenshots or really anything. At the same time, I don't want to be thought of as sharing company IP which would not only be a bad look during an interview, but also may not even be allowed. However I am not sure if it is a good idea to go up to my ""boss"" and ask him ""mind if I show this to interviewers when I look for another job?"". Hopefully this isn't a dumb question, if this isn't the right place to post this I'll gladly remove it. Thanks."

Today I was called by a hiring manager and was told that I would not be getting a job and that I was the runner up for the position. He said he called me because when the next position opens up (which is likely to be 6 months from now), he will reach out to me. I really wish I got this job and it seems like a cool opportunity and a decent team to work with. 

So my Question is: 

Would it be a good idea to ask the hiring manager if I could come on as an intern for the next 6 months to transition into the full time role?  

I can take the financial hit of being paid less for 6 months, however my biggest worry is the loss of 6 months of experience compared to me peers. Especially when I am an (old) new grad with no full time experience.

Anyone have any thoughts?"

I'd like to see your guys' thoughts on this decision and general tips on career outlook for math majors, etc.

Option A: MA in Mathematics from the same state school I went to for undergrad. It would be a 1 year program and I could take a Machine Learning course. It would cost about $12000 all said and done; however, it's an arts degree from an okay state school so I'm worried the career outlook would be weak.

Option B: MS in Applied Mathematics from a top-30 public university. It would take 2 years and cost around $40000 at the end. Obviously it's far more expensive with the explicit and opportunity costs, but it's possible the brand name and the degree being MS and Applied could put me leagues ahead the other degree. Additionally, if I were to consider a PhD, this school would be a much easier transition.

Any thoughts or advice? Is a DS career reasonable for someone with my credentials, and would I be able to get an internship in grad school? What was your guys' education and how did that affect your career? Thanks for any and all advice you have."
iu8d8g,0,2020-09-16,Advice for choosing and Aerospace engineering program,FormItUp,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iu8d8g/advice_for_choosing_and_aerospace_engineering/,"Hello, I’ve posted similar threads in this sub and others and received some good advice from users, and it's getting close to when I need to make a decision on where to go to school so I’ve decided to post again and see if I can get some more good advice. I want to go to school for aerospace engineering, and if I were to work on the aeronautical side of things I would be completely satisfied, but I am more interested in the astronautical side of things. If I could pick any job in the world right now it would probably be at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the Roman Space Telescope or in Texas working on SpaceXs Raptor Engine. 

I have gotten into Alaska Fairbanks, Colorado State, Iowa State, and New Mexico State but have basically decided against these schools either because they don’t actually have an aerospace program, or they seem isolated from the rest of the Aerospace industry. I have also decided against Alabama Huntsville despite its strong aerospace because if I wanted to live in the south I would prefer to go to Florida Tech.

Florida Tech is probably my favorite school of the ones I have got into. It is a small tech school, which is what I really wanted, and is focused on Aerospace. I would love to live next to KSC and watch the Vulcan, Falcon Heavy, and Artemis launches but the big problem is I don’t want to live in Florida. Simply put, I like deserts and mountains and Florida is the exact opposite. If I thought I would just go to class and only leave campus to get groceries I would probably choose Florida Tech but I want to be able to head up into the mountains or desert on the weekend.

I have looked into NM Tech and I love how small the school is but I don't know if they would have as many resources as a bigger school. They have 2 rocket test stands, and are close to White Sands and Spaceport America, but they don't actually have an aerospace major, just a minor. I know you don’t need a major to get into the Aerospace industry, I’m just not sure if it would have as much opportunity as ASU or CalPoly Pomona.

I have also got into the Arizona campus of Embry-Riddle, and it's another small aerospace focused school that seems great, but Prescott seems far from the Aerospace industry, and it seems more focused on the aeronautics side. 

I applied to 4 CalState schools and have got into CalPoly Pomona, and I don’t think I would choose any of the other 3 if they do accept me (San Diego State, San Jose State, CSU Long Beach). At first CPP was my top choice of the schools I’ve listed so far but I’m not sure if I would choose them over Arizona State. They are in Southern California, which I think is the biggest Aerospace center except for maybe Florida, and are extremely close to CalTech, my favorite university, and JPL. But even though they are a tech school they don’t seem to have as much of an aerospace focus as ASU. They only have an MS program, while ASU has a PhD. I have no clue if I'll want a PhD but I thought it was a good measure of how serious the school takes the program.  

I originally didn’t think much of Arizona State besides that there is a generic huge state school but after some commenters on a previous thread told me to take a second look I did and visited the school. I was impressed with how many NASA planetary missions they are involved with and the heavy duty focus the school seems to have on Aerospace and space exploration. I particularly liked their “School of Earth and Space Exploration” and while the AE program is of course in the Engineering college, I am interested in research opportunities or a minor through the SESE. Their AE program also offers an emphasis in Astronautics. While CPP seems like a better STEM school overall and a little more prestigious, ASU seems to have a more developed Aerospace program. I also got into University of Arizona but it just does not seem as good as ASU. 

At this point I am thinking it’s a choice between CPP and ASU, and I’m slightly favoring ASU. Like I said, after going through the SESE at ASU, I get the sense that space exploration is a real focus point at ASU, whereas it’s just another thing at CPP. But Southern California seems like the place to be for Aerospace. I get the feeling ASU has more opportunity on campus whereas CPP has more in a days commute.

I would love to go to one of the small tech schools I mentioned, Embry-Riddle, NM Tech, or Florida Tech. But the most important thing for me is going somewhere where I can make good connections in the industry, and get some real work as a RA or intern on a project that will be used in the real world, and I feel like ASU or CPP are the best two places for that. What do you guys think? Do I have the wrong impression of things? Should I look again at a college that I disregarded? 

I am still waiting on a response from CU Boulder and they will be my top choice if I get in, but I’m not counting on it. Thank you for your time."

iu8vr4,7,2020-09-16,Tapia day 1 - Observations &amp; Tips,Moist_Van_Lipwig,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iu8vr4/tapia_day_1_observations_tips/,"Today was the first open day of the Tapia conference &amp; career fair. I was at my company's booth in the morning, and I have a few observations, and suggestions, for any of you who are attending Tapia tomorrow and on Friday.

*Disclaimer: My observations and tips are mine alone, and do not represent the views of my employer(s) present or past, my spouse, my kids, or my cat. These are based on a \~2 hour involvement at my company's ""booth"", and answering questions in the chat there (both in the free-for-all, and 1:1 chats).*

**Observations**

* OMG it's so slow. Maybe it was because everyone was joining in the morning, but the chat box took several **minutes** to load. Even in the company's chat space, if there were too many people in the booth, things slowed to a crawl
* The video call feature (in the 1:1 chat) is pretty laggy. I did it with 2 candidates today, and both times the quality was terrible. Probably because the fair blew past the traffic expectations by a wide margin.
* If I click on someone's name (in the general chat room) to start a 1:1 chat with them, there's no context of what their message in the main chat room was. So now I either have to rack my brain, or switch back to the main chat room to see what their message was. Which takes a while, and brings me to my next point.
* The chat box has no notion of maintaining position even if new messages come in. It auto-scrolls to the last message, with no regard for whether I was reading an earlier message. If there are a lot of messages coming in, it's *excruciatingly annoying* to have to keep scrolling back, to the point where I just stopped bothering. (Apologies to all the candidates I missed because this happened!)
* A lot of candidates just dumped a wall of text ""*Can I haz software engineering (internship|grad) job plz? My LinkedIn is \[...redacted...\]*"". These will **definitely** get ignored in the traffic we got. We get it. ""Why do you want this job?"" =&gt; ""For the monies, duh!"". But it's not giving you *any* attention, and is probably distracting us from the candidates who genuinely *want* to know specifics about the company. Generics are easily found online, if you ask us those, you're not prepared.

**Tips for candidates**

* **Please be patient!** vFairs UI is far behind something like Slack in usability. If you can, find a booth rep and 1:1 message them, instead of asking in the chat. But also know that the booth reps are probably talking to 10+ candidates at a time.
* The **""Booth reps online"" list can be wildly inaccurate.** I'm a booth rep, and I wasn't able to get myself into that list (even though I've logged in with an `moist.van.lipwig@fluffy.company` email address). We had to get creative, all our profile pics were the company logo. Maybe others did this, maybe they didn't. There are extra steps we need to do, not everyone has done those.
* **Do look** at the company information, where they give information about how to apply to the intern/grad roles. The ""posters"" at the ""booth"" are clickable, and give you information. There are links below the ""booth"" area, the last of which is ""Chat"". Different companies will have different things in here. Go through whatever is relevant. Some have engineering blogs, design blogs, and a grad specific recruiting page. Some have signups for later communication around open positions and application process.
* **Do send** meaningful messages. ""Do you have intern roles?"" isn't meaningful. ""I noticed you have a heavy B2B webapp, I have React and Typescript experience at previous intern projects"" will get you noticed.
* **Do ask** meaningful questions, but preferably 1:1. ""How did your company handle remote internships this year?"" is fine, as is ""Can you give some examples of intern projects from this summer?"". ""What stack will I be working on"" isn't really (we don't even know what teams will have interns allocated - it's 9+ months away!). In particular:
   * **do ask about company values and culture**, **and how it is followed** daily in the work environment, if that's an important consideration for you. If you're after $$$, all else be damned, that's fine. If you value certain things above $, you need to find out about it. Many companies culture stops at the sign behind reception (or painted on the walls). Others' is pervasive. Decide whether it matters to you.
   * **Do ask** what happens to intern projects once the internship is finished. Maybe it was deployed to production a week before you finished, and is seeing thousands of DAUs. Maybe it will be consigned to the bottom of a locked filing cabinet, with a sign on the door saying ""Beware of the leopard"". If it matters to you, ask about it.
* **Do offer specifics** about yourself. e.g. ""I have 2 ML internships with R &amp; Python experience, and I'd like to continue in ML. What would your ML internships look like?"", or even ""I'm doing a BS in Physics with a minor in CS. I've self-learnt &lt;things&gt;. Would I be a good candidate for your company? What are some things you've observed about people changing fields I should be aware of?""
* **Please don't** just dump a wall of very generic text in the main chat room. It doesn't get you any extra attention, it distracts us from people who actually *do* have questions. If you're asking questions easily answered in the above step, it is a waste of time for both of us. The vFair UI is a bit of a pain, don't make it more annoying for us than it already is. (Quite likely, the traffic blew past their expectation by an order of magnitude, so UX assumptions went out of the window)
* **Do ask** the booth rep if you can add them on LinkedIn, if you want to. Some are OK with it, others may not be (either personally, or as a company policy).

**Tips for booth staff:**

This is what worked well (all things considered) for us. YMMV. My opinion is that having a good experience for all candidates (whether or not they're at my booth) is a net benefit for everyone. This is probably common sense for the talent acquisition staff at the booth, but may be new info for non-recruiting folks.

* Make it easy for candidates to identify who the booth reps are.
   * We ended up using profile photos that were the company logo
   * We also regularly sent replies to candidates in the main chatroom, and also noted that 1:1 messages with us will be better than generic ones
* vFairs audio/video calls sucked big time today am. We ended up using Zoom for 1:1 conversations. If you plan to do this, make sure your booth reps have a Zoom (or your company's VC) room that they can stay in as they hand out the URLs to folks.
* If intern/grad positions at your company haven't been posted yet, **make it easy** for candidates to find out where they sign up to receive notifications about the positions. Ditto for any constraints on the interns (e.g. US Citizens only, Only 2021-2022 grads for internships, whatever).
* If candidates connect with you on LinkedIn, try to personalize any messages you send them. They're more likely to remember it as a positive interaction.
* If you know a candidate doesn't meet the cut (e.g. a freshman applying for internships) gently let them know that your company won't be the right one at this time. You're saving their time and your recruiting teams'.

Hopefully this information is useful, and makes the remaining 2 days of Tapia a bit smoother.

*Note: If you're planning to gild,* ***please*** *save your $$ and donate the amount to a charity of your choice instead. May I suggest any that are helping those displaced by the west coast wildfires, or any that helps bring education to the disadvantaged?*"

I'm graduating with my Bachelor's in ME this December and I'm planning on starting a Master's program next fall. I need to find an engineering job to fill the nine-month gap between graduation and starting my Master's. My school's career counselor recommended looking into some temp/staffing agencies, but I found that there were very few jobs posted on their websites. I'm feeling pretty discouraged because I found a position that seemed to match my schedule pretty well, but I was rejected after doing THREE interviews with them. I've applied to \~100 internships and gotten interviews at 7-8 companies, but always get rejected. I've had a co-op and an internship in the past, so I feel like I should be qualified for an engineering job, but things don't seem to be working out.

The options I'm considering are:

* Part time or temporary engineering position with a temp agency.
* Internship- the problem is that this will likely only be for the summer, leaving me with months with nothing to do.
* Full time job- basically not tell the company I'm planning to leave after nine months.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I would appreciate any advice about how to find a job to fill this 9-month gap. Thanks."

Stats: 27M, 3.8 GPA at public state school, 
           GMAT: N/A, Single/No Kids, 6.5"" Penis, dress
           like frat bro (Am not frat bro tho)

Buckle up.

Im from the midwest. First generation college student from a family of farmers. I am children of the corn. I joined the military at 17 in hopes to become a Navy SEAL. Went into BUDs with stress fractures, failed out. Got depressed. I am failure. Binge drink for 6 months. Shake it off like TSwift. Became a rescue swimmer instead. Served out my 4 years, taking Tuition Assisstance here and there for bullshit gen-eds and banging Tinder broads. Got out after my contract was up and went straight into undergrad at a public state school using Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. Still plowing poon with my average length destroyer, this time high on cocaine and weed.

Now, for those of you who are familiar with the Post 9/11 GI Bill, you know that baby is precious, you definitely don't want to waste it, and you definitely cup check Thai hookers before paying for services. I couldn't afford to go to school without it. Am/was poor. GI Bill pays you a tax free living allowance while in school, and it's not chump change; in most large cities it ranged from $2-3000 a month (still eligible for grants in nearly most cases). Only at a public institution does the GI Bill pay 100% of all tuition and fees, so that fueled my choice for public school originally. You get 36 months of it, non-consecutively, which means that omitting breaks and summers, it usually adds up to a 4 year undergrad plan. 

There's a trick to this; whether you take 3 credits or 21 credits, the GI Bill pays 100% of it, but deducts the exact same 3.5 months or so for the semester off of it. This means that if you max out your course loads you can graduate early and save your GI Bill for grad. I graduated in 2.5 years with my bachelors bringing in while bringing in approximately $65-70,000 per year through a combination of GI Bill income, grants, a handful of scholarship money, and hauling around drunks as an Uber driver ~15 hours weekly back when Uber could bring in $30 an hour or so. 

Somehow managed to get summa cum laude while clapping cheeks, recreationally doing drugs, climbing mountains, and getting choked out in martial arts. Had approx 1 year and 3 months left on GI Bill. Knew I wanted an MBA, because fuck being average.

Went to help out on the farm for a few months, then snagged a job at a Fortune 200 in management. This put me at around 90k per year, debt free. Job was great experience, but pure overload. Faced age discrimination and toxic culture. Handled a healthy portion of my business unit's HR, management of 10 direct employees, A/R, contract negotiations, and customer service. 65-70 hours per week. Like being on the 70th wave of COD zombies.....just overwhelming.

Screw that, I've been on the hard fuck shit and I have no desire to spend my youth slaving away and miserable even if I have money. Could switch jobs? Nah, I got over a year on my GI Bill left, I'm going back to grad school for an MBA. Subscribed to r/MBA and read all your pretty boy humble brag circlejerk post (Helpful advice honestly. We can circle jerk sometime together. Shit I may even jerk you off no homo). Anyway, problem is, I go into debt if I do a 2 year MBA, which would be on that dumbfuck shit when I could just graduate debt free. It must be 1 year accelerated program. That narrowed it down to about 25-30 schools that even offered that program, although more schools are coming out with accelerated MBA programs every year. ~30% of those schools were private (debt laden) schools so those were out the question. Narrowed down to 5 programs, all public schools with 1 year MBA programs. Most of those did not have a good dude to chick ratio, and that's gay. 

My alma mater offered a scholarship for alumni. Figured that just made sense. I was familiar with the school and quality. Applied to only that school with no backups because I'm a goddamn savage. Fuck the GMAT, applied to have it waived. They waived it. Couldn't afford to apply to well ranked school or hire admissions consultant. Interviewed well at alma mater. Got accepted with +10k scholarships and full ride on remaining GI Bill benefits. Received grants too. 

I'm stoked. Climbed half dome in Yosemite. Quit my job. Fucked hot sales lady in the next office over. Moved, started school last month. Program is intense, but manageable. Heavy focus on data analytics and management theory. The instructors care. Super talented and diverse cohort. Good weather. Internships abundant. Study abroad. Already talking to recruiters. Debt free, couldn't be happier with my decision. I have lived a great life so far with awesome experiences, travel, and new opportunities. May have an STD. My school is located where I have friends, tons of outdoor recreation, good nightlife, and I'm not too far from family. Weed is abundant.

Seriously, u/tooldrops is right. You guys got to stop tripping on this hardfuck mentality that if you don't make it into an M7 and make it into the 1% it means you've failed and your life is over. You'll be fine, especially if you're a trust fund baby and can pay for AC's at multiple target schools. The fact that you're trying to get your MBA; the fact that you're doing this with a family; the fact that you may be broke and you're still doing this; the fact that I'm not properly using semicolons. Just understand that you're already the cream of the crop. 

Just getting an undergrad degree where I'm from is a HUGE accomplishment. Take it easy on yourselves, loosen up and have fun. Skip that study session and get a beer with a friend. Go camping on the weekend or whatever you're into. Don't lose sight of what you're after and what all that baller money is going to buy you; a little bit of time, more leisure, prosperity for your family, maybe a FIRE plan, or fueling a cocaine snorting/hooker fucking/skydiving habit. Money doesn't buy happiness, it just fixes most things that make you unhappy. Lose your pride and the mentality that you have to get into an M7 or come back on your shield. 

You can't get so busy trying to make a living, that you forget to make a life. Figuratively make a life that is. Please don't relieve yourself inside of anything you wouldn't put a ring on. 






TL;DR: Not a trust fund baby. Am poor. Leveraged Gi Bill. Got through undergrad in 2.5yrs, had remaining benefits to pay for only 1 year MBA. Went to public school that is not T25. Life didn't end. Started last month. School tough. Instructors great. Cohort great. No debt. Single, no kids. Burns when I pee and may have bastard child in Dubai."
iuf365,0,2020-09-17,Should I stay for extra year to get CS+Stats degree?,bernardking50,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/iuf365/should_i_stay_for_extra_year_to_get_csstats_degree/,"Hey, so I’m a senior going for my BA+MA in political science (a 4 year accelerated program) with a minor in math. I’ve had two short data analyst internships (for a state gov agency and for a nonprofit). I’ve taught myself R, SQL, and Tableau, but I am also interested in moving into software engineering. I’ve tried to teach myself python and django over the summer so I can build a website that provides information on every state and local elections, but the project was bigger than I could handle.

Yet, I found learning how to code a lot more exciting than anything else I’ve done that summer. So, I am trying out intro to CS and discrete math this semester (going well so far). If I really do like this major, I am thinking of chasing the CS+Stats degree from my school. It will require me to take two summer classes, and then 8 more classes over two semesters (one academic year). 

The problem is that I am attending a private university at an expensive city. I was blessed and lucky enough to attend without student loans, but my financial aid runs out after my fourth year of college. So if I was to stay for a fifth year, I would need to take out $70,000 in student loan debt to cover the cost of attendance. Also, there is also the risk that I could fail my upper-level CS classes and get into debt without the degree to show for it. 


I have no real software engineering experience, no data science internships, and I haven’t worked for any recognizable company. So, I am a little hesitant to go for this degree because I think the debt would weight me down and I won’t make the salary to pay it off sooner than later. But then again, I’ve had no job offers from my political science degree and had gotten an avalanche of rejection letters.


I could also take the community college to masters in CS from a local state university route. However, I have to consider the time and opportunity cost of this route, as it can take me 3-3.5 years to complete. Also, the fact that my school has a better name recognition (as well the degree in stats) may help me land a better first job. 


So, I am asking for an advice. Should I drop my masters, take an extra year of college and the student debt for the CS+Stats degree? Or should I just graduate with a political science degree? I think I would be fairly happier with the former, just because of the job security, the problem solving aspect and the growth opportunities.


I really appreciate any feedback, and I apologize for my long rant!"

So here’s my current background/current situation/IT career goal:

I live in Northern VA. There are a ridiculous amount of opportunities in this area, but I find them to be elusive

I graduated from George Mason in May of 2019 with a double bachelors in Information Systems Operations Management and Business Management 

All throughout my collegiate career I worked as a personal trainer. I believe IT is the future for business and lucrative/secure jobs, which is why I earned the degree that I earned.

However, when I was in school, I had planned on trying my hand as an entrepreneur and falling back on IT as a backup plan upon graduation. I had been working on a business model that involved fitness, but unfortunately, COVID totally decimated my business model. 

So now I’m onto my backup plan. My ultimate end goal is to work as an IT Project Manager as there are soooo many opportunities for that in the DMV area. My issue is my lack of experience. I did not take advantage of resources available to me when I was in college because I was so busy working and so determined that I was going to graduate and start a multi million dollar business. Boy did reality slap me hard in the face lol. That doesn’t stop me from being driven. I am a hard worker and I do have a bit of work experience outside of the fitness industry:

I had two internships and a contract with a small AI-analytics firm. All the experience was marketing/business development work, but I did get exposed to a lot of terminology/concepts in the industry

I have worked for a Construction Government Contractor for 6 months. The first 3 months I was a Project Assistant Intern and I am now a Project Analyst 

I think that being a Project Analyst right now is one of the best titles that I can hold as it can help me get my foot in the door for both Business Analyst and Project Management opportunities. I do plan on staying with this company for at least a year before exploring other options. 

Having said that, in the mean time I think it would be in my best interest to start earning some more Analytics/Project Management based certifications. My employer is going to help me with the PMI CAPM cert in the coming weeks, but I want to also start working towards an analytics certification. 

TLDR: What certifications should I pursue, what additional actions should I take, and what types of job titles should I seek out if I want to get my foot in the door as an IT Project Manager in the next 3 years or so with very little experience and an Information Systems Operations Management Bacehlors? 

Thanks in advance :)"

This year has been a mess for me, so I haven’t done any major projects beyond in-class. I was very successful in my Data Structures class, so I think I could do well in the interview stage of applications. I also attend at top 10 US university, although our CS ranking is only top 30, and my GPA is almost 4.0

I'm transferring next fall to a more STEM focused state university but even then, I have no objective way of telling that the program at my current university is actually bad. It doesn't offer as many opportunities for internships since it isn't really STEM focused and is an LAC but I hear a lot of people saying ""my state university has an excellent program for this subject"" and ""That university doesn't have the best program."" I could argue that the compsci program at my non-stem LAC is good because it's very hands on and the small class sizes, allowing for a lot of deep understanding due to having more insightful 1 on 1 conversations with your professors. However, that is subjective. How do you actually tell?"

I fucking survived what was literally the worst, most hellish part of my life. I FUCKING FINISHED MY MASTER'S! My thesis has been presented, I passed all the classes and I'm finally free from that goddamn shithole that I should've never put myself into...  


As for the job market? I started searching for a job 2 months after my thesis's presentation. I went through various tests and assessments and, as I saw many other people around me with better soft/technical skills, I thought to myself ""Well, you're done for, my man..."". BUT NO, I actually got the job and I'm currently in an intership at the company I applied for!  


At first I was extremely anxious because literally EVERYONE on my college told me that ""the job market is way more intense"", that ""if you can't handle it here, you won't last a week at your job"", AND, my personal favorite: ""in the job market no one's going to teach you anything"". This undoubtely filled me with anxiety, and I suffered a lot beforehand. But guess what:  
\- **THEY ACTUALLY FUCKING TEACH YOU STUFF, YOU JUST NEED TO ASK AND THEY'LL DELIBERATELY PROVIDE HELP**  
\- **PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG WILL (AND LOVE TO) TEACH OTHER PEOPLE**

  
Also, in the group of interns, we're **ALWAYS** hanging out and helping each other when need be!

Help?",vontaiga,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/iuu0le/24f_in_love_with_ethology_and_ecology_but_also/,"Hi there! I would love some guidance in helping me narrow down my two choices here because this has been eating at me for ages now. I'm finally well enough to be able to attend college, and I'm stuck at a pretty serious crossroads and would love an outside opinion!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it needs to be specified that I have several physical disabilities, and a few mental ones, namely dyslexia and dyscalculia (along with some mental illnesses I won't disclose.)  It's a DREAM of mine to work abroad at an animal sanctuary. I've been obsessed with the work of Jane Goodall my whole life, and have read nearly every book she's ever written. That being said, as much as I would love to become a field scientist, my body isn't as strong as most able bodied people. I got Lyme disease in 2018, and that left me with some nasty ramifications even after the rather lengthy stint of antibiotics. That, coupled with my asthma, fibromyalgia, and chronic migraines have made me wonder if I'm even CAPABLE of living out this dream.  I don't know when to give up, which is both a blessing and a curse (a blurse, if you will!) I've never been one to back down from a challenge, and still took a backpacking tour of Europe a month after my Lyme diagnosis— that is to say, I'm not afraid of being in pain! If I want something, I go after it, regardless of the consequences, but I do want to weigh my options very carefully.

I've been an artist my whole life, and even though I never went to high school, I got into several scholarship art programs for free simply by word of mouth as a teen. I've never failed to be able to sell myself as an artist, and I'm quite confident in my ability to excel in it if I'm given the opportunity. I love art, always have, but I've been afraid that I'd waste the opportunity of going to college if I studied it. However, it's definitely the safer route.  I know how to speak to artists, I know how to sell myself, and I already have a solid background in art.  Ecology and Ethology however, as much as I love it, has not been a constant in my life in nearly the same way. I've volunteered at countless humane shelters, but since I've never gone to a traditional high school, let alone college, I never got to experience any kind of ""lab"" work.  Math TERRIFIES me. I'm very good at it if I'm being actively tutored, but the moment I don't have near daily assistance with it formulas just eject themselves from my brain like a pilot nearing a crash landing. Hell, I don't even remember my own address because it doesn't end in a 0 or a 5 (the 2 numbers my brain actually likes.)  When I got my GED, I was so nervous about the math test because I had to reschedule because I threw up. Everywhere. Needless to say I'm not going to that college, don't need that reputation to follow me around!

I digress, for the program I'm looking into I'd need to start from the bottom of the math courses and work my way up to even attend the course I'm interested in. So, I couldn't even begin the initial studies right away, that is at least what I'm gathering from the information I've been given.On top of that, I know for a fact that these careers are highly saturated. My father has a degree in Zoology, but because he was unable to do summer internships he never got to do anything with it. A big worry of mine is my ability to ""shine"" in this field, as opposed to art. I'm not naturally gifted with math due to my disability, and I'm unsure if I'd be able to make a positive impression of myself academically. With art however, I'm rather certain I'd be able to get scholarships because I've already been offered them to what was my dream school, but I declined due to it still being far out of my budget.

TL;DR  I overthink everything.  I love art, I love animals. I really want to travel, but I have multiple disabilities. Math isn't my strong suit, although I'm decent at statistics especially with tutoring. I'm a talented artist, but I'm worried about not being able to live out my ""dream"" of seeing the world and helping animals if I take it on as a major.  Any help much loved and appreciated!"

I came to the U.S., believing their advertisement of ""Do well in school, get a job, live in the U.S"" created by their Department of Education.

What I didn't realize was how stupid some Americans can be in deciding who their leader should be.

Right after I graduated in 2019, I had an Cybersecurity Internship during the summer that was going to upstart my career in Computer Science. I had to apply for an OPT (U.S Non-Visa Work Permit), which I was accepted, but because the U.S. Immigration system is completely fucked in the ass by being defunded by Daddy Trump, the PHYSICAL CARD was delayed until the summer was over. I couldn't work without my PHYSICAL CARD OPT Visa at hand that the USCIS department sends out.

I was able to find work at this decent Car Dealership Website maker the following October. It was going well, I was learning a lot. Since I was a STEM major, I could extend my OPT to two more years, but unfortunately, the company I worked for wasn't ""e-verified"" with the government, meaning I had to find a different job. I stayed at the company until my end in March 2020. The company had let a few people go ""Due to the Pandemic"", which I believe was quite bullshit. (They fired me by not notifying me, I had to call my boss because I was finishing up work for the business department and I couldn't push up my code to the server.)

That left me two months to find a company that was willing to ""sponsor"" me (they didn't have to if they were e-verified). Two months to find a job in the pandemic-high season in the U.S. My OPT ended in July, but since once again, the U.S. Immigration system is outdated, I needed to notify the department 2-3 months prior to ""extending"" my OPT. But I needed to have a job before I could have notified them.

That left me 2 months filled with ""Oh, you are great for our company"" following ""Oh... you're not American?. I am sorry"". 

And now I am here, technically on my ""Tourist Visa"", waiting to see if I should get my masters or fuck off the U.S depending on whether Americans are smart enough to vote for a competent leader that doesn't defund U.S. Departments because he is ""tough"" on immigration.

The cherry on top is, the very last week my OPT ended, I was offered a position by a company which could have actually sponsored me. The other issue is, Daddy Trump suspended all H1-Bs, and it was ""too late"" to extend my OPT. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR USA ride has been a shitty."

Ive done a ton of research and tbh, most of them are way out of my league or just dont sound interesting. However, because i already have such an interest in the markets, stocks, and economics in general, I've been considering trading as a career choice.

People are saying the field is dying because its becoming increasingly automated. This isnt technically a bad thing for me because Im a computer science major. So i thought maybe I can become an algotrader or quant trader. Im aware both of these jobs are very hard to get into. But i dont know if i should focus on my coding or try to learn technical skills such as ExceL, VBA, financial modeling. Ive met a lot of people who work at the trading sector of JPM and these are all skills they recommend. They do also talk about learning a language like python."

To start off I am and Indian living in Italy . I studied software engineering as my bachelor's in India and moved here to study product design for my master's as I realized it was something I was truly passionate about.I won't get into details but ,the last 6 years have been the worst years of my life but I pulled though (I have interesting stories about this ,if you want to know ,I'll be happy to talk in some other thread probably).So I graduated by the end of January here. And I started applying as a fresh graduate.I had very less experience and obviously things didn't go well. I had to stop for some health issues but then the pandemic hit. During this time I improved on my skills both for interviews and took upon smaller work from home internships and freelance projects for experience . I saw major improvement and was very excited and confident in my work.But a lot of other unfortunate events occured during this time.I don't know how but I managed.I was broke and on the streets because my landlord screwed me over .Regardless during the pandemic out of dumb luck I found someone and  he employed me to work on his farm in some distant small town .I worked in the morning and did my other projects in the evening. Finally I had a good enough portfolio and started apply again from the end of June. I somehow managed enough money to apply for an extension to my visa. From june up until now I had 9 interviews out if which I went to the second round for 8 of them and last round for 5. The problem is they usually reject me for 3 reasons apart from my skill level even though I was qualified

I have been applying in Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden mainly.

1. I don't know the language of the country (which I understand and my Italian is not bad).
2. I am not a European citizen 
3. They are broke because of the pandemic (Again I understand as even though I exceeded expectations in my internship,they couldn't give the position for the financial situation of the company due to COVID).

I understand these being legitimate reasons but sometimes it gets frustrating because I am not being judged on the basis of my skills .I didn't take a day off during the pandemic and worked on myself everyday on myself for at least 18 hours a day to the point it started affecting my mental health and I had to go to a counselor.

I am very disheartened after almost 400± applications and since I want to work in the EU , I have limited time to find a job before my visa expires. 

Anyway I know a lot of people are going through the same and I hope everyone gets their share of success.I am feeling utterly hopeless and disheartened."

I wanted to get some more experience during that gap year through volunteering internships, or maybe jobs because pretty much everywhere I've been advised, people in that field emphasized the importance of experience. I also did some during my undergrad, but 1. I'm worried that it may not be enough. 2. It is a competitive field, so it wouldn't hurt to get more.

Their reasoning is if I just get my degree quicker, it'll be easier to find better jobs (they also offered to pay). I've been saving to move out so I don't have to deal with this further down (and I did want to move out around the time I graduated but with Covid that got pushed back a little), but I'm now wondering if it's a better idea to just suck it up and go to grad school while working part time and getting experience (through volunteering, interning, working), or take the gap year to just work and get more experience and apply to grad school later.

Hope all are doing well. I'm currently a graduate student in Financial Mathematics and a big part of quant interviews are coding challenges in Python. Luckily enough I was able to do good enough on my interviews to secure an internship but if it was for a full-time job I would totally fail. 

I want to train myself to become better at solving these challenges but I only have taken an introduction to C++ class and taught myself Python. Luckily for me, I'll be taking computing classes this year but it will be more data analysis and machine learning than a data structure and algorithm class.

I’m looking some advice on how to properly handle class work this semester. I feel like this semester I have just been worn down since the semester began. I have been doing an online virtual internship, which I’m really happy to participate in (as in its my first professional experience in an industry I want to one day be apart of) but I feel like with how school is going so far I’m wondering how I can better manage my time. I feel like I don’t have nearly the time I used to put towards work, and I feel like professors are ramping up the amount of work and quizzes they are giving out. I have only two courses I’m worried about Spanish 231 and MTH 115. I’m also taking Econ 330 and ES 250. I’m wondering from people who might have been in a similar position to me as to how best prepare for the work load of MTH 115 and Spanish 231. Any advice would be appreciated."

To provide some context, I have been with my current company for a little under 2.5 years in a technical sales capacity. I am 28 years old and this is my second job in my career since graduating college. The first company I worked for was actually a direct competitor and I worked full time for them for about a year and half, but if you count internship experience over 2 years for them as well. Just like everyone else COVID-19 has presented challenges in my job and in my personal life as well. My sales territory is in a more rural market and it is a two man office shared by my counterpart. I don’t have the best relationship with my manager as he sits in our larger corporate sales office in a big market and manages me remotely. Even pre-COVID I would only see him in person a few times a year and we only talk once every couple of weeks. 

Now on to my dilemma, I was actually looked at for an internal promotion a couple of months ago and HR (kind of speculation, but pretty positive it’s true) got involved and put the breaks on it. I think they believe I need to be in my current role for at a minimum of 3 years. Coincidentally I was approached by a LinkedIn recruiter about a month ago and it seemed harmless at first with an introductory phone call, then one thing led to another and they offered me a job this week. I’m being offered approximately a 40% bump in pay and it will allow my wife and I to move to a larger market in state, which is a huge pro for me as well being that I grew up in a city and have realized that being in a smaller area is not something I really enjoy that much. I don’t love where I live at all even prior to COVID, can’t emphasize this enough. The firm is also much smaller, I currently work for a very large multi-national corporation. The firm is also in a different industry than which I currently work in.

So here I am and I feel bad about leaving even though I do want the job... From an optics standpoint will I be looked at as a job hopper? Have I been at my company long enough? I am also fearful that my boss will think I’m being vindictive about getting passed over for the promotion. Also, does it look worse leaving during a pandemic like this? After all, I should feel lucky just to have a job period right now. Not to mention over the last 4-5 months, several people in our sales district have left the company. I feel as though I will be compounding that issue even further. Lastly, while I don’t have the best relationship with my boss, I respect my co-worker a ton. He’s been a friend and a mentor to me and I feel like I will be leaving him in the lurch to pick up my slack... Lastly, were I to quit how do I do so remotely? Just seems awkward.

Anyone have any thoughts on all this? Just really not sure what to do here."

iv0hqg,14,2020-09-18,Advice for fresh grads and job-seekers with little to no experience (internships counted)?,RobinBat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iv0hqg/advice_for_fresh_grads_and_jobseekers_with_little/,"So some background info and my apologies for the length:

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

I, like so many people at this time, am looking for SE roles.

I finished my B.S. in Computer Science back in Fall 2018, but I took some extra time to finish my Biology degree as well (I have an interest in Bioinformatics (and related topics) and my original interest was in fact towards medical school) and just finished this past May.

During my first degree, I fell severely sick, so my performance was subpar (it honestly took all my energy just to get through the degree), which left little to no time for internships and so on.

I got better shortly before I finished my CS degree, however.

Now while I was finishing my Bio degree, I didn't neglect my programming side. I did side projects, did a certificate or two, participated in clubs (CS/SE clubs like ACM) and finished projects there, and I had an internship with a startup in the interim.

Right now, I'm also in the middle of a training course with a company (I knew a guy at the coding club and he introduced me). Suffice it to say that I learned a lot more in the last 4 months than I have in the last 2 years.

Sounds good, or at least decent, on paper, right? The problem is twofold.

P.S.: My education and job search is in the US. International experience and advice is still welcome, just letting you know the background.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns and Questions**

**1.** That internship was not paid and it was with a startup (I don't know if either are looked down on), though I did do significant coding work that my boss could provide proof and support for. So other than that, no internship or work experience.

**2.** I (currently) suck at interview coding. Now I do know that no one expects anyone to get it right off the bat and it takes practice with the problems (Leetcode and such) to get better. While I'm doing that currently, I'd appreciate any quick strategies that could best optimize my Leetcode usage.

So, I just wanted to know if either fact will hurt me on the job search, what are my relative chances (or is that such a wide range of possibilities that it's hard to answer), and is there anything I can do to improve the stuff on my resume ^((if anyone needs specifics, I can PM the resume while deleting all personal information)\&gt;)?

&amp;#x200B;

I should add that I'm not desperate here, I can afford to wait and practice (though how much leeway I'll be given, especially with COVID), and I've substantial support and contacts.

I just can't stop worrying, however, and I'd like to know if my fears of my chances are valid or if they're an overblown case of nerves.

Any constructive advice for me, and anyone like me, is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

I have been following this thread for a while now to get some overview on my career planning. It's great to see how everyone is helping each other. 

So i am pursuing my Master of Information Technology (specialising in internetworking and cyber security) in Australia. I have been applying for IT related jobs and internships but being an entry level international student, not much luck yet.

Recently, one of my professors has offered an internship position at the cyber security institute of my university. It's a great opportunity to get some hands-on learning on cyber security related technologies. Also, it might be a great opportunity to acquire some great contacts who can recommend me in the future. However, it is based on research and I will not be getting much of the industrial experience and exposure. It will go on for 6months so it will be hard for me to apply for something else at the time. 

Therefore, I am a bit hesitant to pursue it because i do no want to get stuck in the research trail and really want to get into the workforce. But I do not want to let go of this opportunity to learn so much and get noticed by my professors and get their recommendations for my future jobs.

Any suggestions that you may have will be great!

Thanks"

I’m a 21 year old junior in college right now and I just feel so lost and hopeless. life just seems like it’s going to be this way until it ends. I have no goals or ambitions, or any real idea of what I want to do with my life. There’s nothing that gets me excited or even moderately interested at this point. Every day I follow the same routine: I rush through all of my class work (were online the past 2 semesters but I still live on campus) just to spend time doing things I don’t even enjoy. Video games, movies, watching sports can’t hold my attention and I catch my mind wandering when I’m doing these things. It feels like I spend the entire day killing time just so it’s night and I can go to bed.

I thought exercise might improve my mental state but it hasn’t really. I’ve been working out 4-5 days a week for the past 2.5 years (using NSuns, that program is great btw) and while I’ve gotten into great shape I still feel horrible about my life. At this point I only still go because for whatever reason I feel extremely guilty being miserable and lazy instead of just miserable.

Over my 3 years here I haven’t made any real friends. I text rarely with high school friends but other than that I don’t really have any contact with other people. I don’t think I’ve even talked to a girl outside a class my entire time spent here. I went to a few parties my sophomore year but really didn’t enjoy those. Everyone around me seemed excited and having a good time and I just remember feeling empty inside, like I was missing something.

Over the last 6 months I’ve also started sleeping less and less. My mind races at night and I can’t get past thoughts about how much of a loser I am, how I’m probably going to die alone, and the fact that I’m wasting such a blessed situation (I’m on an in state scholarship so my parents pay for food and a nice apartment). If it wasn’t for this guilt I probably would have dropped out already because I have no real interest in any major offered here. Usually there’s at minimum one day per week I don’t sleep at all.

I guess what I’m wondering is how do I get out of this rut that I’ve been in for so long? How do I get excited about something and truly feel alive? It feels like I’m literally just killing time until I die at his point. There’s nothing that I wake up for and I’m like “man I’m excited for this today”. Most days it feels pointless to even get out of my bed and I just lie there for awhile.

I’m also wondering how did you figure out what you wanted to do in life/for work? When I envision my future, the only thing I know I want is a family. I had a typical office job internship this summer and I remember feeling sick to my stomach realizing this could be the next 30 years of my life. It’s just hard for me to know what I want to do with my future when there’s no goal or interest I can think of.

Thanks for reading I hope this didn’t come across as some privileged kid ranting that life isn’t fair. I just thought if I wrote about everything in my life maybe I could figure out how to fix it because right now I’m not very happy."

Now i would very much like an internship there, as they have some very cool projects coming up. The problem is, they haven't had proper developer positions before, and they don't seem to quite know what they need.   


Boiled down, the problem they had were many small projects, with a lot of overlap, which didn't communicate well. Overlapping documentation, and difficult to sort information.   
To me this sounded very much like devOps kind of work, and i want to learn as much as possible to increase my chances of getting a foot in the door. I've already done work on network fundamentals, and i think learning a tool like ansible while pursuing a juniper devOps cert might be a good start?   


I wish i could give more concrete information, but it's all a bit vague at the moment and i would be very grateful if anyone would share some insight. I understand it might a bit big for an entry position, but i am prepared for a very steep learning curve. 

Some other notes;  
MPLS network  
Running the network in public institutions(libraries, schools etc)  
Offer many services through their cloud, (office, eduroam ..)  
Primarily use Juniper equipment"

I am currently in talks with two companies about a part time position(3rd year CS).

Both are in ecommerce, the small start up sells their own products and want me to maintain the website and restructure the code, write new websites etc...

Whilst the small company is more of a generalist role helping the other developers (SaaS). They don't have the exact  details yet and it's not an official position but they offered me this position after sending them an email for a future job opening.

I was leaning towards the small company because it is more well known and would appear better in my resume. However i fear that the work will be boring. 

The start up states it as an internship however the small company states it as a part time job, however with my responsibilities both seem like a full time job.

During my undergrad I was exposed to Java, Python, C, SQL etc and I'm fairly comfortable in those. But now I see most job applications require some level of web dev so I'm currently doing a Udemy web dev course by Angela. I had knowledge of HTML and CSS before and picking up JS also seems fine as its just the new syntaxes. I'm looking forward to learning MongoDB, Node.js and React.

I have limited iOS dev skills (Swift/UIkit) and was looking forward to going all in after I graduated but now I see iOS is a complete niche with significantly less jobs than web dev. So I'm keeping my iOS dream aside for now.

Also I realized getting a backend role is harder than getting a front end role. Do you guys agree or am I wrong?

I have applied to about 60 odd swe jobs as of now, got till the final round of one and got rejected. 90% of the time I'm ghosted. I'm actually losing my mind.

I graduated uni two years ago (with an arts degree) and left the UK to become a teacher abroad with a mind to take a PGCE later down the road and become a teacher in the UK. Coronavirus womboed taht plan and I ended up, like many people my age, back home with my parents. My mum encouraged me to start programming; she is a senior dev with a PhD in computer intelligence and like 30 + years of experience and said that there are usually jobs available to people who know react. Because I didn't have anything better to do and a job as a web dev would pay better than any of my other prospects, I agreed. I started doing (free) online courses in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and then started using React, React-native, Redux and some other libraries.   


The thing is... I'm finding it extremely difficult. I started in March and once I had completed the online courses and done a few projects which I put on to Github, my mum got me an internship at her company (which I am very lucky to have, I know it is an option that is not available to many people, especially with my educational background and experience range). I've been working as an intern at her company which basically only recruits senior developers, they've been giving me mainly minor bug fixes and UX/UI tweaks.  


 I feel like I am gradually making progress, but the online courses didn't really prepare me for the reality of programming for companies (so much file navigation and tracking down random pieces of state). The app's state is extremely complex and also uses typescript and a bunch of other dependencies which I am unfamiliar with. Basically, I still need my mum's help with most things (although the complexity of the tasks I ask for help with is increasing).  


My mum is a great developer but not the most patient teacher. She doesn't really offer any encouragement and if I don't grasp a concept straight away it frustrates her. A lot of the time she makes me feel a bit stupid and it's beginning to eat away at away my resolve. It's a pretty steep learning curve.  


The question I have is, how long did it take most of you to start to feel like you ""get"" it? Were you blundering away in the dark for ages before it clicked, or do most of you feel like you always had an intuitive knack for it? I'm also worried that employers won't take a self taught dev seriously so I was wondering how much knowledge / skill is expected in your first job as a junior developer?"

iv5qci,2,2020-09-18,How do you gain confidence?,throwaqauay,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iv5qci/how_do_you_gain_confidence/,"Ive been unemployed for a year after graduating. I could not do any internships. My year of unemployment was mostly a gap year, so its not like I was looking 24/7, but I also didnt do anything related to my degree (computing), as burn out from the degree was the reason I took a gap year in the first place. 

But now, I cant apply to anything else except for jobs in my field of degree. But after a gap year, and not even being passionate about my degree, how do I gain confidence if I get interviews? 
I recently applied for something 10 mins ago, but have already regretted it. I do not have the confidence at all. If I get an interview, then that will surely permeate through and if they ask me questions, all they will get back is a bunch of ""uhhm, i dont knows"" which is so embarrassing.  

Please, can someone tell me how to gain confidence in yourself?"

I'm currently an undergrad with a course of Information Systems major in Business analytics and will hopefully graduate this quarter 🤞

I have knowledge in Python, SQL, SAS EG, Javascript, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Power BI

With Power BI, we had some exercises using it during one of our classes so it's pretty basic.

I had my previous internship as a Software Engineer (If that matters)

So my questions are:

* Are there companies right now that hires undergrads?
* For the meantime, should I apply as an intern or full-time already?
* If there are, could you suggest them to me?
* What are the skills that I should learn more or focus on?
* What are your tips for me?

Thank you for your knowledge!"

I do have a brief idea but i don't know how to compare this possition with my experience so far.

However, it means that I will be moving away from home and living by myself.

I can't pinpoint exactly why, but my depression and anxiety is at an all time low at the moment.  I think my issue is I've never had a job which I've excelled at, I worked abroad for a year and in both internships I basically  got sacked after the 6 month contracts expired because I kept making poor mistakes such as attention to detail.  This is giving me fear that I won't do well or will get sacked from the job because of these reasons.  Also whilst I believe that I could do okay at sales, I have some days where I'm in a really chatty mood, whereas others where I want to be left alone.  I'm worried this might make me not cut out for the job role.

I'm also worried about living alone and  being disorganised. I'm currently medicated but it gives me bad side effects such as anxiety and depression, which I'm worried will impact my sales ability, and the side effects can even exceed my ability to concentrate.  I've tried every medication and they all give me side effects.  I was also planning to see a counsellor to help improve my mental health, but because of this job I won't  be able to now, and will have to be thrown straight into work.

So should I accept the fantastic job opportunity, and chance it and see if my mental health improves when I actually have a routine instilled into me. Or shall I stay at home with my parents and accept a mediocre job, where I will be able to afford counselling because I won't have to pay as much for rent, then I can get a better job when my mental health improves. However, at the same time I feel like my mental health will suffer if I accept a mediocre job, because there are very few job opportunity where I live at the time.

iv9w4t,1,2020-09-18,Job Search Expectations,Hoboster12,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/iv9w4t/job_search_expectations/,"Hey everyone!

I graduated from college this past spring and have been going through the process of job hunting. I was hoping I could get some insight from people about what jobs I should be realistically able to get with my experience levels so far and what my expectations should ne.

My experiences so far are my four years of college, two years of a tech store sales job while I was in college my Sophomore and Junior years, and a year long IT internship starting from May of 2019 to May of 2020. The internship itself was only supposed to last the Summer of 2019 but, I was asked to continue working for them until I graduated. Then, Covid hit and they had to downsize parts of their IT team so there wasn't any chance of a job afterwards.

I figure that with all this together I have probably 2, maybe three years of experience in IT? I know I definitely have one year but I've been told that a degree may be equivalent to another year or two depending on the company.

Currently, I don't have any certs. But, I have my A+ 1001 exam coming up within a week. I'm getting the A+ cert cause I didn't know where else to be going with myself rn and it seemed like a good cert to start with.

The jobs I've been applying for have been for Jr level system admin jobs and IT support specialist roles (or helpdesk or whatever hundred other different names companies come up with for the same role). My internship was very much in this area of IT so, I figured that would be a good place to start applying. I'd rather not be put into a helpdesk role from the start of my full time career but, I also understand that is where a lot of people get their feet in the door in IT and I should probably just suck it up and take one.

Am I going in the right direction for job applications right now? Is a junior system admin role (or similar level roles) in scope of my experience level? Or should I be looking for more traditional entry level IT work? I'm open to sharing my resume if people wanted to look at that and review it. Feedback from others is always appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone I truly do appreciate it,

\-Hoboster12

EDIT: I was asked to be more specific as to what my internship role was so I'll put it here. 

During the summer my main responsibility was to reduce the vulnerabilities the company's servers had. This was usually done by creating updated software packages and distributing them through SCCM device collections also made by me. The packages themselves ran on .bat files and PowerShell scripts. I would also be helping the team figure out why troublesome servers refused to update themselves during the monthly and quarterly patching periods. I used the Cherwell ticketing system and Nessus to keep track of the list of vulns still out there. By the end of the summer I had reduced the vulnerabilities by about 20-25% if I remember correctly. 

After the summer ended and they kept me on board they expanded my responsibilities like having me assist them migrate their server monitoring system over to SolarWinds via PowerShell. I also was responsible for assisting in the data center for server hardware upgrades, racking new servers, unracking and decommissioning old machines, managing the cabling, and updating the active server inventory DB they had. They also had me help with simple ticket requests like expanding disk space on certain VMs via Hyper-V or VMware or creating new VMs with their PXE scripts. "

I'm currently a junior at a prestigious university and I'm considering switching my career path to something in the tech field. I originally wanted to be a music teacher and have been pursuing a Music Education degree as well as working different teaching jobs to gather experience in that field. Recently I have not felt the same passion for the field of music education as I once did, and have been taking some Computer Science courses on the side. 

Because I'm already in my junior year, it would be extremely difficult to entirely switch tracks to be a CS Major. With that in mind, I'm considering graduating with the Music Education major and CS minor however I'm not sure if that would give me any chance in the job market. I'm going to start looking into what internships I could apply for, however I wanted to ask this reddit for any and all advice in regard to what I should do to enter the tech industry. 

Can I use my minor and sell the soft skills I've gained from Music Ed? Should I try to get an entry level position and work up? Should I go straight for a masters first?

Thanks!"

I was incredibly immature and confused when i spent my first 4 years in college. All I cared about was partying and being ""cool"" and ended up developing a drug addiction, in which I had to postpone my BSEE for 4 full years to overcome. So I basically stopped in spring 2015 and returned fall 2019. I treated college like high school, in that you go to class, pass the tests, and move on. 

I never even thought about the fact that classes are just the basics of college until I came back to finish, but I was just worried I was going to fail the classes and lose my financial support, so only in my last semester have I just started to look for extracurriculars. I am doing a sort of IT assistant position for my school now, and am also trying to find research projects, but have had no responses back.

I have a 3.49 GPA, but have had zero callbacks for any internship position. Not even an interview. My resume was basically laughed at by the HR folks at the career fair last spring. As of today, I just feel like I've fucked up too much, and as a result, am going to be in the bottom of the pile of students looking for jobs. I feel like my GPA doesn't even matter, as no hiring manager has even mentioned the GPA, instead they've wondered what the fuck I've done with myself. I do have a slightly better resume this semester, with the IT job. I'm also in desperation trying to relate my skills as a music producer for this band I have worked with over the summer.

I just feel hopeless; I don't see why I should get A's in class when it's done nothing for my future. I don't see why I should even bother to apply online for jobs when my shitty resume with lack of technical experience, achievements and data-driven jargon won't even pass the cut from the AI reader. I'm so worried I'm just going to graduate and still be stuck in my parent's house, in my hometown I can't stand, working other meaningless minimum wage jobs, no better off than a Media Arts major. All I want is to get a job out of my city and gain independence, and feel like I finally can be an adult and not some junkie loser that's been my life for so long.

When I know that I have a bright future, that my work does have a purpose, it's so easy to dive in and accomplish great things, but as of today, nothing about what I'm doing seems to have any purpose whatsoever, except to get a piece of paper that cost $20-30,000 or whatever so I'll have a leg up on the high school graduates. 

I would love to hear from anyone who were in or knew someone in a similar pickle as me. I would also like to know, what should I do if I graduate with no offers?"

I feel like my GPA doesn't even matter, as no hiring manager has even mentioned the GPA, instead they've wondered what the fuck I've done with myself. I do have a slightly better resume this semester, with the IT job. I'm also in desperation trying to relate my skills as a music producer for this band I have worked with over the summer.

I just feel hopeless; I don't see why I should get A's in class when it's done nothing for my future. I don't see why I should even bother to apply online for jobs when my shitty resume with lack of technical experience, achievements and data-driven jargon won't even pass the cut from the AI reader. I'm so worried I'm just going to graduate and still be stuck in my parent's house, in my hometown I can't stand, working other meaningless minimum wage jobs, no better off than a Media Arts major. All I want is to get a job out of my city and gain independence, and feel like I finally can be an adult and not some junkie loser that's been my life for so long.

When I know that I have a bright future, that my work does have a purpose, it's so easy to dive in and accomplish great things, but as of today, nothing about what I'm doing seems to have any purpose whatsoever, except to get a piece of paper that cost $20-30,000 or whatever so I'll have a leg up on the high school graduates. 

I would love to hear from anyone who were in or knew someone in a similar pickle as me. I would also like to know, what should I do if I graduate with no offers?"

Specifically, I applied to Amazon, Microsoft, Google (with a referral), and Apple ~Aug 31st and have not heard back from any of them with a coding challenge. In contrast, I have heard back from JP Morgan, Twilio, Mastercard, and Cisco with challenges. Hoping I can move on in those but still haven't heard anything after doing the OAs. 

I have two previous software development internships at a F500 company and a decent amount of personal projects. Is it just bad luck? Or should I just be patient and wait longer haha."

I’m a full time engineering assistant at a manufacturing facility, and have full intentions of keeping this job until I graduate. This is my third engineering position, my first two being 6 month internships. My GPA is 3.65 so not terrible?

Will having over 3 years of experience in an engineering role help me start at a higher pay rate when I start looking at entry level engineering positions? Or are most entry level salaries based on being entry level and dont take into account experience? Could I qualify for a non-entry level position even though I’ll have just gotten my degree?

Sorry for all the questions, but I’m trying to get a head start on planning post-grad, and I’m hoping I can make up some of the cost of adding an additional two years of school!

ivfifs,2,2020-09-18,What’s the point?,TeaAdministrative296,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ivfifs/whats_the_point/,"Hi everyone. I’m a 25F living in America with a loving family and my whole life ahead but, I don’t want to live it. I just want to cease to exist and to make everything I feel stop. (Skip the last paragraph if you don’t want the backstory)

I know how dramatic everything I’m about to say is going to sound but, it hurts so much. For the past three years, I’ve been studying under a “mentor” who really took advantage of me and used me for his personal gain. I met him at a company where he was my manager and talked about how much potential I had and how he wanted to invest in me professional. The goal was to eventually work together as equals and have successful film careers. (I know it sounds crazy but, I was naive and believed it.) We became closer and started working on projects outside of my internship. 

I helped him produce a podcast, film a web series, write countless scripts to pitch to Netflix and finally, I helped him from start to finish film a horror film. Every project we ever worked on was “his” not mine. I had zero value because I was merely learning from his exalted greatness. The only problem was, none of his projects were ever successful and I was never paid for any of my efforts. He found me when I was in college and now three years out of college I have NOTHING to show for all of the work I’ve done. 

Aside from infiltrating my life professionally, he also invaded my personal relationships. I was told that my friends were too immature and in order to be successful I had to be willing to drop everyone including my family... so I did. I wanted so badly to move to LA and to be working on entertainment that I was willing to follow my “mentor” and leave everyone behind to do it. By isolating myself the only person left to depend on was him. I ran out of money and moved in with him and his brother.

While living at the brother’s house his parents moved in so, I was living in a house where I was the only person that wasn’t blood related. Before moving in, I made sure it was ok for me to bring my two cats. Everyone seemed fine so, I brought my babies. During my time living there, it became clear that the parents were not ok with my cats and only prioritized their dog’s needs. One day, they left the doggy door open and one of my cats escaped. 

I have zero friends, no job, no hopes of getting a professional job with the world in its current state and absolutely worst of all, my cat is missing because my roommates let him out. It’s been two months and I’m losing hope. Things can be replaced and money comes and goes but, I didn’t protect the little innocent being that relied on me and now my cat is gone. I hate myself. I hate people. They can’t be trusted and no one actually cares about you; all they want is to get something out of you. I don’t trust men (lots of abandonment and daddy issues) I want a family but I don’t ever see that happening. I am not willing to get close enough for anyone to hurt me. I just can’t take it anymore and want to die."

Even further is that they were in an industry I didn't want to continue being in. However due to a lot of commitments and being too nervous I was unable to fully commit myself to the interview and ultimately got the rejection email a week later. It pains me everyday when I think about and I feel like I truly did lose my chance to break out of my current positions. Currently I'm doing the best I can to continue to make myself appealing for future positions but I always think what's the point if I'm going to be competing against thousands of other applicants who are much more skilled than I am? Has anyone done internships that they hated and went on to improve and break into what they wanted to do? What else can I do to get that chance again and actually make it or am I just supposed to give up when I got that far?

He dropped out of school, has no job, and just sits around all day.

He finally left today and I was so happy to have my house back, but now another friend can’t go home and needs a place to stay. I’m the only person she knows who would be able to take her in, so now she’s at my tiny house.

And as  I currently can’t find a spring insight programmes as Morgan Stanley I though what have I got to lose I’ll apply for the summer internship then.

I had an interview on Friday with a company at 1 pm and I was on the zoom call by 12:50. My interviewers showed up 10 mins late to a 45 minute interview so my time was already cut very short. One of the interviewer then struggled to turn her mic on for another 5 minutes and when she did it started echoing. After that, the interview started. This is for an internship position for an application development role. They asked me about multithreading and arrays vs linked lists. I told them I didn’t really know what multithreading was but I knew threads, and they continued to ask me large scale questions and grill me on it. After that we went into the coding round. They made me SCREENSHOT the problem and code on my own IDE while screen-sharing which I thought was so stupid, there are free code  share websites. The problem was a medium leetcode problem, and I knew the solution but I wrote my code in like 5 mins because I was heavily rushed to start coding by my interviewers and then when I was done and double checking it, they were like ok we’re gonna take a screenshot and move onto behavioral. I didn’t even get to run my code or test my code. They asked me two behavioral questions and then asked me about my cybersecurity minor and started grilling me on encryption algorithms when I told them I had not taken a course in encryption algorithms yet. But they continued to ask so I just tried to problem solve it. Then the interviewer looked at my resume and said so it looks like you have ML experience should I ask you about ML or operating systems? I just told him my only experience in ML is from a summer project for an internship and that I don’t know much after that. So he starts grilling me about operating systems, and I answer his questions correctly but the other interviewer keeps talking over me every time I say something slightly wrong she starts like talking over me and saying no. And then he’s like ok we’re out of time you have to ask us questions and I literally just asked them what their favorite part about the company was and they couldn’t even say anything about it. They said their teams, but nothing positive about the company. This interview was absolute garbage and I don’t think I did bad except for the topics which I told them I had no experience in that they continued to grill me on. My interviewers were rude and the set up / format for coding was horrendous. What do you guys think? I could be overreacting but I was literally being asked java questions, a medium level coding question, security, operating systems and behavioral in a 35 min interview for an internship position."

1. How much do GRE scores matter in the profile, anyway?
2. What kind of schools should I be applying to, realistically speaking?
3. Should I retake my GRE?"

I feel very hopeless.. I grew up being a book worm and loved creativity and can say, that i was good at it.
I wanted to become an author, but since school was stressful to me, because i wasn‘t good st studying scientific topics, i stopped writing chapters and one day just lost all my ideas and interest (looking back, i‘m amazed by how well written the chapters were and now i could never write like that). Then, i wanted to become an editor instead but what book would i edit in English in a german country? kind of useless. but the thought of living in another country at the age of 18 scared me and the success rate wasn‘t very good i read, so i gave that up and it became a hobby only.

Now, at 20:
My only wish is to become succesful in life.
I started studying biomedical engineering and it shocked everyone, even myself, since i still wonder why i chose it.. maybe, because i thought it would offer a good salary and is well-deemed, so i could feel very smart and show everyone around me that i‘m not as stupid as they think..
well, since i‘ve started studying, i was okay.. I wasn‘t the best but not the worst either. BUT here comes the problem: I can‘t find anything that i‘d be good enough to work in. I want to find an internship, because i love working. I want to gain so much experience in order to find out if i should give up or not, but every job offer i find expects so much experience since it is a hard studying field and i have none, because how would i have gained it? i only worked as a barista until now, still do. 
I don‘t know anymore.. I can‘t see a plan B for myself. I want to be successful in this field but how can i be? I can never imagine myself as a scientist, i always find myself thinking „how do people come up with ideas like that? How do people create something themselves?“ I realised that i actually really lack creativity, so what am i actually good at? I gave up all my hobbies since i barely had time for them and now no motivation either..
It‘s a never-ending cycle for me.. any advice on what to do? I have no goal to work towards..
Where do i start to help myself?"

To get prepared, it would be really helpful to know a bit about what there is to look forward to. For those who have been involved in UCLA's ACM chapter or know about it in some way:

* **Intern vs. Officer**: Would it be advisable to apply to be an intern rather than an officer if I have limited experience, even though I'm a Junior?
* **Responsibilities**: What does it take to be an officer? An intern? Is there a lot expected of you? Is the time commitment manageable?
* **Application Process**: When are they recruiting for officer positions? How rigorous is the recruitment process? Is there an interview? Diagnostic test?

I would be most interested in joining ICPC or Game Studio, if that's relevant.

Any and all answers would be very much appreciated! Thank you!"

My name is Meeaud, currently 19 years old, and began my sophmore year in UNLV at Las Vegas. Currently I am undeclared but will probably have a major in CS. I've been interested in having a career revolving around network security and as of now, my linkedin is pretty sparse. I only have 3 connections and by the end of winter break, I will hopefully have a Google IT Support Professional Certificate that's from Coursera. I'm soon going to be preparing on getting security + and that could be next summer as well. I have a lot of volunteering experience back when I was in high school mostly but I never had a job and of course never had an internship. This may not be the best time to look for internships but I will be okay with doing a virtual internship, apprenticeship, or on-site internship if their available now or next summer. I do know the basics of networking with others and to be honest, I don't do well talking to people or keeping in touch with them. In other words, I'm not good at being social. Networking/being socially active is probably the biggest thing I need to work on aside from gaining experience. 

My resume is only lacking in having any type of experience in what I'm interested in doing and I want to gain experience and that's my plan for next summer and now as well. So this post my be jumping around everywhere but I need some help on what to do as of now and things to look out for/advice. Thank you."

I am 23 and in Denver, CO. I’m currently completing my BS in CS and looking like I’ll be done in January’21. My program is accelerated (8 weeks a course) and while we have been programming for awhile it’s just now feeling intensive and practical. 

I am hoping to be able to apply for a JR dev role or freelance small stuff by then or at least an internship. I know I need to have some form of portfolio but I’m struggling with focusing on what to actually create/work on for it.  My program is mostly Java focused with some MySQL, python, and C++ sprinkled in (very brief stuff with WebGL and JS) I’ve played with mobile dev platforms (my degree will use android for one unit, though I’m more interested in iOS). I’ve been doing some web design stuff but it feels like a waste of time. I like it but not necessarily over anything else. I’m interested in possibly doing something with Computer Vision but it also seems like a lot of industry requires a Ph. D.


I feel like need to be doing something that isn’t just another algorithm implemented. I feel like a pretty modular person who could pickup multiple stuff but also feel like specialization is important. For now I just want paid well and potentially be able to either become a manager or start my own business.

I thought about starting to make a labor tracker and shift scheduler app but also feel like maybe that’s take too much time away from school. 

I’ll search for entry level positions and the requirements seem all over the place with stuff as vague as OOP to a specific API.

iw2j0s,1,2020-09-19,The biggest decision of my life thus far...,ReganMapinoe,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iw2j0s/the_biggest_decision_of_my_life_thus_far/,"Hey everybody. I’m in a really tough spot, and definitely in one of my lowest mental states of my life. 

I’m a high school senior who is applying to my colleges. I played tennis (important) for ~9 years, have competed for the varsity team for 4, and have competed at the national level. It’s safe to say I’m a pretty experienced tennis player. 
	Now, onto the pickle I’m in. Applying to college is a very frustrating and anxious process, and it’s normal for everybody to feel like that. However, for me, it has been plaguing me. Being an athlete and getting recruited to colleges makes the process 5x more stressful than it should be. 
	My main problem stems here. I’m getting recruited to play tennis at multiple colleges, but I’m also applying to colleges I wouldn’t playing tennis for. These colleges are also on completely different sides of the spectrum. All of the tennis schools are small (~3,000 students), liberal arts schools with everything you’d expect from a lib arts school (except one tennis school which is a big university). The non-tennis schools are big, state or private schools (~25,000 students) with many opportunities, too. My problem is choosing which path I want. Do I want to be a student-athlete in college? Do i want to have those long nights and early mornings? Do I want to sacrifice most of my social life and miss out on the things I’d find in a bigger university? Do I want to miss out on majors and internships I could find at a university? Similarly, the other side strikes me. If i went to a big university, do i want to be here and just be a number in the system? Do i want to give up tennis for something bigger than me? Do i want to be a normal kid?
	My biggest fear coming from this is regret. I’m scared that one day, I’ll be playing tennis in college and think “man, I should’ve attended that big university”. Similarly, I’m scared I’ll be at the big school and think “man, I should’ve taken that scholarship and played tennis in college”. 
	Tennis has been all I’ve known for my life and I don’t ever want to give it up. I also hear about college being the next big step and the “best four years of your life”, and I don’t know if i want to miss out on that, either. 
	My parents are suggesting that I play for the club team at a big school because if they have a good Division 1 team, they probably have a good club team. But club just isn’t the same as varsity. Its more so “for fun”, where the practices are only twice a week and just don’t seem like the same intensity as the varsity team. Also, the varsity team has a family and brotherhood that I wouldn’t trade for anything. 
	It’s also hard because the schools are so different academically. Most of the tennis schools are smaller and aren’t necessarily “the best” schools, even though it doesn’t matter that much where you go to undergrad. These non-tennis schools are Georgia Tech, Georgia, and Maryland to name a few. I don’t want to give up tennis and the team and its competitiveness, but I also don’t want to give up more academic opportunities, internships, and the “true college experience”.

Thank you for reading this, seriously. Any advice would be much appreciated, especially from those in my position, those who have been in my position, or college athletes. Thank you."

If not, I hope all of you are able to experience something similar in the future and that everything will click in place for you soon :))

I was able to come home and enjoy a lot of things I would have otherwise missed (I would have spent the school year + summer in Toronto far away from home if it weren't for COVID due to internship and summer school). I've always liked making food (desserts specially) as a de-stressor but couldn't while living on res as we didn't have kitchens, now that I'm at home I could do whatever I want, I even caught up on reading which I never had time for before.

I struggle a lot personally with body image and use to put makeup on everyday for school but now that I'm at home I saw that I started to accept my bare face more and wasn't as triggered when I saw beautiful, perfect people posting selfies on Instagram.

Although I do have close friends, I always put my studies first and use to feel lonely and left out when people post about going to clubs and parties while I studied in the library for an assignment due the next day, but as most people stay home now it's been very peaceful and I've lost that sense of ""because everyone else is doing it I feel bad not doing it myself.""

I've heard a lot about people struggling with mental health as an effect of quarantine, but I found that I feel mentally healthier and wanted to know if I was alone in this?"

First, I got sober, and because I got sober my anti depressants started to work but up until recently i've just been living with my ADD, trying to find ways around it. The unfortunate thing about being in recovery from alcoholism is I cant really be prescribed stimulants because I run the risk of getting addicted to them. But I just started an internship to get my substance abuse counselors license and I realized that I cant be fidgeting or mindlessly drawing while people talk to me just because it helps me focus, i'll look like i'm uninterested in what they're saying or clients will think i'm anxious because i'm always moving around. So I started strattera less than a week ago and so far it seems to be helping a little bit, I can focus just a little bit longer on things and not have my brain pull me in 20 different directions, although it feels kinda like tunnel vision. But the whole point of this post is, I was talking to her and i realized that some people just arent like this?? I tried explaining to her what it was like to just lose words as soon as they come out of my mouth, or fixating on something because if i dont get it done NOW, then ill forget until its too late, or hoping that what im saying isnt actually five different stories being told at once. Idk I just really hope these meds work because i didnt realize how exhausting living with this has become.

TL;DR I didnt realize how much my ADD effects my life and I finally asked to be put on meds to help."

So I've been working with above average pay for my country (300$ avg, mine is 400-500$ (project based not fixed), same as my mom who is a nurse), but beside working I don't do anything.

Maybe I'm sometimes unhappy because I barely spend 1/4 of the money I get monthly since my parents are shit with money management and always have something ""urgent"" that can't ""wait"", and I'm guilt tripped easily, which results in me working all day, enjoying the process but then realizing that when I want to something for fun, I can't because there's never a good deadline and I end up working extra just to deliver since I'd hate being blamed for a missed deadline, bug, because of need of validation from clients/boss. (Doesn't help that I'm the solo full-stack developer of a team made of manager,designer,html/css designer).

I drink about 3 coffees a day and smoke 10-25 cigs a day now, realizing just now that I'm probably addicted to both, and probably because those are the only activities that are short yet can make you go another round of X hours, plus can lift any mood in minutes, but initial reason was because I liked the ritual.

Unlike the me on previous years before the internship that didn't know how to keep progressing, I probably could learn more from leaving my job, start new projects and learn things which I didn't have the time to learn (yet) like caching in the back-end, microservices (at least attempt, I know I'd be over my head), learn redux better (I used to use apollo engine when in internship then had to switch to REST back-end and redux).

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's your advice?

* Should I keep working so better opportunities come up? I'd like to work on actual projects that at least the clients give a shit enough to do real advertising, but every outsourced project that comes in my country is highly unlikely to have the budget.
* Should I leave my job, make programming fun only (no going to office and it goes to 100% fun) and mix it with other types of enjoyable activities, drop coffee, fix my sleep schedule, quit smoking, quit caring about money at all and just spend like a normal guy in my age would, let my parents take care of my expenses.

iw5r25,16,2020-09-19,Which option is better for earning money?,postitthoughts,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/iw5r25/which_option_is_better_for_earning_money/,"Context: 4th year University student

I'm very interested in starting something by myself. A Side hustle, an online business, or whatever it is.

My dad and I often really agree on this feeling of being our own bosses, and he also has a side business while working fulltime. Recently, we disagreed on something very vehemently, however. Not mad, just stronger opinions.

I've currently started a T-Shirt business (not blatantly spending money on shortcut gurus but doing my own research, cashflow calculation, etc). My opinion is, it's my own idea and I really like it, so I've capped 200-300$ of my money to see this through. 

My dad's opinion is that it's not the right way to go. He thinks that I should focus on starting something based on my learned discipline (computer science), and not doing so would probably waste the knowledge I've gained through my past internships and experience by wasting time in an unknown market.

At the end of the day, from what I've read on PFC, it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance in one's life when you're 22 to put some money into your own high-risk investments, but I look up to my dad for advice about this stuff, so when he says it's not the right way to go, it'd kinda demotivating working on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?"
iw60vs,3,2020-09-19,24M 4 year Illustration degree; No interest in art career but no solid idea on new career; NYC bound,dead_alligoater,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/iw60vs/24m_4_year_illustration_degree_no_interest_in_art/,"(copied over from findapath since I'm still struggling) 

Art was a deep part of my identity growing up, 4 year degree burned me out and further knowledge about the industries killed my interest in grinding that competition and it's now a hobby.  
It's ruined any desire for me to be in a career with long-term type deadlines and guaranteed hard crunches to meet them. It also makes me highly aversive to going back to school with exceptions to shorter certification or training.

Been out for 2 years staying with supportive parents and burnout kept kicking me because of my untreated ADHD, now making steps with medication and slowly trying to fix long term bad schedule habits.  
I've had two jobs since out with no previous work experience.

Kennel keeper (no interest in ever working with animals or cleaning again due to, has shown me what level of customer support I can do before being drained)  
College librarian assistant (currently employed until Covid makes numbers too low for assistants to be needed) They kept giving me time-sheets during the quarantine because I was already in the budget, so I'd love to look for a similar smaller state funded/government position.

Both jobs have shown me my brain really likes daily task-based deadlines as opposed to long project deadlines.  
From slowly learning Blender3D I know I like problem solving (but still burnout too fast to make it as a 3D modeler, even though I know they're in demand)  
I've tried to learn basic coding, but that was before I had meds and lost interest quickly. I currently don't have a lot of faith in myself to become proficient with it with my current energy levels, but a future possibility.

Because of the program problem solving, I know IT or CS is a possibility, but school would be an issue as well as lots of Indeed listing wanting several previous years (even with intern positions)  
I like the sound of IT Security because it's less about computer support and more keeping programs up to date  
I've looked into data clerk/stock clerk, and like the idea of it because I'm a big ""planner"" kind of artist who likes to gather and organize reference before working on a piece.  
However, a lot of Indeed listing don't seem super friendly to no experience

Any other thoughts on a daily task-oriented career with low-ish social interactions?  
I'd love to keep working in libraries but because I want to move to NYC to be with my SO I don't think that'd be enough to keep up.

Thanks, tried my best to keep it short"

iw6rva,3,2020-09-19,A strange offer -- an internship instead of a permanent job,Maxilos,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/iw6rva/a_strange_offer_an_internship_instead_of_a/,"**TL;DR: Is it okay to go to a really small, unknown, or even flat-out *bad* university? If you were hiring for a position, would you care if an applicant had a degree from some tiny place nobody's ever heard of?**

&amp;nbsp;

So recently I was made kind of an unusual proposal, and I'm not sure what to do. I was hoping I could get some career advice. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and replies :)

&amp;nbsp;

*My background: I have a Bachelor's degree in CE (w/ co-op, graduated in April) and have been looking for work since new year's.*

&amp;nbsp;

After an interview for a permanent position for a mixed-signal verification engineer, I was told that while I didn't get the job, the manager wants to take me on as an intern. This doesn't come out of nowhere&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;the company apparently works in tandem with a local technical school and often hires from it. Also, many professors at this technical school are past or part-time professionals in the semiconductor industry.

&amp;nbsp;

So the offer would be to work part or full-time at this company, conditional on also doing a master's (while also working) at this technical school (or a local university). 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying my best to weigh the pros and cons but I'm having trouble making a decision. Some pros/cons:

* The company is really good, but I'm more interested in ASIC design than verification.

* My alma mater, without being great, is better-known (and offers better-quality education I think) than the local uni near this job. My grades are really good, too, so I feel like I could do better.

* I'm worried that a master's from a tiny unknown uni would be a bad idea in the long term.

* We're in COVID times. I'm getting desperate for work&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;any work.

* An internship would mean much less money for very similar work.

* The programs at the technical school are ultra-specialized. Maybe that's a good thing, in this day and age.

&amp;nbsp;

So what do you think?

Am I dumb for even considering this?

What would you do if you were in my shoes?"

I’m usually quiet during social event like lunch time or any coffee breaks.(prob. one major reason why i think I would not get an offer cuz i dont quite fit in w the group).

There’s another intern currently hired the same time as me but he decided to pursue masters after the contract ends but no one has asked me what’s my plan after the internship. I know I’m just an intern nobody gives a fck about an intern.

Given the time i have left, should i be having high hopes of getting a job offer or should i just pursue my masters as well?"

Not only do I not have faith in our IT department, I don't trust any of these ""rising star"" programs. 

I've never used webcams and never will. This is, of course, a point of contention between my professors and I. But why must I show them where I live or where I access the internet? My face is not necessary for anything we do. [In fact, it's detrimental to the point of a meeting.](https://www.insider.com/why-you-stare-at-yourself-zoom-calls-psychologist-2020-4)

 I'm tired of feeling like my personal information must be shared with every new program they decide to use. I know these things are ""safe.""

This isn't what I signed up for. This isn't what I pictured the money I've saved for tuition being used for. And this definitely isn't what I need from a master's program or internship meant to further my career opportunities and build important networks.

I have 24 credits left to complete - my original plan was to take 2 classes at a time with expected graduation of Spring 2021. However, this was all hinging on me getting an internship which I have not been able to do despite my trying. At this point, I'm thinking it's probably better for me to stretch out my remaining classes and focus on applying to internships, leetcode, and personal projects. I'm registered in 2 classes for this fall, but am thinking I will likely drop one.

How does this look:

Fall 2020: CS 372 - Intro to Computer Networks

Winter 2021: CS492 - Mobile Software Development

Spring 2021: CS 493 - Cloud Software Development

Fall 2021: CS467 - Capstone


I still also have CS361 and CS362 to take, and as far as I understand I think they are both prereqs to the capstone. Any input on where the best placement would be? 

Depending on how things looked with internships I was thinking if I wanted to speed things back up again I could do 361 Winter and 362 in spring and if I wanted to push things back even more I could move capstone to Winter 2022 and take 361 and 362 both in Fall 2021. 

Any input is appreciated!"

I was interviewing at a very large SaaS company that has its roots in India but with its HQ in the US for a Data Science Intern role. After a preliminary HR phone screen, I had a telephonic technical interview. The interviewer was a Senior Data Scientist at the company. I was asked to come up with an algorithm with linear time complexity to the following question:

  
We are given a sorted array A and a number x. We have to find if a pair of elements A\[i\] and A\[j\] exist in A such that A\[I\]+A\[j\]=x. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was the main crux of the interview. I have no prior experience with competitive programming or data structures and hence could not come up with an algorithm that has a linear time complexity. However, I did come up with two algorithms that performed the task with Big O complexities of n^(2) and nlogn. Upon searching the web later on, I found out that this question is called as the 2-pointer problem and also learnt the algorithm to solve it in linear time. I was asked a few other questions on supervised and unsupervised algorithms but they were not the main chunk of the interview. 

Am I just arrogant for not having learnt the basic yet seemingly irrelevant skill of data-structures and competitive programming for a DS role or is it a mistake on the interviewer's part on asking me irrelevant questions? Also, is this practice of asking a question that is more fit for an SDE role, for a DS role also present in other countries or is it more of an Indian thing?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 29 year old loser trying to improve my life, yes I know I have low self-esteem, but I gotta be honest.  I recently graduated a local community college with a CIS (computer information systems) in programming.  I had a job that was from a internship, but it was a local company and when COVID hit it more or less kicked me out of a job.  I figured that maybe going back to school would be a good way to get improve my chances of getting a job and deal with the impending recession.  Anyway, I am going for a computer science degree and was thinking that it would be a good bet and would be proud of myself for finally getting a real degree.    


This, however, was short lived and I am realizing that I am not cut out for the higher level maths and computer classes.  I'm in trig and computer organization 1, learning about Boolean expressions and the like.  I'm getting my ass kicked and this isn't event the hard stuff yet.  I can't seem to grasped the concepts and get a real understanding of the lessons in either class.  I'm a month in and I'm failing my math already, sure to be failing this computer class come my first exam here in a week.  I have spent literal hours trying to understand this stuff and it just isn't sinking in.  I have always struggled in math and this makes me feel like I'm right back in high school where I first failed math.  I'm just worried that I'll never be successful and I'm wasting time and money doing this.   


I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and to be frank I don't offer a lot of anything special.  I like computers and problem solving, but I guess only at a low level.  I can't imagine what calc or more complex computer problems would look like.  I mean should I just be a technician? or pursue a dream?  I feel like its a little late in the game for that.  I honestly wanted to prove to myself I could do this and had some confidence after the AAS degree for community college.  That is fading fast.    


TL;DR: I'm a dumbass who wants to be successful at computer science, but I suck at math and I am really doubting myself now.  I need some advice or something.  Should I call it quits or what?"

Work background: I’m a nursing unit Secretary at a hospital. I work 36 hours each week. 3 twelve hour shifts from 5 p - 5 a. I work in the NICU with babies so it’s boring and they use me to answer the door, prepare charts and answer the phone. For 12 hours usually I would complete homework to stay busy since there is nothing for me to do. 

However this semester is different because I have to pick up a virtual internship for 15 hours a week and become a virtual teaching assistant 15 hours a week in order to graduate (Major is psychology). I also want to go to medical school so working at a hospital looks good but this job is so bland and unfulfilling, id rather work at a drs office part time during day shift so I can have the entire daytime to complete my school tasks.

I just feel bad because my manager has been so lenient with me. I’ve never met a manager so understanding of me coming in late or anything. She has. I’d feel bad to just up and quit but I’m also tired of working overnights! I feel like it’s taken a toll on my mental health. Not to mention, I don’t actually get home until 5:45 a.m., I have classes at 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. 

My refund check is coming and it covers my rent until January which is when my lease is up since I may be moving back home to NY for postbac program. I will have extra money left over as well probably like 3,000. 

Should I quit my job and look for something part time and day shift? Or stick with my job? (she won’t let me change my schedule since she has a secretary for the mornings anyway). I’m just nervous about my grades. Being that I want to go to medical school and I have a lot on my plate... I just have a lot of fears. My GPA is a 3.4 and I’m not trying to lower it my last semester of undergrad.

Any advice or input would help! Sorry for the long POST"

Unfortunately we don't really have standardized interview questions like leetcode. I won't go over which company asked my which questions, just a big list of the questions I remember.  

Disclaimers: 

* These questions were for internships, but there's some overlap
* I was a freshman/sophomore during most of these interviews, so most of these questions weren't too math/textbook heavy. I was asked most of these questions before I took AC circuits and above.
* I had practical and internship experience during these interviews, so some of the questions might be more specialized
* I keep track of every question I get asked during an interview, but I left that notebook at school so these are the ones I remember
* These are only the technical questions

I won't go over my answers since that would just be too much, but feel free to ask about specific questions. I ended up getting offers from a lot of them, but of course that's more than just getting questions correct.

As the title suggests I’m trying to break into the BI world as an entry level employee. A little bit of background about me just to paint a better picture of where I stand. 

I am a petroleum engineer graduating senior with a decent amount of BI experience mostly with Power BI and Spotfire as during my internships with a large oil and gas operator they focused heavily on digital initiatives and transformation efforts. I even managed to generate my own projects during internships and lead an intern project by the end of my last internship! 

Regrettably due to oil and gas tanking I didn’t get a return offer and was curious as to what businesses would accept a petroleum engineering undergrad with a good foundation of the basic BI tools. If you want to PM me feel free I’m really open to any feedback or guidance."

iwoj2c,0,2020-09-20,NY Verbal Contract Offered and Rescinded,JavaMush,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/iwoj2c/ny_verbal_contract_offered_and_rescinded/,"I've been reaching out to get a lawyers opinion on a *verbal contract agreement for employment*. 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had lost my job due to the employers restructuring. 

Soon after, I started seeking a new position. I came across this listing and decided to apply. 

([https://www.indeed.com/m/viewjob?jk=0679299051750c24](https://www.indeed.com/m/viewjob?jk=0679299051750c24))

After applying, I was contacted for a series of 3 remote interviews with the CEO. 

After these interviews, I was asked to attend a Zoom Meeting on 7/10; where the other applicants and I were asked to work under a Part-Time contract for a month (on or off the books). 

I accepted the role and signed a contract saying that I would begin 7/15/2020 and end 8/18/2020. I never received a handbook as detailed in the agreement. 

After approximately 2 weeks of work, the CEO asked me to work additional hours and then stated the *original contract was now void*; due to my working additional hours for another applicant. 

I followed through with all requests to appease my boss and worked incredibly hard to obtain the position as Executive Assistant. 

When the one month contract was over, the CEO and I had a phone call discussing my position moving forward. I was in NJ and he was in Brooklyn, NY at the time of this call. 

Unfortunately, We don't have this call recorded. 

The CEO offered me the Executive Assistant position, 3-4 days a week at $30/hr as a salaried employee (because I'd be on call).  

**I accepted the offer and awaited the paperwork for the position to be sent to me.** 

I was overjoyed by reaching my goal!

**When I received paperwork a few weeks later, the salary and hours were sliced exactly by 50%** and they began posting positions for ""Male interns"".  (The original position was $46,800 a year, $30/hr 30 hours a week. The paperwork presented was $23,400 a year, of $18/hr 25 hours a week.) I had to awkwardly address several issues with a contract that looked very unprofessional and unofficial. 

I wasn't informed of these changes. I sent him a message asking why the contract is far different from what was discussed.

**This was his reply:**

&gt; *""Yes everything on the form is correct. Due to* ***budget and profitability restraints****. Why it says new contract will be updated 60 days ""*

After seeing my heartbreak, my husband u/javamallow looked up NY State law on Employment Contracts and Verbal Contract Agreements. 

As a young adult diagnosed with CPTSD and other mental disorders, receiving a job offer, feeling stability amidst a pandemic and the stress of having it ripped away after working so hard - has caused severe depressive episodes and emotional instability. 

It's a great concern for my family but we currently aren't able to afford out of pocket help - I'm on state insurance through the Foster care System. 

*Is it possible to seek emotional damages?* 

I have spoken to my coworkers who have all chosen not to work with this CEO, due to his ""games"" and unprofessionalism. They are willing to give statements on his sneaky character.

I'm seeking a lawyer who is well versed in verbal contract agreements in the state of NY.

*Does anyone have any advice or know of an attorney who would be willing to look at the details of our case?*

I am a transfer student that came to UCI to the data science major because I was interested in computer science and curious about data science. I took these classes my first year:

[Already have minor in stats from this](https://preview.redd.it/knf6gooikdo51.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781d17a3217c89d844276629f8d29f67fbc3b3cb)

And the current plan to finish the data science degree is:

[Finish in one more year](https://preview.redd.it/rxy1zsjnkdo51.png?width=348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d659de4ffdf590da535010e2e882747f6d5c2aec)

However, despite doing well, I did not really bond with the statistics classes but did enjoy the computer science classes. I now also feel unsure about whether I want to go into the data science field as data analytics does not seem like something I would be passionate about doing in a career. I feel like I am more interested in the development or even hardware side of CS. But of course it is hard to tell with my lack of experience.

This leads me to the choice I now have to switch to the computer science major with a minor in stats for which an example schedule will look like this (intelligent systems specialization):

[Another plan is taking 2 extra quarters if this is too intense. Does this plan seem too intense? Hard to tell for me cuz I've only taken 1 Upper Div CS class.](https://preview.redd.it/vpbh545tkdo51.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84d6a1d85bdeba249dc5b5aa8963efad836859cd)

I feel like taking the computer science route will give me more time to explore the different fields in CS and decide what direction to go in my career. I also think computer science + stats minor will look better for employers as its more broad compared to data science which is a newer and specific major. Plus it seems like getting a masters in data science quite important for the field. Switching to CS may also give me more time to find an internship (currently only have a small one) and get experience/projects in the field which is something I am lacking.

So, I am stuck in the decision of finish data science major in one year and move on from school/get in the field or take an extra quarter (or 2?) to do a computer science major + stats minor. What do you fellow anteaters recommend? Is the fall 2021 quarter CS schedule too intense? What CS specializations do you recommend? Is there anywhere / anyone you know who I can ask to get more advice? Thank you all so much for all your help!

&amp;#x200B;

|*Pros for Major Switch*|*Cons for Major Switch*|
|:-|:-|
|More time to explore CS|Graduate 1 or 2 quarters later|
|CS major + stats minor is more recognizable for employers?|Start to explore other fields out of school later|
|More time to get internships / projects / experience with UCI resources|Miss out on data science capstone project|

I need help on how to rethink myself and change how I approach applying and interviews. Rather than approaching with a mindset of: I would like to have my first dip in professional experience so please give me a chance. 

I'm having a hard time finding confidence and thinking what I need to do because all the rejections I'm getting is that I don't have enough experience. Well, I'm applying so I'm trying to get experience!!

For background:   
I recently graduated with a B.S in computer engineering at San Jose state. I was not able to get internships during school, so I graduated with no internships under my belt. All technical experience I have came from academic projects. 

Due to pandemic, I am currently living with my parents in Hawai'i. There is nothing computer engineering related in Hawai'i that I can apply to.   


How I will benefit the company?    
My answer:  
I am a recent graduate, with academic experience that touches different aspects of the whole computer engineering field from web development, embedded systems, computer architecture, and general software and hardware concepts. I am well-rounded and a faster learner and can pick up on things as I work on projects.

iwsyij,133,2020-09-20,Was hacker culture at Berkeley EECS ever mainstream?,victoriouswar,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/iwsyij/was_hacker_culture_at_berkeley_eecs_ever/,"When I came to Berkeley to study CS, I expected my peers to be ""hackers"". The type of people who would stay up late into the night fiddling with their Linux distros or doing personal projects like making Arduino robots. Just like how Steve Wozniak (BS '87) was notably famous for making his own telephone hacking boxes to defeat AT&amp;T's long distance telephone systems into giving him free calls.

It seems like most of CS majors aren't in it for the love of hacking and programming, they're in it because this job pays well and is currently prestigious. A lot less people are studying CS because they like messing around with microprocessors, and a lot more people studying CS to impress other people. When people talk about being a CS major, they're comparing what kind of internship they got and what kind of compensation they're going to get, not what cool thing they built last night or what neat thing they recently learned.

You can even see this in clubs. ""Hacker"" clubs like the OCF and CalSol are welcoming and no-cut, while ""career"" clubs like MDB and CodeBase are hypercompetitive orgs that have single digit acceptance rates.

Anyone know if Berkeley used to have a stronger hacker culture, or if this has just always been the case and ""hackers"" have always been rare? I'm sure such people still exist at Berkeley (I've met a couple through OCF), but they're for sure few and far between."

iwxlzc,0,2020-09-21,Graduating soon with no internships. What should I do?,probscrewed_tho,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iwxlzc/graduating_soon_with_no_internships_what_should_i/,"Hi,

I switched to CS major pretty late in the game around my 2nd year in CC and transferred to a pretty well-known university. I chose CS because it seemed interesting and fun to do at the time, but I was completely unaware of the competitiveness of the industry. When I transferred, I had to move to far away to a new place. The academic rigor of university and loneliness of moving away from parents and friends caught me by surprised. Thus, I was pretty much only focused on academics and integrating into the school when I transferred. Senior year is here now and I'm graduating soon without any internships. I feel like I don't have enough qualifications(as I only know Java, Python, C, SQL, a little bit of R and some DS tool) to apply for real jobs and I don't have any interesting projects aside from class projects. In the summer I worked on learning more about Databases and Javascript as I hope to get into backend dev but that's not enough. I know I'm probably completely screwed and I'm not sure what to do at this point besides grinding leetcode. I been stressing over my future and I'm gradually dreading graduation while being completely defeated by schoolwork. I am unable to sleep at night because I keep worrying about my future.

Should I take a couple months after I graduate to focus on building my resume (working on side projects) and doing leetcode questions to better prepare myself as a candidate? I feel like if I apply now I probably won't get any offers as my resume seems pretty bland. I have a few side projects in mind but I don't have the time to work on them as I need to work on my classes and help my sibling/parent take care of a new baby in the family. My parents are immigrants who have worked hard for for me to get my education and all I want to do is to be able to pay them back. We are a very poor family so I don't think I have any good family connections to make use of. I don't need a job at FAANG. I just hope to make enough money to give my parents a comfortable living. What is the ideal next step I should do if I want to find a job or internship after graduation?"

I  am going to apply for internships for Summer 2021 and it would be  really helpful if some one who has gone through internship process can  review my resume and suggests changes. Some companies that I am  targeting are Amazon, Microsoft, Apple etc.

I feel like I'm currently inadequate for an actual job and doing an internship will help me to understand how real companies work and how actual projects are done. Are the internships which the big tech companies offer only for people who are currently in college for a CS degree or can someone who has already graduated do it too?  


P.S. I'm not from the United States but if there are any remote internships offered by American companies, I'd be grateful."

ix0tx8,5,2020-09-21,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (9/21/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/ix0tx8/weekly_job_qa_thread_9212020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirtieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

ix26jt,1,2020-09-21,How do I increase the chances of being able to stay at my internship?,xynaxia,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ix26jt/how_do_i_increase_the_chances_of_being_able_to/,"Currently I'm in my 4th year of my study Communication &amp; Multimedia Design. I managed to do my graduation project at a big IT company, doing the UX regarding to some IoT devices in Smart Offices, that will be used when people get back to work. THings like contact tracing, tracking distances between people etc. 

I like this company a lot, and when I'm finished graduating, I very much hope I can stay. They already told there is a possibility of staying, but that all depends on how well I do. The last (data science) student that could stay did some crazy evolutionary AI for ships, to reduce fuel used. So I suppose the bar is high...

There are 3 other interns, though I'm the only last year.

What are important qualities IT companies usually look for in a graduate?"
ix2pyp,108,2020-09-21,[Rant] JC vs Poly vs ITE by a JC grad,ainlovescode,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ix2pyp/rant_jc_vs_poly_vs_ite_by_a_jc_grad/,"Heyo! I was a student at Anderson JC for 2015-2016, and managed to pursue engineering at SUTD (ISTD pillar / Info Systems). I graduated late August. My older sibling went to poly and my younger sibling is currently in ITE. 

Based on what our experiences are, here is the general comparison:

* Cost: JC &lt; ITE &lt; POLY
* Academic rigour: ITE &lt; JC (written) \~ POLY (practical/internship)
* Career guidance: ITE + Polytechnic usually have internship opportunities. My JC didn't have an internship fair or opportunities.
* Career prospects after graduation: You are more likely able to find a job with a poly or ITE diploma. An A level cert alone is good mainly for getting into uni, or working at a tuition centre if they ask for it.
* Social status: JC &gt; POLY &gt; ITE but as a JC kid, I don't believe in this. It's just what my parents and secondary school teachers have been repeating.

Warning: huge braindump here. All my views here are my own and/or my siblings, and not meant to consciously ""hate"" on certain people or academic pathways.

**TL;DR**

If you need someone to tell you that you will turn out fine not going to JC, and that you will do perfectly fine going to poly of ITE, I'm that person. It comes down to how you want to get a job, and whether you are capable and willing to deal with whatever life and society throws at you.

**My Experiences after going through JC**

If I knew what I wanted to pursue as a career, I would definitely go poly instead of JC because I believe I would be more suitable in a more hands-on culture rather than the fast-paced mugging in JC. However, I still didn't know what I wanted to do back then. Knowing that poly was more ex for my middle-class income family, I chose JC because two years and annual fees are still cheaper than poly.

I felt constantly pressured and had trouble catching up. Legit was staying up till 3am to complete homework and revise. My self-confidence was at an all-time low as well. Thankfully, knowing that my grades will cmi, I did a lot of leadership and volunteer activities. When I was applying to SUTD, I knew my CCA and leadership activities definitely helped me get in.

Once I was in SUTD, I was learning at a slightly-slower-than-JC pace but with strong teacher support. Plus there was many hands-on projects that had a significant weightage in my grades rather than being written exam-heavy. This time my focus was on getting a job before graduation, and I had to figure this out mostly on my own and going nearly every month to my uni's career development centre. Accepted a job offer not long before COVID hit.

**My takeaways about the different education pathways**

My younger sibling in ITE was initially disappointed (as a SG kid would be) that they only had the option of ITE. However the teachers and facilities at ITE are seriously commendable. Heck, all the ITEs had better facilities than some JCs. ITE teachers are some of the most concerned teachers I've heard of from my sibling, who gained tons of self-confidence and now knows how to take care of themselves- go to gym, cook, compare online shopping prices (lol).

My polytechnic sibling never chose to go to poly due to their grades but had a good enough portfolio to go through a few jobs (some companies they worked at closed down or had poor office culture).

Both of them had more career experience than I did as part of their education, and to me, this was more important than what I see as just studying and revising for exams.

SG Society is so focused on academics and going to university that any other pathway is viewed as lesser. What's worse is that this view is held by and supported by many of our parents and teachers. Many of our elders are so adamant on this because they see it as a max benefit, min obstacles path. ""It is easier to get into uni from JC. It is easier to get a job with a degree"".

In my opinion, all of us are going to school so that we can get a job in the future. I don't think the education pathway you take should be your worth, although it shapes much of how you perceive society. ITE students can work after they grad, or go poly. Poly grads can work after they grad, or go uni. JC grads either retake their A levels, stick with their O level certs when finding work, or go uni. Ultimately, it's a test of grit and mindset.

Anyone who tries to convince you that going anywhere but JC and uni will be detrimental, is perpetuating a toxic stereotype that works against the raising up of all members of society (as cheesy as it sounds). Not everyone can afford the tuition and extracurriculars and connections to get into elite schools, but everyone has worth in society regardless of where they come from and where they were educated."

One on the major hurdles on moving there (or so I've been told) is the language, Peru is a Spanish speaking country, but i honestly have full confidence on my ability to speak, read, listen and write the language, so if a certification is needed, i shouldn't have an issue getting said certification.

Also, I know i'm really early on thinking about moving out, this is because i **think** you have to do a lot of stuff and preparation to move away, with getting a Visa accepted and such. and that's why i'm asking for advice here as well!, to know what i should be doing/ thinking of doing before i end up getting to a point in which i'll just waste time; career, economically and personally wise.

I'm enrolled already on a work and travel J1 program which will hopefully come out next year! (2021-2022), it was supposed to be this year but covid and the J1 visa suspension halted my plans.

My university is : Universidad La Salle, Arequipa  
My major is: Ingenieria de Software (Translated to Software Engineering)  
My semester is : 4/10  
I do not have experience working in the field yet, a really sad thing is that there's just not any opportunities to intern or get experience in the town i live in, only in the capital (Lima), and even there they are scarce  
honestly my biggest strength might be my English ability, and the love i have for my career (i'm not good yet, but i will be when i graduate!)

Any advice is welcome, i just really want to know what to do in order to advance on my goal, instead of just University and playing games. (Just to clarify, i love games, in fact, I want to specialize in GameDev!, it's just literally all i'm doing right now)

I hope you have a great day :)"

Ideally, I would buy the 3070 in October, but I feel like bots are going to buy them all up again. 

As of now, none of the previous gen cards are discounted, many of them I'm seeing are selling well above msrp still. What would be the best idea for a graphics card to purchase now, and how to buy it for the right price? I play on a 1080p monitor, but I can't play games lower than 120fps. Like many else, I see buyers remorse in the future if I spend $400 on a 2060 super when I could spend 100 I more on a brand new 3070.

I am a fresh college junior that has recently switched their major to CS. I know an internship is very important for this major, but I worry that I won't have enough CS classes/experience under my belt to get through interviews and an actual internship in the summer.

By Summer 2021, I would have the following classes under my belt

Computer Science 1

Computer Science 2

Computer Organization &amp; Assembly Language

Intro to Computer Forensics (elective)

Calc 1 &amp; Discrete Math

Should I wait until later on to apply to internships? I'm worried this won't be enough.

ix43oi,19,2020-09-21,Off my chest: Interview gone wrong lol,friendbear70,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ix43oi/off_my_chest_interview_gone_wrong_lol/,"I had an interview a few days ago for a startup im interested in being a design intern at. (I'm a junior mechanical engineer).

Interview started off at such a high point, I was able to show that I was passionate about their project and mission but ... I was expecting a behavior interview not a technical interview (making this my first technical interview for a job). And with each passing question, I just felt them feeling more and more unimpressed with my answers to questions such as: design a pot for a blind person, how would you design a product like ours if ours doesn't exisit yet, and describe how your mechanical pencil was manufactured.

The WORST part: they pulled up a photo of a simple cantilever beam, fixed at one end and a force on the free hanging end. They asked where the beam will break.

I **immediately and super confidently** answered: ""the middle"".

The interviewers face just... seemed stunned. How did this third year engineering student get such an easy question so wrong?

(In my defense I was nervous and didn't think through it, and in my head I was imagining a moment diagram for a distributed weight. Still a terrible excuse though, i know.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so disappointed in myself, like how did i get through statics without being able to answer this question, easily and correctly?

Anyway, I'm still waiting to hear back from them, but i'm doubtful i got the job.

**To students that are doing their first technical interview: always talk through your thinking process before answering.**"

ix6hpx,1,2020-09-21,Journalist asking for an interview. what are my rights?,IrishAmericanWhiskey,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ix6hpx/journalist_asking_for_an_interview_what_are_my/,"I was contacted today through my work email by a journalist claiming to be a journalism student from University A. They claimed to be writing a piece for a journalism class about a company I used to intern for (for 3 summers) asking to interview me about my time there.

To the best of my knowledge, the name used (as well as email) was of a legit student from University A, but seems to be from the class of 2020. I tried to look them up but couldn't find out much about them other than that they were at some  point affiliated with the university. They were able to contact me through my Linkedin profile, where it lists that I was an intern at the company. This company is ""infamous"" to say the least, so I feel like it may be a bit of a trap, rather than an actual interview.

What should I do? I dont necessarily feel uncomfortable in speaking with a journalist (to some extent), but also dont really know how to approach the situation. Should I inform my previous employer? Should I try and find out if this is a phishing scam, or a journalistic trap?  


I dont remember signing a NDA when I was an intern, but I was obviously privy to some details which were obviously not ""public"". I'm also worried that the journalist may be trying to get me to divulge information about some of their higher ups, whom one of them I knew quite personally.   


Any advice is appreciated. "

ix7sym,3,2020-09-21,Would I be stupid to turn down a job offer at this time?,Naarraan,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ix7sym/would_i_be_stupid_to_turn_down_a_job_offer_at/,"So the situation, recent May 2020 graduate still looking for a job. I have a degree in Materials Science and slightly unrelated internship experience in Manufacturing Engineering. Since looking I've been called back for 4 positions (1 interview I was unprepared for and bombed, 1 after the interview it seemed clear I didn't have the experience they were looking for, and the 2 I'll talk about here). 

I got called for a Materials position and went through two rounds of interviews for it which I felt confident about but ultimately I didn't get the position for ""someone who better fit the needs of the position."" Although they must have liked me enough to recommend me for a Manufacturing position with a team closely related to them, which I then interviewed for and got offered.

I'm struggling to decide on which way to go. On one hand, I think I know that I'm not going to be interested in the work I'm doing and not gaining the skills that I would want to advance my career, which I want to be in materials science. But the other hand, pandemic, 4 months no job, decent offer at hand (although moving to a very HCOL area).

I guess some specific questions I have would be:

Am I doing myself a disservice to take a job that isn't going to give me a large number of the skills that relate to my ultimate career goals? In my mind, I already wasn't offered the materials position because of a lack of relevant experience, what is going to change in a year when I want to find a new job and I'm a year further from school?

Should I view this situation as any experience is good experience and try my hand again in 1-2 years?

Anyone in a hiring position, would you see my resume with 1-2 years of not completely relevent technical experience differently (I guess more appealing) than a new graduate fresher out of school but a lack of experience in general?

What is the point where someone is going to see my resume 5,6,7... months post graduation with no job yet and think it's a red flag and then I'm in an even worse position?

Any thoughts/tips would be helpful, trying to weigh all my options without bias. Also if anyone has experience switching between fields (ex Maunfacturing to something more technical) without all the right relevant skills would be helpful information too."

I know this is a hard time for everyone, but I’m feeling a bit more down than usual today and wanted to post here. 

I graduated in May 2020, and have put in around 1000 applications, had about 50 interviews, and had zero job offers. Now interviewing isn’t my strong suite, but I’ve had a lot of feedback and I know I’m not bad or at least certainly not terrible at it either. 

I have 3 years of admin support (1 year also being management of a small logistics office), 2 years research assistant, and 1 year program planning research internship experience. I’ve completed leadership training programs, been in honors, have awards and several certifications (for research and CPR/AED/First aid). My major is public health, and prior to covid my plan was to go on for an MHA after getting a position in a hospital or clinic, or healthcare related private business/contractor before moving on in that direction. I’ve been involved in some coalition partnerships (as a student research assistant/program liaison/for my internship), and have had several speaking events (even at local county-level courthouse on a couple occasions) related to these efforts. I’ve since had to move from the area over 1000 miles back home, so the small amount of networks I had developed at school either can’t help me here or are essentially tapped dry. 

I’m just frustrated and scared, I know everyone is going through similar and terrible things, but to be honest I am nearly broke (savings I had have been exhausted) and will have to start paying private loans in November (aka my life will be over as I have nothing and no family that can help with this) if I don’t find literally anything by then so that I can start graduate school (non-private loans only won’t be enough to cover it, and I am going to need to defer what I have. I have been applying to great opportunities, what might or could fit, and interim high-school graduate level jobs as well.)

I don’t mean to complain, I am just scared and frustrated, and thought I’d tap in to see what other people are struggling with too/what pointers or tips might be helpful that I could be overlooking, and so I don’t just stay feeling like this. 

Appreciate any words of wisdom."

Here are my stats:

* 4.0 GPA so far in Math and Computer Science Classes
* 3.9 Culmative GPA
* No research experience
* One internship within the school related to school website
* 166 Verbal / 169 Quant GRE
* International Student if that make any difference
* I'm sure that my professors will write a strong letter of recommendation for me

Schools I'm looking at:

* Cornell University, Duke University, University of Arizona, University of Florida, and probably couple of more state schools

I am interested in either algorithms or machine learning.

Do I have a good chance at these schools? My CS professor says that I have a pretty good chance at these schools and that I'm a competitive applicant due to my strong writing skills, good GRE, strong math background, and GPA. But I don't know how competitive I am because I don't have any research experience. Any input will be appreciated!"

I don’t want to do web development so I haven’t made an effort to learn those in depth but I’ve seen that having a website with links to projects and your social media (LinkedIn, GitHub) is beneficial.

 I have a well written resume and cover letter(s) and have networked with leads at Lockheed and Raytheon from school about potential internships I could apply for in the spring but I want to know what recruiters are looking for in terms of supplementation to a resume. My current projects are very intermediate as well. Hangman, magic 8-ball, web scrapers and an application with a simple GUI that launches selected programs for me upon booting my Mac.

I would like to know what I could try and create to make myself standout and what shows I could perform well if I was offered an entry level position. I just don’t want the average practice programs that I’m sure everyone has seen coded before but they have solidified a lot of concepts for me.

It goes like this. My GPA is 3.7, I expect to get about 1350 on the SAT, and I am pretty good at writing and I think I will be able to create a compelling essay. I have been working since 15 in internships and whatnot at my school's entrepreneurship institute, and currently hold a job at a VC Firm. I built a system in use nation-wide for my school (it is mostly a university, but it does run a High School). I taught myself how to code at 14 and have always been a leader-ly kind of person.  I practiced athleticism for one year during HS and was Theater Staff, too. I ran the first Machine Learning Hackathon in the region of my country at 17 (50 ppl attended), and have given several talks to university students about AI and entrepreneurship.  Lastly, I went to the Houston FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) in 2019 and have had some but low involvement in Robotics/hardware.


Currently, I am concentrating a lot of my efforts in helping Mexican students get connected to Silicon Valley companies and mentors to improve their tech skills, as well as get started in tech in general.  


I am Mexican and 18 years old, and another interesting thing about me is that I dropped out of High School (to work full-time) one semester. I have a personal blog on medium ([@namesphill)](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/profile/namesphill%29) but overall have a low social media presence.  


As far as minorities go, I am just Latino and Gay.  


I am aware that getting into Stanford while asking for Financial Aid as an International Student makes it very hard to get in, and I have thought about applying without asking for Financial Aid (getting into a ton of debt and looking ferociously for backers and funds), but I wouldn't want to if I feel like I can spare it.  


I hope that the fact that I am applying to Stanford under Restrictive Early Action will make it easier for me to get in as I expect a smaller pool of applicants.  


I think that is all the context that is needed to get to know my situation, and I would love to have your thoughts on whether my resume should inspire confidence or whether I should really find ways to finance it without the aid or maybe wait a year to build more stuff.

Thanks!"

Also **TestOut by LabSims** has great performance based exercises and the material is to the point and covers all the objectives without a lot of unnecessary rambling. A big thank you to **Professor Messer** and his practice tests; I crammed all three tests just hours before my test by reading the questions/answers and that saved me!

I applied and just found out I am a Network Administrator! When I got the offer, I did some research and counter offered another 4K and got it!!!  Today I just got my paper copy of my A+ certification and feeling pretty good about my achievements. I must say that being able to get along with others, giving credit when it is due and not coming across like a know-it-all, is HUGE, and definitely played in my favor.

ixdhwd,1,2020-09-21,Am I taking things too far by cutting out my bestfriends?,WiggleNdGiggles,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ixdhwd/am_i_taking_things_too_far_by_cutting_out_my/,"TL;DR I've always been a hard worker, being told by my lazy best friends I should just quit my job and find something I love to do. Currently live with one of them who can't pay her bills on time or pick up after herself and is completely selfish. Am I wrong for cutting them out of my life?

I'm a 26 year old male and all my life I've had two best friends growing up. We've been through everything together and lately since quarantine everything has just changed. I can't tell if I'm just having an emotional episode or am I being reasonable.

So, back in the day in high school we had our first falling out. I was a sophomore and had a group of friends I also hung out with. One night we all decided to hang out at a friends out with parental supervision while 10-15 of us got tipsy off Mike's Hard Lemonades for the first time (we were underaged). We all slept there for the night so we all didn't drive home, again with parents there to watch us safely.. It just so happened one of my best friends liked one of the guys there so both of them cut me out of their friendship for 3 years, until they felt bad and rekindled outright friendship in college. I ended up missing prom both years and my senior trip, and landed into an abusive relationship during the falling out.

Now to the beginning of 2020, me and my s/o decide to move into a house and, since all has been well for nearly 6 years, I ask one if my bestfriends if should would like to be our roommate. I knew she was struggling to pay a one bedroom on her own, and she enjoyed my company. Only thing is, she isn't the best with her money and she's super unclean/doesn't clean up after herself. She offered to move in expressing how great it will be that her rent is more than halved and being around me would ""force"" her to be clean.

Fast forward to nearly 9 months later, she cannot pay he bills on time, doesn't pick up after herself, and blames me for being overly clean. Thing is this has all built up over time and now we can't even speak to each other. She came to me right after we had signed for the rental that she didn't have the money. I should've known better, but I offered to front the $700 for us to move in (deposits and first months, etc for her part). Months passed and I never got my money back, and I noticed she blew her stimulus check and bought a bunch of stuff for her birthday. When confronted I was told ""f---k you, its my birthday I can do whatever I want with my money."" This was backed up by the other best friend, and again it was 2 against 1. Even now she's seeing a guy and trying to turn him into a stoner by buying him stuff like bowls, smell proof containers, etc because he lives with his parents and young kids, from what she told me. She has money to spend but doesn't pay went until 1 week late. When confronted twice her reasoning was that they won't say anything untiless its past the 6th (rent is DUE on the 1st of the month no exceptions per our renters guidelines, AND EMAILS WE GET REMINDING US MONTHLY). During the summer she had ants upstairs because she would leave fast-food on the floor, so long that it was melting through the bags and cups. I ended up cleaning her up stairs office/living space, to which she replied ""honestly I just stopped giving a f---k because they will never go away."" They were gone as long as I kept it clean for her...

Now all my life I've been told by these two that I need to chill and that I take life so seriously. I've been working full time since high school, graduated honors in college while still working and juggling my internship. I've always worked hard for what I want and growing up in a low socioeconomic class with my single mother made me cherish my hard work even more. These two are so lazy, one quit her job after taking acid because she found her calling as a Woman's Coach/Tarot reader, the other works corporate at my same job sleeping all day on the clock (quarantine and working from home... her grandfather owned the company that we bought out and she's basically a receptionist that colors all day answering the phone if she's awake). They want me to quit my job and do something I enjoy, but unfortunately I need benefits for my medical conditions and I enjoy what I'm doing while making decent money. 

Since all this all happened I decided to cut them out completely. She blocked me from snapchat, so being petty back I decided ill save her the energy and delete her from Facebook.

I’m a male military veteran who used my GI Bill to go back to school for a B.S. in health sciences - What I saw as a “stepping stone” degree to higher education in the healthcare field. I’m currently working in the WIC program which is a little outside of what I was looking for, but is not bad as my first job out of college. The only problem is, all of my coworkers and teammates at WIC are women - No problem with this, but I just feel completely ostracized and out of place at work everyday although I’ve tried to the best of my ability to be social and friendly with everyone. And because of the rampant gossip I hear about other coworkers behind their backs, I know that I’m being gossiped about &amp; talked about behind my back as well. Furthermore, I’ve done the best I can at this job with the tools and knowledge I’ve been given but there has been little to no job training done outside of computer-based powerpoint training and it seems that you’re not appreciated for what you do correct and do well, but heavily chastised when you make a mistake - Many times on things I’ve never been taught in the first place. 

Alongside this, it seems that my boss is playing favoritism with a new girl that was hired a few months after me - Praising her, giving her a position above me as community outreach coordinator and internship coordinator in front of me (idk if this was to try and motivate me or maybe demean me in some way..??) The new girl was even given her employee orientation before me - To date, I’ve worked for WIC for 5 months now and never received a proper employee orientation. I just can’t hell but feel that everyone else is being held to a different set of standards and rules than I am. It’s making me absolutely miserable at work all day every day - sick to my stomach most days. Sunday nights are the worst and I begin getting anxious, depressed and nauseous. Just today (9/21/20) I was running a little behind and came in at the same time as new girl, nobody said anything to new girl but I was asked for a reason as to why I was late this morning and before leaving for home at the end of the night, my boss said she had to do a review with me tomorrow (I’m assuming it will be pertaining to my being late this morning). 

Sorry for the long post, was just hoping somebody could offer some insight or advice to my situation. Anything is appreciated - Positive, negative, etc. 

TL;DR: Male working at WIC, completely out of place and miserable due to lack of communication, training, gossip and favoritism to the point of being nauseous at work everyday, wondering what my options are for other jobs requiring a bachelor’s in the healthcare field."

I am a full-stack engineer at this company and have been with them for the past two and a half years ( 3.5 - 5 years of total experience if you count internships). 

Before I speak with the hiring manager, I have some questions and would love to hear your advice:

\- How are the day to day different between a M&amp;A engineer vs a SWE engineer?

\- Which path would be more stressful, and which one more rewarding?

\- Assuming M&amp;A engineer does less coding but more design reviews. 

Would that be better or worse for future career progression compare to normal SWE?

I am a little divided between staying with my current team and the manager that I like and continue doing the same fullstack work or change it up a bit to gain perspective into other organizations and how they do things. It'll be interesting to gain some experience in M&amp;A since positions are not that common, but I am concerned that my hands-on skill will take a hit (especially at an early stage of my career). 

I'm open and happy to chat more if anyone's want to DM!"

I am not sure where to turn or what to in my job search. I am 23 years old. I have a degree in marketing and my MBA. I have worked every summer since high school and even landed an internship in the summer of 2019. 

Since I finished up school in May I have been looking to take the next step in my journey and break into a professional career. Four months later, after applying to 400+ jobs, networking with alumni, and reaching out to friends for referrals, I am still unable to even make it past a 2nd round interview.

A common theme that we (job seeks) are currently facing is the high demand for work relative to the low supply of entry-level jobs. Of the handful of second-round interviews that I make it to they all turn to dust when the recruiter reaches out to me to let me know that I have not been chosen due to my lack of experience. This is the main problem I am facing, the lack of experience compared to other applicants. The same jobs that I would have been able to land last year under normal circumstances are now flooded with talented applicants, some who have 5-10 years of experience over me. 

With this being said, I am not sure what to do anymore. I do not know how to I can compete with people that have 5 years of experience over me for these jobs. I have mostly been looking into business/sales development representative roles and marketing type purchasing/analyst roles in the NYC metropolitan area. I have dropped my standards so much already in terms of the quality of the positon &amp; company that I have been applying for. If I continue to lower the bar at this rate I would be better of making $15/hr at amazon or target. I have also been debating taking on a teller/retail bank job as it is at least professional work I can put on my resume.

If anyone can relate to this, has any advice on getting my career started during the pandemic, or could share a story of how you transitioned your career into the industry you always wanted to work in please leave a message.

Thank you"

It's been difficult to find jobs, especially as a soon-to-be undergraduate. Should I take the jobs that I can get or do I keep looking for the job that I want?


I really want to land a job as soon as i get out of college or a couple months after. I've been searching and applying to jobs left and right, even if its a SWE position that I'm not entirely interested in, like a Full Stack position. 

For positions like Full Stack Devs, I dont like the idea that a good portion of my time is spent on the front-end/UI. I personally like back-end work, almost anything that doesn't deal with UI. I'm content with only minimal amount of time working with UI.

The problem is, I feel like it's difficult for me to land a job due to no experience (besides my internship). Should I take a Full Stack position and then move myself somewhere to backend or should I just shoot for the position that I want right now?"

After a few years, I transferred to a CUNY school and graduated spring this year. I've been working full time (unrelated job) while in school to pay for it, so my internship experience is 0. I've been trying to look for one, but it's a rough time for it, even though I'm in NYC. Timing is also pretty bad, with most of them right now being for summer 2021.

Because of the gap in school (5 years) I feel like I'm super behind when it comes to things. I also feel like my degree comes from a just ok school, and coursework wasn't challenging or special enough to show on a resume. I have a very good GPA (3.94), but feel like my actual experience is really lacking. Major imposter syndrome, coupled by feeling behind a lot of my peers due to the gap.

I primarily worked in Java at my first school, so I'm a little rusty on that, and mostly did C/C++ at my last school, but since I jumped in at a higher level I had to basically learn them on my own. I've been doing leetcode to brush up and get back into a programming headspace, but am I better off doing something else like learning a new language? Filling in my gaps in Java/C? Python? React? A lot of what I see as the popular languages weren't really big when I first went to school so this is all brand new to me. Should I try to create a project? Create an open-source offshoot? Really just lost on how I should really maximise my time. Not aiming for a FAANG job, really just want to get in somewhere and start building experience.

They gave me an intro task to allow me to get comfortable with the git workflow. I basically had to change a type in like 500 different locations in this gigantic codebase. It caused alot of bugs that I had to fix. Now I'm having trouble with git and I'll possibly have to go back and redo the entire thing. There is constantly new code being committed which is causing more and more compatibility issues which I have to keep fixing. It feels like a race for who can finalize their code first and not have to deal with merging other people's changes. On top of that, the build system is extremely slow because it has to redo alot of work every time. I feel like I am on the verge of being fired as the other interns are well ahead of me at this point.

I am in my second semester as a grad student. These past few months I really had a chance to think about my future, and I realized that I don't actually like/want to do research, it's just something that I know how to do. I don't even care too much about my thesis topic. I honestly hate grad school a bit right now, and I can barely find the motivation to even go to class anymore. I'm just extremely unhappy and it is showing in my work ethic. I think I had the wrong idea of what grad school would be.


Anyway, a job in the field I know I for sure want to be in just opened, and I am qualified for it. Not only that, the hiring managers were my internship supervisors from last year (they told me to get my application in ASAP) and I have multiple connections within the industry. Going this route will more than likely get me where I need to be in the end, and given that it is a government job, I will have great job security/benefits.

Edit: I guess the reason why I am hesitant to quit is because I 1) don't like quitting, and 2) am worried about burning bridges in case I want to pursue a different master's degree in the future.

I've been really struggling trying to figure out what I should do after I graduate. I know I want to get into a Machine Learning PhD program but I don't know how I would go about doing this.

I've taken classes in linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, diff. eqs., intro A.I., etc., and am currently taking machine learning and deep learning. I also have pretty good grades (I think). The problem is I have ***no research experience.*** I've done projects relating to machine learning, and will probably do more considering the classes I'm in, but no papers.

It's a little to late for me to do research with a professor since I skipped a year (graduating in 3 years rather than 4) and given the current situation its hard to find any research opportunities while being remote.

So, in my naïve and inexperienced view, I see 2 paths:

1. Go to grad school for a machine learning MS, and hopefully get some research experience while I'm there. I looked into this recently and apparently if your ultimate goal is a PhD this doesn't seem to be the best move, especially if you already have a CS/ML background and aren't pivoting from a related area. That and I looked up the tuition cost of the top MS programs in ML (CMU, Berkley, etc.) and holy s\*\*t they are absurdly expensive!
2. Then there's option 2, getting some research experience with an ML internship. This seems to be a better choice since I wouldn't be breaking the bank (and in fact getting paid), it'd be research focused rather than course focused etc. And, maybe, I'll have a leg up since I had an internship (not research) at a big software company last summer.

The problem is, do those research internship positions even exist? It seems most of the positions I find are for MS and PhD students. This makes sense of course, why would you want a kid fresh out of college to work on your research rather than an MS/PhD student. But still, I'm totally unclear on what I should do. I can't find any info online about what people in my position do usually.

1. Do they just suck it up and get a masters?
2. Do they just always have research experience and so don't deal with this?
3. And even if I find a research position it might only be for the summer. In that case I would have to find another one for the year I'm no longer in school yet also not in a PhD program (or maybe just a regular software dev job I guess).

I am a recently graduated (May 2020) ME from an ABET certified school with a 2.93 GPA and no prior internship experience. My primary interests are in machines, fluid mechanics, energy production, CAE/CAD, and the field that always seems to be dealing with these, aerospace, but also I'm not averse to MEP or HVAC. I am not interested in manufacturing, quality engineering etc., but at this point, I'd probably take a job if I could get one. I have been applying for jobs without success, and in the meantime, I have gotten my EIT and am studying for the TFS PE exam.

&amp;#x200B;

Title point:

I have been noticing in my job applications that there is a noticeable gap in the experience levels for which jobs are available. At one end there are the jobs that are seeking currently enrolled students with a GPA of (generally) 3.0 or higher and possibly some related experience. Then there are the jobs for graduates that *require* 1, 2, 5 years of experience in a highly specific field or skill (sometimes also with a required GPA of 3.0 or higher). Positions that are in between these categories, I would say true entry-level positions, are scarce.

I'm applying for jobs anywhere and mostly in the fields I'm interested in, but pretty much always, I am not even meeting the basic requirements for the position, which I frankly feel is not the way of an engineer to apply for jobs one doesn't qualify for. Not to mention the difficulty of sinking so much effort into cover letters for positions that are very likely to reject me without even reading the letter due to not meeting the basic requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions: Do I apply for internships? Do I apply for internships that require one to be currently enrolled? 

To what extent should I be particular with the fields that I apply to, if at all?

What are some ways for me to gain experience? Or do I have all the experience I need to get my first job?

Anyone who has been in this situation, is there any advice you can offer?

I started my career almost two years ago in a multinational company that manufactures industrial equipment. I work at the Research and Product Development Department. I have learned a lot in my job up to now and it seems that my boss believes in my potential. Every day is a new lesson and I still have a lot to learn (really, a lot!). Lately, my responsibilities have been scaling up and today the company Product Portfolio Committee has approved two new product line developments, in which I have been assigned to be the technical coordinator. One project involves some innovation and new product design, the other one is more like an adaptation of a product line for a specific market (Russia).

These two projects add up to some of the responsibilities I already hold. I am coordinating another product line development which I took over at the end of 2019 when the former coordinator moved to another country. I also coordinate a small structural analysis team (2 other engineers and an intern) and a team that develops FEA tools (2 engineers), both of these leadership roles were also assigned to me at the end of 2019. There are also all those small tasks that pops up during the week and have to be done.

So, I'm quite young at the company and I feel like upper management is betting on my development. However, I'm feeling very insecure and all these responsibilities are stacking up to the point where I am starting to feel that if I don't come up with a good methodology to manage many different projects at the same time, I will get overwhelmed and things will start to fall apart.

I wanted to ask for some guidance on how to better organize myself and these projects, how to deal with the daily struggles when you feel lost and don't know how to proceed. Do you have any suggestions on tools or systems for managing many tasks simultaneously? I am trying OneNote and something like a Kanban board, however, I often get lost with many microtasks. I also receive lots of emails from different subjects and this gets me distracted often.

This series of events has somewhat evened the playing field for extracurricular activities, which unfortunately, has given some students an excuse to slack off. Stuck at home, students are feeling powerless, without agency or direction and combined with months of online schooling, they’re probably falling into bad habits. 

As educators and as parents, we need to reshape our assumptions about extracurricular involvement. What was possible in the past may not be possible for months or years to come, and this shift to connecting with others online for work, socializing, or entertainment may become permanent. For high school students, “normal” achievement outside of the classroom needs to be redefined, and we need to try to look for new ways to create a sense of community around interests and goals. Now, more than ever, colleges will be looking at how students dealt with these monumental shifts in their education and the creativity they used to stay engaged in a post-COVID world.

# Why start an online club/community

One of the largest criticisms about distance or online learning is the lack of community feeling or socializing that in-person classes engender. Yes, online platforms can be great for teaching algebra concepts like FOIL or the impact of Lincoln’s Gettysburg address, but it’s not as good in promoting discussion about these lessons or allowing for students to help teach each other when the teacher’s lesson is unclear. 

Online clubs have long been scoffed at as glorified Facebook groups that are even more useless and shallow than those in-person school clubs that don’t accomplish anything (of which every school has many). But this perception certainly needs to change, especially when facing few alternatives for satisfying the void of discussion and socializing that distance learning creates. In this article, I’ll be spelling out, in-depth, how you can create an engaging, well-organized online community or club.

# Choosing a topic/interest to center your club on

The first big decision when starting any kind of club is to decide what your interests and goals are. Is the club focused on starting businesses and learning about entrepreneurship? Is it focused on raising awareness of a social issue? Raising money to help a particular community? Maybe you just want to start a community to talk about film and cinema? Ultimately, you want to start a community that revolves around a *real* interest. While you should be thinking about the practicality of your club’s focus as it relates to college admissions (looking at you, esports clubs), [The Admissions Angle](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2019/01/15/whats-an-admissions-angle/) strategy that you choose to adopt should be based on your passions and your interests in the first place. 

Younger high school students, in particular, should think less about how things will look for college and more about what interest or academic field will hold their attention for the longest time. [Choosing an interest that you’re likely to stick with or likely to receive recognition for will ultimately have the most admissions value down the line](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/07/09/what-makes-an-extracurricular-activity-good/), so it makes sense to allow your interests to dictate your Admissions Angle strategy. 

For older students, you do want to consider more how the club synergizes with the rest of your extracurricular resume. If you’re hoping to apply for biology majors, but you don’t have any activities related to bio, it’s probably best to start an online community related to the subject. If you’re applying as a bio major and you have too many science-related activities and awards, your extracurricular profile might come off as one-dimensional. There might be more value in choosing a club revolving around a hobby or interest that’s not science related. Ultimately, students should make a conscious choice with the direction of their club as it relates to their overall admissions strategy. 

# Demonstrating legitimacy

If you’re creating a club/community online, you want to think about how qualified you are to lead a group of other students. Hopefully, you’re choosing a subject that you already have some expertise or experience in. If you don’t have this yet, start a blog on the subject and spend a few months learning about the topic before you start the club. There should be some online presence that you can point to in order to convince people online that you’re qualified to lead them. 

After choosing the club topic, think about the name of your club. You want to consider names that are interesting and unambiguous, which can be a difficult balance to strike. Rather than “Science Club”, try to narrow down the field a little to “Astronomy/Astrophysics Club” or “Biochemistry Club”. Oftentimes, you just need to narrow down the scope of the club to make it more interesting. But be careful of getting too narrow. A club revolving around quantum physics might sound really interesting to some, but will be hard to find members for. Sometimes, the name of the club can also be related to the competition or event that the club goal is focused on, like “[Bio Olympiad](https://www.usabo-trc.org/) Club”. 

# Setting tangible goals

This brings me to my next point: every club should have clear and tangible goals. Oftentimes this is a specific competition that the club is preparing for. [The Diamond Challenge](https://diamondchallenge.org/) entrepreneurship competition, [a science olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/), [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/), or a math modeling competition. The best clubs have a clear direction from the beginning and this clarity in direction gives a real value proposition for students interested in joining. If your club is more hobby/interest focused, then your goal can be a specific project that the club strives to complete. If it’s community focused, then the goal can be fundraising numbers, hours volunteered, or a number of petitions and signatures to get.  Whatever you choose to be the club’s goals, make sure that it’s clear from the start in any marketing you do to get new club members. 

# Choosing a platform for an online club

There are a number of online platforms that are great for starting clubs or communities. Such platforms include [Edmodo](https://new.edmodo.com/), [spikeview](https://www.spikeview.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), or [RoundPier](https://www.roundpier.com/). They all have different features or reach that make them appealing, but regardless of which platform you choose, make sure to be thinking about what type of student you hope to attract and where you might find them. Online clubs and communities will only be successful if you surround yourself with the right people, and choosing the right platform will better help you align with the right personalities. 

You also should try to take advantage of video conferencing services to get some face-to-face interaction with members. While it’s not the same as actual in-person meetings, video conferencing can still help to build rapport with members and actually get to know them personally. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Google Meets](https://meet.google.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) and a number of other services can accomplish this without having to pay subscription costs. 

# Assembling your leadership team

Any entrepreneur will tell you how important it is to surround yourself with quality people. This is also true for high school clubs or just life in general. It’s impossible to accomplish anything of magnitude by yourself, so if you have ambitious goals, you’ll need help. Your leadership team should be the first people you turn to for ideas, solutions, and support throughout the difficult process of running a successful club, so you want to make sure to align yourself with the right people.

First, you’ll want to think about any friends in your current social circles who already are interested in your club topic. Starting a CS related club? Think about talking to your programmer friends. Starting an underground school literary magazine? Talk to your artistic/creative writing friends. Having at least one or two reliable friends on your leadership team can go a long way in setting a solid foundation for an online club, as online interaction with people can be a little less reliable than in-person. 

If you don’t have any friends with aligned interests, you’ll want to go through a somewhat rigorous screening process when looking for student leaders to fill out your ranks. There are certain platforms that make it easier to do this than others. As mentioned before, spikeview was designed with online clubs in mind. If you find fellow students on the platform through interest groups and start chatting with some students there, it’s just one easy step to share your spikeview profile with each other and get a great look at their high school resume.

If you’re not using [spikeview](https://www.spikeview.com/), other social media platforms will sometimes give you some insight into a student’s interests. If you find them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), or online communities, you can usually see their post/tweet histories and determine what a user is involved in. You’ll have to dig a little deeper and through a user’s social posts or images, but look for any corroboration of interests in your club topic. After you’re confident that someone might be a good fit, contact them to ask for a resume and set up a conference call. Treat the interaction as an interview and have questions ready to ask about the students involvement and expertise. Ask specific questions about items on their resume and make sure they can explain their role in those activities. 

When deciding on who to recruit for your leadership team, try to think about the roles that you hope to fill. For online clubs, it can be really useful to have someone on your team who is comfortable with technology. To properly run online meetings, you may want to use platforms like Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts for meetings. You may want to create a website for your club, so having someone who can also build web pages or is literate in HTML/CSS can be beneficial. You’ll also most likely want to recruit a student to handle the finances of the club, with some experience with accounting for an organization or with creating a balance sheet. You’ll also want a right hand man/woman who is just reliable. The COO to your CEO, who is flexible and can help with a variety of tasks. They should be someone who can just get things done. 

There are a number of other roles that you can fill, depending on the scope of your club, but it’s important to think about the roles/responsibilities for your leadership team members. Later on, you’ll want to divide responsibilities between your leadership team so that you can reach for higher goals. Some of these responsibilities might include keeping meeting minutes, organizing email lists/newsletters, managing the website, outreach to other organizations, putting together Powerpoint/Google slides, etc. 

**\*\*Note: Don’t forget to explicitly mention to students that their leadership role in the online club will help with their college admissions resume.**

# Planning for weekly meetings

Once you get a core group of student leaders, it’s time to start preparing for club meetings and projects. The online club experience is different from in-person in that it’s harder to keep members and even leadership team members accountable. Attendance and assignments can be easy to blow off if you’re hundreds of miles away from the rest of the group. The best way to keep an online group engaged and accountable is for the leaders of the club to set a good example. This means doing your best to be consistent and accountable yourself. If you as the club leader are rescheduling meetings every week or forgetting to send out email updates, you can’t expect your club members to be accountable. 

The other factor that will help students to take the online club seriously is the level of organization that you show. This involves club materials, leadership roles, expectations, preparing Powerpoint/Google slides, and sending professional emails/messages. If you put in the effort to make the club as legitimate as possible, students will resonate with that and also put in the effort. 

One of the first things you can prepare is a semester-long club meeting plan, which should be a rough schedule of lecture topics, projects, speakers, competition preparation, and socializing. For lecture materials, borrow information and slides from online courses related to your course topic. For projects, think of fun, inexpensive activities that students can collaborate on virtually. This could be contributing to a blog with guest posts from club members, collaborating on building a website, organizing a literary magazine, a [Github](https://github.com/) project, collecting signatures for a political/social/environmental cause, and so many other possibilities. For speakers, try to find local professionals in the field that your club revolves around: professors, business leaders, local politicians, or professionals. The more time and effort you spend in planning your club activities and weekly agendas, the more successful it will be. 

On top of planning weekly agendas, you should think about putting together Powerpoint/Google slides for meetings. While video conference meetings can help with getting to know your club members, you’ll need other visual aids to teach, inform, inspire, and entertain your club mates, the last of which is often overlooked. You should always plan your club meetings with some type of fun activity, video, gifs, jokes, or memes included. You want your members to look forward to your meetings!

# Now you’re ready to start your online club

As we look to the future, we see that leadership in an online setting is an increasingly valuable asset. Moreover, the ability to be adaptable in the face of unexpected disaster, such as Covid-19, demonstrates grit, flexibility, and ultimately, promise in the eyes of the admissions officer. If you take this opportunity to shine, admissions officers will take note.

iy0qjw,6,2020-09-22,Stuck In a Useless Internship,DataPhiks,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/iy0qjw/stuck_in_a_useless_internship/,"A little background: This past summer was the summer between my junior and senior year of college which meant I had just one opportunity left to secure an internship for myself.  I'm seeking a career in data science, analytics, business intelligence, or whichever buzzword you prefer to use...and I have a strong background in statistics and programming.  I marketed this heavily and eventually found an ""analyst"" position with a small company with several clients they represent.

When the summer finally came around, I quickly realized this position was not the right fit for myself.  First of all -- with the company being so small -- there isn't even an ""analytics"" department so to speak.  Furthermore, it is hopelessly disorganized.  Almost 100% of the work is done in Excel...and absolutely none of it has been automated in any form or fashion.  This means that in the event work needs to be handed off, you typically get someone else's Excel file which is an absolute disaster and takes forever to decipher. 

So, me being the ""analytics"" intern, the company thought a great project for me would be to work on their monthly reporting which gets handed out to clients.  I took this as a great opportunity to finally put up some standard procedures within the organization, and was able to fully automate their reports using Excel's Power Query functionality and designing a file structure to be used on the companies network.  ""Wow!"" -- they said -- ""I didn't even know that was possible!""

Of course it's possible -- it's 2020 you nitwit -- other companies did this years ago.

Anyways, I did ""such good work"" that they extended me a sizable pay raise and even a nice little bonus check as incentive to keep me on while school started up again.  I'm back in school now and am working remote part-time.  It all sounds great right? Well...here's my concern...

Since there is no analytics department at this company -- and because I am the only one who really knows how these reports work -- I've pretty much painted myself into a corner as the ""report monkey.""  I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.  My entire job is basically to build and automate whatever shiny new report they can dream up, tweak the old ones whenever they feel like they want to change something (usually to frame the data to look better...terrible ethics), or to simply run the reports as they become due.  This is such a colossal waste of the skills I have, and also a tremendous waste of time in my eyes.  I feel as though my time would be better spent simply working on personal projects to pad my portfolio a bit to try a land a job that will actually make use of my skill set.  Despite me being the ""analyst"" I have still never so much as done anything beyond compute grand totals or simple averages.  Such a joke!

I really, really want to walk away from this disaster, but I also know that If I leave the place will have no idea how to deliver their reports to their clients.  Furthermore,  I feel like it would leave a bad taste in their mouths given that I just got a pretty big bonus (for which there were no strings attached).  Typically I would try to line something else up before leaving; at least that way they couldn't hold a grudge.  With me being in school, however, I have absolutely no time between working this ridiculous job and studying.  As someone pursuing a career in data, I feel that it would be career suicide to stay at this place -- after all -- nobody there even understands how I do what I do!  How am I supposed to learn if there is nobody to teach me!?  Why in the world are you hiring interns if you have nothing to offer!?

I would really appreciate some advice here.  This is my first time dipping my toe in the corporate world and I'm really not sure how to navigate these waters.  Your wisdom is greatly appreciated!"

I have a dilemma on my hands. I am a 20-something female working on finishing my undergraduate electrical engineering degree at my local public university in California. 

I transferred in from my local community college (after much effort and a few major-relevant internships with no publications) because of my financial situation (one kid in a large family with an ill parent where I was the primary caregiver; my primary goal was to finish undergraduate education with minimum to no student loans). 

In my first semester, I earned a \~3.8 GPA. 

In the subsequent year, my ill parent passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. I did my best to honor my parent's dying wish and attempted to use my grief as fuel to finish my degree coursework. As one might imagine, this did not work out too well. Especially when my direct academic advisors essentially ignored me when I emailed them for help with mortuary documentation as proof. 

My GPA basically collapsed by one whole point to 2.8 before I could find out how to take a temporary leave without jeopardizing my place in the program. I was gone for a year to recover from the burnout and from my grief.

I thought that I had recovered sufficiently in 1 year, only to be forced into living in my commuter car for two semesters when the local infrastructure power outages began in full force last fall and everything outside my personal control that could possibly go wrong did. I burned the candle at both ends and then some to simultaneously stay safe with housing and food insecurity and pass my courses when possible.

I even stayed enrolled throughout the COVID-19 quarantine, where I managed to get my GPA up to Good standing (\~2.8).

I am in my senior year with a cumulative GPA of approximately 2.7, and trying to figure out if I even have a chance at applying for graduate school in STEM because of everything that is going on globally, and because of the series of unfortunate events that is my personal existence.

Additionally, my university academic advisers are currently too understaffed from COVID to directly address many of my current concerns.

What do you think of my chances for graduate school? 

What do you recommend I should do to make the most of my senior year where most of the professors in my major have also long refused any of my attempts to assist them in their research to gain engineering research experience because they refuse to take undergraduate students?

Contextual Note: Whenever I meet with any researcher or professor outside of my university and talk to them in person about different research topics, they are astonished and disbelieving when I tell them that I am not already a graduate student. I have also been offered multiple research opportunities outside of my current university, that I end up not being able to take because of the fact I am an undergraduate student with not much financial flexibility.

Thanks for any suggestions you can give me, and I am happy to DM for any questions you may have.

Best, Magnetess"

I was struggling at first, but over spring break I sat down and started reading through my text book and began to understand how programming actually worked more and more. Over the summer, I started building basic projects, learned a little bit of python, got my feet wet in html, and started applying for internships for next summer. 

Now that I'm about a month into my second semester, I realize that there's still a lot about programming I don't understand. I get the basic concepts of what a data structure is, and what object oriented programming is, but I still struggle to put that understanding into practice. I have trouble finding solutions to problems through deduction and reasoning, and usually have to go for help. I'm good at finding out what I have to do, but struggle to actually translating what I have to do into code. 

On top of that, I'm getting mixed messages on what I should be studying in order to be successful in the industry. I've heard that implementing data structures is important from some people, but that it is unimportant from others. 

And then there's things like Node.js, Gradle, SQL, Github, and other important languages, frameworks, platforms, etc. that I don't really understand. I'm honestly very overwhelmed and don't know what I should be focusing on right now. I want to be a programmer, but I'm struggling to find a way to go about it."

My GPA is really weak, but I have some other (hopefully) strong stuff to make up for it. Ideally, I'd get a top 20 program, but I'm fine with just about anywhere where I can find a prolific research faculty member in my area (networks and PLs, mainly, but also tangentially interested in databases).

My main goal is to have a stellar resume when I graduate from my MS program -- that way, I can feasibly shoot for HPS or UPenn for my PhD. If I don't complete my PhD, and I go work in the software industry in a service role instead of an R&amp;D role, the degree wouldn't be of much tangible use anyway.

School: Rutgers University

Majors: CS, Math

GPA: 3.2 cumulative, 3.5-3.6 both majors

This warrants an explanation. I had severe mental health issues my underclassman years, so I got one C in a 200-level CS class and two C+s in 200-level math classes. The rest have been mostly As, but one or two odd B+s in each. Other than that, I've taken graduate-level classes with special permission from instructors (all As in these).

GRE: Taking them in November, aiming for 330+ total score (I'm going to study myself to the bone until then).

Extracurricular Activities: Two SWE internships, one at MongoDB and the other at FB. Grad classes are also very code-heavy (networks, PLs, databases).

Do I have a shot at a shot to get into a Top 20 program? Once again, this would be ideal, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it."

\- only taking 12 units but one of my classes is cse 167 which I've heard is a time sink

\- doing a couple codepath courses just bc I'm interested (\~9-15 hrs/week, could drop if necessary)

iy8e4w,5,2020-09-23,Working with interns/masters students during the PhD,goatsnboots,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/iy8e4w/working_with_internsmasters_students_during_the/,"I have a year and a half left of my PhD (in human-computer interaction). There are a lot of things I want to be able to do before the end, and I'm (1) concerned that I won't have time for everything, and (2) I'm concerned that I won't be able to pull off one of them (it involves an experiment in the local language here that I am not yet comfortable with). 


My institution encourages PhD students to take on interns from the masters program to help them with their research, and I have been pushing for an intern for a few months now. Typically this person implements the ideas of the PhD student and takes the place of the second author on any published papers. However, my project has $0 left and therefore cannot afford to pay an intern for me. There are unpaid interns, but I've heard that any unpaid interns typically keep looking for a new position and often leave halfway through the project (this is totally reasonable in my opinion). Also, I worked with two students previously and it was a disaster - they didn't do what I asked them to do, they were difficult to communicate with, and it ended up being a total waste of my time. After talking to some of my peers, I've heard that even the paid interns can be very difficult to work with because they are graded on a final presentation rather than what they've actually accomplished. So I'm worried that I won't be able to find an intern, that any intern I do find won't stick around, and that they may be completely unhelpful.


An idea that has occurred to me is to use students from my previous institution where I did my masters. There, the masters students actually complete a thesis with a company or organization, which is unpaid, rather than completing an internship (these can be the same thing, as they were in my case, but the idea is that the students are graded on their actual work and contributions). I was thinking about contacting my old institution and running a few project ideas by them to see if their masters students would be interested (they would be choosing projects between now and next April or May or so). In this case, any published research would result in them being the first author, me being the second author, and our respective supervisors taking the last places, right?


As a side note, I am currently helping an old colleague of mine on his paper by carrying out an experiment that he's not able to carry out. We don't share the same institution, and the work has been cleared by both of our supervisors. I'll be taking the second-author place whenever he publishes.


Has anyone done anything like this - used the help of a student from another institution in their research? I'm seeing it happen right now with my other colleague, but is this typically done? Am I right in assuming an intern who completes the work I give them gets second author place while a student who heads their own research in my project gets the first author place? I'd need to talk to my own supervisors about this of course, but has anyone been able to use a non-first author publication as part of their external committee meetings, defense, etc. as proof of contributions?"
iy8nws,2,2020-09-23,How do I stop undermining myself during job interviews?,chloapsoap,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/iy8nws/how_do_i_stop_undermining_myself_during_job/,"I’m graduating this semester. Career fair season is about to kick in, and this is going to be my last chance to attend an event like this. I’ve been spending the past two weeks brushing up on my technical knowledge in certain areas, but I still feel pretty unprepared.

I’ve noticed I have a really bad habit of downplaying my accomplishments during interviews, and I feel like I’m shooting myself in the foot. I know I have the knowledge and skills to be successful in the industry, and I feel like I have really strong soft-skills as well in the professional environments I’ve been in. This is always what I want to express during my interviews, but it never comes out properly.

My GPA is sub-standard. I struggled with loneliness and depression during my junior year and in the beginning of my senior year. I’m seeing a therapist, and we’ve made a lot of progress, but none of this is going to change what’s on my transcript. 

On top of that, my only professional experience in CS was an 8-month co-op I had following my sophomore year. I was wildly inexperienced at the time, and I struggled a lot throughout my time there. I was the youngest intern they had, and I was given a project substantially more difficult than my peers (according to the senior dev who mentored me). I ended up completing it, but the amount of turbulence I experienced makes it hard for me to talk about it with pride. I’m substantially more knowledgeable now (and if I were given the same project again I think I could easily do it), but it still sticks out in my head as a mark of shame.

I can feel myself bombing in interviews when I talk about these things. The sad part is that my intentions are pure. I pride myself in being a straight-shooter, and I want to give the most authentic answers I can during an interview. But this is a problem when I authentically just feel like a bungler. 

Part of me acknowledges my accomplishments. I’ve fought tooth-and-nail in order to get this degree. I’ve brought myself back from the brink of flunking and I’m respected among my peers in spite of it. I kept fighting when even my friends with better transcripts than mine were jumping ship. It wasn’t the most graceful academic journey, but it’s mine, and I’ll be so proud of myself for it once it’s over.

In my eyes, my experiences don’t really lend themselves to highlighting my intelligence or charisma so much as my tenacity and grit. I think they’re valuable qualities in their own right, but they’re not exactly glamorous to talk about. I always feel like I’m just painting myself as a clown when I talk about how many banana peels I’ve slipped on. I really really don’t want to give that impression. But I don’t want to be disingenuous either.

Has anyone had a similar experience? What ended up working for you? I would really appreciate some insight on this."

What should I do to get more opportunities at big tech in the U.S.?

As a fresh may 2020 graduate, I only recently decided to go to grad school. I mention this because as an undergrad, I didn't focus as much on research as I should have. I didn't get published or do any posters or anything like that, unfortunately. Here's what I actually did:

1. In sophomore year, I did an internship at a research institution. Unfortunately, kind of squandered my time there; my internship project was basically googling autopilots and making an excel sheet, and I learned python in my freetime. Didn't really do any real research there until like the last 2 weeks, where my boss gave me a unique engineering problem to solve. I came up with something and actually did have to learn some new concepts on my own (catenary equations for example), but I have no idea if my work was worth crap since my internship ended as soon as I turned in my code

2. Academic extracurricular with drones. I worked with ROS and Gazebo to make simulations, but I'm not sure this counts as research. Sure, I had to do a lot of self learning and come up with solutions that weren't done before, but it's not like I did any literature research or published academic papers. I did help write a research paper and we won best paper at a competition; my contribution was kind of minimal though, like 4 paragraphs. 

3. Actual research in a computational group. However, my work was much more mechanical and electrical than computational, unfortunately. Designing a relatively complex arduino circuit, developing arduino code, writing some MATLAB/python to gather data, soldering, doing solidworks stuff, etc. However, my research did count for a computational research project for my computational science certificate, so that's good.

With that said, do items 1, 2, and 3 give me a good enough research background to be able to get into good research programs related to my desired field, computational atmospheric science? I know that's kind of vague, still trying to find out what research I actually want to specifically do, but that's the general idea for me right now. What do you all think?

P.S. Don't want to make multiple threads so I have a question about the GRE. A lot of schools are waiving it, but a few of the programs I'm looking at have the GRE scores as ""optional."" The GRE will take up a lot of time, money, and stress, so I'd rather not take it if I have to. Should I take it anyway, or not? I figure I might as well take it for grants, as grants seem to still require the GRE. Thoughts on that?

Thank you!"

What can I do to make myself a stronger candidate with going to graduate school?,throwawayAEpatent2,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iyc5r4/im_feeling_like_i_have_to_give_up_my_search_soon/,"[I posted my resume over here. Feel free to take a look at where I am so far.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/iybs2i/graduated_dec_2019_have_not_received_a_callback/?)

It's abundantly clear to me I have no chance of standing out from anyone applying for these jobs. Graduated Dec 2019 BSME. I can't even get hired a fucking factory job doing technician work. I'm stuck in this stupid retail job. No internships or industry experience at all. 

What can I do to become a stronger candidate for engineering jobs? I'm studying Japanese to try to attain N5 fluency. I've done quite a bit the last few months studying Japanese and I think I'm fairly close to completing all the stuff I need to learn in the next 2 or so months. I'm also trying to study for the patent bar I'm trying to take by the end of Dec (though I'll probably have to put the testing date off for a bit longer). Lastly, I'm trying to figure what parts I need to build a CAD/programming workstation on a budget (using planning on using Solidworks, OnShape and Fusion 360), also including a build-it-yourself 3D printer in the budget also (looking for suggestions on those, I saw a $250 printer a while ago but forgot the name). I haven't put any CAD work in my resume at all because I've literally done none. I have knowledge of how the programs work, but not any professional or hobby work.
 
Here's what I want to do:

* I want to specialize in patent law down the road (definitely as a patent examiner), but if not, I'd like to switch over to computer science.
* PLC programming is definitely in my near future 100%, after I complete the patent bar.
* Programming is definitely the next focus for me.
* I don't know if I should try to get the FE certification. I'm thinking of going to graduate school for computer engineering or computer science, but it's not in the cards whatsoever because I have no money.
* I also want to immigrate to Canada or somewhere that's not US within the next 7 years or so (ideally within 5). I'm kind of stuck here with my home under my name at the moment.

What can I do to strengthen my chances in those aspects? I have a BSME, so I'd figure that's probably the best thing to do in the short term to get experience but yeah, no fucking callbacks or anything. Should I just give up on the search completely and just try to focus on those now?"
iycm0r,2,2020-09-23,"Finishing mechanical engineering but comp-sci/coding /etc interest me (Long text, TLDR at the end)",coscorrodrift,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/iycm0r/finishing_mechanical_engineering_but/,"So, I'm a 23yo final year mech. engineering student from Spain, and I have a subject and my thesis left to finish my degree. I'm also doing an internship at the R&amp;D department of an aeronautical company (well it's a consulting company but at the aerospace department).

I've been quite unsatisfied with everything and kinda stressed out because the subject i have left is taught in a way that i really dislike, my thesis' tutors are kinda off the grid atm and that front is looking very unclear, i'm going to have a lot of workload in a student association i'm part of very soon and the vibe at my internship makes me feel useless, but still keeps me busy and drains me of mental energy because i'm supposed to do X hours and be reachable during those hours. 

The first two I can deal with, the 3rd thing is something i kinda put myself in that's firing back on me that could be worse but the 4th thing is just what really  grinds my gears at the moment. 

I'm in a project that has just started so we're defining the requirements, but everything is so abstract that everything i do to define something just seems to me like it's a waste of time. I got into the internship in the R&amp;D department because I wanted to learn some CFD and some other skills in projects that are less critical (R&amp;D, not flying anytime soon), but what I've been doing is basically doing basic ass calculations and dimensioning and that feels very useless. My idea was to be useless to the world (do calculations that are not going anywhere since it's an R&amp;D project) while I grow (learning skills that will eventually be used in real projects, maybe), but so far it's been being useless to the world while I don't learn anything, because while I've had to do some research on things that aren't in my field (aerospace stuff, I'm mech eng), the calculations are so basic that i feel like i'm not learning anything of value or doing any calculations that are interesting in any way.

This particular frustration , and also some dissatisfaction i've been carrying for mechanical engineering in general since a couple years ago when I failed a ton of subjects due to in part stuff that was my fault, but also to not being able to feel interested for the subjects, have led me to the classic ""self-exploration"" state of mind with which ,I guess, this subreddit tries to help deal.

In this self-exploration thing, I've noticed that while I did enroll in mechanical engineering because cars are my main passion, I'm not that good at solving engineering problems, and that I'm not really interested in the way those problems are solved in the first place either. I thought the engineering process was much more ""pure"" than it actually is, with each stage from concept to final production very connected to each other, but my little experience in the field just gives me a sensation of every stage being very separated from its previous stage, with entirely different people, different interests, etc etc. Maybe places like Singer Engineering or ICON 4x4 do their work in a way more like I thought it was, but those are very limited offerings, plus far away. I also thought that maybe going narrow could be a solution, that's why I chose this internship, because my theory was that I could learn some CFD and see if I enjoy that type of workflow and get very into CFD/fluid mechanics so I can work on something related to combustion in cars or maybe aerodynamics, stuff like that. 

I've also noticed that the places where I did my best, and felt most comfortable in, were the subjects or activities where coding was involved, and I felt useful then. I felt like I could tackle the challenges, even if they were ""useless"" like the classic coding class problems are. That doesn't mean i'm a computer genius, I struggle to do simple shit like installing OpenFOAM on windows using the command line (and basically anything linux related), and I'm not like those people on youtube videos that learn coding by themselves and do cool shit like Michael Reeves' robots, or people who code their own apps/games, etc... 

And I included Comp-Sci too because I also like the theory of computing, I'm not very well versed in it but there's some interesting stuff there, I've read some articles and watched some podcasts about computing ""laws"", like Moore's, or 
Amdahl's and Gustaffson's, and they have something that's very interesting to me, they're specific in a way, but they make you think in a kind of universal way that seems like could apply to everything. I know that podcasts and articles are meant to be interesting and are not the same as an actual comp-sci class but the same could be said about mechanical engineering podcasts and classes and i don't really listen to any of those.


In this situation I'm now doubting if my decision of testing the fluid mechanics/CFD waters (hehe) was wrong even though I still haven't gotten to actually test those waters and if I should give up that path that's looking less promising in the future (combustion engines are going to be around for sure, but the path to reaching those positions aren't clear to me, and don't seem that profitable), and go into compsci/software engineering , where I could tackle actual problems while also making decent money (even here in Spain apparently).

My main doubt is that I don't know if I've given up too easily without having even had barely any engineering experience, and that compsci/programming will be the same, because it's a ""me"" thing, and I'm the problem, my attitude in those fields would wind up being the same as it is right now and I'd just get disillusioned with that field too. 

Then the follow-up questions would be what route to take in each scenario:

- If I go the compsci/software engineering route, what should I do? Comp-sci degree sounds the most interesting to me, but it also sounds like the longest route, at least 3 years more of university, and I don't really know what computer scientists actually do. I think I'm more familiar with what software engineers do, and maybe I should consider that way and start self-learning and get some certification from like Azure or Amazon or whatever company and apply for jobs that need those certs.

- If I stay on the engineering lane, should I strive towards something that I feel I'm more aligned with like a Singer or Icon 4x4 equivalent closer to me? Or maybe I should keep with my original plan and do that? Try to actually get some CFD internship barely earning money and trying to climb that ladder?

Maybe there's intermediate solutions that I'm not considering. 


________________________
TL;DR: Disillusioned final year mechanical engineering student with some interest towards comp-sci/coding/software engineering. Not sure if I should stay on my lane and go the engineering internship route or if I should switch to the computers route, and what exactly I would do to not feel disillusioned in that new computers route."

Wanted to ask, from your experience, do cloud sec and/or DevOps teams usually accept fresh out of college graduates? If so, that way I can spend my free time working on projects/certs that relate to this field.

Thank you"

I'll go live on beach and sell ice cream for all I care and just try to be happy. In 2020, I got laid off (and 300 job applications and the start of a master's program I still am unemployed), my brother passed away suddenly at 23, and I moved back in with my mother in my hometown, leaving my boyfriend across the country. Not to mention the general horribleness that is the pandemic and the state of the government/politics. 

I had started an online master's program in a liberal arts field, and doing online school feels like such a waste right now, especially since I can't even get an unpaid internship. For once in my life, I feel like I'm ready to do something that will make me happy. Life is too short, as cliche as that sounds. I can't stand the thought of working a 9-5 desk job that I hate when my brother died at 23. Life is too effing short. The problem, I'm having a hard time figuring out what would make me happy. I've included some info below that is relevant, but I'm just curious if anyone has any suggestions. I am literally willing to start from scratch/nothing, because like I said it feels like nothing matters anymore

My goals with a career are the following:

1. Good work life balance, I don't want to live to work
2. Ability to use my brain and critical thinking skills
3. Lots of time off or at least flexible scheduling
4. Decent pay (I personally define this as a median salary of $60,000 or more)
5. Ability to do something that contributes positively to society
6. Something that could be done in many places (my partner has more specific geographic needs with his job)
7. Something that isn't just a desk job, I prefer to be up and moving at least a little bit

My interests:

1. I love budgeting and crunching numbers
2. I love being helpful and feeling like my work is tangible
3. I like working with people, especially children
4. I like writing and I'm pretty good at it"

iym0mz,119,2020-09-23,MBA Interview Prep - The Complete Guide,MBAPrepCoachcom,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/iym0mz/mba_interview_prep_the_complete_guide/,"**How Do I Prepare for My MBA Interviews?**

I believe the key to success with this whole MBA admissions thing is research. **Research yourself, research your goals, and research the school**. In that order.

&amp;#x200B;

**Research Yourself:** 

Spend some time in self-reflection, understanding your strengths and weaknesses, knowing what culture best suits you, understanding your values, and knowing your USP – unique selling proposition. Identify your brand, meaning what you are known for and deliver in every setting.

This knowledge is what imparts depth and feeling to both your essays and interview responses. Some people say they don't want the coaching, only help with their essays. However, without introspection behind them, essays become robotic and superficial. These kinds of responses will not make adcom root for you. Like all aspects of this process, the objective is to **help them get to know you**. And in order to do that, **you must know yourself**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Research Your Goals:** 

Make LinkedIn your friend, big time. Think of yourself as a product and the recruiter as your buyer. How will you position yourself to make the sale? What do you have in your background that lends itself to your post-MBA role? What do you still need?

You can make a lame attempt at trying to figure this out, but why not go to the source? **Do informational interviews**. This always goes a very long way with the admissions committee and shows them you are a serious person. They don't want to work with students who just ""pitch it over the fence"" and make *your* dreams *their* responsibility. Taking initiative now will position you as someone who will partner with career services rather than become a problem for them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Research the Schools:**

They want to know they can help you achieve your goals. For example, if you apply to INSEAD in September batch and your goal is Investment Banking, well then you didn't research your goals well enough to know you need an internship. September batch does not feature an internship, and so they will have to say ""no"" because they can't help you. Another instance might be to give a goal in real estate when the school has no substantial curriculum on that industry.

Interviewers consider themselves as gatekeepers, screening who wants to become part of their family. This is a long-term relationship and they want to make sure your head is in the right place and you share their values. Applicants massively underestimate how different one program is to the next; their culture, values, and orientation. Knowing these things and weaving them into your interview will **open their heart to you**. You *want* this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now that you’ve** **done this research, you are ready to prepare talking points.** It takes a lot of work to make it look easy. Some decide to wing it so as not to sound rehearsed. I hear candidates promote this approach a lot more before their interview than after, if you know what I mean.

We all know they are going to ask you the standards: why MBA, why now, what are your goals, why this school, so the interviewer expects you to have your $hit together. Have your story straight – it’s much better to have a planned response, as long as you deliver it slowly and thoughtfully. This allows you to make eye contact and build rapport than looking constipated as you struggle to find an answer. 

**Summarize your stories into 2-minutes each**. Have at least an idea of what you might say for all the questions you find in interview debriefs. Focus on the communication objective: getting your USP across, what are you known for and how do you tend to add value? Prepare a story about your role in teams, how you have led others without having direct authority over them.

**When discussing your anecdotes, rehearse them on camera for time and edit yourself.** Use the [STAR](https://mbaessaycoaching.com/b/how-do-i-write-an-mba-goals-essay) method – touch on all parts of the STAR – but make it focused. Think targeted rather than comprehensive. This is not an autobiography but a story to illustrate something interesting about you. Ask yourself, ""what do I hope for them to take away from this story?"" Leave out any details that aren't essential to illustrating your claim and stay under 2 minutes (aside from ""walk me through your resume"" or ""tell me about yourself, where 4 or 5 minutes is passable).

**Check in with your interviewer**. If they have an open posture and seem engaged, great, but if you see their attention wane or deviate, ask if you are answering the question, if this is the kind of information they were after. Give them a chance to stop you and get you on the right track. The last thing you want to do is ignore their body language and doggedly plow through responses.

**In your response, have a claim and then a story to substantiate that claim**. For example, you tend to leverage everything you learn for the benefit of the whole office, by teaching/training/mentoring. Then give them a compelling example. You have to illustrate your point quickly; you don’t have a 500-word essay to do it. 

**Remember milestones, not words**. Do not script things. Rather, prepare talking points but allow yourself to speak extemporaneously with regard to them. The milestones act as cue cards to keep things flowing as you move from one part of the story to the next.

**Prepare thoughtful questions for the interviewer**. Google your interviewer and check out their LinkedIn profile. Choose questions that are attuned to their background. For example, if they are the Diversity Recruiter, inquire about that. Many applicants think this is about gathering information. In part, yes, but the larger opportunity is to establish rapport.

**Which you do by touching on topics that would resonate with them.** How would they define the culture of the school? What was their most memorable moment in the program? What qualities make someone a Boothie, Sloanie, GSBer, etc.? What might separate one of their graduates from those of other schools? Show genuine curiosity and ask open-ended questions that will stimulate a meaningful exchange.

**Finally, send a thank you note within 24 hours**, if you have their contact information. Show gratitude for what you learned from them! Mention how it developed your understanding of the program and how you feel there is a fit. If you stumbled on any questions, consider clarifying information that you might have left out in the moment.

They might or might not respond; don't panic if they do not. They might want to avoid appearing biased. And at that point, it is best to focus on other interviews or applications. Trust you did your best and move on. Worrying never increases your chances. Create options for yourself and find ways to keep your mind off things."
iym5xc,2,2020-09-23,How am I suppose to deal with communication problems with my new boss/tech lead?,WellOFortune,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/iym5xc/how_am_i_suppose_to_deal_with_communication/,"I've been working as an intern at a company instead of going back to university this semester. Up until now I've liked it more than I expected to. I'm usually more into hardware, but because they won't let interns onsite with covid, I'm doing software. For the past three months, it's definitely taken some adapting, but it's been good. Our structure is we have a team lead and a tech lead. The team lead helps with organizational stuff. The tech lead helps with the tech stuff.

My old tech lead got promoted, and she was brilliant and totally deserves it. I am happy for her, but I am completely miserable dealing with her replacement. I don't even have to work with him that closely. I just need feedback on my projects. The thing is he's only been doing it three weeks and I've cried twice from the frustration of it. I'm not usually emotional like this. I've been working here since june without any problems. I'm just at my wits end interacting with him. It's so exhausting. I know for him it's a new job. He's obviously going through a learning curve. And I should be more patient. I just don't know if this is something that will ever get better.

My specific complaints with him are that he doesn't seem to hear anything I say. We are working remotely, so I understand it's harder, but I haven't had trouble like this with anyone else. Some examples, we use a tool to show only the changes when we update our code. I need to get my changes reviewed by him. While in the review process, another developer edited the same code I did. The tool made it look like I made all the changes. I figured out how to use the tool to only show my changes. I messaged him on ms teams explaining how and why and I also left a note in the tool itself. The next time he looked at my work, he left a lot of comments and feedback on the parts I didn't do which wasted a whole review cycle. I don't just say stuff because I like to hear myself talk. He needs to know it, and it makes it harder that I can't seem to get the message across.

Another example, on ms teams I shared my screen and walked through my project. About a week later(mere hours before the hard deadline), he asked me a fundamental question that honestly made it seem like it was the first time he ever looked at it. Even though I brought it up at least once a day either directly or at our daily meeting that I needed feedback on this project. 

We change direction constantly. I had four different versions of the project I was working on based on updates throughout the week. I was suppose to have a hard deadline by last friday at 7pm. I was given a new direction to go in on friday at noon. I obviously didn't meet the deadline(still haven't, don't know if I ever will). 

I have trouble understanding the feedback he gives. English is my first language and his I believe, but I don't understand anything he says. I have spend hours, I wish I was exaggerating, just trying to understand what he wants from me without even getting to implementing it. His comments are full sentences that contain thoughts, but not ones that make sense in the context of my projects. I usually respond with all the information I have, but it seems to only make it worse.

When I do understand it, it realize it's kind of inconsequential/nit picky. For example, in one section of the code, we identify the type of error. If it is a warning, we log it. In another section of the code that we only get to if we have too many errors to handle, we also log it regardless of whether it's a warning or something else. He said that was very confusing. So even though this wasn't apart of my project and already written and reviewed, I made something called a warning handler for the first part of the code...that just logs the error....exactly like the original code did. And he was much happier with this second version that wasn't different from the first in any meaningful way.

I'm an intern, and they've said I can come back and intern again next summer, but the idea of working for him makes me not want to do it. Which is crazy, because I should be ecstatic about potential job IN a pandemic where companies are struggling right now. I like so much about this job. I feel like the company really cares about their employees and they have a lot of early career developmental opportunities. 

But today he left more feedback that I looked at for an hour, called my dad and read it to him to see if it made any sense to him(it didn't), and cried because I'm so exhausted and tired and I can't do this anymore. Part of this has been venting, but I really need help. Please."

After watching posts for a few application cycles, I know the program has gotten more competitive over the years and wanted to know what I could do to stand out. 

For reference, I bounced around to several schools early on due to financial problems/family conflict but still had good grades (3.6). After arriving at my current school, I've been excelling in my International Relations major (3.9) and had some good work experiences and internships. The main reason I'm looking towards this program is because of a potential job in intelligence, but to move up at all, they want people to have substantial knowledge of cyber security and computer science in general. 

Anyway, I am mostly wondering if my transferring multiple times early on looks bad even if I've done well at my current school. Would love to hear from any non-traditional applicants."

I rubbed my eyes and slowly turned to find the attendant stooped over next to me,  whispering.  I wasn't sure if I was actually awake or if this was a dream.  

""What are you talking about?"" I whispered back in reply, still wiping the sleep from my eyes. Then I looked over at my wife. She was still asleep, as was my son. The attendant tapped me on the shoulder.  ""Your Mother-In-Law.  You knew she was a chemist when she was young. It is time you knew more about her, and her role in the fight for human survival."" 

I sat my chair up from the flat, sleeping position. ""Her role?"" I replied loudly. The attendant placed his finger over his mouth to shush me. ""Come with me."" He motioned for me to follow. I stood up from my chair and walked with him to the window. We gazed out into space for a moment, then he faced me, and continued.

I shook my and shrugged ""So what?"" The attendant moved closer and tilted his head to show me his words were important. ""Your mother-in-law was doing an internship for the German department of agriculture. She was stationed in the same building that they moved the meteorite to.  The government was worried that the rock could be dangerously radioactive, but they wanted to study it.""  He paused.  ""Who better to do this dangerous work than an eager intern?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Again I shook my head. I still didn't see the point of the story. ""What does all this have to do with the fight for human survival? "" I asked.  He continued ""Your mother-in-law was tasked with measuring the chemical composition of the meteorite.  For months she ran tests on the rock as ordered.  Then one day, a man appeared who she had never seen.  Her boss called her into an office and her next job was explained.  The man was an astronomer from the United States named Roy Tucker. He and his colleagues had just made a discovery."" The attendant paused again. ""They made a terrifying discovery.""  My head dropped and I muttered what I knew was the name of this discovery.  ""Apophis."" The attendant nodded slowly in confirmation.

I stood silently for a moment, looking out the window at the stars. Then I started again. ""I still don't understand the connection. I mean, a chemist couldn't have done anything to stop Apophis.""  Again the attendant placed his hand on my shoulder. He spoke slowly. ""No, son.  A chemist could not stop the asteroid.  But, a chemist was indeed needed to save the human race."" I looked up at him, waiting for the rest of the story.

""Tucker shared his discovery with NASA. They ran programs on Apophis' orbit through our solar system. They ran thousands of simulations.  One month later, a call was made to the President of the United States. They told the President that an asteroid would hit Earth, on April 13, 2036. The President asked NASA if they could be wrong. He asked, ""what was the percent likeliness that there could be a mistake."" They simply answered, ""Zero, Mr. President.  Zero Percent. This asteroid,  Apophis,  will strike the Earth. It will mean the end of all life. There is nothing we can do to stop it.""  

I shuddered as I imagined how it must have felt to receive that phone call. The burden it must have been to keep the information from the public in an attempt to salvage our humanity in Earth's remaining years.  

I snapped out it after a few moments. I still didn't have the answer to my question. I felt a bit annoyed. I wanted him to get to the point.   ""What did my mother-in-law, a chemist,  have to do with the fate of the human race?"" 

He smiled, gently. ""After all denial had faded, the governments of the largest nations gathered together to devise a plan to ensure the survival of the humans. Earth would be destroyed.  We needed to find a new home. It wasn't long before we decided on Mars.  It had the best climate. The best chance for water.""  He paused again.  ""It was our best chance of survival.""  I nodded in acceptance. ""We believed that we could create oxygen forever. We believed we could produce water forever.  We did not know what we would do for food.  We knew we had to be able to grow our own food or we would starve. But, how could we possibly test growing food on the red planet?  Well, that is where your mother-in-law comes in."" I raised my head when he said my name. ""Travis, the meteorite your mother-in-law was studying in Germany was from Mars."" My eyes grew wide as my attention focused. ""She ground pieces of that Martian rock into soil and figured out a way to grow food on it. It was thought to be impossible, but she did it.""  

I stepped back. I was baffled. ""That's,...it's.....""  The attendant finished my comment. ""It's Amazing!""  I nodded. ""Yes, it's amazing.""  He smiled back.  ""It's also how they got you a ticket on this rocket."" He paused, trying to gauge my emotions. ""Not only was your mother-in-law smart enough to grow food on Martian soil, but she was smart enough to negotiate 2 tickets to the red planet as a reward for her efforts.  She was the first confirmed passenger. Followed shortly of course by her good friend and college roommate. An exchange student from Japan. You might have heard of her.  Her name was Etsuko.

My wife and son woke up just then. We ate good food and watched some movies like the other days. They fell asleep by 9:00 PM. 

I waited up until 10 PM. I grabbed the Etch-a-Sketch from under my seat. But, 10:00 came and went and nothing appeared on the toy. I watched the display as the clock advanced to 10:01, then 10:02.  I wondered if the messages were finished. Maybe the device is broken. I have so many more questions. 

Tears welled in my eyes as I recalled the amazing gift given by my Mother-In-Law.  She had the most valuable item on the planet, and she gave it to us.  She saved us. The tears flowed quickly now.

Frustrated, I clutched the toy, brought it up to my lips, and whispered, as if someone was listening, ""Why didn't you come with us? There was room!  Why did you choose to stay on Earth, and die?""

I lowered the Etch-a-Sketch to my lap and wiped my eyes.  Just then, the white dials started their familiar, fast movement.  Within a few seconds, a new message was drafted.  The tears reappeared as I read the triplicate note.

I'm going to be graduating this spring coming, and I was hoping to find a paid internship for the summer before I leave for college so I can get some experience, but I've noticed they're tough to come by. I'm interested in STEM, specifically Mathematics and Computer Science (probably going to double major in those), so I would love an internship related to that!

Does anybody have recommendations I can look into?

I'm from the Atlanta, Georgia area, but I'm flexible. If it is out of state for me, I'd prefer it provide housing, but I know that not possible for all of them so I'm willing to hear about anything y'all have to share.

I'm a senior, finance major with the opportunity to become a SWE via JPM's tech connect program. This would be my first full time job. Let's say I hated SWE 2 years in, how hard would it be for a SWE to get into corp finance? I'm afraid of pivoting straight into a completely new career but the opportunity is awesome and I do have an interest in coding (have gone through some courses online)

Do SWE's have an easier time switching to corp. finance than others? Would I need to get an MBA and pivot over to fp&amp;a or could I do it without an MBA?

I do have internship experience from a big name brokerage in ops/risk if that helps.  


I could either graduate spring and go full time with this program or intern again at a big tech firm in FP&amp;A next summer. I do not know what to pick. If I knew for a fact going from SWE to FP&amp;A wouldn't be too tough then I would do the tech connect program.   


Looking for any advice!"

I'm trying to consider whether switching from CompE+Math to CS would be worth it or not.

To put things in context, I'll be able to take courses like Discrete Math, DS&amp;A, OS etc. in the same timeframe either way. CompE will make me take a few completely useless courses like basic circuits, but some of the higher level selectives like Networks, Compilers, and AI are taught pretty well I've heard. I plan on starting LeetCode next semester; and generally there's not many courses I'll miss out on by staying in CompE.

With that said, which companies or industries do you think would be biased against an international CompE for internships and jobs? Specifically asking with respect to FAANG, Quant and fintech, AI, Cloud etc.

Any other viewpoints or advice on the decision would also be very helpful.

Edit: Some things I'm currently interested in (I know some of these are buzzwords): AI/ML, GPU and GPGPU programming, Computer Architecture.

Edit #2: Just a quick point, but I probably do intend to go to grad school for either CS or ECE depending on how things work out, simply because after looking through both undergrad courses I think I want some more of the grad level classes and research. Besides, as an international from the country with the highest backlog, it's very unlikely that I'll get a job right out of undergrad-I'm more or less restricted to big tech that can afford the legal side of hiring me."

Started coding a bot in python for discord with my friend to get experience in Github/development to add onto my resume after my distributed research I did over the summer, and I'm squeezing in either hackerrank/leetcode wherever I can since I work as a TA for school: brushing up on data structure knowledge by helping my friends with their class projects and ideas

I see videos on youtube where people are solving problems that I can't even wrap my head around for interviews with big name companies and it honestly has me scared out of my mind (which only makes me go on leetcode even more haha) but I'm just wondering if companies that aren't big names will ask the same caliber of questions in interviews?

I think right now I'm freaking out because my algorithms class was harder than expected + everything with COVID and school but

I guess here are my general questions:

1. how hard do you think it'll be to find an entry level job for software development (or hell anything related to cs because I think its interesting) in the coming years?
2. I've been debating on taking a semester off if my uni goes remote again and focus on developing an app i've been thinking about for a couple months. is that a good idea? (also if i dont land an internship do you think if i develop an app it'll look alright?)
3. Are coding interviews as hard as some of the questions you see on [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) for youtube (for non big names)?
4. Is it too late to apply to internships if you start applying in January? (seeing if i can give myself a few months to go all out in leetcode)

sorry for all the questions

iyrz5o,14,2020-09-24,Tifu by cooking with chili peppers before surgery,Hom3b0dy,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iyrz5o/tifu_by_cooking_with_chili_peppers_before_surgery/,"Tifu by making a dish with chili peppers in it before my on call surgical assistant shift. On mobile, so apologies in advance.

The recipe asks that you halve and seed a handful of chilis before boiling them. The boiling of the chilis creates a very spicy steam which leaves your eyes and throat burning all day if you're not careful. I remembered this time, all was well and my neighbors didn't have to wonder if the rona had struck our neighborhood. 

After boiling the peppers, you need to peel the skins off. I did all of this with no issues and scrubbed my hands extremely well after touching the very slippery little spice globs.

Now, in the past, I have missed a bit of chili or jalepeno under my nails or got some oils on my fingers. This has led to burning sensations when the oils get somewhere sensitive (my eyes, jeez guys..) Today, I was especially careful because burning my eyeballs is no fun and I needed to be prepared for any emergency surgeries over night.

Well, despite my intensive scrubbing technique,  these peppers were persistent! I got called in a few hours after cooking. I scrubbed my hands with hibitane (strong soap) and followed with an alcohol based scrub before entering the OR and gowning up.

The *instant* my gloves were in place, my hands were on fire! Finger tips, knuckles, palms, and the backs of my hands. Every inch was screaming and I couldn't do a thing about it for nearly 2 hours. I have no idea if the alcohol scrub caused the irritation or the glove material, but that was the longest 2 hours of my life and I will be buying gloves for any future pepper adventures.

The surgeon and the ER intern who scrubbed in thought it was funny and the patient is recovering well, so no harm done, for any that were worried. My cheeks were simply as warm as my hands for a bit there.

TL;DR - tortured my hands for 2 hours during surgery by cooking with chili peppers before getting called in. Wear gloves or feel the burn, folks!"

First off, I go to basic college in NYC. I actually recently transferred here and was hoping covid would chill so I can participate in some sort of research study/project. I'd like to go to grad school, hopefully at a much better school to make myself look better, and get my masters in maybe a narrower field of CS or stats. I was thinking the research would help me look better but everything being online is odd. I dont even know if the research is necessary for a masters degree.

I have some work experience as a computer tech working under IT departments fixing basic hardware, software and networking issues but most of my other work experience is in a trade (it was and still is my plan B, i just wanted to get a feel for it). In that computer tech job, I work at various companies/offices and have gotten the chance to work at Goldman Sachs, JPM, and Bloomberg. Luckily, i was able to score 3 connections at JPM. One happened to be a recruiter, another happened to be a managing director and another was a recent college graduate. 

They've been super helpful and supportive really. They all work on trading floors, working around them has definitely sparked my interests in pursuing that field. I already enjoy  reading about the markets, stocks and economics in general, so why not combine two things I'm interested in. So i thought about maybe going into algotrading or working towards becoming a quant. I'm aware the journey is difficult but I figured working towards a career like that would still help me find a good career anywhere else. 

Internships is definitely the biggest thing that will help me achieve my goals. I dont plan to graduate ""on time"". So should i get as many internships as possible? Maybe start off at small ones and use that experience to get bigger ones? What should do? Thank you for reading this far if you did"

Although I am Malay and was born in Malaysia, I don't consider it my home. I've moved around a lot my entire life: moved to Dubai in 4th grade, then back to Malaysia in 7th grade (international schooling), then to Kazakhstan in 11th grade, then Canada after graduating high school, then back to Malaysia after only spending a year in Canada (it has been two years now since I have been back in Malaysia). Basically ever since 4th grade, I've lived and breathed within an international community, and now that I'm forced back into the Malaysian community I feel increadibly out of place. I actually have a lot of questions so I'll try to break it down and provide as much information as I can:

**Question 1**: For the people who have moved (or are in the process of moving), how did your family react?

I am the oldest and the only girl with 3 younger brothers. Everyone within my extended family lives in Malaysia and my parents are also fairly patriotic towards their country. My parents dislike the idea of me wanting to leave the country permanently. Growing up, they've entertained my idea and showed some support but have always emphasized that it would be for work and that I would always return ""home"". It feels as though choosing to leave Malaysia would mean that I would be abandoning my family, which isn't true! It's not like I wouldn't come visit. So what I want to know is other people's experiences dealing with their family members when they got out... any stories or advice? Regardless of my Family's opinions on the move, I still want to leave Malayisa. I just... want to reasure myself that this isn't an act of betrayal towards my family. 

**Question 2**: Any general advice on where to start in terms of getting the Canadian PR? When can/should I start? 

I've done some research on it but i'm still a little lost. I understand that Canada has a point system and that will determine if I am qualified for the PR. For anyone that has gone through it... how long did it take? Did you complete all your points before moving to Canada or did you attempt to complete it while living in Canada? Should I have a certain amount of money first before starting? I'd appreciate any general guide/steps I should work towards because I have no idea where/how to even start.

**Question 3**: I have a general idea of what I want to work as after graduation, but any advice or opinions?

I am planning on graduating with a bachelor of science degree in applied physics by 2022. I've always appreciated the work my teachers have done growing up, so my original plan was to become a teacher. I heared Canada requires an additional teaching degree to actually teach and I have no idea how long that would take or if that is an option for me to do right away (are teachers in high demand within Canada?). Right now, I'm open to the possibily of any job. I feel like I can't exactly be picky. In January 2021 I have to undergo an internship period for my degree. The original plan was to search for an internship opportunity in Canada (I thought it might help my chanced of moving to Canada after University), but because of covid that isn't an option anymore.

**Question 4**: What is your opinion on how difficult it is to find a job near Toronto/Waterloo?

I lived within Waterloo for a year back in 2017. I originally studied Mathematical Physics in the University of Waterloo before having to move back to Malaysia. I knew that if I studied in Canada, it would be easier for me to eventually move there. It's an unfortunate story actually... I was suppose to undergo a 5 year program in UW but there were some financial issues within my family and my parents could no longer financially support my studies (the international tuition + accomidation fees were really high), which is why I moved back to Malaysia where tuition and accomidation were much cheaper. I've grown quite attached to Waterloo within the year that I stayed there, and I also met my boyfriend (Canadian citizien) there. Our original plan is that once I am done with my studies here in Malaysia I would move back to Waterloo, but I feel like that is easier said than done. The way I see it, it'll be hard to find a job in waterloo since it's a small University city... and Toronto is near by but hard to find a job in. I did work for 3 months in Waterloo, but it was just a part-time job at a local sandwich shop.

**Extra info that I'm not sure would help**: I currently have a visitor's visa (I've visited my boyfriend once during the 2 years I've been back in Malaysia. Was going to visit again but covid happened) but it will expire in 2022 when I graduate. Is that something I should renew, or should I apply for something else since I want to move to Canada and not exactly just  ""visit""?

I know I gave a lot of information and questions, but I appreciate any advice or opinions that can me given to me! :) Thank youuu soo much for taking the time to read/answer"

I had very little experience, but I was willing to learn. And I learned, I learned a lot (so I thought), Django, Django rest, Angular, VueJS, Docker, Ansible, there were also little things that come along like java, ruby, Nginx, ...)

I was basically developing and deploying (with Docker) Django rest API with angular across multiple servers with shared NFS storage. I was really happy and proud that I was able to do that as a student. I was also communicating and coordinating with other country's programmers that were developing a mobile app that was connecting to my API. That was 3 years ago

As we are primarily a backed oriented company we didn't have any frontend developers. I volunteered to learn VueJS, which happened 1 year ago.

Now my student years are over and I was given a work contract, I was really surprised how low I was valued, I was valued even lower than the scale can go. We have ranks scaling from software developer 1 to software developer 7 and wage for developer 1 and developer 2 ranges from 2300 to 2800, I  was given 2200.

I'm pretty devastated and sad that the company thinks so little of me after 6 years of experience there. I must accept the offer because of the internship I had there which tells me that I have to work there for 3 years. I will call for a meeting but I think it will be really hard to negotiate because I was given so little at the start. Also all project managers I worked over the years already quit their jobs here at this company, so I'm really on my own.

As this is my first actual job I don't really know what to say at the meeting. How do I negotiate the wage I was given. I made a list of things that I did in the company and I'm proud of. Does anyone have any tips?"

I have asked loads to people if they can help me find jobs - which is wrong, I know - but it sucks when someone who hasn't done shit in their life gets a good position in a company, you know? It really sucks. And for the last few months, I have been feeling shitty about myself, feeling shitty about my decision to join that subject five years ago. Nowadays, every job I apply to only makes me sad. I know they will not select me. I feel like all those years I worked my ass off to gain experience has gone down the drain.

What was the fucking point of doing all that? No point at all. My shitty mind made me leave a person who loved me dearly. They used to understand what I was going through, but I still left. I am a bad person. So, nowadays, I sit on my bed the whole day regretting my decision to invest my time in a thing that has only degraded my mental health. I think it will be better for me to leave this sector and join another one. But every fucking day, I wake up thinking maybe today's my day, you know? Maybe someone will finally send me that email, asking me to join an interview. But that's just a dream. So, I think of giving my life up, maybe that will stop all of this completely, but I can't. I know it will only cause pain to my family.

I don't know what I am supposed to do. Everything sucks. I don't even know why I am writing this here. I just wanted someone to listen, I guess. I used to laugh at people who said the same old ""growing up sucks."" Now I understand it. I really do haha"

I've been teaching myself web development through online courses and tutorials and stuff for a while now. As I've gotten more comfortable with certain languages and libraries I felt like I was ready for a next step.

When I was looking through job offers I noticed that all of them ask for at least a bachelors degree, which I don't have. On top of that they ask for work experience, which I also don't have. This made me kinda insecure and I decided I would just call some companies and ask if there was a possibility for me to come and gather some work experience through an internship or just on voluntarily basis.

The 2 companies I called both told me that I really should have a degree to stand a chance.

This kinda hit me hard because I feel like I've been wasting time teaching myself programming. And I also feel kinda old to start a new study (even though I'm just 26).

On the internet I read a lot about people being self-taught programmers landing a job so this is kinda contradictory to me. Maybe it's just different in the country where I live? (Netherlands)

Anyways I feel kinda bad and discouraged now and I don't really know what to do. Should I find a simple job to gather money so I can start a study? Should I continue searching for a place for an internship?

I'm kinda just venting but if someone has some tips that would be greatly appreciated.

...................

Edit: Thanks everyone for the great tips and kind words. Like I said I was kinda just venting, but it was more about me having the feeling that I had chosen the wrong path by teaching myself, and less about the actual rejections. I just don't like the feeling that I wasted time. But I'm convinced otherwise now. I'm just gonna keep learning and keep building my portfolio website."
iz08n2,3,2020-09-24,"What, if anything, should I be doing different as a student getting a CS minor due to circumstance?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iz08n2/what_if_anything_should_i_be_doing_different_as_a/,"To preface: ***I do not care about working at a FAANG and would be happy at any type of company. I would actually not want to work at most of those big companies for personal reasons anyway.***

​

Most of the posts I see in this subreddit are either 1. FAANG focused or 2. either self taught entirely or coming from a CS degree. So I'm writing this to try and get general advice from my category that doesn't really fall into either.

​
So basically, I am a junior at a big state school that has an outstanding CS program. Problem is, I did not come here as a CS major, I came as a political science major and by the time I discovered programming, I was too far behind to change and afford it (CS here falls under engineering, so I'd have to take 2 semesters of chemistry and physics before I could even apply to switch). So I'm settling for a minor that covers:

- 2 semesters of Java with a heavy emphasis on software engineering
- Discrete math
- C/Software Tools (title of the class, not sure what software tools refers to but I've heard it's a general systems programming class)
- Data Structures and algorithms
- Operating systems
- Assembly/Computer organization

​I also plan on getting my master's if I cannot get a decent job after school, **and I worked at BigTechCompany this past summer as a Data Analyst Intern, where I wrote Python scripts and some JS as about 25% of my job.**

I also code on the side but lately have hit a wall of sorts. Because I spend most of my days writing Java for my SWE class, which is a huge time sink due to it being a weedout, I don't have much brain power for side projects at the end of the day. FWIW, I just hit 1000 LOC on my current class project and I'm about a quarter done with it. I have a few decent projects but nothing at a real large scale and I currently am having a hard time finding ideas or motivation. I also participate in CTF competitions with my school's security club and do pentesting in my free time on HackTheBox, and am the VP of our school's LUG (Linux Users' Group).

​

Anyway, finally, I guess what I'm asking is given my situation, how does it look in terms of getting a general dev job OR cybersecurity? I don't care about FAANG and would be glad to work anywhere, but what should I be doing and focusing my attention, or is my situation unrealistic? And, how can I regain my motivation to do side projects and get over the hump I've hit?"

I go to a top 15 public university, and I will be graduating in December.  Other than the partying at the beginning of my Freshman year, I have not really enjoyed college, and I am graduating a year and a half early. Most of my classes have left me uninspired, I have changed my major a few times, and I really feel like I am either not learning anything, or can learn a lot more outside of school. I have had a pretty much full time internship the last year and a half in addition to school that has taught me more than what my tuition is going to. 

I was planning on just going to graduate school after, but I do not really just not feeling more school, and taking on debt. I want to get more experience, learn new things, and really broaden myself and I don’t feel like graduate school will do that for me right now. 

I want to move to a big city like New York or Los Angeles but jobs haven’t been too keen on hiring me while I am not in the state. Do I keep applying or is it pretty much no chance I get hired during the economy right now?

I feel like my best option is to just move home after graduation, work a few minimum wage jobs until I can get a few months rent to live on my own, and then move to a big city and hope I find a job, but I honestly don’t feel like that’s a suitable plan!

I have worked hard for my entire life, dif sports, work, and extracurriculars, got into a good university, graduated early and am open to literally moving anywhere but I just have no idea what to do."

I'm turning 23 soon and I can't remain in this position anymore. On the other hand, I have received two interviews for a Veterinary Assistant role. While this is a great opportunity to gain actual medical and laboratory application experience, there will also be a growth limitation and a salary cap. As such, I will add these possible roles to my resume and cover letters and continue to apply to as many available openings. 

My only concern with this is that I feel as though I will be rejected by possible future employers if I held four different jobs in the same year. Obviously I could say that the role did not offer what I desire, but I feel most jobs want a long term employee. But this should go both ways, increase a long term employees skills set and salary and they are sure to stay!"

I have a few related summer internships in the past, but really not even in the U.S., although the experience means a lot to me. 

Does this mean they are willing to accept me or at least I get a bigger chance?

Wow I have been so skeptical about my future because someone once said my gpa is toooo low to get into a “top” grad school in computer science or related. 

I am applying to BU MET CIS. My undergrad major is MIS from a T50. These two are very much closely related and BU doesn’t require a CS background for a candidate.

From the moment I got the fee waiver, I have been demonstrating 1000+ times a day that I am not bad...sounds like an idiot but yeah I really have no idea where I am going to the next...and I have heard a bunch of pathetic things of schools sending out fee waivers only to keep the acceptance rate low...

I've sent in many applications for par-time jobs and internships within the past couple months and its either no response or a rejection. I don't have any previous IT work experience and I'm not done with my degree yet so I am thinking that's the reason.

Should I just wait till I have my degree? The logic is that it would prove me more qualified to work then my current situation with no experience and no degree right?

TL:DR: need experience to get job but need job to get experience. Should I wait for my degree to (maybe) make it easier?"

It's hard to find jobs in Chemical Engineering and the # of jobs is low (in Canada) &amp; oil &amp; gas industry is volatile and I don’t like the work hence why I am not good/skilled at it (I am average). I want out and into a more in demand, stable, good paying field and want your advice. 

In my free time I have already dived into and completed Digital Marketing courses/certifications and have a good working foundation/skill in it. I am also currently taking and working on completing my online coding classes at Udacity &amp; Codeacademy to see if software development can be an option for me before I shell out further money or time for a Computer science degree/bootcamp. 

If I see myself doing coding based on completion of my online courses I was thinking about going back to school to get another bachelors in computer science. Since my previous Chemical Engineering major was very competitive and hard I don’t have quite the scores needed to land myself into grad school for a masters of computer science, &lt;3.0 GPA). Since I am counted as a after degree student getting admission into good computer science bachelor degree at a well ranked university may be difficult due to high demand for computer science majors from high school. 

Should I just go to an accredited regional College or lower ranked University and bust out a bachelors in computer science and get high grades where they will accept me? Cost of education/time needed is not an issue since I am ready to do what it takes and just want a more stable in demand skill/profession in the long term. 

Another option on the table is possibly go back for a accounting degree, get high GPA, get my CPA and work at big 4 and make my money.

&amp;#x200B;

***(3) go to school for accounting get the degree in half time (2 years and only taking courses that don’t transfer), get experience, get my CPA &amp; go work for big 4.***

This summer I graduated with MS in Biomedical Engineering and also hold BS in Chemical Engineering. Not long after I graduated, I was lucky to join a summer school (5-week long) in Data Science and Machine Learning, where I learned to code for the first time. At first, I joined this short program to learn skills in data analysis that would possibly prove useful during PhD that I was going to start from next year. But I found myself enjoying programming a lot more than what I used to do as a biomedical researcher. I also have a lot of friends, who are currently employed at very big tech companies and display a lifestyle, which I would love to have, but it doesn't seem possible with perspectives of doing PhD for 5-6 years and slim chances of getting employed in US afterwards. 

I've been encouraged by some of my friends and my family member, who's also SWE, to continue learning to code and pursue career in it. So I started this paid offline courses in Java (not Python, because it's rarely used by SWEs in country where I reside), which are 2 month long. Since I already have an experience with coding in Python (after data camp, I took few online courses), these Java classes seem a little too slow in their pace for me, and I feel like I'm wasting my time, especially considering that I started learning at 24 y.o. I'm very determined to get an internship as soon as possible, and feel like in order to do that I must be learning something that will allow me to create real products and put on my Resume ASAP, while taking this Java classes.  

Maybe there are some peers here, who also come from non-traditional backgrounds and don't have degree in CS, who can suggest me some tips/share resources/point me in some direction?

Following is the syllabus of the Java SE classes that I'm supposed to complete in 2 month, which is supposed to be followed by another class in Java EE and Spring Boot( which is another 3 month-long)

Java Standard Edition

Lesson 1 - Setting, Variables, the Scanner Class

Lesson 2 - Conditions, if, if-else, else if

Lesson 3 - Loops, One Dimensional Loops

Lesson 4 - Arrays, One-Dimensional Arrays

Lesson 5 - Strings, the String class

Lesson 6 - Two-Dimensional Arrays

Lesson 7 - Methods and Arguments

Lesson 8 - OOP. Classes and objects

Lesson 9 - OOP. Inheritance, polymorphism

So, I thought I was being wise by taking initiative and taking an algebra course over the summer before my freshman year begins. They told me that if I failed the course, I'd have to switch out of my major. I thought ""no biggie, I got this in the bag! It's just algebra!"" WOW my duMBA-- anyways, I was getting 88% and above on quizzes, 100% on assignments, and I understood the material very well.

The final is worth 50% of our grade, and we need a 75% in the class to be considered ""passing"" the class. With quarantine and all, studying at home has definitely affected my mental health, and my house isn't really work-friendly. My house is very noisy and my parents stress me out so much, and I have severe test anxiety when it comes to math because I suck at it. During the test I kept thinking about how this class is in the way of me and continuing in my major. Even the proctor reached out to me after the test and let me know that I looked very stressed out and she wanted to check on me.

I failed the final, which resulted in me failing the class. It really was a matter of poor test taking skills rather than poor math skills, nonetheless, I must face the consequences.

Turns out, not only do i have to switch majors (I'm a bio major) but I have to completely switch out of the college of natural and agricultural science and into the college of humanities and social science. I thought ""okay...not what I wanted, but I'll make it work! How about majoring in psychology since that's an available major?"" Nope. I can't major in *anything* relating to math. Matter of fact, they're not letting me take a *single* math class again. I literally can't do anything STEM related at this college because I failed this class. REALLY? OOWEJDOJW IM PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND YOU WONT LET ME GO BE STUPID IN MATH? PLEASE???

I want to go into med school, and I need to meet math prerequisites, which I can't fulfill at this university anymore. I'm thinking about trying to transfer to a better university, but until transfer applications are due, I'm not sure whether I should go to a cc and transfer to a better university, *or* if i should stay at my current university and stick with my undeclared humanities major while taking random courses that are interesting, then transferring to a better university once the applications are due.

Just a note, the university I'd love to transfer to is a really amazing yet selective university (a private uni, not UC) and I've had my eye on it for so long. I don't know if attending a CC would lower my chances of admittance over transferring from a 4 year public university. Do you think that private uni's would prefer a student coming from another uni over a cc?

Additionally, if I do transfer, should i mention this whole ordeal? Would mentioning this situation paint me in a bad light? I was thinking that maybe I should make my transfer app focusing more on how I have many interests, such as violin, philosophy, compsci, and medicine, and how my current uni doesn't really allow students explore all their passions and avocations.

So sorry for this block of text. I appreciate any advice I can get because I'm seriously in a tough spot right now and I feel quite stupid. If you were in my situation, what would you do? I was thinking about transferring out of this uni before this situation happened because I truly stand by my earlier statement, that it's hard to explore your interests here (simple example of that is that I wanted to take a foreign language and they told me it wouldn't give me any credit no matter how good I got at the language, and that they highly discourage me from taking a language. This was when I was a bio major.)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR** I failed a math class/workshop so I can't take any more math or science classes at all, got kicked out of my major and forced to be in humanities. I want to transfer but idk if i should transfer from my current uni to the selective school i have in mind or from a cc to the selective school. If I stay at my current uni, I have to stick to humanities and that means I might have to transfer as a humanities major too, but I have more research opportunities and internships. If I go to a CC, I can take any class I want and go back into STEM, but research opportunities are limited. Also, should I mention this fail situation on my transfer app although it doesn't show on my transcript?

# Going to a CC and then transferring elsewhere

*Pros*

* cheaper
* allows me to go back into stem
* fresh opportunity and no record of ""being bad at math""at the CC

*Cons*

* Possibly no research opportunities
* Don't think it's possible to transfer after a year, and I reallly want to transfer ASAP!
* Less resources
* Less ""prestigious"" but idc although admission officers might think it looks better to come from a 4 year uni

# Staying at my current uni and transferring elsewhere

# Pros

* Lots of research opportunities and resources (although now that I'm a humanities major, I'm lacking a lot of support suddenly lol)
* Might be able to transfer after a year

*Cons*

* Can't do anything STEM related at current uni besides internships or research
* Stuck in humanities
* If I transfer to a different school, I will still have to be a humanities major (I can dabble in stem courses though, just not major in stem)

***What do you think? :,) ALSO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY STARTED FALL SEMESTER SO I CAN'T ENROLL IN THEM, AND MY SCHOOL HAS NOT STARTED YET, AND I NEED CREDITS TO TRANSFER ASAP BUT I ALSO WANT TO DROP OUT OF THIS SCHOOL IDK WHAT TO DO. I can't just sit around all fall semester if i want to transfer soon. aak.***

edit: Just bc we got some ppl who think i'm making this up for whatever reason..adding this for ya'll :( chass = college of humanities and social science. they stand by this policy hardcore. sounds unbelievable? ikr, i can't believe it either.

I graduated on Computing Science and spent 9 years coding, mostly on C++ and Python, although never really considered myself a top-tier programmer to be honest.

Now, due to 1/ covid crisis and 2/ urge to move on to something else, I’m considering seriously making a career change. For the past couple years I’ve been reading about bioinformatics, sequencing and genomics in general and I’d love to move in this direction as I find this domain absolutely fascinating. I have found a few Masters programs on BioInformatics/Life Science such as [this one](https://master-bioinfo-bordeaux.github.io/architecture.html#year1_S7) or [this one](https://www.th-deg.de/lsi-m-en#course%20content) that take on Computing Science profiles but I’m not exactly sure what kind of job I could expect to find after completing this. I guess what I want to say is that I wouldn’t want to go back to coding. I would love to be able to get a job on this field, but not necessarily as a programmer. Can you help me understand what kind of jobs could be out there for a profile like mine ?

Also, bonus question, what do you think is the ‘employability’ of a &gt;40yr old highly motivated but with little or no previous experience on the field (apart from the master’s and the 6-month internship + of course all my previous stuff)?

Thanks so much for any insight you can give me. Much much appreciated.

# TLDR:

* [Made a Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ok-zoomer/difojhphdkeielekajnflmacfdebhkkk/) to easily add and store Zoom links for UCLA classes
* **VERY IMPORTANT: IF NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIRST TRY TO ADD A CLASS, REMOVE AND RE-ADD THE EXTENSION, THEN RESTART CHROME**
* Add classes (or Personal Entries) through the [Class Planner](https://be.my.ucla.edu/ClassPlanner/ClassPlan.aspx)
* Once classes are added, the class planner calendar thing will be ""enhanced""
* Use the popup to modify entries, or for quick access
* You'll be notified when classes occur, and you can add extra meeting times for classes
* [Github Page](https://github.com/mting314/ok-zoomer)

# Background

Now that UCLA has become the University of Zoom, Los Angeles (UZLA), I personally have found it a bit annoying when I need to get to a class, but I hadn't had the presence of mind to save all my links in a central place. Now maybe it's just me, but this inevitably results in me spaghetti-ing my Zoom links all over the place. There'll be times where I knew it was send in an email, and oh, then I have to sift through my email app with 4-digit notifications. Then after 3 minutes of searching, oh wait, it was actually just on CCLE for that class. Oh but now I have to log in with **d u o  m o b i l e**...

I also have a friend who is planning on participating in like 9 classes in Fall 2020 (up from 6 last spring).

[ouchie they all start with the same 4 letters](https://preview.redd.it/77fqxpkzs5p51.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f219f1586870f5267a98fc1325ffed32c05bb755)

He was smart enough to store all the links in a folder of bookmarks but adding lots of class names, start times, etc. gets a bit ugly (especially because all the class names start with the same 4 letters).

Well, Ok, Zoomers. I've been working on a Chrome extension to remedy this issue!

Access it right here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ok-zoomer/difojhphdkeielekajnflmacfdebhkkk/](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ok-zoomer/difojhphdkeielekajnflmacfdebhkkk/)

# Adding a class(/personal entry)

First thing's first; there isn't much you can do until you add a class to the system with its corresponding Zoom link and password. To do this, first head over to the [Class Planner](https://be.my.ucla.edu/ClassPlanner/ClassPlan.aspx). You'll see something a bit different:

[Click those little plus buttons to start adding an entry](https://preview.redd.it/3p8etodxs5p51.png?width=1781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69c0aea06e26905b4726d43a63f8b89bd6670fe9)

Click on those little adding plus buttons. Then you'll be prompted for either a Zoom Meeting ID OR a meeting link.

**It is advised that you add a Zoom Meeting ID rather than a link just because it's faster to join, which is the whole point of this extension.**

*In fact, if you try to add a link of the form:*

[`https://ucla.zoom.us/j/1234567890`](https://ucla.zoom.us/j/1234567890)

*The system will automatically detect that this is actually a Zoom Meeting ID hiding in a link, and therefore add it as a Zoom Meeting ID.*

Once you add that, the system will simply ask you for the password. If everything worked correctly, the page should reload and the plus icon should turn into a little Zoom icon.

# The ""Enhanced"" Class Planner

Once you've added a class to the system, you can that reflect in the class planner.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""enhanced\\""](https://preview.redd.it/5ehcwrb2t5p51.png?width=1826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a987bca84a980cff77cfd152e7b4652a4b47dc7f)

Any class or personal entry that has been added to Ok, Zoomer will cause the borders on the corresponding planner boxes to become thicc.  This indicates that this planner box has now become a **linked box**, that you can click on to automatically join that class/personal entry.

Furthermore, you can also see that timeline (which I honestly believe is a feature all calendar/planner apps should have), that red dotted/solid line that indicates the current time and date. In fact, any class planner box hit by the ""today"" part of the timeline will be highlighted as well, so that you can easily pick out which class is going on. Very helpful if you have 1000 class/personal entry boxes.

In a future update, you'll be able to turn these off if they bother you.

# The Popup

Once you've added classes to the system, it'll appear in the popup. Open the popup by clicking the little icon in the top right of Chrome, or by default hit the shortcut

`""linux"": ""Ctrl+Shift+K"",""windows"": ""Ctrl+Shift+E"",""mac"": ""Alt+Shift+P""`

in order to open up the popup. However, when I try on my laptop, I think it can't handle those three keys at once, so you can just go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` to change the shortcut to whatever you want.

[The popup](https://preview.redd.it/v4e8glo4t5p51.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8d63f25c7225211bcd9b0f43276f4ac5b635484)

Lots of this stuff is self explanatory, press the Big Blue Button to join your meeting, delete button to delete an entry, and the cog icon to edit an entry.

What's important is what you're able to edit from here:

* Password
* What you call the class/personal entry (click on the name next to the Big Blue Button)
* When the class meets (add or delete)
   * If you add the class from the planner, the entry will automatically inherit the normal class meeting times
   * Class times are displayed in Los Angeles time, but will ring at the correct time in your own time zone. For example, if my entry says ""Monday @ 2:00 PM"", but if I live in Bangladesh, the class with ring when my clock says ""Tuesday 3:00 AM"", or ""Tuesday 4:00 AM"" after November 1st because Daylight Saving.
* Import or Export Classes

# Importing/Exporting Classes

Maybe you're taking an interesting class, and to share it with your friend. However, as of right now, there's no easy way to add a class without it being in your class planner in the first place. Therefore, if they're not enrolled in the class, they'll have to add the class to their plan for a second, add it from there, then remove the class from the plan. Bit of a headache. But because Ok, Zoomer's database of classes is really just a bunch of JSON objects, we can just give an option to export as a .json file. To do this, go into an entry's edit menu in the popup, and click the ""Export"" blue button at the very bottom of the menu.

Then you can send that file to your friend, and add it through the popup's \`Import Class\` button. This will bring in all the info, importantly including the url/Zoom ID, password, and the meeting times that your friend had set.

# Final Thoughts

If you got through reading all this, thank you so much at the very least for your interest in this extension! After my internship ended at the beginning of the month, this is what I've been pouring a lot into while I'm waiting for classes to start.

I'm always looking for more users to help test this extension out, so anyone trying it, even for a day, would be appreciated.

Here's the [Github Page](https://github.com/mting314/ok-zoomer) if you're interested. That being said, I'm very new to this Javascript/HTML/CSS stuff (I still haven't taken a programming class at UCLA!), so please don't laugh to hard at my code haha"

I don’t want to be annoying and go ask them what I can do every few hours.. I get really anxious when I feel like I’m getting on someone’s nerves. my bosses said last week they want me in the spring so i think they are happy with me, but I keep worrying that I’m some how not doing what I’m supposed to. I have a lot of homework every week so I usually do that during the day. 

I guess I just wanted to know if you have any advice on what to do?

I've been heavily thinking about transferring since my current university doesn't offer as many internship opportunities and is a smaller and lesser known school in my state but I am having a hard time telling if it is truly worth it to transfer. 

As a freshman right now I pay around 4-5k a year for my current university and may pay even less after this year but transferring to GMU or VT would make me have to pay around 20k-30k a year, forcing me to take out loans. I'm mostly trying to see if my current curriculum at my university is a good one as I can't really tell in all honesty, so that's why I wanted to get input from other cs majors who potentially have more knowledge.

Does this course list look good? I will say that I've been taking cs160 in my first semester and it mostly isn't difficult for me since I learned a bit of python and the class feels like we're learning c++ and applying it. I'd be concerned if it felt easy the whole way through. Any thoughts though?"

I come here for questions Google can't answer because some Redditors make Google.

So, I have finally progressed to a 3.04 cgpa after a rough start and I am just leaving my sophomore year. Ironically, when I was doing poorly it was in non-computer science courses. For example I earned a C in ethics but an A in discrete mathematics and also A's in all my CS core classes like computer architecture. I am a moderately good programmer in Python and I have a large project in which I built an autonomous UAV that was sent into the stratosphere with a range of over 40km using Python, RaspberryPI, and Arduino.  I know CAD and Inventor as well as MATLAB like the back of my hand but I get crushed on HackerRank so I'm working to improve my raw coding ability. I have basic understanding of algorithms and have even implemented them in the UAV project to make the drone do things like take the longest path and follow trace routes.

I decided to apply to SWE internships at Lockheed Martin, Home Depot and Paypal.

My question is, I applied back on the 9th of September for all three positions. Right now, all three of these companies are listing my status as simply 'resume received'. Is there a chance that because I have not heard back yet that my  resume never even got pulled while they were making interview selections? For background, I am 28 years old and spent time in the Army as a helicopter mechanic as well as having completed a prior internship for network management. The soft skills and experience are there. Should I be applying to way more than three companies to even have a chance? I know my GPA will improve drastically over the next few semesters because I am no longer working full time. I listed my GPA on my resume directly and placed 'meeting the employment standard' on my curriculum vitae which is also individualized for each of these companies.

It sounds like insanity to build cover letters for 30+ companies.

What am I missing?

Help me feel like I'm not an imposter and any recommendations on places to apply for fall internships with those credentials would be amazing."
iz7ume,3,2020-09-24,Looking for guidance.,Elda0221,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iz7ume/looking_for_guidance/,"Hi,

I recently graduated college and right after that the pandemic came and so far I feel very lost and that I feel like a failure for not being able to find a career job even though I know its probably the pandemic. I graduated college with a computer science degree, but I didn't find coding enjoyable and was hopeful that I could find work without coding. I did multiple internships in IT in roles such as project coordinating and data management and non IT jobs and I was trying to get into the company that I interned for during my senior year, however everything fell through. Now I am wondering what kind of jobs I can apply for with my computer science degree without too much coding as I really haven't coded at all since the pandemic and don't feel confident coding. I tried to apply to stuff like project coordinating or help desk but no one seems to want me since I don't have too much experience. Any advice is helpful as I am really lost on what I should do. I was also thinking of trying to self teach myself web-development. Also if you want to see my resume to check it out, that would be helpful as well! Thank you!

p.s. part of me feels awful because my friend who graduated at the same time as me has found a teaching job and I am very happy for him but feel like I have fallen behind. Once again, any advice on what type of jobs I should apply for is greatly welcomed as I am really lost on what I should do."

Should I be concerned that this Co-op position is too related to their IT departments? If I was going to be an IT intern maybe my job title would have been ""Information Technology Co-op"", this company does have co-ops available with that title too. I was hoping the title they would give me would be ""Electrical Engineering Co-op"" because that's what I actually applied for. Maybe this is a question I should be asking them, and I might.

iz7zk0,0,2020-09-24,Am I majoring in the wrong field?,dc5josh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iz7zk0/am_i_majoring_in_the_wrong_field/,"So I was majoring in healthcare right out of highschool (2010) and dropped out after 2 years.  In those two years I managed to get the fundamentals for basically any degree (english, history, science, some math).   Recently I wanted to follow my dream of computer science, primarily coding, but possibly cyber security.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, in my junior year of college, and the only computer science classes I've taken thus far is programming fundamentals 1 ( c++ ) and currently taking programming fundamentals 2 ( java ).  In class we are learning THE VERY BASICS of how data types work, loop structures, classes/methods, and arrays.  To be entirely honest I have a hard time deciphering the definitions of the basics.  And somehow when the labs come I am able to solve them using pieces of this code and that code from lectures and examples.  Again, very basics.  I have myself worried now.  I began researching interview questions for internships and I can't even begin to think how to get them.  This is mostly because I was never taught the syntaxs they are using to solve them, and even if I was the logic behind it kind of escapes me sometimes.  I tried looking for summer internships to start applying this winter break, but even in my junior year I have only been taught the basics of CS.  The school I am currently attending does not assist in internship placement, and they do not have a senior capstone.  Really my college has what feels like no resources for me and I'm considering transferring and delaying my graduation another year and $10k.  I'm especially worried that once I finish my bachelors I'll need to then go to a boot camp which I cannot afford.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what my question is, am I bound for failure?  Is this a common feeling for where I am currently in my education (the start of programming)?  Am I just overthinking by assuming I should know much more than I already do with only 1 fundamentals class down and halfway through my second?  Do internships require more than just knowing the basics?  Any advice is appreciated greatly"

I would like to get a degree in the computer science/cybersecurity/IT field, and have done a ton of work on related projects outside of school.

I’ve also held a spot as an IT intern around four years ago as well as being the co-founder of the software business, obviously.

My job offer that I got after my internship was rescinded over bullshit completely out of my control (a mandatory course I needed to graduate with was postponed due to lack of a professor to teach... I had to beg my Dean to resolve it which was as they gave me a conditional where I had to pass all my courses and only then, will they give me an exam that covers that course's content and if I pass then I graduate) which started my spiral downwards. I even told that company that it was resolved but nope. They dropped me. The job hunt since losing the offer has been extremely hard on me. 

The worst part is I ""supposedly"" have a marketable degree (software engineering) yet I constantly get rejections or get ghosted and the one job I got was so shady that I left quickly (had to stay for 2 years for extremely shitty pay or I have to pay them $30k). 

I managed to get to the point of a background check for another job before taking on the shady job... Only to be ghosted. I emailed the company asking if there was something wrong and... nothing.

I get so discouraged as I'm seeing people younger than me get jobs that I've desperately been trying to get. I've got my resume checked out by various people even at my university's career centre and they all said it's fine. Idk what I'm doing wrong. I feel hopeless and wish I could end it all, but I have people who love and care for me and believe I can get a good job soon. But I feel like such an imposter if I've yet to get a job with my degree. I've been crying every day because I feel so pathetic that all I am is just a letdown.

 I'm sorry for venting but I just want to ask if there's anything I'm missing, or overlooking? I can DM my resume so you can take a look. What's even more frustrating is people see the experience I have (internships and everything) yet I remain jobless.

Edit: I'm in Canada if that helps."

I chose to go into engineering because I love solving problems, organizing people/resources/time/etc efficiently, and working with a lot of the really passionate and knowledgeable people in this field. However, the further I've gotten into college, the more I'm feeling that less of what I actually love is really in this field. A lot of the people I'm taking classes with seem to hate being here, and constantly complain about the difficulty. Some have straight up told me they're only here for the money engineering jobs can bring. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with feeling either of these ways, but it has definitely gotten to the point where it feels toxic, especially because there's also this mentality about how we are all competing for the top jobs, the top internships, the top grad school acceptances, and so a lot of these people who claim to hate it here are also making up lavish extracurriculars and experiences on their resumes to outdo everyone else. I don't even know how to compete with these people, because even if I know it's fake, companies don't always know--I've watched dozens of these people still get hired despite the bs. Aside from a few close friends who are also really passionate about our respective fields (but are in other majors), I just feel so sad and isolated after this revelation.

On top of this, I was over the moon when I got a job at a fairly respected research lab in my area of interest at my university, but I quickly realized how disorganized it was and how much it's prestige and amazing projects were an illusion. Half of the current projects are barely functional due to mismanagement and poor organization, and the team just laughs about all the money and time and stress wasted on this stuff without ever thinking about making real changes. For example, just before I was a member of the lab, one of our major projects was in development when we found out one of our suppliers had to delay an essential service for the project's deployment. This delay lasted a year, and no further progress was made on the project at the time. Why? Nobody knows. It sat in a clean room for 12 months, incomplete. Suddenly the supplier was ready to go again, and the lab scrambled to get things together for deployment to the point where they were uploading code to test in their hotel rooms the night before the big deployment day. When the time came, it only partially worked, and it was pretty much a total failure since they had almost no test data to use for calibration or debugging. When I was told that story, among others, few thought there was a real problem with what happened. It made me so disheartened after being so excited to join and work on projects there. Is this how it is everywhere???

I must sound like such an ingrate. I'm so thankful to be here and to have the opportunity to be a part of this field.  I just feel so lost right now. But what else would I even do  instead? Engineering is all I've known and wanted. It feels too late to quit now."
izcp4o,2,2020-09-25,I have an interview tomorrow with an amazing company! Help?,akayy14,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/izcp4o/i_have_an_interview_tomorrow_with_an_amazing/,"I am trying to relocate to another state next month and have been on the job hunt actively for a month. I haven’t received a single interview and with my lease ending in 3 weeks I started to become extremely discouraged. My current job is great and my back up plan is to stay here if anything.

After noticing my resume had been viewed and downloaded on LinkedIn, but had not heard back, I started to begin connecting with people in the department I was applying to and tried to send a couple messages. After attempting to connect with the VP of the department, I had noticed she viewed my profile twice within 24 hours. I decided to send her a message about how I noticed she had viewed my profile and reasons why I believe I’d be a great fit for the team (even though I’m a new graduate and only have 1 years worth of experience when the job required two, I have very specific experience that aligns with the job description flawlessly. She said that they were in the final round of interviews (this was last Saturday) and asked if I had submitted a resume. I said yes, but would love to send it to her directly if there was still wiggle room. She agreed and I did not hear back so I sent a follow up email yesterday. I sent a resume, cover letter, and custom deck about me and my experience, and designed the deck to closely resemble their brand...I know I’m extra but I really want to stand out, this is a dream job!

This morning I got an email from the hiring manager saying that the VP had passed along my email and that she wanted to set up a zoom interview for tomorrow! I have done a lot of research on the company and practiced my interview questions. I also have a letter of rec from my current boss to present tomorrow as well.  I feel extremely confident, but don’t want to get my hopes up just in case. With that being said, is it safe to assume they’re very interested in me based on everything I’ve explained? Also, am I doing too much or am I standing out immensely? My first professional job post-grad I was an intern prior so I had a fairly easy in. This will be my first professional interview post-grad so I want to make sure I’m wow-ing but not being annoying.

Thank you in advanced!"

izd8vx,0,2020-09-25,Does a B.A. or a B.S. in Comp Sci Matter?,Kelter1313,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/izd8vx/does_a_ba_or_a_bs_in_comp_sci_matter/,"I'm a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) who just started his comp sci major this year. I'm also double majoring.

I'm currently set for the B.A., but have considered the B.S. in Comp sci due to fears that employers may greatly prefer the B.S. over the B.A. My main rationale is that I don't want to risk dumping my GPA and being stressed out for most of the rest of college on two more semesters of calc, linear algebra, and physics. Instead, I hope to do my double major with a minor in statistics to make up for the math gap and show rigor (it also makes more sense to me, and I feel is highly applicable to comp sci). 

My main question is to those who have gone with the B.A. or B.S., what has been your experience job or internship wise? Further, for general tech (software development, networks, etc.) will missing the extra calc hurt me, or will the statistics prove more beneficial? 

I'd also like to ask employers or those higher up in Comp sci what they think of a B.S. or B.A. student?

I just don't know if the B.S. is worth tanking my grade when I'll take just as many comp sci classes in a B.A. and it could stop me from being able to minor while packing my schedule so tight I won't have any space to breath... 

Further, I heard that what you do outside of class is HUGE in acquiring both internships and jobs. Why take more calc when I can learn an extra programming language, build some apps, and practice front end that my classes wouldn't teach me instead?

ize9c1,5,2020-09-25,I'm paranoid and angry about not being able to find a job,zknight137,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ize9c1/im_paranoid_and_angry_about_not_being_able_to/,"I keep having this feeling of dread that I won't be able to find a job. I'm a senior in college and I have a part time job as an intern in my field. I don't know if they'll be keeping me on when I graduate. My manager really likes me but I see no advancement here and very little opportunity to gain additional experience. On top of that, I have a grant for school that requires me to find a government job in return for the tuition they've paid for me. If I don't find a government job, I have to pay the money back, which will be around 60 grand. I'm getting married in a year and the thought of not having a job makes me feel sick to my stomach. It's difficult to talk about stuff like this with my fiancée because it makes her worked up and incredibly anxious and I hate seeing her like this. I'm paranoid because I went through the interview process for one agency last year for an internship and I was inconclusive too many times on my polygraph test. They kept insisting I was hiding things when I wasn't. I was supposed to be brought back for another try after trying twice but they dropped me. I was told I would get a letter explaining why but it never came. I'm paranoid that I've been blackballed and don't even know it. I was the only person in my grant program last year that didn't get an internship and there are two that I'm definitely more qualified than they are. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been told by professors, managers, coworkers, and recruiters that I have a great resume but no one is contacting me. I email folks back when I get rejection letters asking what I can work on and I never get a straight answer on what I can improve on. I get aggravated seeing job postings for agencies that didn't give me the time of day or I wasn't good enough to pass their lie detector pseudoscience bullshit."
izepa4,0,2020-09-25,I have some questions about internships,SnowingRain320,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/izepa4/i_have_some_questions_about_internships/,"Hey all, I apologise in advance if I'm being ""that guy"" who repeats a common question, but I'm really at my wit's-end and could really use some solid advice from my peers.

First, I'm a Sophomore, but haven't taken Data struct &amp; algo yet, will that impede me while I'm looking?

**Secondly, how do I look for an internship?**

 I've mostly been looking on Indeed, and I've got to say I've come across maybe a handful of actual internships. Most of the time, they seem like people who are trying to be cheap, and get someone who's already in industry. I've seen 3,4 year experience requirements... Also, most of them are unpaid, which unfortunately isn't something I have the luxury of being able to do. 

**Thirdly, how do I get around not really being around any major tech centers?**

 I live in Tennessee, and I'm too poor to move out into a random area for months.. I'm curious how people who are in a similar situation have adapted to that."

I'm old and engineering is my 2nd degree.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/izid96/how_do_internships_work_im_old_and_engineering_is/,"This stuff is all new to me. Are engineering internships generally paid? 

Also at what point in the degree do you start applying for the internship? 

I'm technically a sophomore due to all my gen eds being done from my first degree and my uni only offers engineering courses fall and winter.

I work a corporate job at an auto firm right now so I potentially have an in there..but if I can quit my analyst job and move over to a pay-cut but rewarding in terms of experience job as an intern the summer before I graduate in a few years....I might do that.

Thoughts?"
izievo,55,2020-09-25,[IWANTOUT] 21F SE USA -&gt; London,tech_pumpkin,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/izievo/iwantout_21f_se_usa_london/,"Hi so I really want to leave this country and was hoping to get some advice. I’ve traveled a lot throughout my short life (mostly Europe) and I fell in love with London last summer when I had an internship there.  I have always loved the culture and want to move there so desperately. There’s a few factors that are holding me back though so I thought you guys might know more than I do. So here’s a bit about me- 

I just started my first job as a software engineer and I have a bachelors degree in computer science. The biggest thing that’s making me hesitant about leaving is that my company pays 90% of my masters so I could get it for basically nothing. However if I get my masters in London I could pay basically nothing because tuition is so cheap there. 
Another hesitation is just the fact that I don’t want to leave my job after just starting because it could look bad on my resume. I know I couldn’t for a while because of the borders anyway but just planning for the future. 
A factor that might help, maybe not anymore, is that I’m in the process of getting my Portuguese citizenship so I’d have dual citizenship with the US and an EU country. 
Another concern is that tech just doesn’t pay that great anywhere else than it does here and I am slightly concerned that since cost of living is so high in London that I’d struggle financially. 
In a perfect world, I would be able to just live in London while working remotely with my current company but that’s such a long shot since I just started a few months ago but I am willing to ask in a few months but I can’t count on that at all.

I’m also open to other countries as well. I just figured London has the most opportunities and since I’m in my early 20s I really value that. If you guys have any advice I’m open to hear it. I’m hoping to move in 2021 if the borders open up so I just want to have a set plan to do that. Including how I could live there full time- going theres as a masters student, sneaking in because I have an EU citizenship, marrying rich - anything else?"

izkdsp,1,2020-09-25,MSF to get into IB from non target undergrad?,jakehbs27,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/izkdsp/msf_to_get_into_ib_from_non_target_undergrad/,"Hi all,

I'm a current junior at UMiami and interested in IB. As I've seen thus far in the internship search, IB is tough to pull from my university. Can a MSF program be a good way to get into IB from a non target undergrad? My plan would be to get an internship in some form of banking or research Summer 2021, graduate In Spring 2022, and then start MSF in Fall 2022. Currently without much internship experience in finance, would gain most professional experience in Summer 2021.

Please let me know, I've been hearing mixed reviews about placement after MSFs. Here is just a quick list of universities that have MSF or similar programs I identified if anyone could comment specifically on each program:

NYU / MS Global Finance

Columbia / MSFE

MIT / MSF

Princeton / MSF

Cornell / CFEM

UT Austin / MSF

LSE / MSc Finance

LBS / Masters in Financial Analysis

Vanderbilt / MSF

Yale / MSF Asset Management

UC Berkley / MFE

UCLA / MFE

WUSTL / MSF

UVA / MS Global Commerce

Oxford / MSc Financial Economics

Please let me know!"
izkgdn,1,2020-09-25,Can’t decide whether to laugh or cry at my most recent rejection letter,Bodark,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/izkgdn/cant_decide_whether_to_laugh_or_cry_at_my_most/,"For a bit of context, I was a recruiter in a major US city in the Hedge Fund and Private Equity space for a year so I am no stranger to experiencing ghosting and rejections. Usually I am able to take them on the chin and move on to the next application without too much thought but what happened yesterday was pretty frustrating.

So in mid-June I began applying to jobs in the city I live in pretty aggressively. I have kept the volume up since then but I’ve also been networking by reaching out to people via email, and LinkedIn. One company I have been aggressively targeting since June, resulted in me having multiple conversations with 5 different managers and 2 associates, as well as a talent acquisition person. This was in June and early July and they all told me that their internship application window for the summer of 2021 would be opening in August of 2020 and I should apply then and they’d be happy to interview me. 

August roles around and I apply to 2 roles, one internship and one full-time position within an hour of the job posting going live. I then followed up with all 8 people I had conversations with and not a single person responded. “Whatever” I thought, “time to wait”. 

So yesterday, I received an email from an HR manager I had never spoken with or heard of. The email informed me that I would not be able to be considered for either role because they are not open to juniors in undergrad as they are only open to grad students.

The thing is, I AM a grad student. I’m getting an MS in applied and computational math from a target school in the US. And it says so right on my resume and in all my emails to the other people I’ve spoken with. 

I’ve reached out to everyone at the company I’ve spoken with and so far, nothing but crickets. I feel so cheated. The amount of time and effort I’ve invested into the company alone is going down the drain by the minute. Pretty frustrating."

izl4o4,24,2020-09-25,Internships,adambjorn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/izl4o4/internships/,I am switching careers right now and currently attend university for CS. It seems like there is a huge focus on internships and my only issue is that I make relatively good money right now and support my wife and I. I will need to quit my full time job when it comes time to do internships But will need to stay employed long term to pay the bills. Are there any companies who do long term internships or are the all mostly 10-12 week summer internships? Also is it necessary to have internships if I can create good side projects and already have real world work experience(sales at an ISP). Thanks in advance for your response!
izmbwk,10,2020-09-25,Don't Give Up Hope!,boookay,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/izmbwk/dont_give_up_hope/,"This may be a little long but I promise it is worth it.

I graduated from College back in 2018 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. I concentrated in Biomolecular Engineering and Minored in Biotechnology and Microbiology. Throughout school, I focused heavily on my studies while working in lab and part time as a receptionist.  My summers were spent in summer school sometimes taking 4 courses at a time and my semesters usually had 18+ credit hours. I did not have the opportunity to have any internships.  All of this was so that I could make money and go to school while graduating within 4 years.   


When it came time for me to start looking for a job in Fall of 2017, I decided I wanted to work in big pharma. I would go to career fairs and would spend my nights applying for jobs at several companies I thought I was a good fit for. I applied for over 100+ jobs in the pharmaceutical industry and kept getting denied. This truly made me start to question all of the work I put into it. Was I not good enough to go into pharma? Should I have maybe taken less credit hours and found unpaid internships? It didn't make sense especially when I would see my peers getting lucrative offers and my dream positions - yet all I was getting was denied.   


In Spring of 2018, I can admit it now, I decided to lower my standards. I started looking at jobs solely in Biotech, eliminating the Pharma hopes and dreams. Note, when I say lower my standards I mean finding a job that was outside of pharma. I found that when looking at smaller companies, people actually recognized my potential and wanted to have me interview with them. I ended up having several interviews and finally receiving a job offer for a Technician Job making $40,000 a year. To give some context, an Engineer in Pharma out of school can easily make $65,000+. I was once again questioning my abilities. Why is a company only offering me $40,000 a year when I'm clearly worth a lot more? Am I just not worth this because I didn't have an internship? I started doubting my self worth and after further consideration I decided to take the job. As I was able to still live at home during this time, money wasn't an issue and I decided that at that moment experience was worth more. I had in my mind that I'd work here for 2-3 years and then go back to school for a Masters and then FINALLY make that transition into Pharma.  


Fast forward to Spring 2020, I was unhappy at my current job. Promotions and raises were given in December and although I was promoted, I still didn't cross the $50k mark. I started feeling as if I wasn't recognized and appreciated. My colleagues continued to get rewarded when I was one of the few people working overtime, going the extra mile, and working within multiple departments at once.  I somewhat got depressed and started questioning my self worth. I dreaded coming into work.  The pandemic hit and thankfully I was able to have a job and continue working. I put my thoughts in the back of my head and became grateful that I still had a job.  

Throughout the Spring, I worked throughout the pandemic (overtime still) and came up with a plan to study and take the GRE and apply for grad school to start in Jan 20201.  I told myself, I plan on leaving at the end of the year so what do I have to lose with applying for a few jobs? In June , I fixed up my resume and I started applying to jobs again in Pharma. Logging on once a week and hitting submit on jobs that simply required experience and an engineering degree.

In the beginning of August, I got hits on 3 different jobs I had applied for. Two of the jobs I was fully if not overly qualified for. I knew the salary would be more than my current one but would also still be lower than what I could be making. I had in my head that if I could just get my foot in the door I'd be good.  One of the jobs I had no experience in the primary role and was VERY upfront about. Through the phone interview, I stated I'm willing to learn and assimilate to whatever is thrown at me. When it came to the video interviews, I said the same thing to both the manager and director. At the end of our interview, the director said he loved me for the position and even said he would consider me for another that was similar. I was told to wait till the following week and I'd hear something.

Now we are at the end of September and I have officially put in my two weeks notice for my current job. 

I tell this long drawn out story to say that, if you ever feel as if your self worth is being compromised or going to work becomes painstakingly hard, it is okay to take that leap. I compromised with the money initially but it eventually became hard to look past especially with me not being rewarded any other way for my hard work.  I will add that my self worth was so damaged that when I was asked for my salary expectations, I low balled myself so much that the director added $9k more.   


 I will also add that sometimes it is OKAY to wait (if you have the resources to) for your dream opportunity to come. I will say I regret myself for settling initially but on the other hand, had I not taken my current job I may not have this great opportunity that I have. Everyone's path is different in life but remember that even if it doesn't happen now that it will happen when the time is right!"

izo08w,8,2020-09-25,Awful Phone Call Quality in Phone-Screen. Should I tell my recruiter?,fatalerror9812,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/izo08w/awful_phone_call_quality_in_phonescreen_should_i/,"So yesterday I had my third and last phone-screen for a SWE internship at FANG and I’m completely sure I bombed it.

First, I had a very hard time making contact with the interviewer, she had to call three times just so we could hear something on the line. Then, when the actual interview started, I could not understand many of the questions she asked me because of the poor call quality aggravated by my nerves and the fact that I’m not a native English speaker.

When I finally came to understand the coding question, I was able to code a super-naive solution but then she obviously asked to improve the time complexity. And when I got stuck and the interviewer gave me some hints, I just could not understand what was being said.

I have no complains about my interviewer, she was so patient and repeated herself many times,  she even had to call again when I stopped hearing her (again) but the communication was so messed that all of it was to no avail. 

Mind you I’m not located in the U.S, I’m in another country far from North America. So maybe the signal was worst because of the long distance? Sincerely I don’t know. 

In my previous two interviews the signal wasn’t the best either but I was able to hear the interviewers much better. Sincerely I don’t know if I should bring this up with my recruiter or just let it be. I’m convinced I’m going to be rejected because of this interview so I have nothing to lose, but honestly I don’t want to burn any bridges  / get blacklisted for being a complainer. 

This is my first time interviewing with a company so I’m completely unprepared on how to handle this :(

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!"

I was just curious as to what programming languages you think are relevant to the industry, I'm currently learning Python &amp; Java and I have a good grasp of SQL.

I'm currently finishing up a certificate in geospatial science &amp; GIS technology because my BA in anthropology &amp; geography has been deemed useless by every employer I've applied with since my graduation in 2019, despite having nearly 4 years of experience with GIS analysis.

I’ve applied to literally all the related postings on LinkedIn and in some cases have reached out personally to the technical recruiters as well but so far I’ve received the OAs only from RobinHood and DataBricks (code signal) and both of them rejected me eventually. Only solid lead I have is from HubSpot and I’m waiting to hear back for the final round from them which will be next month. I got HireVue from BofA which I think I have aced, so hoping to make it to their SuperDay. None of the FAANG I have applied to have gotten back to me it but they haven’t rejected me either. I have been seeing posts lately about people getting OAs and even getting to the final round for Lyft, Amazon etc. and that’s a tad depressing.

izrbpk,3,2020-09-25,Does this computer science course list look good or should I be concerned and consider transferring?,ScaredOfLife666,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/izrbpk/does_this_computer_science_course_list_look_good/,"  [http://www.longwood.edu/computerscience/computer-science-course-listing/](http://www.longwood.edu/computerscience/computer-science-course-listing/) 

I've been heavily thinking about transferring since my current university doesn't offer as many internship opportunities and is a smaller and lesser known school in my state but I am having a hard time telling if it is truly worth it to transfer.

As a freshman right now I pay around 4-5k a year for my current university and may pay even less after this year but transferring to GMU or VT would make me have to pay around 20k-30k a year, forcing me to take out loans. I'm mostly trying to see if my current curriculum at my university is a good one as I can't really tell in all honesty, so that's why I wanted to get input from other cs majors who potentially have more knowledge.

Does this course list look good?

I've been heavily thinking about transferring since my current university doesn't offer as many internship opportunities and is a smaller and lesser known school in my state but I am having a hard time telling if it is truly worth it to transfer.

As a freshman right now I pay around 4-5k a year for my current university and may pay even less after this year but transferring to GMU or VT would make me have to pay around 20k-30k a year, forcing me to take out loans. I'm mostly trying to see if my current curriculum at my university is a good one as I can't really tell in all honesty, so that's why I wanted to get input from other cs majors who potentially have more knowledge.

I really hate that that is the only advice that people give or believe that is remotely true. It is completely untrue that you HAVE to start in Help Desk to go anywhere in IT and the fact that this subreddit is littered with it is ridiculously shit advice. 

It just sets up people for shitty jobs in the bare bottom of IT, making shit pay and getting stuck in a position that they hate for a while. If you have a bachelors degree in IT, CS, IS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO INTO HELP DESK. If you are a student, get an internship and you will surpass help desk all together. 

I recently graduated with a degree in IS and had a software dev internship at a fortune 500 company and I applied internally for a position in Info Sec as an Analyst and I got it. There were 8 other candidates and they were all guess what? Help Desk. 

Another employee on the team told me after i got the job that the people working help desk never get these jobs and they give these internal hires to other fields even if it’s not InfoSec because people in help desk have a mentality to just do what they’re told and not actually learn on their own, or have creative problem solving skills. This is the mentality that breeds from doing tickets, being a help desk tech etc. and honestly it can fuck up their careers entirely. 

So for every answer on this sub to be just go into help desk to start it’s not in the slightest bit true that that can be your only career path, work hard and be where you want to be don’t settle to be help desk making shitty money and slaving away if you can teach yourself and get other positions not in just general IT.

izu0bc,7,2020-09-25,tips for freshman CS majors?,[deleted],ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/izu0bc/tips_for_freshman_cs_majors/,"heyyo,

i've been struggling a bit with knowing what opportunities i should be taking as a new cs major. my schedule is honestly already packed, but i'm afraid of falling behind in regards to making my resume look good for future internships, which will most likely be in my sophomore year. 

i know that uf has a pretty large amount of opportunities for cs majors, but when the time comes to actually attending a career showcase and trying to obtain an internship, what exactly should i have on my resume by then? is it clubs? side projects? should i join other clubs that i'm more interested in, like philosophy and music, or is that just wasting time? i honestly have no idea. i don't want to burn myself out, but i also don't want to risk falling behind or ""missing out"" either.

\*btw, i've been told to do so many different things, like attending swamp hacks, joining a variety of different cs clubs, getting a minor, working towards certificates, doing side projects, and much more. i'm sort of indecisive with things, and all these options are getting me pretty overwhelmed. i have no clue where/how to start, or what's important among all of these options.

any advice/tips would be appreciated!"

* Expected to graduate in 3 years exactly, graduating spring 2021
* ECs:
   * Research assistant for 2 years in the field of machine vision (time commitment: 4 hrs/week)
   * Remote software engineering internship at a heard-of company (45k employees) during this summer, the summer between 2nd year and 3rd year. They offered to extend me part-time until Jan 2021, which I accepted.
   * On the officer team for my school's robotics team, been a part of the team for all 3 years, promoted to an officer my second year (time commitment: 8 hrs/week)
   * On the officer team for a CS club, we hold workshops on things like app development, interview prep, etc. Was a member of the club last year (joined second year), promoted to officer this year. (time commitment: 2 hrs/week)
   * Was on the grading team for 2 CS classes and a tutor for 1 CS class over the course of the past year
   * On a non-competitive dance team (time commitment: 1 hr/week)
* Letters of Rec:
   * One from my manager at the internship
   * One from the professor I'm doing research for
   * One from a professor I took a class with last spring, and I'm auditing his grad class in the fall. Plan is to take an undergrad class he's teaching in the winter, but this will be after admissions deadlines

I think my weakest points in my profile are my GRE scores and the fact that I'm coming from a not-so-well-ranked school. I'm currently trying to narrow down which CS programs I have a shot at applying to, my list right now consists of \~30 schools, which are the UCs and the typical T20 CS programs in the U.S.. I honestly have zero clue where I'd have a good chance at getting into, especially since this year a lot more people are gonna be applying due to job economy. So I'd appreciate any and all insight into where you guys think I'd have a shot at getting into. Thanks so much!"

Am I on the wrong path?,kuzubitchi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/izvc1c/female_graduate_of_a_computer_major_who_has_no/,"I'm a recent Computer Info systems graduate from a decent university. I studied different subjects for five years and also got an intern earlier this year before my last semester ended. I pursued this major not because I was passionate about computers or the tech industry, but because I knew that I could get away with doing other things (aka my passion, which is drawing and writing stories) in this major. I aced most of my classes because working hard was what I did best, but I forget everything easily so all of the things I studied I've forgotten already. Now that I'm out of school, I feel stupid and useless. I feel like I'll never qualify for any job because I don't really know how to do anything anymore (from programming to systems analysis, etc.)

 

I've thought of what I could potentially get into after I graduate. UX/UI design, game design/developer, anything in the creative industry. My real passion lies in art, writing stories, creating something. That's what I want to do in life and I thought I could integrate it easily. And recently, I've also been getting interested in looking at cool gaming pc builds and mods. I'm not a big gamer (I only play Overwatch) but I just fall in love with the way PCs look and all the things you could do with it to make it even more beautiful! it made me feel like I could actually become part of the industry if I get into it and learned how to build/mod PCs for a living. But the problem is... 

I don't know if I'm only chasing after daydreams again. It's like I'm infatuated with the idea of becoming someone who's working in the fastest-growing industry, but the reality is these little infatuations and interest are temporary, and that I'll never be happy with what I choose to settle on. (It's like I'm in love with the idea of being in love, not with the person.) I'm scared to be wasting my life chasing after dreams I'll never achieve and give up halfway through. 

What should I do?

Do you think I made the wrong choice of picking computer major? Am I a bad person for choosing a path I'm not completely invested in? Is being a gaming pc builder/modder an ""actual"" job that exists within a certain niche? What are the qualifications of being one?  Is there any hope for a person like me who can't figure out what she wants out of this degree? 

I would love to hear your thoughts and stories."

Decided to switch gears and try computer science because I'd always been interested, however this semester has been really overwhelming with only 4 classes and just living at home plus i was really burnt out from my engineering degree as I'd been taking more than required classes every semester and it caught up to me with a crash. now i can drop all but one class and take some sort of break this semester and still catch up next semester, my plan is to do some studying on my own for the classes i know I'll be taking next semester but without the stress of deadlines. 

I don't have any experience in coding but i am interested in cybersecurity or data science. can anyone suggest any certifications or any type of thing i should be doing right now, I'm very scared I've run out of time as i haven't had an internship or skills n experience yet and i don't have any computer science experience to apply for one.
My mental health has absolutely tanked with all these fears holding me back and I don't know what my future is going to hold and i need to get a job in 2.5 years.

Business Information Systems),nsh1995,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/izx2dp/what_entrylevel_jobs_should_i_be_looking_for/,"I'll be graduating in December with a BIS degree, and have been applying for jobs for the last month or so. I initially planned to study marketing, but during my junior year I took an intro to Java class which I ended up enjoying. It was tough to jump straight into Java, considering I had no programming experience, but I liked it enough to switch my concentration to Information Systems, thinking it would be a good balance between CS and Business. I took a few different classes covering SQL and Python, and have been doing additional work/projects in my free time to get as comfortable as possible with those two languages. The problem that I'm facing now is that I jumped into my major pretty late, so I didn't end up doing any sort of analytics-based internships. I've worked a few different sales jobs through college, but I assume that sales isn't the ideal experience that employers are looking for out of a new college grad when it comes to analytical positions. Does anyone have any suggestions on what entry-level jobs may be a good fit with my education/experience? As far as a long-term goal, I've looked into Business Analyst positions that sound really interesting. Any advice on what sort of entry-level jobs I should look into would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance."

Right after finishing my CS degree, I was pretty much given an internship by a family friend. I ended doing alright and got promoted to Junior Software Engineer. I mainly developed C/C++ software that ran on an embedded device. I didn’t develop any Linux drivers or do any super low level stuff. 

Fast forward a year and a half later to February 2020, and my company has massive layoffs, including me. I got a great separation package, so I just hangout for a bit and help my family’s restaurant business during crazy COVID times.

Now I’m not sure what to do. I don’t have enough hardware experience to be an embedded engineer, which most C/C++ positions seem to be. I’ve been applying for entry level positions that use C/C++ for months. 

I wasn’t a good student in college. I’m stuck now realizing the hard truth that I have no skills. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do? I was thinking I should learn full stack web development, but I’m worried if companies won’t give me a chance if I say “I learned web dev through freecodecamp” based on other Reddit posts... 

What should I do? I would love to get in the embedded field, but it seems like my opportunity has passed when I didn’t learn any hardware/electronics in college."

After loosing my first IT job because of COVID I had been on the search for help desk level 1. I was using seek and indeed and from the many MANY applications I submitted I didn't get one response.

I found an IT business close to me and even though they were not advertising for a job I still cold called them and sent in my resume.

I got a call back from them and they informed me that they are looking to take on a internship with possibility of full employment at the end. And I will be getting a call to talk further. I don't want to get my hopes up but it seems promising.

So if you're currently on the hunt and not having much luck try cold calling a few busssinesess in your area and send through your resume. I know it can be a bit scary cold calling people but it makes you stand out from the crowd.

I even said in the email I'd be happy to volunteer my time for experience so I guess that also shows how keen you are. I get that it may not be an option for everyone though.

Good luck everyone and keep going!"

But here's the thing, I have no passion for any field in CS whatsoever, I've done a little bit of data science/machine learning and some web development/cross platform mobile and I don't see myself preferring anything over the other, I'm a hard worker so whatever field i choose i know I'll at least be decent in it. I don't plan to work until I'm 50 but for the next 5-7 years i don't mind overworking myself.

So thw big question is, what career path can get me the most amount of money (assuming i actually succeed in it) for the 5 years of experience i spend at it?

According to levels.fyi, software developers at FAANG get somewhere around 200k-350k for that kind of experience, is there any other career paths that could pay more? is there some that will pay overtime for example?

j06szr,9,2020-09-26,Unpaid Internship Advice,mangosIicess,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/j06szr/unpaid_internship_advice/,"Hello! I’m in CA and recently graduated college and like most graduates, had a difficult time finding a full time job, especially due to the circumstances right now. 

I took on an unpaid internship because I truly was desperate for any type of work in my field (which hindsight is 20/20 will never do this again) and thought this would be a good way to get experience. I think this internship is illegal and I’m not comfortable with what they’re asking me to do.  

1. I was not aware I would be the only employee. Originally, there was another intern who also was working but quit and I ended up being moved to her role. Basically, its just me and my boss. 

2. I originally was working on their social media and creating designs for them, which is what the job description entailed. After the first month working on this for them, I was moved to the previous interns role and my job duties increased. 

3. I‘m basically putting in 40+ hours a week. Honestly, I was basically handed a company to run on my own since I’m doing social, content, emails, website, business calls, and company partnering. I’m even being told to write legal documents which I have no experience with. What started out as an internship has become the workload of 5+ separate jobs.  

4. My boss had me change my job description on LinkedIn to seem like I have a “higher” position to those who might see it. This is because another part of my job duties includes connecting with other companies. 

5. I never signed a contract of any sort when I first started.  

6. They claim they are a non-profit but up until recently, my boss told me they are not officially registered. 

7. I’m being told to say specific things to potential partners to make it seem like the company is more established than it really is. 

8. If I quit, I’m worried I will not be able to put this on my resume but at this point I do not have it in me to continue working. Its caused me a huge amount of stress, which no unpaid internship should ever do. However, I’m currently in the process of a huge project (which is the main goal of the company) which will most likely not happen if I quit. 

I’m at my breaking point with this internship as the workload is extremely difficult to handle, especially for being unpaid. I was excited to work in a field of my interest and I’m sad its turned out this way. 

I’m worried my boss will be angry towards me for quitting. I want to know what my options are with this, if it is indeed an illegal unpaid internship? What are some next steps I should take?

TLDR: Unpaid internship has become an unpaid full-time job and I don’t think this is legal.

It has a lot of corrections for this post.

I was surprised to find that when you assign a small integer, for example, `2` to two different variables `a` and `b` and check for their memory location using the `id()` function, they returned the same location.

This was weird, I mean everything in python is an object and every object has an address, but how come two objects even if they had the same value point to the same location in memory if they haven't been told to explicitly? Turns out that ~~python~~ the CPython Interpreter ""interns"" (sort of caches) certain values such as small numbers (-5 to 256) and small strings in memory for faster fetching.

*What are its implications?* Well, it could give you the wrong impression that the operator `is` is the same as `==` particularly if you use them to compare variables storing smaller integers or strings.

Remember that `is` is an identity operator used to compare objects based on their **memory location** whereas the `==` operator is used to check the equality of objects based on the values that they store. And, using them interchangeably could result in some serious hair-pulling down the line.

*Why the confusion?* This confusion could possibly be due to how ""pythonic"" `is` looks. I mean it sure looks appealing to use `a is b` when checking whether they have the same values given that statements like `x in y` and `p or q` are quite frequently used.

As a rule of thumb, we should always use the `==` operator when comparing for values. Note that you can use `is` to compare with `None` for equality ~~since it's also interned like smaller integers~~ because `None` is a singleton guaranteed by the python docs and you should actually prefer using `is` for testing identity with `None` (Thanks u/severe-olive for pointing it out)."

I am also debating on going back to school to complete an MBA which would be really useful if I open my own event planning business.

1. Everyone: Have you changed or added a second career? If so, what was your first career and how did you transition to your second? 

2. Teachers: If you are a teacher or have been a teacher, have you added a second career? What has that been like on top of your teaching load? Have you utilized our summer vacation or holiday breaks to really dive into this career?

3. Event planners: how do you enjoy your job? Do you own your own business? Do you have any recommendations, words of wisdom, or hard truths that others don’t share?

j0cv0x,1303,2020-09-26,Exempt Mr Bigshot,BaronIbelin,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0cv0x/exempt_mr_bigshot/,"Responded to an AskReddit with this story, and it was suggested it would fit in over here (fixed some formatting).

TL:DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at my company's HQ. We support probably over a hundred users that have medium/high-profile articles written about them, plus their assistants &amp; interns.

For those unaware, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 in January this year. For us folks in the industry, we knew well ahead of time and upgraded all machines to Windows 10 accordingly. I've been involved in W10 upgrade projects at other companies since 2017- across the board upgrading to Windows 10 has been **non-negotiable** once IT decides to make its move.

Current company decides at roughly the end of 2018 to start moving all remaining W7 machines to W10. Emails are sent to ALL employees, signed by CEO/CIO. This is coming from the top guys in our *entire industry*. We're having global IT meetings on Zoom every 2 weeks to discuss progress. Our office's remaining W7 numbers are going down- we're still sending emails every couple of weeks as a reminder to those who haven't switched that they need to coordinate with us to get it done.

  
Cue Mr. Bigshot who is *clearly* exempt. With 7 months to go, he starts emails my manager saying he can't move to W10 because his current setup is too specific, W10 is a PoS etc.  Manager replies stating this is non-negotiable, gives him the January deadline.

  
After he gets the next reminder email, Mr. Bigshot contacts his boss, says the same thing. Boss points out that the rest of their team has managed the switch, and that the top level of the company is asking this.

  
Next reminder, and he heads down to our in-house IT assistance and tells us he needs to speak to our manager and get exemption because, well, he's a Bigshot. Manager states exactly what was said in previous email.

  
We reach 2 months out. In our global IT meeting, we're told we can inform users their machines will be cut from the network if they don't make the switch. We're given the full backing from the top of the company to cut people off once January 14th 2020 hits.

Bigshot emails one of my coworkers to come up and speak to his admin. Admin explains Bigshot's exemption status. Coworker explains the cutoff threat.

  
It's the new year. Bigshot goes to the head of his department stating he is exempt. Dept. head asks CIO if there are exemptions. CIO is very clear.

  
It's Jan 14th, 2020. Coworker who spoke with Bigshot's admin pulls the plug. Bigshot's network access is gone. I'm at the in-house IT area. Bigshot's admin comes down and shows me the laptop, explaining he can't connect to the internet. I take one look at the machine, put on my ""I haven't heard that name in years"" face, and act super surprised that there's a computer still running W7, given how much of a security risk it is to the entire company, and that we've made IT's position very, VERY clear over the past 12 months. I tell her I HAVE to take the computer and upgrade it immediately. It's going to take the rest of the day and he'll get it back tomorrow. I call coworker over, and hand him the machine. Admin heads upstairs and explains to Bigshot.

Bigshot immediately complains to dept. head, who chastises him. Dept. head calls my manager to apologise, thank us for our patience, and gives us his full backing to do as needed with the machine.

  
I checked our ticket history yesterday- we haven't had a ticket from him in 9 months.

**TL:DR:** Bigshot thinks, despite numerous reminders for 12 months, that he's exempt from upgrading from Windows 7. Spoiler: &gt;!He isn't. Gets cutoff from company network.!&lt;"

Ellen enjoyed jump space. When she had a body it had been something to fear, when she'd been encased in a synthetic life-support droid, shed found it more a curiosity than anything else. But as she progressed from a droid body to that of an entire star ship she found the eddies and waves of jump space to be wonderful. In a similar way to flying a fighter craft through asteroids she flew through gravitational eddies. She rode the waves of jump space flying faster and further than any organic ship pilot could. Type 9 giant here. M class star there. White dwarf. Binary star. She knew them all by their own distortion of jump space and the veins at the front of her ship self altered the field protecting her from its rigours and steered her around each one.

“when will the pain stop?” Nakikalik asked, he was alone so she assumed the question was directed to her. Inside his private room Ellen couldn't see him but she could hear everything well enough.

“hopefully within a few days. Your nerves are taking completely different information to what they're used to.” she replied. She empathised with the Alien soldier, after all she knew what it was like living in a prosthesis.

“want to take it out on someone?” she asked after a few moment.

“what do you mean?” Nakikalik asked.

“a fight. Do you. Want to. Fight.” she asked slowly. Outside the room one of her droids moved to the door and opened it.

“yes.” he said opening and closing one of his robotic hands.

- - -

This fucking droid was fast. Nakikalik thought as he tried to grapple the thing again. They'd been at it for a while now, the droid had won every bout so far but he'd gotten a few good swings and kicks in. each one hard won after backing the machine into corners, beating past its guard or simply bull rushing the thing.

“not bad.” another droid suddenly spoke from the rooms entrance. This was the flesh golem wearing a dead aliens skin. “how do your arms feel?” it asked walking into the room, at a silent order the combat droid walked to the edge of the room.

“they still burn.” Nakikalik answered walking to his pack and pulling out some water, he trickled it over a cloth and wiped it across his exposed chitin careful to avoid getting it close to the swollen joints where metal met flesh and plate.

“it took me years you know. When I woke up in, well it wasn't this body but it was close enough. Chess, the AI who saved me, he manually blocked each and every pain signal for months. When I asked him to stop all I could do was scream at first. But it got less and less until suddenly it was gone.” the droid said stalking into the ring growing taller as it did until she was looking at him eye to eye.

“I don't envy you. Did it hurt? The operation?” he asked her putting down the cloth and circling her.

“I was near death when it happened. I couldn't have felt pain even if I wanted to at the time. But again, your an alien I have limited data on your genome, even with the ok from your medical 'squire' it was safer to suffer a little pain then than a lot more in the future.” she said stalking forwards and lunging at him. He nimbly stepped backwards before dancing to the side and trying to strike back.

“How do you know your not some AI pretending to be this Ellen you used to be.”

“An AI would be smarter.” she said jumping and launching a furious double punch. Nakikalik raised his arms and took both blows to his new limbs. Pain lanced through them but it was a good pain, real pain.

“An AI wouldn't need to feel anger, pain, loss, frustration.” she said taking a swing with each word.

“I cant make that choice, they can shut it down, become cold and logical or loving and caring as they please.” she carries on launching a faster and faster assault. Nakikalik retreats as fast as he could but she's quicker and he starts taking blows on his sides and chest as she slips his guard again and again.

“And when you start to see your own people as alien, inferior, young and stupid the only creatures in existence who you can relate to just want to keep serving those same stupid things!” she shouts launching herself at him. Before she can strike though the combat droid is there grabbing her and throwing the Golem to the side. 

&lt;Lethal intent detected. Interception complete&gt; it says in a deadpan voice.

“See what I mean.” she grumbles picking herself up and in a very organic motion rubbing the damaged elbow of the golem.

“Would you like to hear some of the Faith's scripture.” Nakikalik 

“Not really.” she replies.

“It might be enlightening, you know you fit the description of our Goddess quite well.” Nakikalik says.

At this she pauses. “go on then.”

“The faith don't believe in some being so far beyond us that its incomprehensible. She's a real thing. Something yet to come or who has come before. She's our great guide, a warrior who will go out of her way to help, even those who should be her enemy. This often hurts her more in the long run but its also gained her unexpected allies. Mortal enemies who once she'd beaten them down where instead lifted up to great heights. My people where one such enemy according to our own variation of the scripture. There where two others. Her own people who became the heralds of her word and teachings and the ship weights. They built the first temple ships in her flagships image and when she left the three founding races stayed behind and founded the Faith. Sound like anyone?” Nakikalik 

“...yea, she does.” Ellen admitted. Whilst Nakikalik had been speaking she'd returned to the mat and sat down cross legged. It reminded the hulking Paladin of hatchlings in nursery, their chitin still soft  as they rapidly grew so they could contort themselves into positions their elders could not.

Nakikalik knelt on on leg and began to tell Ellen the first tale he was told as a child. “when she first arrived at our galaxy our Goddess was beset on all sides, great empires wanted her power, fledgling races begged for her protection demanding she save them and strike down their enemies, even if those same enemies were only victims themselves. She saw amongst them all a single race, they where scattered and separated from their brothers and sisters. Hunted for sport or kept as slaves. In them she saw something great. So she freed a group of slaves and took them onboard her ship. Taught them how to use the tools she gave them and found them a safe place to hide, when she left they got to work. They built a great city and at the city's centre they build a great ship. As she returned with more of their people the city and the ship grew. One day when she arrived she found the city, its great temples and palaces empty, instead flying high above it in orbit was the first temple ship built in her image. The people declared themselves the great builders and offered her their services” Nakakalik paused to take a drink, the Ellen bot shuffled and opened its mouth to ask a question but thought better of it.

“That's the story of the first faithful. A species wronged, protected and lifted to higher purpose. In some versions the leader of the builders was taken back onboard the Goddess' ship and given instruction. He returned as the first Divine. They are people of the faith in direct service to her.”

Ellen gave a very human sigh. “you know, when you get old enough people stop telling you stories.” she says as she stands up. 

“I'll leave this droid here if you want to fight some more. LG unit, set difficulty to medium.” she orders before walking out the room.

“confirmed, setting changed from easy to medium.” the droid answers in a deadpan before walking to the ring and picking a fighting stance.

Nakakalic frowned. He'd been giving all he'd got and he was loosing to a bot on easy mode?

- - -

Ellen kept an eye on the soldier as he got put on his ass again and again, almost casually she darted past a dwarf star roughly the same size as the Sun. a few more hours and they were nearly at their destination.

Ellen thought over the story, there were indeed several parallels. But by all accounts these weren't slaves. The Faith, as much as she'd seen anyway seemed to be about unity and co-operation between species.

“Naim.” she asked sending her focus inwards again.

“yes Mothe..uhh captain.” the small rat replied. He was in the front of her ship-self with Mick replacing a section of power cable.

“what is the faith.” Ellen asked the rat man.

“MMM...captain should ask Paladins or High hands. They know better than Naim does.” he answered quickly sticking his head into a conduit and trying to work.

“I've asked them already. I want to know what the Faith means to you.” Ellen presses.

Naim doesn't answer right away. “Naim was happy on home world. Naim built houses, did power for houses...Faith comes and asks for many to join them, build ships. Work on ships. Say treated well, see the galaxy, paid good so home is safe and wealthy...Naim was happy at home. Naim scared in faith, Not so scared here.” he answers briefly pausing to pet Mick. 

“They didn't give you a choice. Did they.” she asks.

“Always had choice. Could stay, build houses, let mother and brothers and sisters starve. Build houses doesn't bring food. Faith bring food. Take Naim, Take others. Is how thing are.” Naim answers.

Not so unified and co-operative then.

She spent a few seconds looking for Namke, he was being escorted to the reactor by a pair of drones. 

&lt;Namke, could I have a word before you do your tinkering.&gt;

“Of course. Not like I can say no.” Namke. 

&lt;No I suppose not...Tell me about the faith. Not its scripture but how it operates.&gt;

“hmm a vast topic to be fair. Where shall I begin. First there are the Divines and the Papacy. They rule us, the divines are more like a government within the government however, their job is the bigger picture. To make sure the Faith keeps to its path and doesn't stray too far. A Pope will be part of the Papacy, once the Faith's territory became too large for a single pope to oversee it was decided to split the faith in two, with each pope handing half and working together. Then it was split in four. Then eight. It currently stands at 64 sectors of space overseen by a pope who is themselves part of the papacy.” Namke says as he walks. He'd picked one of the droids to talk to and was animatedly discussing his topic.

“so beyond that, each Pope has his Bishops and they have their Patriarchs, who protect key points of infrastructure that a Bishop may have under his domain. Then there's Fathers who will manage colony's, ships, and many other points of authority. And finally Hands, palms and digits. Which are various ranks of people who handle the day to day running of the empire. I for example am an engineer. My rank is Hand because I was part of a team, I served a high hand who intern served a Father. I managed teams of Digits lead by Palms.”

&lt;and when you encounter a new species&gt;

“curious about our resident tunnel rat? Its ok. The faith is in a near constant state of exploration, conquest and uplifting of species. We encounter a species, and have them select the best of themselves to undergo initiation and began teaching them the Scripture of Faith. The rite of initiation is a harsh one, for his species more so. Apparently a good number of their people committed suicide during the process. They where too primitive so now they're being uplifted. It is the way of things.”

&lt;and the conquest?&gt;

Namke gave a shrug. “some species do not wish to join the Faith, but having to guard internal boarders as well as protect from external threats. Many species are thankful for their forceful addition to the Faith after a generation or two.”

&lt;we're almost at our destination. Return to the living quarters. Thank you for your time Namke.&gt;

Ellen had much to think about for now, but she could also feel the upcoming star. A good yellow star. The jump drive spires of her ship began pushing against the fabric of space around her slowing her ship self down. 

- - -

Nakalak ran to the nearest terminal when the announcement came. It was weeks to early. They should have had to stop off a dozen times as they jumped from star to star. Even at extreme jump ranges there where only one or two skips that should be possible.

He's managed to get the terminal running when they jump exit came. Shaking his head to clear the haze of arrival he glared at the terminal daring it to lie to him, daring it, her. But there it was, symbols coming up as ships were identified. A small red-yellow star with three planets in the green zone, one dead centre, one at the hot edge and one just shy of the cold edge. Yellow deserts, green forests and icy tundra's dominating the respective planets. Above each planet survey and research stations orbited. Further out a single gas giant just shy of becoming a star in its own right. A harvesting station in low orbit was tethered to a much larger structure, system fortress, shipyard and supply dump all in one this frontier defence station was undeniably their home port. The station was only host to a handful of patrol ships of the same class as Wandering Flame. 

They still had a good day before those ships even saw our arrival.

&lt;Want to announce our arrival?&gt; Ellen's voice comes from the terminal.

“they need to know you're not hostile. And that our brothers and sisters are not returning.”

&lt;very well. Press the button and I'll record a message to broadcast.&gt;

Nakalak nodded, took several deep breaths as he collected his thoughts.

“This is Paladin Nakalak of the Deliverance of Light, Father's Wandering flame, Light of Allerak and Deliverance of Light are dead. Almost all hands lost. The Flotilla led by Patriarch Barthos...is lost with all hands. The engineer's from the Wandering flame and Allerak are onboard. Total survivors, just under 200. This ship intends to drop us off at a convenient location... recommend the system defence station make ready to receive us.”

- - -

Bishop Faiths Sentinel fumed as the broadcast came in, deep in the system was a heretic vessel, docked at the systems defence station and by all accounts unloading survivors of some yet unknown calamity. The Civilian sector reporter, a palm rank at best, was energetically reporting on the situation, an advanced civilisation this. Welcome addition to the faith that. Technological advancements, ships the size of the earliest temple ships! It made her sick to her stomach.

“time to intercept.” she demanded of her high Father. They'd both been present on the bridge at arrival and thank the Goddess it had been so. Not having to manage her ship and the tactical situation at once was a god send at this time.


“we dropped out at a close point, it'll see us inside 3 hours. We're a day or more distant at full acceleration. It has to die doesn't it.” her Father replied.

“despite its actions. It is a heretic ship, it must be purged before it can infect the faith with its cancer. And before it starts searching for this 'her or she' that the other one demands.” Bishop Faith's sentinel shakes her plumage, making her feathers stand up and give her a much larger appearance than her normal sleek elegant features. “bring us in.”

- - -

Nakikalic stood next to the small rat engineer as the others filed down the stations docking umbilicate. The Southwind was too large to fit into any of the stations docking arms, even the battleship scale one, so a scaffold of steel and flexible plastics had extended out from one side to join the dreadnought, several hundred meters of plastic wrap, steel and alloy support structures served as an atmospheric seal and lifeline between ship and station. Faithful bounced and floated along the corridor in two's and three's squires and Paladins using their suits propulsion systems to guide portable reactors and other equipment through the shaft.

Nakalak arrived carrying a wounded on a stretcher. He paused at Nakikalic. “feeling doubts brother?”

“not doubts, no. but...there's a thought nagging at my mind, perhaps out interpretation of the scripture is...in need of a fresh look.” Nakikalic answered one robotic hand massaging the mailable metal of the other. “I'm staying onboard. For better or worse.”

“Then Fair well Brother, I don't understand your choice but I respect it.” Nakalak finishes giving a slow nod before carrying on with his wounded charge.

“you should go little one.” Nakikalic says to the small digit.

“Naim should...Now here, Naim doesn't want to.” the small rat. Naim answered.

Nakikalic could understand the creatures reluctance, he was the only one of his kind left of the crew's and whilst the thing was by all accounts a decent engineer, their species pre-disposition for suicide made them awkward to deal with. Nakikalic hurumphed, prey species.

“good to see you.” turning around to the voice Nakikalic saw the now familiar face of Namke. “I take it the both of you are staying? Then you can help me gather the supplies...what you didn't expect to just jump onboard an alien ship without stocks of food, medicines and a few creature comforts? Come on the shuttle's at a hanger already.”

“can the drones not handle it?” Nakikalic asks.

“yes introduce the devout to automated war drones and maintenance bots. Because it worked so well when it happened to us.” the engineer replies.

“point taken. Come on then Naim, I hope you're feeling strong.” he says shouldering his own bag as the survivors taper off. 

“Naim is not strong, but Naim is quick.” the rat answers scurrying into position slightly behind the two taller creatures.

Before they can get to the shuttle bay a droid steps in front of them and a wall terminal lights up. “should I be worried about this?”

on the screen a temple ship and its attendant fleet had just arrived at the edge of the system. Nakikalic was no ship captain, but he could see they where already swinging around to approach the station.

“Probably... I can try talking to the Bishop or Pope in charge.... three hour round trip, this is why I became a paladin. At least my opponents are usually face to face.”

the drone nodded and the screen blanked out. “Last chance to leave.” it told the three.

Naim Fidgeted and looked back but didn't move. Nakim and Nakikalic both stood straight, unconsciously displaying themselves as ready and willing. “then follow me.” the drone finished before turning and running down the corridor. Naim dashed after it, going to all fours as it almost kept pace with the artificial warrior. The two chitinous Faithful had no choice but to lag behind despite their best efforts. After a while the drone slowed itself down but didn't stop running. It ducked through corridors, took lifts and dug deeper inside the core of the great ship until abruptly the quartet arrived at a single door guarded by layers of shielding turrets and armour. With the grinding hiss of long unused metal the door opened into a bridge room. Too small chairs were arranged around the curved front wall, each one in front of grouped terminals and display screens.

As the three entered the room the screens came to life bringing illumination, they showed internal view's of the last few faithful hurrying down the umbilical as the airlock doors closed. A close up real image view of the glorious temple ship. Its great spires and weapons standing proud amongst its attendant fleet.

“you cant fight that.” Nakim muttered as he took in all the information. Scrolling lines of observed weapons, structural analysis, identifiers of missile pods, fighter bays and any other weapons the great ship had tucked inside its belly.

“Perhaps.” was all Ellen answered as her mimic drone self walked in and sat In the captains chair. “Paladin, stand next to the captains chair for me. Tell me when you're ready to speak.”

Nakikalic nodded swallowing spit before clearing his throat and nodding. “I am Paladin Nakakalic, the ships captain has rescued us and returned us to our home base. I have remained onboard to learn more of her race and serve as...a guide for her peoples entry to the Faith. To the unknown Bishop or Pope of the temple ship, I ask for you reply and guidance.”

“that'll do I suppose.” the Ellen bot spoke after a moment. The screens flickered and showed the unbiblical detaching from the dreadnoughts hull as the engines spiked.

“show me that one again.” Nakim suddenly demanded. One screen had briefly flickered showing something surrounded by towers.

It flicked back and Nakikalic's heat dropped. He's seen the reactor room before, but here it was in all its glory, a black dot, barely more than a pixel on the screen was surrounded, wreathed in flame as the spires tore energy from the nothingness at the centre of the room.

“A Singularity generator. Breach reactor. Wave form collapse system and jump syphon all in one” Nakim breathed. “each one by themselves a technological marvel. But to see them all in use here, all at once...If the goddess.” he broke of not yet willing it seemed to voice such heresy.

The screen vanished and the ship began to hum. Power was being funnelled to the engines as the dreadnought moved away from the gas giant and space station into deep space.

- - -

Bishop Eastern shield re-watched the message. The replaced arms, the way the Paladin spoke, his eyes briefly flickering from the camera to the screens around him. She flicked over to one of his previous reports. A short recording detailing discipline of a new digit squire. Then to the records of the other paladins and personnel she was being fed from the station. It all fit. The heretic never bothered with such deceptions.

But she might. - the thought came nagging through the back of her mind and charged to the forefront.

By all accounts a flotilla had been sent to intercept this ship and only a handful of survivors had returned.

Yet they where only reporting that the ships had been lost and that this ship had saved them...it wasn't hard to read between the lines. Either they'd never seen what had killed the fleet, or they where scared to tell others that the heretic ship had been both slaughterer and savoir.

“Com's send me a message, system wide broadcast....Paladin, congratulations on surviving what must have been an incredibly stressful ordeal. There are things you do not know regarding that ship and its builders however. My fleet with rendezvous with you and board the...Alien ship.” she said biting off the word heretic and almost spitting out alien.

“...when we have ensured it is of no danger to the Faith its crew will undergo initiation and then their ship returned to them.” she finished flapping to her officer to send off the message. 

And just like that there was nothing to do but wait and watch, as she did though she got a good look at the heretic's ship. In shape and overall design it was identical, even down to the pattern of thick dense hull plates on the prow that hid the devastating main gun. What was of interest was the visible damage and repair marks, clearly the crew had replaced a good deal of the damaged hull plates but had yet to re-etch them. Whether the internals where as repaired was difficult to determine. She decided to play it safe and assume the thing was at full repair. Perhaps even more so than the other heretic.

“your holiness. We have a reply.” the high hand sat at communications suddenly answered interrupting her plotting 

“play it then.” she demanded.

The paladin was still there. Stood to the right of the alien sat in the captains chair. They where still but she could easily see the fear in the Paladin, two drips of what passed for sweat slid down his face plates. The alien stood up slowly and the camera zoomed in on her face. “No. You will not.”

“My Lady Bishop, Do not take this course of action. You have more than likely guessed at the events that happened. It was not the action of a malicious or vengeful creature, just the panic freshly woken crew under control of a powerful ship. Would you act differently in the same situation. This ship can and will defend itself. And I am powerless, and unwilling to stop it...there have been signs.”

Bishop Faiths Sentinel fumed. The heretic aliens flat denial was one thing, she expected it. But the paladin's deceleration was treachery and heresy of the highest order.

“When we get close enough, I want to bring the might of the faith down on that ship.” she said slowly, clearly.  “give me an open channel.”

“Paladin Nakikalic I accept your assessment, Faith's sentinel will pull alongside your Alien ship and I will come onboard to receive your report and see what compromise can be reached.” she lied, over the years she'd gotten good at it too. You had to lie in her position, the most common she found was “everything will be fine.” as she sent faithful out on dangerous missions, into heretic or pirate bases knowing they'd die in their droves to protect the faith. Some knew the lie as she spoke it, others took it with hope. That kind of lie she never hid, this kind was different, she kept her feathers down and her face directly at the camera letting nothing of the lie escape her perfect features."

I am an Indian student doing my engineering in India from one of the top schools in the country. I am a junior and have done a fair number of internships till now. Because of COVID, my current term has been shifted to an online-only semester, like most other colleges. In addition, it has also been reduced in length and should be over by early November. Given this fact and that Decembers are  winter breaks for us anyway, I find myself with an almost 2 months long break at the end of year. I would like to spend this time working at a startup so as to pick up some more relevant skills which might be helpful for the subsequent summer intern (which I have already secured). 

So I wanted to ask the people here if this sounds like something which can actually happen. I know companies host interns during the winter term from January-April but can companies host interns at such an odd time as well (November and December)? Also, given the circumstances, it would absolutely have to be a remote intern. All these extra conditions have made me doubt if there are any companies which would even bother with internships right now. I know for a fact that large tech companies wouldn't even think about it, but then I don't want to work there either. I am looking for interesting startups which I feel would also be a little more flexible in this regard.

I like to think I have good past internships/experience and technical skills so interviews shouldn't be too hard. 2 out of my 3 previous internships were also remote+international, with my mentors based in Europe/US so I am fairly comfortable in working with/communicating with such a team. It is the availability of opportunities which I am confused about.  If you know any such startups which wouldn't mind hosting a foreign remote intern, please do let me know! I can share my resume with you if you'd like. 

Thanks for your time!"

A little about me: I have recently graduated in June 2020 with a BS in computer science (have 1 internship and a few projects on my resume) and haven't had much luck with job applications and have been constantly applying for the past 3 months. I decided that I should have some backup plan in case I can't find a job/covid makes things even worse.

I am posting because I have had some troubling finding online masters computer science programs that accept students with a 3.0/4.0 gpa. Doing a google search mainly results in something along the lines ""the best online masters schools"" or ""the most affordable online ms cs schools"". I can't really find any statistics on online ms cs programs like you would for in person undergrad schools. The reason I want to do an online program vs an in person is because I don't want to move anywhere rn because of the pandemic and also if I get a job, I will have flexibility with an online program to do my job and get the degree at the same time.

Can anyone recommend online ms cs programs that I would get into with a 3.0 gpa?"

ATL or Houston?,ily_msu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j0id6g/where_should_i_move_atl_or_houston/,"When I graduate college, I am planning on moving down south immediately.  I have a business plan with a friend and we will be working on that (I will be graduating with a degree in marketing and currently have an internship).  I'm trying to figure out where the best place for me to move is.

I feel like Texas' cost of living is lower in general.  I'll probably live alone for my first year (I live alone now in MI).  With Atlanta, I know a lot of people there.  My best friend lives there and a bunch of my other friends &amp; acquaintances.  I do always hear of people wanting to move out of ATL though, and it's slightly more expensive I believe?  I've been there a few times and enjoy it every time.

With Houston, I know one person that lives there and she loves it.  Everyone I've heard that has spoken on Houston loves it.  I haven't been there yet but I've been doing my research and it seems like a really nice place.  The hurricanes concern me, though.  Houston does seem slightly safer for me to live based on what I've seen but I can't necessarily confirm that.

Has anyone lived in both and have an opinion on each?  Or does anyone have any recommendations for me?"

I don’t know what to put for the title of this internship on my resume. As it is a Tech company even they don’t know. Can someone tell me what do you call this role? I thought to put it as a Trading analyst. Does this come under Proprietary Trading? 

Thank you."

I never had an internship (could not get one for the life of me) so I faked one just to pass the course. My grades were poor and I dropped a lot of classes which led me to graduating one year later than I was supposed to. I have no solid job record in my field (two months as product data analyst, then laid off due to pandemic) and now have a six-month gap of unemployment. 

I never knew what I wanted to pursue. Nothing interests me and it seems like I only do things passively. The only reason why I've chosen IT was because I thought it would be easy, pay well and be in high demand. 

It seems like I've ruined myself. I have no goals, ambition or motivation to do any work. I've been living off my parents this whole time as a NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) and it seems almost impossible for me to get any simple entry-level job in data analysis or software development. 

I know something must change. I will probably never get an entry-level job again in the field I've studied for and my chance for a good career path seems to be gone. So, do you think that I should bite the bullet and send my application to McDonald's?"

I’ve been with this company as an intern for 2 years. That was in another office location. When I graduated college and applied for a full time role I asked to be transferred to another office several states away and they agreed. I want to stay in this area as my husband also got a job here.

Well, only one month after starting this job they permanently close the office for the location I work in. Thus making me a permanent work from home employee. I feel like this will be a significant detriment to my career, and that the company will always undervalue me in the future. Also I moved to this brand new area and really wanted to make friends through my job, which I can’t do anymore. 

So I want to start applying for a new job. I am really worried that if I start applying no one will even want to interview me because I’ve only been in the full time role for 4 months. Even if I get interviewed I am anxious to have to explain this situation and I don’t know if saying that I just don’t want to be fully work from home would suffice as an answer. How bad would this look to recruiters? Would anyone even be interested in me?

I am a graduate student and have secured a full time job with google (tech+, not SWE) as soon as I graduate in Dec. my academics are great, have a job, have a girlfriend. I interned with the team I’m going to join, and the team is good. Life is good. 

However, I still don’t feel satisfied. I feel like I’m still not doing enough. When I see other young students with plenty of good internships and getting 200k+ offers, I feel like I failed. 

Now after some reading, I convinced myself that new grad TC is meaningless and it all depends on how I do at my job and grow. So was calm for a while. 

However, I met some people (mutual friends) who are top notch quant traders and investment bankers who are filthy rich even before 30 and the stress kicked back in. Now I’m worried if I’ll ever be that successful. Even if I stick to this job at such a prestigious company for the next 6-8 years, I doubt I’ll ever make a 700k-1mil salary. 

I started questioning my career choice. Was I right in choosing tech/software dev? Is Finance a more lucrative career? I can see a steep growth as a banker (commercial/investment), and with tech its kind of linear. 

I have been told money is not a gauge of success. But my brain has not accepted that fact yet. It stresses me out.

I’m not sure where I want to be 5 years from now. 

Should I still be a software dev? Maybe, I do like coding and development, but I don’t know if that’s what I always want to do. Should I move to a managerial role? I don’t enjoy writing vision and mission statements and similar high level tasks, but I do enjoying leading a team and delegating tasks and strategic planning. Should I start building my skills in finance and switch career after I have paid back my loan and other responsibilities? But that’s such a risky switch? Chances of failure are extremely high and I don’t know if I’ll even like finance. 

One advice I keep getting is, it’s too early to decide what you want to do. People say you have to wait and learn from your current job, have some data to evaluate where you’re going. But my argument is, I would be wasting so much time while I’m waiting. Wouldn’t it be too late to switch career when I’m 30? Wouldn’t it be way harder to be as successful as others who have been doing that all their life?

Why am I never happy with what I have? Have you ever felt this way? Am I being “greedy” by always trying to aim for money? How do I change this thought process? Is my characteristic of always trying to be better than others destructive?

Do I need help? Or is this a common thing everyone faces?"

I didn't even like my degree, but at least I had structure",albatrotter,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/j0ud6d/just_graduated_yay_but_uhoh_what_now_i_didnt_even/,"**TL;DR: Just finished a degree I hated and have no intention of working in the field, but don't have the grit to develop a new set of skills. How do I pull myself together and make something of myself?**

I just graduated from college this week. Not gonna lie, I'm proud of myself. For double bragging rights, it was law school (not as mentally challenging as it's hyped up to be, but the repetitive workload is grueling). Can't say I graduated summa cum laude, but hey, Cs make degrees.

All of you know how hard it is for us ADHDers to do something we hate. And I hated my degree. Viscerally. But I stuck with it because 

a) I ain't no quitter, and

b) I didn't really have a better idea, in some part because

c) my lawyer dad really, REALLY wanted his kid to take over the firm when he retires and systematically discouraged me from pursuing anything else

Up until now, I had an excuse for not doing much in my spare time. I was in a tough university program and needed to focus on that. Deadlines and exams gave me some structure.

But now that structure is gone. School's over, and to make matters worse, the job market isn't exactly friendly to newbies at the moment. As mentioned, I hated the degree. I know people say school is different from real life, but last year I managed to snag an internship at one of the Big Law firms in my country, and it was soul-sucking. I'd take almost any other job before I considered working in any law-related field. I never even liked civics in the first place, I just felt pressured to choose a ""respectable"" career and after math suddenly got hard for me in year 10, law seemed like the only option.

So what are my options now? I didn't hone any marketable skills during my degree, I was too busy being emotionally overwhelmed by how much I hated it. I only got diagnosed toward the end of my degree, but even so, I fucked up by not acknowledging my feelings earlier and changing course.

What's done is done though, and now I need to find something that works for me. I've been dabbling in programming these past couple of months. I like it, it's fun, I don't mind getting stuck on one bug for 8h at a time for some reason. I like that the program tells me when and where I fuck up much of the time. Ambiguous instructions were always a big source of frustration for me.

So if I enjoy coding, what's the problem? In a word: structure. With no deadlines, no externally imposed roadmaps, no one to whip me into shape, I flounder. I go down weird Wikipedia rabbit holes. I spend two hours writing this very post on Reddit. 

Before you ask, I am on meds, and on the whole they're a huge help. Household chores and exercising are a breeze when I take my methylphenidate regularly, but it didn't magically build my self-discipline muscle.

I'm lucky to have both a partner and family who are willing to support me through the transition (financially and otherwise), but I hate being a burden. I truly want to be employable, but with no immediate prospect of starvation and a lifetime habit of coasting through school, I don't know how to get there.

So how do I break out of this inertia? I'm not blind to the fact that I'm extremely privileged and have every advantage I could hope to have, but I still feel lost."

No matter what the hell I seem to do I cannot get an internship. I've applied to about 200 companies the past 2.5 months and haven't so much as gotten a response from 90% of them. The other 10% puts me in either a HireVue (what the fuck, why can't you take 10 mins out of your day to ACTUALLY interview me?) or has me do a trivial LeetCode question thats almost always 2nd semester freshman type questions, and then I get ghosted.

Just looking for a bit of advice here. Some background: There is a company I really respect and I am really interested in working for. I worked there for a short internship a long time ago. Despite the fact that this company didn't have any open positions on their website, I emailed someone who was supervising me during my internship with a cover letter-type email and my CV and enquired whether they would have any positions available in the coming months.

I expected them to say no, but they asked me for a meeting tomorrow! I'm super excited that they're interested but now I am confused as to how to go about this. I have never really applied for a job, so I don't really know how it all works. Actually, in my current (and first) job, the way I got the job was exactly like this. I'd done an internship, I emailed my supervisor from the internship asking if anything was available, they asked me to come in for an informal meeting, and after that 'informal meeting' I was offered a job. They actually didn't ask me any questions and there weren't any open positions for that job either, but based on of my performance on the internship they gave me a job.

Could anybody please give me some advice on what questions I might need to ask, what they might ask me and most importantly... Can anybody have a guess at what the actual purpose of this meeting will be?

I'm not sure whether it will be like an interview or if it's just a chat.

Currently the only question I've really thought of is to ask whether there actually would be an open position for me, but I feel like that would look like I'm assuming they want me to work for them, or maybe it's a no-brainer because they've actually asked me for a meeting?

By the way, the job in question is a client-facing finance job if that helps at all.

So I graduated with a bachelor of commerce back in 2018. I took a few programming classes in my third year but decided I didn't want to waste my first two years of schooling by switching programs, which I regret now as I really liked coding and I really like computers and I think I want to pursue software development as a career.

As I work full time in an accounting field, I'm taking Algonquin College's Computer Programmer 2-year diploma program; it's fully online. I figure it'll give me a good base in programming. I'm just wondering if it'd be worth it to go to university after. I'd be interested in going to York or Ryerson or Laurentian (live in Sudbury currently; parents live close-ish to York and Ryerson) but for either York or Ryerson I would need to upgrade my high school math - I got 57 in calculus and 71 in advanced functions in high school, and you need a minimum math average of 75 with no grade below 65 for York at least, not sure about Ryerson. I'm 24 now and I should be about 27 when I'm done with the diploma, then add another year or so, so I can upgrade my math and I'd likely be 28 when actually entering university. The benefit is that it'd likely only take me 2.5-3 years to complete a second bachelor's since I already have one and I'll probably be able to get transfer credits from university and college.

That's quite a long path, though. I've heard it's possible to get a job as a software developer/software engineer without a degree, but I don't know how realistic that really is. So, I have some questions:

1) Would I be kneecapping my future income potential by only having this diploma? I've heard of software developers making $80k+ easily, is this possible with a diploma? Alternately, is having both a business degree and this diploma going to look good to employers?

2) Would I be at a big disadvantage if I did go to university, given I'd be graduating around 31 and I'd be competing for jobs with 21-22 year olds fresh out of their first degree?

3) Is it hard to get jobs out of university? I won't have a co-op doing this college diploma, but if I did university I would do co-ops or internships in the summer. What are my job prospects like either way? I don't want to give up my job to do a second degree then graduate and be stuck unemployed when I already have a job now...

I've seen a lot of software devs around these parts so figured it'd be a good place to ask. Thanks in advance for your advice, everyone!"

* **Why I want an MBA:**
   * I am interested in finding problems and solving them as efficiently as possible while also preventing them from happening again. I want to be able to apply information in an insightful way that not only improves company performance, but its culture as well. From my understanding, an MBA will assist me in developing business skills that I can use towards these goals (I don't want to be an Excel/Tableau monkey forever; I want in on the decision-making).
* **Why I want one now:**
   * I don't. I want to know if I am on the right path to applying for a competitive program in the next year or so. I want more work experience, and financially a full-time MBA is not feasible for me right now.
* **Target schools:**
   * Reach: T7 programs
   * UC Berkeley Haas, UCLA Anderson, USC Marshall, UM Ross, NYU Stern, etc (only looking at T20 programs overall).

**Background**

* **Work experience:**
   * Marketing/Accounting/Strategy &amp; Operations Internships since 2013.
   * Since graduating in 2019, 1 year as an Operations Analyst at a managed healthcare provider. I was hired directly by the CEO and I report directly to the Chief Performance Officer. My role is basically as an internal consultant for a variety of different departments (finance, ops, case management, etc), and my projects range from predictive modeling to workflow efficiency enhancement. Currently make $75k, on track for $90k-$100k beginning in 2021 depending on some things going on in my company.
* **Extracurriculars and other experience:**
   * Started a virtual tutoring company with 4 part-time employees besides myself.
   * Volunteer at food pantries and animal shelters during my free time.
   * In addition to the job I was hired for, I work as a data analyst for one of the healthcare groups that will potentially be merged into the umbrella of the healthcare provider my 9-5 is dedicated to.
* **Undergrad school/major:**
   * UC Berkeley, Economics BA (2019 grad)
* **Other education/coursework:**
   * Nothing ""official"" since I graduated. I've taken the odd Udemy course to teach myself Python &amp; Tableau.
* **Race/nationality:**
   * White
* **Sex:**
   * Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 720 (41Q, 49V)
* Undergrad GPA: 3.492

I know my GPA isn't great and my GMAT score is decent. I am worried about my extracurriculars/timeline for applying for an MBA; do I need to flesh out my goals a bit more? If not, is. applying for a program beginning in fall 2022 a realistic goal?

Thanks so much!"
j0xk7y,32,2020-09-27,[POLY] rant and advice needed,toastedsobs,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j0xk7y/poly_rant_and_advice_needed/,"\[LONG POST AHEAD\] hi m currently a Y3S2 poly student currently studying EEE and i really need help to choose a degree for uni!

just received my results a few days ago and I'm quite satisfied w my grades although it's not the best LOL (did my internship for S1 - which was a total mental breakdown 24/7 but in the end, got a B and my cGPA is 2.562)

I don't really know where or how to begin so this will b a total mess, sorry!

to start off, I do not like my course. at all.

in the beginning, i was super pumped for my course because i was finally out of my single-sex school and poly was a whole new other world, engineering also seemed really interesting and so, i really wanted to do well. however, a few days in and i felt like i was in the wrong course. i did not take physics in sec sch and apparently your knowledge in physics wld b rlly beneficial during your engineering course. majority of my classmates took physics so that was one of my first few red flags (i felt insecure.) next, i was constantly burnt out after classes every day because i wasn't used to socialising w ""boys"", since i was from an all-girls school and it was a whole 180 degree change. for example, i was the grp leader for my proj and got my grp number wrong (the lecturer was constantly changing grp numbers). the lecturer said it was the wrong grp number and this grp member said ""ya lor you can't even do that because you're a girl"" and i ????? mind you, this grp member didn't do his slides till the very last min of submission (5 mins before LMAO). another example, the boys didn't allow /give me a chance to dismantle an electronic fan (for another grp proj) and i was so ???? they just told me to take pics and i got so annoyed because i really wanted to provide some hands-on assistance. basically, i really felt the brunt of gender discrimination and it affected my mental health A LOT in school.

next, i really dreaded classes because they were rlly hard to understand ever since Y1S1. majority of my classmates were either rlly book smart or understood the module rlly easily through logical thinking (idk if that's the right term i cant think rn). there were modules tht i understood rlly well and modules tht (up till now) i cant understand and usually the ones i cant understand, hold a higher module credit weightage. in sec sch, i knew i wasnt a science girl and really leaned towards language (such as ss and geog) and studying in engine further proved my point. thus, further affecting my mental health. I'm honestly really scared for my final sem in poly because i heard from a senior that the modules are more difficult and i want to cry just thinking about it, esp practical lessons which r my worst nightmare.

from there, my poly life seemed like an endless cycle whereby I'm barely hanging on by a thread. studying seems pointless to me although i constantly pushed myself to focus to do well. i'm someone who gives up really fast when i'm unable to understand a concept and thus, either procrastinate or move on to another module. since it's my last sem in this hell hole, I'm really hoping that i have more motivation to study harder (which is p hard considering how much i compare myself to others who r doing much better and it is v hard to ignore too).

anyways, my poly life isn't the worst because I've done some volunteering programs and also travelled overseas twice. my social circle is REALLY SMALL but most of my friends r from sec sch who r in diff courses n diff poly. i also get socially burnt out rlly rlly fast halfway through Y2S2 which took an even heavier toll on my mental health due to personal and family problems. so, i guess you can alrd grasp how mentally draining my life is in poly LOL.

AND MOVING ON, i don't know what to do in uni.

I'll most probably b doing my uni in Australia like my siblings but i still haven't decided on a major/degree. i hv no interest or hobby (but leaning towards the arts/languages sector since i hv a bad impression through my experiences on STEM and BUSINESS), and i dont want to waste my parent's money by studying a uni degree that will put me in the exact same spot right now. my sec sch friends who r in uni rn seem to b doing a degree tht they like and it rlly fuels my jealousy.

THEREFORE, i hope y'all r able to give me some encouragement/motivation to push through my final sem in poly and also, provide some advices on choosing a uni degree.

thank you so much for those who actually read through my rant :-(

i actually hv more things to rant abt my i cant think rn since uni degree is what's filling my head rn."

I was lucky enough to receive an interview offer from an FFRDC (Federally Funded Research Development Center), and passed the 1st round interview with the group lead.

The job is a Research Hardware Engineer position, and the required skills from the job listing are as follows:

* Prototyping system experience
* Writing software or firmware in one of the following: C, C++, Java, or Python
* Strong written and oral communication

Strong candidates will have experience in two (2) or more of the following:

* Signal processing and data analysis (such as MATLAB or Python)
* Circuit design, including schematic capture and board layout tools (such as Mentor Graphics or Altium)
* System-level design, system architecture, and trade studies

Additional experience in one (1) or more of the following is desired:

* RF engineering (such as radar or designing antennas)
* Sensors and physics of sensor operation• Low size, weight, and power applications
* Mechanical design software (such as SolidWorks or Autodesk)

I have experience in prototyping, C/C++, Python, PCB design, system design, and mechanical design software, but not much in the others listed. I assume that the best thing to do is be honest about what I know and what I don't know.

Next up is a panel interview with 3 of the research group members, which I assume is going to be technical. I've had relevant internships, but the interviews were always behavioral and never technical.

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for what to study up on, potential questions, and what I might expect?

Thanks for any suggestions/advice."

GPA: 9.44/10 (3.77/4) (Till 6th semester)

My engineering math scores:

Sem 1 Math: 98/100

Sem 2 Math: 75/100

Sem 3 Math: 98/100

Sem 4 Math: 100/100

2 Internships. First one in Python/MySQL, Shell. The second was research analyst role and required Data Scraping, Cleaning, Visualization and Robotic Process Automation (RPA UiPath). **Got a full-time offer from this internship.** 

I plan to do one more Internship in December.

So that's 3 in total.

Working on an AI project with a startup. This AI startup has a cell in my college and I'm on its core team. It was originally founded by an Indian professor at MIT. The startup will be providing certificate on successful completion of the project. We are working with doctors to get some insights into our approach. So it's not a research per se, but close maybe?

Implementing already published research papers. So I guess these could work as research projects?

Participated in an AI Hackathon.

Regarding bad GRE score, the night before I had a panic attack followed by only 5 hours of sleep. I knew I could do well on Quants but I was sleep-deprived.

Cant retake GRE due to financial predicaments.

Does my profile look competent?"
j0ziyl,0,2020-09-27,Going back for a second bachelor's in CS after taking a college diploma?,variableIdentifier,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j0ziyl/going_back_for_a_second_bachelors_in_cs_after/,"Hi everyone,

So I graduated with a bachelor of commerce back in 2018. I took a few programming classes in my third year but decided I didn't want to waste my first two years of schooling by switching programs, which I regret now as I really liked coding and I really like computers and I think I want to pursue software development as a career.

As I work full time in an accounting field, I'm taking a Computer Programmer 2-year diploma program; it's fully online. I'm in Canada so I think the closest equivalent is community college? I figure it'll give me a good base in programming. I'm just wondering if it'd be worth it to go to university after. I would need to upgrade my high school math - I did somewhat poorly in high school math and the universities I'm looking at do consider high school grades even for transfer students. I'm 24 now and I should be about 27 when I'm done with the diploma, then add another year or so, so I can upgrade my math and I'd likely be 28 when actually entering university. The benefit is that it'd likely only take me 2.5-3 years to complete a second bachelor's since I already have one and I'll probably be able to get transfer credits from university and college.

That's quite a long path, though. I've heard it's possible to get a job as a software developer/software engineer without a degree, but I don't know how realistic that really is. So, I have some questions:

1) Would I be kneecapping my future income potential by only having this diploma? I've heard of software developers making $80k+ easily, is this possible with a diploma? Alternately, is having both a business degree and this diploma going to look good to employers?

2) Would I be at a big disadvantage if I did go to university, given I'd be graduating around 31 and I'd be competing for jobs with 21-22 year olds fresh out of their first degree?

3) Is it hard to get jobs out of university? I won't have a co-op doing this college diploma, but if I did university I would do co-ops or internships in the summer. What are my job prospects like either way? I don't want to give up my job to do a second degree then graduate and be stuck unemployed when I already have a job now...

I've seen advice to do a bootcamp but I don't know how reputable they are, and again, like with a degree, I don't want to quit my job and go back to school full time if that's not going to land me a job. Thanks in advance for your advice, everyone!"

New account so my friends don’t judge me, although they’ll probably figure out who I am anyway with some thought. 

So I’m graduating from a solid (top 5-10 depending who you ask) CS university this semester with close to a 4.0. I have 2 internships with quite well known corporations and made significant contributions. I also have a lot of relevant coursework and personal projects to support my skills. 

The time has come for me to figure out who to work for and I am facing an issue.

My company I had an internship with last summer did not give me a return offer, and my next best offer is with Company A which I have really good connections with, but the comp is pretty bad (72-78k). I am good friends with two very senior SWEs at company A, and people were all chill that I met. Work life balance is also excellent at the company and benefits are standard. 

My summer internship paid at ~100k. COL is lower at the former, but definitely doesn’t account for a ~25k pay gap. Company A’s tech program assumes you have little software knowledge, which is not the case for me. I would be working at an “associate” SWE level until I graduate their tech development program in 6 months to a year. 

My question is, would it be better to be an all star at Company A and potentially fly up in the ranks having a significantly stronger background than most other employees, or should I turn down a potential offer from Company A (I’m still in interviewing phase) and continue interviewing for the chance at landing a better gig with better comp/mentorship.

Company A has a history of not negotiating very much on offers. 

Can provide more info if needed, thanks."

I have a bunch of other times towards working out and school so I cant dedicate huge hours.

I just wanna share one of my recent interview experience for a software engineer intern role. The email said that it is a technical interview, so I was anticipating a leetcode-like interview. However, my interview was full of concept questions (which I did not prepare). And one of the questions is about the operating system (I haven't studied this course so I was clueless). Right after this question, my interviewer stop the interview and said that it might not be a good fit. And that's the story of this 8-minute interview. I was definitely discouraged at the moment, but later I recovered and understood that maybe it was not a good fit after all.

I guess the primary lesson from this interview is that always learn about the company and what type of interview/questions they have. And tbh, I appreciate that my interviewer cut it short. Or it would be an agonizing 30 minutes of ""Sorry I don't' know""."

So this is my second year at college, the first year I took mainly all general education classes and network design as well as an intro to python class. I go to a community college, and there were no In-campus classes for python so I had to take it online. I am a very bad online learner and I have always been a hands-on type of person so in summary, a professor in the online class didn't even teach but gave us a book and told us to do the exercises there and that was it. I struggled to learn to code, and to this day I don't even know anything about python. Now into my second year, I am taking a Java Intro class, online of course due to the situation, the same scenario with python but I have been learning using codeacademy, and I feel like I can get the hang of java.

I just turned 20, and I feel very discouraged, I see people who are 17 or 16 making large projects, getting internships and I can't even code 10 lines of code without going to StackOverflow. But I really do not want to change my degree as I do not have the finances and I have always been very passionate about technology in general. It has taken a very bad toll on my mental life as I keep telling myself I am wasting my money and time in college without learning. I feel like I am stuck in this situation and every day I wake up I think about this. I want to know if people have been in this situation what did you do, or if you guys could recommend other ways to learn to code other than codeacademy."

I'm thinking that either working abroad or working with tech on very unique projects could give me a new perspective on things and allow me to try something new while still working in tech and making a nice income.

What are my options in that regard? I have a nice variation of internship experience (though not at any FAANGs or large companies rip). I have work authorization for a few other countries and I speak quite a few languages, though so far that hasn't been of much help.

Because of the pay and the amount of things I have to learn, I have been putting so much pressure on myself on picking things up quickly and making an impact on the company as quickly as possible. I have been ridden with guilt because I feel like this was all a mistake and I should be able to contribute more and I feel useless. During my first couple weeks, there was an intern finishing up their internship and they just seem to be much more knowledgeable and confident in what they were talking about making ME feel like the intern. I tried to reason with myself that they have been here longer than i have and it sometimes works. And I have past experiences before but they were at bigger companies and it wasn’t as fast paced and I’m worried I won’t be able to pick things up fast enough.

I’m currently working on a small project and I fear that it’s taking me longer than it should. I feel soo dumb and I want to relax and be patient with myself but I’m so desperate in proving myself. It’s also hard being the only woman engineer.

I feel lost as to what I'm doing wrong, but obviously there is something! 

I recently graduated university from a top 5 school in my country (Canada). I majored in chemistry with an agriculture minor. I completed 4 months of undergraduate research that provided me with good experience and networking. I graduated with a 4-year GPA average of 3.8. I took a 12 month internship working for the federal police gaining a ton of great experience, references, a stellar reference letter, networking, and I came out of it with a security clearance too. The type of work I completed with the police was unique and easily transferable, giving me experience I'm confident very few applicants have. 

I've got some strong network connections through my time in university and my internship. I've got a lot of experience for someone my age and even have very reputable references to back that up yet I still struggle to hear back from anyone. I've taken career courses with resume and cover letter review, I've pressed all of my networking connections, nothing. COVID has either frozen or slowed the hiring process for practically everything it seems. 

I'm at the point where I no longer have the luxury of applying just to jobs in my field or that I properly qualify for. I'm having to turn to retail, or general labour as I don't have many options and bills are adding up. I still can't get a response from even these jobs and I worry it's because my experience is far from relevant or I'm overqualified for these types of jobs. The last job I worked where I was doing general labour/retail work was 2016-2017, so I've got nothing else to fill my resume but my chemistry/police experience. 

It feels like I did everything right. I got the degree, internship, research experience, built networking opportunities, and kept up the hard work to get good grades as a cherry on top. Yet here I am struggling to hear back from warehouse jobs and dead-end retail. 

I'm really struggling now, and I'm at my wits end. Of course I still keep trying and sending applications, constantly going over my resume and cover letter. The point of it all is starting to lose it's impact on me though, and I worry I'm beginning to get depressed."

I don't know, seeing how my parents treat me and my brother differently. I always have to have good grades, do some extra curricular activities and its never enough, never have them just appreciated me for who I am or what I can do. If I'm tired and just don't want to be asked to do much on weekends considering I leave home at 6:30 am and get home 9 pm on weekends im a piece of shit, the fact that I'm more of a sensitive dude I'm a faggot the fact that I'm more of a quiet guy ""weirdo"". When I didn't got in in one of the other good law schools my dad said to me that I'm a ""waste of investment"", ""unworthy of the roof over my head""...

And then I look to my brother, barely making it in one of the worst high school in the city, just sits in front of the TV all day, and literally says ""I don't need to do good in school because our dad is rich"" is treated like he's a fucking superstar. Never is asked to do shit, and if he is he doesn't do it anyway, never put down for anything and always have the approval of my parents for every shit attitude he got.

Once I helped my dad all my summer vacation on his job, and when we were done he said to me ""I don't think you got what it takes"", not a single thank you.

I'm tired of seeking for their approval but at the same time I can't take it anymore. The worst part is that they make me feel like I'm crazy, that I'm making things up and that I'm a jealous person.

When I fight my brother and we insult each other they get mad at me when I say my brother is a bum, that he doesn't put in the work or even that he is fat. But when my brother says that I should have had killed my self when I got the chance (during a time I was depressed around 2017), or that family gatherings in general are so much better when I'm not there they don't say a thing, my brother says that kind of thing to me in front of them and they don't bat an eye.

Sometimes I think I really should have gone through with it and killed myself that day, I'm think about it all the time especially during the covid times when we are forced to be so close all the time and I can't see my friends often (sometimes I believe my friends are the only thing that keep me from doing it).

I hate feeling like that, because my family is rich and I have a house and food and etc, but I can't help it, I just feel so bad for being me all the fucking time and I just don't know what to do.

As the title kinda implies, I am a 30m ex-med student who decided not to practice medicine about 4 months before graduating from med school (this was about 18 months ago).  After leaving, kinda been bouncing around trying out different things on the business/analytical side of healthcare as it seems more fitting of my personality (health admin for 8 months, consulting internship for 3 months, etc.).  Recently a friend of mine working on developing AI for a pharma company put me onto becoming a data scientist with a specialization in healthcare.  From his description of the job, it seems right down my alley as I love the concept of using technology/AI to analyze and interpret massive amounts of data by making sure I, as the coder, ask the right questions in the right way. Obviously, I have the medical knowledge to fulfill the role, but I am concerned about my technical ability, or lack thereof.  I have always enjoyed technology and have a pretty good but basic understanding of computers from PC gaming in my early 20s, but absolutely no experience with coding.  So I guess my question would be, how hard/how long did it take people to feel proficient with coding/python?  Do I need to have a CS degree (or just a strong background in CS) to even becoming proficient in coding? I kinda just wanna know if jumping in head first into coding can lead me down a successful career path, or would I just be wasting my time?

Thanks for reading, any advice, encouraging thought, and/or hard truths would be greatly appreciated!"

Hi all! So I’m a 4th year student majoring in supply chain and computer information systems. I’ve been applying to internships and full time opportunities for over a year now. And finally had an interview and even got offered the position.
 Unfortunately of course due to COVID I go to school in a different country which means I need a student visa. However the time to apply for the work visa (alongside studying) is only allowed to be applied for in the beginning of the semester within the first 10 days and it cannot be applied for without an actual job offer first. So I had to sadly decline the offer. Now, I sent an email to all the recruiters and VP to thank them and how much the opportunity meant to me and that if ever in the near future or when I graduate and you have an opportunity I’d love to join the team. You think I still have a chance with this employer or just move on? 

I mean I have been applying to many other jobs but do you think they’d still want me? 

Anyways so I do have another interview coming up and if I do get that position (a different company) do you think I could let them know that I won’t be able to start right away? I feel like they wouldn’t want to wait for me for a couple months until the next semester starts just for me. They’d rather just hire someone else. 

Sorry for rambling I kind of just wanted to tell someone my story and get some advice. I’d appreciate any and all the help I can get and I apologize if this kind of post isn’t allowed."

I graduated 2yrs ago from a mechanical and electrical engineering program. After graduation, I was unable to land a role in my field but managed to land a role as a Software QA as I had some experience from past internships. I always knew that wasn’t what I wanted to do long term so I started to self learn software programming in C++. 
A few weeks ago I transitioned to a dev role while also taking courses to help with coding. In the few weeks since I’ve started, I’ve struggled a lot and Im starting to wonder if this is the right role for me. I’m finding myself trying to learn the basics before I’m even able to attempt to tackle my task, and even then feeling pretty lost without much help/guidance around. 

I know it’s just the beginning and I expected it to be difficult but this just seems out of my depth. Not sure if I’m just not cut out for it or it’ll get easier over time. I feel stuck and frustrated right now and I’m not sure what do to regarding my career going forward. 

I wanted to see if any of you have had a similar experience and had any advice for me. If this isn’t the right job for me, any advice on what type of roles I should be seeking going forward?

I've been applying for everything from unpaid, tech support, to more junior level positions but I'm just not landing any interviews. I have a decent portfolio and CV but after 50+ applications, I had 4 companies reach out for an interview so far. Two are for unpaid internships and one of those was from my university that always has unpaid internships to offer their students, so it's less of an interview and more of a formality.

I have one interview with a recruiting agency coming up but it's not necessarily for a job. The rest were from regular jobs but I've had no offers yet.

I'm asking what have other job seekers experienced during this time? Junior/Senior job seekers can answer as well. I personally live in Finland so things in the US or your country might be different, so I'm curious about the situations abroad too! 

Personally I'm not Finnish, I'm an immigrant from the US, it could be a factor I need to take into account but then again, I'm not sure as I don't have a baseline to work with."
j16fq2,30,2020-09-28,TIFU by not double checking the date,YangNewZealand,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j16fq2/tifu_by_not_double_checking_the_date/,"Had to go into town this morning for a quick meeting at my uni (no longer socail distancing where I live). I took the bus which takes about an hour instead of driving (parking and fuel are expensive). 
After the meeting was over I found a spot were I could quickly do some work on my laptop. 
Got an email from a lecturer titled ""event on tonight"". 
It was a networking event that had some big names attending in the field I'm studying. Being my final semester this could've hopefully lead to an internship or something. I signed up.
I had nothing to do for the rest of the day and I really wanted to go. 
I came dressed very casual (hoody, jeans, t-shirt). I didn't want to go back home and change. 4 hours on a bus would be tiring.

Decided to go buy some clothes. Went out to the thrift shops. Frist thrift shop picked up an okay shirt and a good jacket for cheap, however the did not match my gray jeans. Next thirt shop went looking for pants. Spent awhile searching, because none of the pants had sizing on them. Went back and forth to the changing rooms (store had a 1 item at a time limit).  The changing rooms are unisex. The bottom of the door about a foot and a bit off the ground. The top of the door is not that high as well. Me being tall my head just stuck right out over the top. Anyone could see that I was taking my pants off and my face. On about the third time I went to the changing room a woman was there with with her two daughters. She had a massive stack of clothes. The daughters were trying things on and the mother kept handing them more clothes. I was getting changed and the mother just gave me an anger stare directly in the eyes. Pants didn't fit. Went back got another pair. This time the only available room was right next to one of her daughters. I didn't realise that. She flipped. ""Don't get near my daughter and take off your pants"". I was freaking. I could not see her duaghter in anyway, because of the wall between us. Got the new pants on. Finally a pair that fitted. I quickly picked up my stuff (Which was a laptop bag, bag of clothes I got the last thrift shop, and my jeans). Opened the door and tried explaining that I could not see her duaghter and nor that I would want to look at her. The Karen was like don't come back then. 

I walked to the check out, still wearing the new pants. Tried explaining to the checkout operater that I was wearing the pants I wanted to buy. She said I have to take them off. I tried to show her the price tag etc., but she didn't budge. Karen was still over at the changing rooms, I wanted to avoid confrontation with her. I had to wait for 2 hours for her and her two duaghters to be done (each time the girls tried on a new item they came out they paraded around in it, and the mother kept going back for more stuff). By the time they were done they worn clothes rack was full with their unwanted clothes (well the floor underneath the rack, she just dumped them their). 
Finally was able to change and pay. 

Went to the mall nearby to buy a hot chocolate and muffin to go. Muffin in right hand, hot chocolate in left. My phone went off in my right pocket. Bags over right shoulder. Tried moving my the muffin bag to my left hand. Grabbed it a bit too tight and bent the paper cup. The lid popped off and very hot hot chocolate went everywhere. Down my shirt, hands and on the floor. 

Older woman sitting at a table nearby brust into laughter, after the frist couple chuckles she started chocking. She had been eating at the time of my misfortune. We just stared into each others eyes as she chocked. I stood there silently, as people came to her assistance. I picked the lid up off the floor and left. Looking back on it what I did was pretty monstrous. 

Walking back to uni an ambulance rushed past in the direction of the mall. Called the number back and the person said they accidently called me.
Luckily my new clothes were fine. 

Had to find a way to put my dirty clothes somewhere. The lecturer who normally lets me leave in his office had left early. Had to go buy a lock so I could stick my stuff in a locker (including laptop so I can't do work). 

After waitng around the rest of the day. Finally the time of the event had arrived or so I thought. I went to where it was meant to be happening. I was wondering where everyone was. Asked someone, the reply ""Oh that's happening tomorrow night"". Checked my phone and she was right. My lecturer had mistitled the email and I was dumb enough not to check the date. 

Went back to get my stuff from the locker. Turns out I locked the padlock keys inside my locker. Can't get anyone to cut open my new padlock until tomorrow afternoon.

The real kicker is that it's my grandmother birthday tomorrow night and her birthday is at my house. I cannot attend the networking event that I got my hopes up for all day. Don't have enough time to go into town and pick up my stuff before the party (have to prep things and if I not there my little cousins will destroy my house). 

TLDR: got invited to an event, but did not check the date. A Karen accused me of being a pedo. Split hot chocolate all over myself. Caused a woman to chock and just left. Locked the keys to my padlock in a locker with my laptop. Missed out on a really important networking event."

j186i7,3,2020-09-28,I feel hopeless and despondent over my career in this economy,StarStar1999,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/j186i7/i_feel_hopeless_and_despondent_over_my_career_in/,"I just. Need to vent somewhere about my career prospects and college and my mental health n shit because I'm feeling really isolated and depressed about the future.

Okay so I'm going into my junior year and I'm in a mechanical engineering program. I wasn't able to get an internship this past summer, I'm sure COVID played a part in that but I also feel partially responsible because I didn't want to start applying to jobs until I knew what major program I was in (I only found out in the middle of last winter quarter, about a month before everything went to shit.

The reason I only found out my major last winter is because my college had multiple rounds of major applications for the college of engineering, and the first one was directly after freshman year. The way admissions are set up, if you get accepted into a major you automatically get appointed to your highest choice that accepted you, and after one year of college I truthfully didn't feel ready to commit to any of my options, except computer which I applied to and *obviously* got rejected.

My freshman year I temporarily joined a CubeSat club and quit after like a month because the tasks they had me managing were absurdly dry and they provided next to no guidance on how to get started, so I don't feel like I took anything away from that experience. My sophomore year I got an on-campus job, not because I needed the money, but because the job was in a makerspace and I could spend a bunch of time dicking around with 3D printers or doing my homework, it was easy and paid well so I thought it was a good use of my time. I also started working out consistently at the end of my freshman year which did wonders for my mental health and self esteem. However between the academics and my part time job I didn't feel like I had enough time left over to try to join another research group or STEM club. The result is I'm concluding my sophomore year with a decent GPA and diverse course coverage, but nothing in the way of experience. My resume is fucking embarrassing because I'm still padding it with shit I did in high school. I'm trying to make headway with this and my current project is trying to make a homemade CNC machine to demonstrate something of use I've done by myself. I have lots of esoteric knowledge I've acquired from niche personal interests, but those don't read great off a resume. My biggest saving grace is that my communication skills are fantastic, my mother is an editor and as a result my writing clarity is, at this level, much better than my peers. (Had to do a bunch of peer reviews in my technical communication class. Also I'm writing this at 1 AM and I'm not proofreading so don't take this as an example). But of course that's almost impossible to demonstrate without getting an interview.

Exacerbating this is the fact that a bunch of my friends seem to be doing well for themselves. One friend of mine is in my major and got an internship for herself this summer. A different one is in CS and got a summer internship at a social media company that got spun into a co-op. She's making 55 fucking dollars an hour. As a junior. A different friend has been TAing for her major the past two quarters (CS again, ME doesn't have undergrad TAs). A different different friend of mine just hopped on a research team one of his old professor's is leading. I'm so happy for them, they all deserve what they're getting and they all worked hard for what they got. But every time I hear of their latest success, I feel a stab of envy and shame. And I feel like I have to hide that around them because I should just be proud of them. I worked at a goddamn hardware store this summer. I made in a day what my social media buddy makes in two hours.

And what hurts the most is it's my own fault I'm in this mess. I should've tried to stick with a proper engineering club. I should've applied for every fucking job or research opportunity I saw regardless of if they required a declared major. I shouldn't have taken the fun job. I should've tried applying to more majors after freshman year. I should've hustled more. I should've worked harder.

But even knowing that, I wonder whether this is even what I want for my life? I spent the end of my freshman and the start of my sophomore year struggling with my mental health, I felt overwhelmed and burnt out with the work I was doing and the stuff I did with friends between work felt good, felt refreshing. This winter quarter is the first time I've felt really happy with my life and felt like I had a good work-life balance, and it was when all I had on my plate were classes and my job. I feel in retrospect I should've been working harder all along but I also know that along the way I always felt like I was working as hard as I could without getting burnt out. Even during the good quarters there were days I couldn't get myself out of bed just because seasonal depression kicked my ass.

I love engineering. I really do, I love the problem-solving, I love the science, I do well in classes and I have a good intuition for studying all of this. But I hate the hustle. Why did I have to choose a career that makes every leisurely moment feel like a waste of time? I feel guilt for every moment I don't spend on the grind. I know college isn't supposed to be a vacation but I really thought I'd have more time to do things I just thought were neat?

This year I'm starting my job search early, but it's the most depressing fucking thing holy shit. I scroll through so many internship applications taunting me with the question ""why should we hire you?"", and I simply don't have an answer. There are thousands of students out there more talented, hardworking, and intelligent than me. If I were them I wouldn't hire me either. I feel like I'm losing at a game I never wanted to play. I apply to the jobs anyway and eventually the law of large numbers will become my friend, but at the moment it looks like I'm going to have to sacrifice my mental health and self confidence in order to maybe push my career forward, and I don't know how long I'll be able to go on like this."

I keep thinking that if I don't sleep today then I won't be able to wake up tomorrow, and then I won't be productive for the whole day. Having insomnia is giving me the pressure to sleep, which makes it even harder to fall asleep.

I've tried melatonin for a while but it doesn't really work when there are just so many thoughts racing in my head. Maybe my dosage was weird, I was using 3mg and I felt very dizzy when I woke up even if I did fall asleep with melatonin.

Right now I basically have trouble sleeping every two or three days. Should I go to the doctors to get a prescription? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

j1cn4p,3,2020-09-28,Are people happy in their CS jobs?,realgmodi2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j1cn4p/are_people_happy_in_their_cs_jobs/,"Hello everyone! My question is how do people in mentally demanding fields like CS stay happy and motivated. From my past experiences, I have had a lot of stress and mental breakdowns whenever I am working in this field.

About me, I recently graduated from a private university in India. I consider myself as a good developer and have done 3 development internships in total. My last two internships were more like a job and I have felt a lot of stress and anger in it. Work was really challenging and it helped me improve also, but it has taken a toll on my mind. I used to get headaches whenever I got stuck at anything while coding. I have had continuous tension headaches since my second internship (which was a year ago). Now as I sit jobless, I am getting more stressed than ever. 

I don't know what to do and how to stop this suffering. If any of you used to feel the same way, it'd be great if you can share your experience and also tell some solutions on how to cope up with it. Thanks in advance."
j1e945,2,2020-09-28,[France] Internships in the US ?,ado000,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j1e945/france_internships_in_the_us/,"Hi ! I'm a student in France pursuing an engineering degree in Computer science. It is done with a 2 year course of just hard maths and physics called ""prépa"" ( those kind of classes are only common here) + 3 year course in an engineering school. I'm currently in my third year, in engineering school , and I have another 2 left. 

I don't know how the curriculum goes in the US, but here, we have to do internships in order to get our final diploma. The first one was a simple worker internship to discover the working environment, I did it this year.  The second one is the one I'll have to do next year. It has to be done as an assistant to an engineer, and has to last 4 to 6 months. The last one will be related to my graduation project and will last half that year. 

Now, it is added that to get my diploma, I have to spend at least a semester abroad ( as an exchange student in a uni or in an internship). I intend to do both. So I wanted to know how things are done generally there. Do you have something similar ? Are internships for undergrads common there, or not at all ? Do you know a french exchange student in that field and how they did ? Are interns paid (In France, if it lasts more than 2 months it has to be paid)  ? I know that the only concern my school has is that I complete the tasks and skills they require and that they have communication with my supervisor. 

Thank you !!"

j1ghox,22,2020-09-28,TIFU by getting too close with my boss,VeniVidiPesce,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j1ghox/tifu_by_getting_too_close_with_my_boss/,"This summer I \[19F\] got an internship in a strategy department in one of the biggest retail companies in my country. I was supposed to work there for three months and then return to my studies.

The thing about that department is that everyone is very young, with the head of the department \[26M\] being the oldest. Everyone else is from 22 to 25 years old. Everyone is also both very attractive and clever, so naturally, I caught a couple of crushes here and there, including a crush on my boss. It's typical for me to have multiple short-lived crushes at the same time, with most of them lasting less than two weeks, so nothing was out of place for me, and due to the age difference and my appearance of a 15 year-old I had not even considered anyone paying any work-unrelated attention to me.

As the end of my internship approached, my boss asked me if I would like to continue working with the department and start a long-term internship, which I happily agreed to. My main reason behind this was that the team was well-known on the market and I would get both valuable work experience on my CV and a possibility to network with useful people. My boss also explicitly told me that whenever I had any career-related questions, he would be happy to answer them.

Fast forward a couple weeks, and I decided to take him on that offer and asked him to stay after work (the department typically works from 10 to 21) and have a chat with me. We spent about an hour talking about his work experience, my career goals and the best way to get into my dream company (which he knew a lot about since he used to work there). After that, both of us gathered our things and left the office, and while waiting for the elevator my boss asked me if I would like to continue that chat and drink something. Being the dumbass I am, I assumed he wanted to go to a bar, so I agreed.

Half an hour later I got out of taxi and immediately realised that there was no bar and I was standing in front of an apartment block. However, I was too scared and ashamed to tell my boss I misunderstood the offer, so I followed him in. There he told me he had changed his mind and asked if I would like to smoke weed (banned in my country), and, since I still was a dumbass, I could not pass on a chance to smoke free weed.

So we are smoking and drinking wine and he is talking about career stuff and I'm slowly getting sleepy (it's always like this when I smoke) when it suddenly hits me that he is talking about *weird* career things now - precisely, he's telling me about how when he was an intern in a big international bank, everyone in his department had sex with each other.

*WTF*, I think, but I'm high, so I do nothing.

A couple minutes pass and from then my memories are hazy, but he leads me to his couch and starts making very clear advances, tells me something like 'don't be afraid', while I'm having a very clear panic breakdown. So we sit like this for a while and he is just hugging me, and then at some point I finally sober enough to tell him I want to go home and beg him to let him go. So he calls me a taxi and helps me get in it, and I go home to wake up this morning and ask myself, *What the fuck was that??*

And obviously, now I have no idea what to do.

TL;DR I was dumb enough to get too close with my boss and misunderstand all his hints, and it ended up with him offering me to have sex."

I have zero confidence and feel completely stupid all the time. I have nobody to talk to about this other than by bf, but there’s only so much he can do for me. I need some sort of income so I can contribute, but just the thought of going out and speaking to another person sends me into a panic. I have taken online classes and they are preparing to set me up with an internship somewhere, but I’m so afraid of going in and looking dumb. I have horrible memory problems and it’s hard for me to concentrate. Any job interview I’ve had in the recent past has been a flop because I don’t know what to say to simple questions and I look visually nervous. I’ve been in therapy before and that also gives me anxiety. Talking to them about my issues makes me feel awkward and stupid. I just don’t know how I’m going to overcome this.

j1igqs,1,2020-09-28,"Feel trapped in entry level, what can I do?",gorillaBBQ,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/j1igqs/feel_trapped_in_entry_level_what_can_i_do/,"A bit of background:

I got a BA from a good UC (University of California) and spent about a year trying to find a job with no luck. Then I had a quick internship in tech followed by almost 2 years in an academic research lab. I picked up python and SQL in the research lab and have been wanting to get into tech for a while now. Then covid hit and I lost my job at the research lab and struggled very hard to find a new one. I (very luckily) just landed a new job but it is much more entry level then I was expecting based on the interview process I had. I am basically a data entry person and I not only feel like I wasted the last 6 months doing next to nothing (because all I was doing was soul crushing job searching) but now I feel like this full time job is going to make me very stagnate and I won't be able to grow out of this entry level role. I am having these thoughts because I just had a conversation with my boss where we discussed possible growth in the company and it seemed very bleak. It looks like I'll most likely be doing data entry for \~a year before even being considered for anything. Also, the company culture looks like if I'm not working on the weekends or at night sometimes I won't really be viewed as giving it my all.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to best take advantage of my situation?

I'm interested in tech, data, and have intermediate python skills. What freakin jobs can I apply for that are not super entry level (to like a patronizing degree), but also aren't freaking data scientist? How do I get my foot in the door for a job where I actually get to grow these skills without having to have like 5+ years experience and a fully fleshed portfolio??

How can I grow in a role that seems very stagnate and won't give me the opportunity to prove myself in other tasks?"
j1ivfr,2,2020-09-28,Asking for referral from past interviewer,scaredalpaca,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j1ivfr/asking_for_referral_from_past_interviewer/,"Earlier this year I interviewed with a company and I actually managed to get the offer, but I ""ditched"" them for another company. The reason I ditched the position was not necessary because of there are more attractive offer but because the company at that time offered internship position and already reached the headcount for full time employee. I even asked them whether it is possible to actually do the internship and basically convert later(this is pre-covid so having this expectation is quite normal) and they cannot promise me that time. This company is not exactly my ""dream company"" but if I were to be accepted for that position I believe it is a few step up in terms of my career progression.

On another note, I really tried my best to building my ""image"" during the past interview on that company. I was usually actually pretty awkward during interviews which actually gave me a hard time to get a job, but what I did take note from people is that I have a strong technical capabilities at least on my level (currently still entry level). So what I did for that interview was they actually gave me an unpauseable 8 hours technical test which I would roughly say managed to do quite well and after this test they actually asked me for feedback (this is just typical practice), so for this I actually gave a lengthy and detailed feedback of the test and actually mentioned some ""oddities"" (It was a coding test so you can say there is absolute answer, not because I was wrong or some sort). I guess this is noticeable for the interviewer and eventually the head of the department discussed directly with me regarding the feedback (quite odd experience actually lol). Onsite interview is decent, I would not say special but at the end of the day I managed to secure the offer, but as I mentioned I ""ditched"" it because I got a full-time offer. So my plan was actually is to try to ask the interviewer (the head of department, I talked to) for referral. At least if I were to get ""boosted"" up to the technical test it already gave me a decent edge since from my past experiences most companies doesn't even bother to reply even rejection.

Tldr; I interviewed with a company, rejected the offer due to it being intern position (I know beforehand but quite desperate and hopefully got full time instead), a full time position in this company came up. Is it appropriate to ask for referral from the past interviewer?"

j1jd80,2,2020-09-28,Hi! College junior here looking for tips/advice on how to get started for landing an internship this summer.,HeyaAya0115,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/j1jd80/hi_college_junior_here_looking_for_tipsadvice_on/,"Hello, first post here! :) I’m currently a junior IT major interested in front-end development. I have a pretty good understanding of HTML and CSS, however, I have very beginner knowledge in JavaScript (which I’m trying to work on at the moment). I do also have some experience with Python, Java, and PHP, but this is only because of my required coursework. Unfortunately, I don’t have much to showcase to employers other than my GPA and my job in retail. I do regret not having worked on personal projects in my free time, and this is something I do want to get a start on very soon.

My concerns are on getting an internship this summer, as there’s a lot of pressure on me to do so. I feel like I’m very inexperienced and thus wouldn’t be qualified for any type of internship by the end of the spring semester. Although I don’t have much time, I do want to try my best to learn as much as I can by then. I would appreciate some advice on how I should get started- or what I should put more of an emphasis on learning. So I’d like to ask for some input regarding the following:

1) I know personal work is important since it shows a passion for learning outside of school! I do want to start creating a few projects with HTML and CSS, but I also want to put aside time for learning JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap. Should I focus on making personal projects with what I already know or learn JS first? 

2) I’ve been doing research on available internships near my area. A lot of them I feel under qualified for, as some of their requirements involve experience with backend languages too. Is it a good idea to still be applying despite this? Should I apply now, or wait until I have something a little more impressive to showcase? 

3) I’d also like to hear about your personal experiences and your process in learning more about development; whether it was in school or self-taught. How did you start, what were some helpful resources you used, and where did you go from there?

Thank you! :) 

tl;dr: Looking to get an internship this summer, but I only know HTML &amp; CSS (and a bit of JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP). Interested more in front-end; should I focus more on making personal projects with HTML &amp; CSS or learn JS or other languages first? Should I be applying to internships right now despite feeling under qualified? And what are your personal experiences and process when learning about development? Ty!!"

j1mtm2,1,2020-09-28,Need help exploring CIT vs CIS,glimmeronfire,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/j1mtm2/need_help_exploring_cit_vs_cis/,"I’m three years into a videography degree, but due to Covid I am taking electives at my community college. I decided to take an HTML and CSS coding class because I really could have chosen anything and I thought it would be a cool thing to learn. Now that I’m partway through this semester, I’m having a bit of a crisis about my future because I’m actually really enjoying this coding class and I actually look forward to starting a new lesson every week. I don’t really feel that way about my current major so I’m not sure if it’s really what I want to do, but I always thought I’d graduate in 4 years so I’m trying to decide on whether or not to struggle through the last of my videography classes and be possibly miserable for the rest of my life, or if I should switch to a computer major.

Now that my life story is out of the way, I was wondering if anybody with computer experience would be able to give me some advice about the difference between CIT and CIS, as my university offers both, and what I might be better suited for if I do change my major.

I did a tiny bit of research between the difference but I’m still pretty confused, and I don’t know which one would be better for me.

About me:
1. Bad at math (I know I’d need math classes regardless, but whatever)
2. I’m shy, a bit reclusive, and not the best with people but the only jobs I’ve ever had were customer service jobs (cashier and barista) so I’m not completely clueless on how to interact with people.
3. I interned for a film festival last summer as a videography intern but ended up doing mostly computer stuff, such as using a DCP program to get the movies ready for the projectors, and I spent quite a bit of time working with the guy who runs the remote servers and learned how to navigate between a few of the ones he had set up.
4. I’ve always had a minor interest in computers but didn’t realize it before I chose my major and started college. Therefore, since my interest was minor, I know quite a bit about viruses (new and old DOS type ones. I think they’re interesting as hell) but not about the physical computer itself or how exactly anything works.
5. I’m also taking a Computers In Business class and so far we’ve learned a little bit about stuff like hardware, OS and file management, software, the web, the cloud, security, web development, and other stuff.

If any other info about me would be helpful to know, please let me know and I’ll be happy to answer. Sorry for the long post but thank you for reading."

I studied abroad in college (Turkey and Greece) and together my husband and I travelled extensively, and moved from rural farm towns, to major cities and the East Cost. We’ve been together 8 years and have a sweet one year old boy. 

My husband and I spent considerable time in England a few years ago and fell IN LOVE. While I particularly love London, we really enjoyed Oxford and the Somerset area as well. 

Here’s a bit about us:
* 26M has a masters degree in computer science, has worked for the same company for 7 years (started as an intern in college) and is most proficient in C++, Java, Python and a few minor languages. He also has two bachelors degrees: one in computer science and one in applied mathematics. He has published research, as well in both mathematics and computer science (if that counts)

* 28F I have a marketing and journalism background, but have devoted my life to religious non-profit work. I currently work for a religious organization and am seeking continuing education in Seminary.

* A side note: my step dad adopted me when I was very young and his father (my papa) is a Holocaust survivor who is originally from Austria. My papa started an international financial consulting firm, which my dad now took over, and he does  business mostly in Western Europe. Unfortunately, I spoke with my dad and he has no way of say, hiring me for marketing, and sponsoring a visa. However, because of my dad’s business, I wouldn’t mind being located close to where he visits frequently which would be Switzerland, France, Germany and Austria."

I've always loved scientific principles and understanding how things work. But as the title says, that isn't where my life has led me. I'm a firm believer in the Mike Rowe saying ""Follow opportunity, not passion"", so I started following opportunities that eventually led me to some computer science classes, an internship, help desk jobs, military service, and I am now pursuing a degree in network engineering.

The biggest roadblock I had was the math. I had some pretty ingrained ""math anxiety"" in school, and I eventually convinced myself that I just wasn't any good at it. So I decided to side-step into another technical field that doesn't have much math at all, but I've always wondered what could have been if I had slogged through a few years of calculus.

I'm still determined to get my IT degree, the earning potential I have for where I'm at in life is just way too good to say no to.  And I genuinely do like solving technical problems and being able to help people in that way. But I also know there isn't much overlap between mechanical engineering knowledge and IT stuff, one side is torque and tensions and the other is computers and electrons. 

So my big question is, is there any way to bridge the gap? What could I do that involves both fields somehow? I've looked some into the maker community, I'd love to get a 3D printer and start tinkering on my own, but I'm cautious as to how much of a career I could make out of that. Is there any kind of professional position that requires credentials in both areas? Thanks!

TL;DR

What kinds of jobs are there that combine IT knowledge and mechanical principles?"

My job as an intern is to create an administration network for my company's servers. The idea is that all administration flows are on a dedicated VLAN. The servers therefore have two interfaces. Administration services should only use the administration interface, and business services cannot use it. I am more used to the Unix environment, and I am trying to determine what are the administration services of a windows server (2012 R2 and above). 

There is obviously the RDP service, the WS-management service, remote registry, ... Any thoughts? I don't seem to find any subjects about it.

I know administration services will depend on server role or function, but I am trying to clear services common to all windows servers.

I have a few questions though  


1)  How hard is it to get an entry level paid internship for someone like me who doesn't have any prior experience in the field if I get selected in a good school for Master's?  


2) How is the working environment? Like is there a good work life balance or people just work all day 7 days a week?  


3) Since I am an Indian, would I face any sort of racism in the country? I have heard that Irish people are the most welcome and loving people but I just wanted to know  


4) What does the growth look like in this sector and what does the general pay look like for a guy who is let's say working as a full time data analyst?"

I am a 2020 grad with an Engineering degree. My competitive landscape is based on the (2) co-ops I've had in quality engineering, and continuing on as a quality engineering intern for the company I currently work at. (Started 2/10/2020 - Present)

My situation is strange I feel. I started as an intern before I graduated with hopes of re-evaluation and being hired on full time. I was/am paid $18/hr for the work I do. My ""mentor"" up until May was tired of working here and moved on to another company, improved title Quality Engineer II.

So as you may have deduced, I am graduated and still hold the role of intern. My company feels like its in desperate need for more Quality Engineers (my building is down 1 and another building as well), but i am at a loss for why they will not hire me and on-board me to fill any vacancies. 

I had an evaluation with HR and my boss that felt more like a cop-out that constructive and/or genuine criticism. But I feel like the cards are not in my favor to fight on my own behalf for hiring and salary increase.

My question is what to do in this situation. I feel like I have little to leverage (relatively green to the industry &lt; 2 yrs experience). But at the same time I dont want to be set under a precedent that its OK to have bachelor's degreee employees not salaried and making less than the GED workers on the factory floor. I put in the hard work, and am not seeing a return for my money and effort to obtain my degree. 

Do you see my side? I feel a bit of injustice being dealt by keeping me in place and not offering open, honest feedback or a way to fill a role that seems very apparently needed. I understand the times and I am grateful to have my job, but I'm also not stupid and I know that my company hasn't hardly been effected by COVID (I work in medical) and most assuredly could afford to hire me. I genuinely am starting to feel taken advantage of for cheap labor. I do practically the same/similar role as my mentor, albeit with less experience, and have tackled some solid projects that should have demonstrated my worth by now.

Let me know if you need any further info required. I will monitor and respond.

Thanks in advance!

Tldr; how can recent grads reasonably be able to leverage their worth to companies and command a respectable salary? What tools are available for disposal and what experiences do you have"

The pay is really good for a junior position and the company is a startup, the job is fully remote. 

I'll be honest, I don't even know how I got the job honestly because I don't think I performed spectacularly well during the interviews. The company mainly works on Kubernetes and dockers, and mainly use Python and Golang. Truth to be told, I have never even heard of Kubernetes and Golang before I started preparing for the interviews, so I have literally 0 experience in them. In addition, during the interview, I asked the company if they offer training and they said they will be throwing a few easy projects at me first and I can ask my co workers, but they won't be offering any formal training.

I am torn. It's good pay and it will look really good on my resume, and I know opportunities is hard to come by during these covid times, but I just feel like I will do horrible at it because I have literally 0 experience in their subject and I don't want to go in and get fired.

I decided to take an introductory Python coding class just due to general interest and because I've heard it's good to know Python as a coding language. It's an elective and I don't need the class to graduate.

Well, my first test went terribly and I failed. I only have a large final project (worth 20% of my total grade) and two exams (worth 50% of my total grade) left.

On the homework assignments, I take 5-10 hours whereas other peers of mine in the course take 2-3 hours. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up to try and get to everyone else's level.

My grandpa died of COVID-19 this semester. It's been rough on me. 5 of my other family members have gotten COVID-19 too. My father now wants to go overseas to see my grandmother (his mother) and take care of her. This has been freaking me out because he's essentially going to travel on a disease tube for 17 hours before heading to a third-world country and staying there. 

If I drop the class now, I can get 20% of my money/credit back. I can spend more time on classes I actually *need* to pass. I can use that time to look for an internship and work on other projects.

My parents don't care if I take the class or drop it. They want me to continue taking it, but I'm worried how a bad grade will look on my transcript and impact my GPA. This would be the only class I've ever dropped with a ""W"" (withdrawal) grade. My advisor/counselor says one ""W"" withdrawal doesn't usually cause concern because there are plenty of valid reasons to drop a class.

I need advice. Should I drop this course?"

Here is the thirty-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

God I wish I was normal, I wish I could go to the supermarket without anxiety, I wish I could sit on the bus without obsessing over the way I breathe or the way my nails look or my hair or my face or my clothes, I wish I could do things without constantly feeling like my heart is going to come out of my throat, I wish I could stop feeling like I can't fucking breathe. 

God I just want to breathe again, I want to walk down the street past a bunch of people and feel nothing. No fear, no anxiety no obsessing over the way I walk, the way I breathe, the way I look. I'm so tired. I just want it to be over.

I could've gone to my internship today. And besides the fact that I have no uniform pants I would've been fine. They would've been nice to me. Like they were when I met them. I could've worn dirty pants, but I used it as an excuse because I got so caught up in my fear that the only fucking thing I could see was being there and being scolded or having them be upset at me. Why, why does my head always make up bullshit scenarios and make me believe them. 

I want to be normal. I want to be normal.
I want to be happy."

I’m halfway through a bachelor of science in Mathematics and Computer Science at my university. I love both of my majors and feel I am good at them and have potential, but I’ve never had a programming internship and I don’t know if I’ll be able to break into the field, considering I won’t be getting an engineering degree. Honestly, I don’t know where to go with it.

However, I found out about a teaching opportunity in my home town (I would be a teaching assistant for a teacher who will be doing combined 6th and 7th grade for the winter). I have seriously thought about teaching, but I wanted to try out computer programming first and fall back on teaching. If I take the job, I’ll have to skip the spring semester and be a year behind all of my friends (sounds dumb but they’re a big part of my productivity and mental health) as well as potentially needing to change my major if I really want to pursue teaching for real. 

For some context about my situation, part of my university’s COVID response was to not let a certain amount of students back for the fall, thus I am at home working as a baker. Also, I’m currently living with my parents and they want me to take the job. 

Am I an idiot to pass this up, or should I stick with what I originally committed to? Computer programming feels much less certain, but teaching feels like giving in."
j2gckk,1,2020-09-30,Leaving for more money/better experience,Rcturbos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j2gckk/leaving_for_more_moneybetter_experience/,"Hello,

Tl:dr: I’m debating about leaving because my pay is subpar to other close proximity cities. Then disliked co workers, lazy co workers is a catalyst for my thought process.

I have myself in a little dilemma which I’m not sure the best route to go is. I recently took an internship in January and transitioned over to a full time SE in May. For the most part I really enjoy it and I have learned way more then I leaned in school. I picked up on new framework and projects fast and was able to implement/learn CI\CD stuff.

The things I don’t like that make me want to leave:(some are minor but I’ll mention them)

1. There are a select few employees that are way to “their way or the highway”. Talked to manager about it helped but not great still. I shouldn’t have feel anger/hatred towards other employees I’ve never had a job like that.

2. Due to the nature of the work it’s easy for people to not do anything. I’ve always been one to want to work fast and get stuff done, but there are people who will sit back take a task and sit on it for literally weeks on purpose and nothing gets done about it.

3. Due to nature of work your job title is only correlated to your years since graduation. I can probably count almost on the daily jr. or interns teaching senior/upper level developers.

4. Pay is sub par, where I live we don’t get 130-180 like most on here claim but 90-130 is reasonable for entry level jobs. I’m about 15 or so miles north of these jobs, and I’m stuck at 70ish. I know if I were to leave and go a little closer to these other jobs I’d get those salaries. 

For the most part tho I really enjoy the job and don’t want to leave but for reason above I feel I would be better suited somewhere else especially where the pay is quite a bit let. I asked about pay increase/promotion and they said I couldn’t until 2022.

When is it worth taking a big pay increase over dealing with less money for a better experience? (Not that I don’t think I would like a new job but just a possibility).

I’ve also been interested in learning/straying towards cloud, which I do not get here)

The new job or city would involve me moving (which I want to do anyways)."

And after finishing, while collecting my letter, I heard my boss mention that he was building a system with another coworker (who I knew had no experience there, but all the oldies assume everyone in the IT dep. Is Elliot Alderson.)

 So I volunteered my services and the bro took me on, he then proceeded to block me out of the project until it was time to show progress where he had a big impressive half of the system (from github with a name change by his own admission.)

 &amp; other guy had me create a system from scratch separate from the original cause he 'lost' the original system design I ended up creating a whole other system that was green lite, by the boss &amp; the it director but now. 

The boss says my separate systems launch is dependent on the other guy completing his system, (which is unlikely as I finally have the design from the boss &amp; he won't be able to make it) 'conveniently' his laptop 'crashed' (which is his go to for stalling)

The tricky part, he's in his late twenties, (i'm 22) has a family (I don't &amp; he knows it) and he is super less fortunate (I'm definitely not), so the boss put this together to sort of help him out, I can't tell without looking like a bit of a dick, 

I could do the system for him but that's exactly how he has more certificates &amp; qualifications, while I was there enough times he'd start a course &amp; have someone do it for him in our office &amp; he's admitted to cheating quite a bit through uni so I don't wanna be one more avenue for him to glide off of to bigger and better things.

So I'm stuck in this mental state of checkmate trying to see whether I should let it play out (but there is a time limit end of this year) or snitch now and get him kicked out of his own project or snitch now &amp; get kicked losing out on the $$. 

It's a gov project 
(P.S. I'm an not 'merican, Live in the ""3rd world"" where any jobs let alone like this one are near impossible to get and are absolute life changers.)

So what do?"

I have also lost touch with the professor and beleive that he wouldn't know me well enough to write a fleshed out recommendation letter. 

The PhD student has now completed his doctrate and has joined as a faculty in a (different but lower ranked) university in July 2020. I was wondering if I should rather ask  the PhD student ,who had actually supervised me, for the LoR. I have a good rapport with him and they know more in detail about the work I did so they can write me a very strong letter of recommendation.

How will it look to admission committee that someone else other than the supposed supervisor is talking about the work I did? Plus the PhD student is very young faculty, will it be considered a red flag?"

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a couple weeks ago, and after a couple rounds, I had a pre-negotiations call with HR just to verify my range of salary and that we'd come to a deal. Problem is, I've no official internship or working experience yet as someone who worked full-time as an engineer for 4 years and and graduating in December. Only 'real' software development I've done is in undergrad classes. Despite that i believe I'm getting about 10% return rate on my applications cause my resume looks better than it is. I'm also not very good at negotiating. I took my current job in a panic because I would actually get health insurance during the pandemic (last company didn't). Job hopped a little before that for a big $ increase even though it was a contract role at Am@zon, night-shift, no benefits. So I'm trying to be picky as much as i can, but need a position where I'm actually doing something productive for once. Here's my somewhat relevant history:

**2 years** \- Manufacturing engineer 45k/year (made a couple small tools in [VB.net](https://VB.net))

**6 months** \- contracted Control systems engineer @ Am@zon $32/hr. (programming industrial controls and robotics)

**6 months** \- Controls engineer @ small company $69k (more industrial controls programming, No official 'coding', some scripting in HMI screens

**Current job** \- 5 months at Honeywell $72k or $34/hr. Tricked into a QA engineer role. Do a small amount of Python and Linux programming to automate testing of hardware components. Once i graduate I can ask for a salary bump, and move to a software role, but company rules say i have to wait til December 2021. Also anti-remote. Everyone's mostly in the office, no exceptions.

**New opportunity** \- Full-stack remote role. Mainly Java/Spring, which is my 'strongest' language I haven't had any experience in. Company is in the retail space, based in the Midwest. I'm located in CT, MCOL. Interviewed for several other roles, telling everyone I want 85k-95k. Some companies confirming the middle of that range, this one saying they'll be closer to 80k once we start.

**Edit**: I would add, the new company seems really chill. They stress good wlb, which is important to me, but also that'd I'd be learning a lot from real coding to CI/CD. I don't think a crazy amount of PTO to start, but you can purchase more. There also room to grow here, and senior's look like they still get a healthy salary comparatively for the area. I also loved being remote for the 3 months before i had to move to Honeywell.

At 80k, I'm inclined to take it of course, that's a 10% increase. Also I'd consider this my first real developer role, will learn a lot, etc.

Thanks for any input"

j2lk39,1,2020-09-30,Am I being unreasonable with my salary demands? Let me know your thoughts please,gunnerforever123,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j2lk39/am_i_being_unreasonable_with_my_salary_demands/,"Hi all,

I just wanted to share a situation I've found myself in within my current role. Just to give you a bit of background, I've been at my current company for 3 years where I joined fresh out of college after impressing them following an internship. Now in those three years, I have worked very hard, contributed well to the team and the senior management have told me that I've been doing really well and that the feedback I get is all positive. During this time I have received no performance related pay rises (despite displaying 'above average' performance in my performance reviews). The only pay rises I have had during my time at the company have been in relation to my accounting exams. So had I not passed any exams, it is likely that I would still be on the salary which I started on over 3 years ago. You may wonder why I haven't received any performance related pay rises, and from my knowledge the company has not reviewed anyone's pay since I've been at the company until now. 

So, the predicament I am currently in. Due to my hardwork, I have been rewarded with a promotion. Now I have had my suspicions for a while that my current (pre-promotion) salary is very low. The reason why I know is because: a) I have a good indication of what the salary should be for my current (pre-promotion) role and new (promoted) role; and b) I am 90% sure I know what some people doing my current role are earning (who are less experienced than me)

As I mentioned earlier, my current salary has only increased due to exam related pay rises by about $3-4k. Now I know for a fact that some graduates (with no experience or exam passes under their belt) have come in to the company ON the wage which I am CURRENTLY on - which I am obviously annoyed about. So in other words, graduates with no experience have walked into the company earning $3-4k more than what I started on.

Now my company have offered me an 8% salary increase for my new role - which you could argue is fair for a promotion. However, given that some of the new grads are earning what I am currently earning, once they get their exam related pay rises the pay increase they get will be in line with the promotional increase I've received - and I will be more senior than them. In a nutshell, I could be in a situation where I am earning the same amount of money as a worker who is a whole job level below me, and less experienced than me - this sounds ridiculous right? 

Furthermore, as my current salary is so low, the 8% increased they've offered means that my new salary for my promoted position is... you guessed it - too low! I know for a fact this is true as I have spoken to external companies so I know what the going rate is for my new role.

So in order to correct this, I have asked for a pay rise in the magnitude of c. 18%. I believe this would be an acceptable increase and I feel that this would mean I'd be earning a salary which is in line with the market rate and above what other junior workers below me could potentially earn. I am awaiting their response. Do you think what I am asking for is unreasonable? Just to give you a bit of context the salary which I've requested is in the low $40s, and what they initially offered me was in the mid to high $30s

What do you guys think? Do you think I am being unreasonable with my demands? 

Disclaimer. Just to finish, I hope I am not coming across as being ungrateful. I am 100% grateful for the opportuntities that my current company have provided me and the fact that I have managed to keep my job during this pandemic. I know I may be coming across as a bit bitter here, but at the end of the day I am just after a fair wage. I'm sure most people in my situation would feel the same way. 

What are people's thoughts?

Apologies if there are any typos as I have rushed this - lol

Thank you!"

First of all a bit of context info. I am from South America, and I am about to finish my MSc in CS in a top 10 EU University. I don't have European passport, so I would need a Visa to work in almost any country. I started the MSc with the aim on doing a change in my career, since I want to work in robotics/autonomous driving/drone industry; Furthermore, I have almost 10 years of professional experience working as Fullstack dev/engineer, and I have worked in several companies of different sizes.

Due to this Covid situation, I am worry about to be able to find a job in any of these industries.. last year, I had a hard time finding an internship in the field, and I think this (or next) year will be harder. I won't give up now, I will try to find a job, but I want to be realistic in my expectations. Also, I have a wife and we are planning a life together, so my salary cannot be as an intern.

Last year I sent more or less 15 CVs, and I had 2 interviews.. Do you think this year will be the same or harder? Do you know which is the situation of companies in any of those fields?

Thanks in advance!"

From the job description, it seems that the role involves working and consulting with PM, developers, software architects, etc. It also says that knowledge of programming languages is highly recommended, which could mean that it might not be required? All this led to my belief that this role might be another name for Technical Support, which is one I am not exactly keen about since I am studying Computer Science and I want to get into Software Development.
Do you think I should accept the offer? I am not exactly desperate and feel like I could get other interviews and offers. Does working as a Technical Specialist hinder my chances at getting into Software Development later on? It is valuable to have on a Software Developement focused resume?"
j2qw6z,2,2020-09-30,Should I start my career with Frontend or Backend?,Pumpkinhero1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j2qw6z/should_i_start_my_career_with_frontend_or_backend/,"I am a computer science graduate who recently found a software engineer job in a start up company.

Since my company is a start-up company, I have an opportunity to choose from working in frontend projects or backend projects. I'm thinking which one I should go for. I personally doesn't have an absolute preference for either one of them but I know I may need to choose either one side in the future of my career.

My company is using mostly React.js and Next.js for frontend web, and React Native for frontend mobile. And for backend, mostly Node.js but there is some old projects still using PHP, in the future they may use Golang as well. 

The situation is that I have more experience and knowledge in frontend than backend due to my past internship experience but of course I think it's still beginner level. For backend, I only did some simple node.js tasks in my company the previous week, and my knowledge is super little. For frontend, I do not have much experience with React, I just learnt some basics of it in one week. I know React should be the most popular frontend framework nowadays in the industry (please correct me if I am wrong). So I really want to learn more about it. But on the other hand, I also want to know more about backend to see if I would prefer which one more, and Node.js is also fun to learn.

So now is the question, what should I go first? Should I go for React to experience the most popular frontend framework, or should I go for Node.js and maybe Golang in the future to learn more about backend? And how do u think about the career path of frontend and backend developer? Which one is better? How to distinguish if I am better in frontend or in backend?"

I have two internships under my belt and a multi-year role as a backend dev at a successful startup. Anyways, this years internship search has been quite difficult (as it seems has been the case for many others) and I'm hoping not to have to accept my return offer.

Anyways, the reason for this post is that I was just rejected by Robinhood with a 842/850 on the CodeSignal. Finished it super fast with top scores for implementation and passing all test cases. Although I'm not the absolute best candidate they will get, I feel that I'm definitely qualified enough to hire. Why do these companies waste our time with these coding assessments without even reviewing our resume? It would seem intuitive for a coding challenge to only be given if they plan to interview us if we have a top score. I understand the concept of giving one but not if we can just be rejected after performing well. I'd prefer a phone screening or some form of consideration before spending time between school, work, etc. to take a test that will apparently mean nothing.

Regardless, that's all I wanted to share. I assume many of you have had similar experiences. Does anyone have suggestions for getting to the in-person interview stage beyond referrals (since I can only do that at a few companies)? The way I see it, if I have experience, a 4.0 at a quality school, and get every single technical question right I'm starting to run out of options but there's clearly something I'm not doing quite right. Would love some private advice regarding my resume as well. Thanks in advance!"

j2rzay,2,2020-09-30,[For Hire] E -Commerce | Web Marketing | Business Ideation and Digitization | Team of Two,WetL1me,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/j2rzay/for_hire_e_commerce_web_marketing_business/,"Hello!Hello!

We are two recent Business graduates from the University of Oregon looking to help you with your digital, e-commerce, and/or general business project needs.

We understand that getting started within the digital realm can be daunting. Our backgrounds in Sociology and Philosophy (in addition to business) can uniquely help you succeed in today’s dynamic online environment. Our business concentrations in Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Data Analytics have transformed the way that we experience, interact and see business. We believe that having a humanistic approach in addition to raw technical skill is integral to the success of any 2020 online and brick-and-mortar business.

Whether you need assistance digitizing your current business, want to get your idea off the ground, need SEO and digital marketing help, or are simply looking for consulting advice on increasing sales and marketing ratios, we are the perfect pair for the job!

DO YOU NEED HELP WITH… Shopify, Etsy, Wordpress, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Reddit, or basic business digitization?

We’ll be the perfect match for you because:

* We have affordable and flexible rates
* We’re tapped into today’s rapidly changing online culture
* We’re passionate about helping others achieve their business goals
* We both thrive in team environments and always maintain a basic level of synergy within our work

You’ll be the perfect match for us because:

* You’re willing to balance novelty with learning moments
* You’ll help us build up our portfolio over the course of your projects
* You want current perspective on e-commerce/online digital management
* You have an amazing product/service and don’t know how to market it online
* You like the idea of helping to further two ambitious graduate’s careers

WANT TO GET STARTED SELLING ONLINE BUT DON’T WANT TO PAY AN EXPENSIVE AGENCY OR INTERACT WITH ROBOTS OVER THE PHONE? Let us help you get started today!

THE BOTTOM LINE

Having an e-commerce website is necessary for establishing a basic form of online presence (especially during COVID), but ultimately having a marketable product that people are willing to buy is the greatest hurdle. Fortunately for us, you’ll already have that outstanding product or idea (or at least have the start of one). E-commerce platforms integrate a level of marketing and social media that a basic website simply can’t generate. This means that to succeed, we must balance the constraining resources of our client while driving traffic online via marketing and sales strategy.

E-commerce is a very saturated market so establishing an online presence also means that you must target some sort of niche audience or industry if you want to be successful. This is especially important to keep in mind when intertwining social media and various third-party marketplaces to capitalize on the uniqueness of your product, service or idea.

What WE can contribute:

* Conduct Market Research and Targeting Analysis
* Setup and Manage E-Commerce Platforms and Shipping
* Integrate Social Media with E-Commerce and/or other Online Locations
* Establish Meaningful and Relevant Marketing Channels
* Utilize SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Digital Marketing

Open to any and all projects at this time!

I did pretty well in college - I got a 3.92 GPA out of 4.0 - and I have a lot of internships and personal projects on my resume (I have a minor in Computer Science and have been fortunate enough to do coding internships).

I am very not-well with anxiety. I feel anxious constantly about little things, I have a paralyzing fear of failure, and I'm severely under-confident in my abilities. It's reached such a point that after working with a therapist for a long time, I am going to be starting Lexapro this weekend, so that could change a lot for me.

As I plan my next steps, I'm trying to think of a career path that would allow me to have what I crave most when I'm anxious: control and knowledge of what's coming. At school, once I got into a rhythm with Economics, I felt a lot better because everything felt like it was in my control. I got a syllabus at the beginning of the semester that would outline everything I needed to do, the material we would go over, etc. Heck, if I wanted to, I could just start studying the next chapter and help myself out for the next week, and sometimes I did.

I'm looking for a career path or a job that feels predictable or that I can become an expert in and sort of rely on my skillset with confidence. I understand that part of life is having stress and uncertainty, which is why I'm getting medicated and getting therapy to help myself, but I also know there are different ""degrees"" of predictability and difficulty in jobs, i.e. consulting is not a job for people who dislike change. I'm not asking for the world either, I would be okay with making around $40k a year if it was predictable and could afford me some comfort while I work on myself as a person.

So does anyone have suggestions for a job, one that I could get with my bachelors degree in Economics or one with short-term training?

tl;dr - I have anxiety issues that I'm working on and am interested in career/job choices that are predictable or even ""boring."""
j2soun,0,2020-09-30,YMCA for Video games,patryk7754,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/j2soun/ymca_for_video_games/,"Hello all. I have an idea for this business that I have been brainstorming for several years now but I've had my run-ins with certain obstacles. At this point in life, I'm ready to finally ready to take on the challenges. I'm here for mostly advice and any ideas to make my business better. This post will cover three things; What the service is, where I am in the process of starting the business, and what advice I'm looking for to help me move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the YMCA for Video Games (name TBD)?**

* Will be marketed as Recreational Esports for any and everyone
* A service that will follow a business model of the (you guessed it) YMCA
* Some of the services provided will include;
   * The ability to come in a play a verity of video games on a verity of systems on a daily basis 
   * Esports Coaches (Personal trainer): members will be able to schedule sessions with ""Esports Coaches"" to help improve their skills the same way you would hire a basketball trainer to improve your jump shot.
   *  Tournaments and leagues
   * Video game workshops (for example; how to build a gaming PC class)
   * Camps  (for those unfamiliar with some services the YMCA provides, one of them is summer camps during work hours)
   * Gaming Lounge: This area will have an arcade type of environment. Arcade games, couches, movies VR games, and more)

**Ideas for Revenue** 

* Monthly membership fees 
   * I plan on having tiered fee system ($10/mo, $15/mo, $20/mo) I haven't actually determined the fees just using those as examples
   * The more expensive the membership the better the benefits. Some benefits I have in mind;
      * Basic plan: access to all services with no additional benefits
      * Gold plan: access to all services, discounts to tournaments and leagues, 
      * Platinum: gold plan, free entry into X amount of tournaments or leagues, one free session with Esports coaches.
   * Tournaments and Leagues entry fees
   * Parties
   * Sponsorships
      * Local pro teams. For example, the MLB has struggled with gaining a young audience and I can leverage this into an opportunity to have access to a young demo via baseball-themed tournaments and leagues. Could also have a dedicated room that has their logos and other things on display
      * Partnerships with Universities. Universities could use this as a recruiting tool. Fortunately, I live in an area where there is a pretty prominent school in the college Esports world so I can probably use that to my advantage
      * Your typical sponsors like local restaurants, car dealerships, etc
   * Partnerships
      * K-12 schools: invite schools for field trips and field days or other school events. The idea behind this would be to gain membership signups and building a strong relationship with the community
      * YMCA: same idea as the K-12

&amp;#x200B;

So that's basically the highlights of my service. I'm in the very beginning stage of making my idea into an actual business. What I have so far I've 

* I've already covered
* the basic costs of the business: One-time cost like video game systems, rental cost, what I want to pay employees etc
* my plan of paying for start-up cost. I am currently working two jobs with the second job funding my savings for startup cost. Once I'm ready to rent out space and buy furniture and other things, I will combine my savings with a business loan
* I've created a business plan and presentation for loans and potential sponsors and partners
* The employees I need and where to get them. I'll go to the university I graduated from for interns (lack of a better term) cheap employees. They have a sports business program that is great and provides great people. My brother is currently studying for the bar so I'll have him for legal advice. My friend is in school for IT stuff (not sure exactly what stuff but that'll be nice to have on hand as well)
* I have a good picture in my head of what I want my space to look like. Right now, I'm looking for an open space with some private rooms. Nothing huge but comfortably sized. I've looked some spaces I like and most of them come out to 50-60k a year in rent

So that's what I've done so far and now I'm looking for some advice. The main thing that keeps me up at night is how to solicit people to sign up for my business. My idea is to do it the same way gyms do but Idk how they do it. Also, any advice you have or ideas for making my services better would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."

j2uc7k,2,2020-09-30,(international intern) What is the appropriate way to ask my boss for a full-time position?,[deleted],germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/j2uc7k/international_intern_what_is_the_appropriate_way/,"I am an exchange student doing an exchange year in Germany.

Part of my exchange year is a mandatory internship at a company in Germany.

I am doing an internship now as a software dev at a software dev company. At the beginning, my boss told me that interns often remain as full-time employees after their internships. I showed interest but I still was not sure at that stage because I had exams at my host uni in Germany that I needed to pass.

To cut the story short, I am now sure I want to be a full time employee.

How do I tell her this? This is somewhat of a cultural question because in my culture, saying something like this directly would be rude and arrogant, but I know Germans are much more direct.

I googled a bit but most of the things I found were targeted at a US audience where, like my culture, people are also not as direct as Germans.
One suggestion was to ask the boss for feedback about my performance and then subtly hint at my interest for a full-time position. But not sure if this is appropriate in Germany.

So here's my question: how do I proceed if I am interested in a full time position? Do I ask my boss directly, ask her for feedback and subtly hint at my interest or wait for her or HR to offer me a full-time position? 

And more importantly, at what stage of the internship do I start this?

Some details:

* Field of study: computer-science

* This is my last semester as a BSc student. I already finished my bachelor thesis before starting the exchange year. I will graduate immediately after the internship is over.

* Duration of internship: 5 months

* 3 months of the internship complete, 2 left

* German language skills: fluent; all communication with my boss and colleagues is in German

* Nationality: Jordanian

I appreciate any and all answers."
