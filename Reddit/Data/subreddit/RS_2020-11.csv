I'll also be having the Capital One super day interviews next week (wish me luck!). Let's say Capital One offers me a position for their TIP (Technology Internship Program), which company do you recommend I go for? Expedia's internship will be in Seattle, WA while I'm hoping C1's will be in McLean, VA (I live in northern VA as well).

Expedia pays very well and I know Capital One does too, probably even more. However, I'd like to consider many other factors besides pay that'll help me long-term. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thank you!

jluyvv,1,2020-10-31,Microsoft or Capital one Internship?,BackEndClutch,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jluyvv/microsoft_or_capital_one_internship/," I recently received and offer from both companies for Software Engineer Role and I am actually stuck and have no idea which to choose.

So I have a predicament. I graduate 6 months after I am done with the Summer 2021 Internship, so I wont have a comfortable time window to interview at other companies once I get back from internship. So in this scenario wherever I end up working I would go back as full time.

I love Capital One culture and have been trying to work there for over 2 years while studying. I was super excited when I got the offer and it is in NYC which I requested since I have family there I can live with once I graduate to save some money(trying to live frugally) and they listened. They pay around **$4,307.69 biweekly** and a **6k** Stipend in NYC. I have also been told that is the hub where most ML projects are done, a field I am interested in. Also Capital One basically does everything on the cloud with **AWS** which I know is the best cloud service out there right now and I am super interest in ending up in something related to ML/Cloud. Basically perfect opportunity.

AAAaaaand...

Then I got a Microsoft Offer in **Seattle** with **3,683 biweekly** and **7k** stipend along with a lot of other benefits and its been pretty much hectic. It would be working in the Core Services Engineering and Operations (**CSEO**) which builds and operates the systems that run **Microsoft.** So id probably be doing some C# work and I dont know if I would be happy working on this team. I loved the person who interviewed me but the teams focus seems boring to me like being the internal Laundromat for Cast Members outfits at Disney world while they cast members interact with the customers. Also Microsoft is Azure which from my little experience with both AWS and Azure is not as fun nor intuitive to use but in the end its Microsoft and they also have a great work culture and I love how they are opening up to open source and a lot of the products theyve bought over the last few years(LinkedIn, Github, etc) I agree with and I believe they have a mindset that also fits with me.

EXTRA INFO: If it's virtual in Summer 2021 I would have to fly out into contiguous US to work(not necessarily NYC) vs with Microsoft I can work from anywhere during the summer.

I honestly dont know what to do. It must sound ungrateful me complaining about this situation but I dont know what to do I dont want to make the wrong decision which will shape somewhere between the next 3-5 years, especially as a new grad once I am done with the Internship, with one I have NYC which has Musicals/Save money on rent and is not cloudy almost entire year. But the other is Microsoft in a new place I havent been to before and again its Microsoft and they will take care of me as an employee as long as I do well.

Any suggestions/thoughts/advice would be extremely helpful"

app --&gt; r\*s\*me (the paper that contains your name, contact info, experience, school)

&amp;#x200B;

* I graduated from a Canadian CS degree (top 4 but not Waterloo level) with a single, two semesters long internship (backend Java).
* I have been working as a developer for a few months (backend Java).
* Canadian salary is very depressing, so I want to target FANG-ish companies in Canada or any other decent tech companies in USA (TN visa) once I hit 1 YOE mark. I would like to work on **backend** work.
* Before my first job, I had bunch of project listed on my applications just like typical college students, so that my resume appears to have a few different skills like React, JS, Python, etc
* My personal projects from the college period is visually unappealing, poorly written, unimpactful, and I suspect it could backfire if someone checks it out.
* If I remove my personal projects, my skill section will suddenly only have one backend language, and I am worried that it will make my application look empty, or miss keyword hits from ATS. When I look at app thread, and even most university students seemed to have like 5 or 6 languages listed.
* Do I need to ""re-create"" meaningful projects outside of work using different languages just for the sake of making my app not empty? Would having work experience be enough on my app? Should I still list my old personal projects, preying that the hiring managers won't check them out? (from what I see from other posts, project needs to have production-like impact for non-students, and that sounds like a lot of effort)
* If personal project is not needed for me, do I still need to include github user profile on app? (it's been abandoned many months with a lot of bad code...)
* I enjoy Leetcode much more than doing personal projects.

Thanks for reading."

I graduated with a CS degree from good undergrad program and worked as a software engineer for a year at a pretty well-known company in the Bay. I also did a few internships at similarly decent companies during school.

I was pretty unhappy with my life/career that year and decided to quit, leave the Bay, and then a little less than a year after doing that, moved abroad to teach English. I did that for two years and enjoyed living abroad immensely, but I knew that it couldn't be a forever career financially or logistically. So last year, I decided to try getting back into tech (mostly because I had no idea what else to do) and found another job abroad teaching at a bootcamp and doing some dev work for them as well. I was supposed to be there until the end of this year, but then due to covid + visa limitations I had to leave early. So on my resume I've basically taken a 4 year break from my career (in reality it was only 2 years where I was working in a completely unrelated field).

Since then, I've tried to review technical questions - something I've always been horrible at. I can't seem to solve anything above a leetcode easy problem on my own. The medium problems I can't do within the required time complexities most of the time, if at all. I should also mention that I struggled through my entire undergrad degree and barely passed most of my technical classes. I know people would say ""just practice,"" but after years of practicing these types of problems with little avail, I feel like there's a limit to how much I can improve. (Btw, I got my past internships/job because they either didn't ask coding problems or asked simple ones.) It's not like I have unlimited time to practice either... even applying to jobs with a 3-4 month gap on my resume a few years back I got asked ""what have you doing been doing with this time?"" and I can hardly say I've been practicing interview questions, right?

The past couple weeks I've applied to a handful of companies, mostly getting no responses and haven't done any interviews yet. I don't even know if companies will respond to my long break from tech - very badly, for sure. I have no idea what to do - tbh I don't even like software engineering. I only studied CS because it was the most interesting and worthwhile (in terms of how much I was paying for my degree) major to me at the time. I liked some projects/topics, but I've found real word dev work to be nothing like that.

I'm wondering if I should even try to get another SWE position or attempt to pivot my career into something like UX Design or Product Management. The bigger issue is that after some broad research, I don't know if I'd really like those things much better, though I know they'd at least be ""easier"" career choices for me. It also seems really hard to land one of those positions with no experience - I've even considered taking a bootcamp course on UX Design, but a friend of mine did the course recently and has had no luck finding a job even months after the bootcamp.

How do I move forward in my career when I have no idea what I want to be doing?

**Tl:dr:**

1. I really, really can't do technical interview problems. Should I even attempt to find another SWE position after a 4-year break from tech and only one year of full-time dev experience?
2. What's the best way to pivot to another area of tech, like UX Design, PM, or technical writing? I've done research on all 3, but it seems impossible to get an even an entry level position in any of those fields without prior, full-time work experience. Is a bootcamp or MBA program worth it, esp when I don't know if I feel strongly towards any of those careers either?"
jlxad0,2,2020-11-01,"The Men in the Bowler Hats, the Final Chapter... I Hope",zimmer199,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jlxad0/the_men_in_the_bowler_hats_the_final_chapter_i/,"As I alluded to in a [previous story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8dsmnu/when_battles_replay_themselves/), the vacation I took after intern year was eventful. So much so that I never told anyone about it, mostly to protect myself from any consequences of my actions. It's been almost three years and perhaps I'm out of the woods to get this off my chest.

As outlined previously [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bbzgs/the_men_in_the_bowler_hats/) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2br373/the_men_in_bowler_hats_update/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8djs3v/ida_black/), I believe I was hunted by strange men wearing dark suits and bowler hats after I left my old job on not good terms. My old boss was evil, no other words describe how heartless, selfish, and cruel he was to his employees. He would prey on those who needed work, whether it be work visa or desire to enter the field. I heard stories of him retaliating against those who left his employment against his wishes, but I never imagined it would be this bad for me. I never thought he'd want me dead, or whatever it is they want from me. But there I was, hiding in my apartment fearing for my life. Then they were gone. I don't know why, perhaps my old boss thought he got me. In any case, shortly after I moved across the country for med school. I thought I had escaped but I think I may have been found. I have no idea how, as I did not leave any contact information when I left. Fortunately I was to move again shortly after for clinicals, so it seemed I was always one step ahead. I didn't think I was found again, though I did have an experience where a semi tried to run me off the Verrizano. I didn't see the driver, may have just been a grumpy trucker. Regardless, I shortly after moved to a different city to continue schooling, then for residency to another state. I went a year without seeing a man in a bowler hat. Then one day I was called by the ER to evaluate somebody, and as I approached I heard him asking if anyone had seen his briefcase in that unmistakable shrill tone.

Of the ones I've seen, some of the men in bowler hats carry a briefcase. It's always a brown, rectangular leather briefcase, the kind that haven't been used since the 80s. At times I observed others stopping people on the street and asking if they've seen their briefcase. What's in the briefcase or why you would ask a random person if they've seen it , I don't know. But frankly nothing about these men make sense. I'm not sure they're human, with shrill yet deep voices, faces that don't seem to grow facial hair, and seemingly unnatural walks.

As I must, I decided to do my job and evaluate this man. I wore a surgical mask pretending to have concerns about spreading the flu, this being before the COVID-19 pandemic it may have seemed somewhat strange. As I entered I saw this man. I was given the name Randall Elmerson.

""Hello Mr. Elmerson, I'm Dr. Zim. What brings you to the ED this afternoon?"" I say.

""Oh hello good sir,"" he says in this chilling almost robotic voice. ""Say, have you seen my briefcase?""

""Sorry to say I have not,"" I said. ""So what can I help you with today?""

""Yes, but have you seen my briefcase?""

I don't know how to explain it, but every time he uttered that phrase I grew more and more anxious. It was like he was sapping something from me, peering into my soul or something. Whatever it was, I didn't like it. I swiftly ducked out of the room and hurried over to the ER physician to ask why he needed to come into the hospital, and to pretend he was safe to go. As I approached the desk I hear ""CODE VIOLET, EMERGENCY ROOM"" called overhead. I instinctively ducked behind the desk and peered over, to see this man being carried out of the ER, thrashing against security and police. When he was gone, I went back to the resident work room. Safe, but I knew they had found me again.

I knew I was not going to be able to run forever, and I needed some answers. My vacation was coming up, which would be my opportunity. My plan was to visit my girlfriend for a few days, then drive down to see my family. The route would take me through the city where I used to work. I had planned it so that I would have a few hours to snoop around my old work, see if I could figure out more.

When I got to my old work, it was midday on a Saturday. I had hoped nobody would be around. I parked a few blocks away in case there were cameras that may have seen my car. I had since replaced it and perhaps the fact that they didn't know this helped me. As I approached my the building, I went around back, making sure I wasn't followed, and attempted to pull open the door that doesn't lock well. Unfortunately for me they had fixed it since I was there. I tried other ways in, but no luck. All the ways around locked doors were secured. But fortunately a student came by and swiped her badge to get in. I was able to act naturally and come in behind her. The sign on the door saying ""don't let strangers in"" didn't seem to affect her willingness to hold the door open as I picked up my pace to get to the door.

I climbed the stairs to the seventh floor, the location of my old department. I had a sense of dread, wondering why I even came. But for whatever reason I pushed on, walking with a purpose to the lab. Walking down the hall I barely recognized it with all the renovations that had taken place since I left many years before. There was nobody else around. Finally at the end of the hall I reached my old lab. It was oddly unchanged, as if my old boss refused to allow improvements. Much like in the workplace. I noticed some posters on the wall, projects that had been done since I left. I didn't think anyone would work there after me, but I guess he found another desperate soul. I looked down the adjacent hall, saw desks and papers lining the wall. The lab was being cleaned out, I suspect my boss was finally retiring. I pulled out the key that I had kept and tried to enter, but alas the locks had been changed. As I peered through the window I could see a dark nearly empty lab. Then suddenly I felt a chill and heard an old familiar voice.

""ZIM!""

I slowly turned around as my heart sunk into my feet. My old boss was standing behind me, as if he knew I'd be there. I gazed upon him silently with fear but resolution. He was a short man, older but with a certain spryness. His nearly black eyes pierced my soul, as memories of years of abuse came pouring back.

""Well hello,"" I said in mock happiness.

""You're back,"" he said.

""What do you want?"" I shouted.

""You could have been the one!"" he hissed.

""Not here,"" I cried. ""Not for you.""

""You could have been the one!"" he hissed again.

""I wasn't happy, I moved on. What do you want from me?"" I asked with some trepidation.

He let out a growl and lunged at me. I saw he had pulled out a knife. Without thinking I sidestepped and pushed him away, missing the blade by a few inches. As I reeled back I shouted ""What the fuck is wrong with you???"" He snarled in response and lunged at me again. Again being much younger I was able to evade. Without thinking I noticed that the cold room door had come open, and with the next attack I grabbed him and shoved him in, locking the door behind him. I took off running down the hall, down the stairs, and out of the building. I kept running and without thinking I ended up in my car. Breathing heavily I paused for a minute before restarting my car and driving home.

Back on the road I thought about what just happened. I knew that nobody would be in that building until Monday, and he would for sure freeze to death. I tried to wrap my head around the entire situation, why would he try to kill me? Especially if he thought I could have been the one, his prodigy, his star worker. I will probably never know, maybe some people are just evil.

From the somber realization of what I had just done, I came to the realization that maybe it was all over. I wouldn't be bothered by the men in the bowler hats. I even let out a chuckle. Then I felt an impact on my rear bumper.

I looked through my rear view mirror and to my horror I saw a pale man in a bowler hat driving a black SUV. His expressionless face glaring at me as he approached me again. I quickly sped up to try to avoid another impact. There were no other cars around, nowhere to hide. All I could do was speed ahead as this man was hot on my tail. Then at an on ramp another entered, and immediately tried to ram me. I swerved to avoid him, thankful my mom made me take that defensive driving class. As the car spun out the man chasing me ran into it, ending that chase. I breathed a sigh of relief before yet another black SUV approached over the horizon, speeding towards me. This time I was approaching traffic, and I was unsure how I would escape. I did my best ducking and weaving through cars, my heart pounding and my stomach in knots. Then to my horror I saw the black SUV pull up beside me. The window rolled down and the passenger pulled out a gun and pointed it at me. My heart sank as I swerved into the right lane away from him, barely missing rear ending a semi. I drove along side the semi for what seemed like an eternity, unsure if the SUV would emerge in front or behind. Finally as we crossed the state line into my home state, the SUV moved into the passing lane. I looked around, the SUV was gone. I breathed a sigh of relief and continued driving home. I didn't see any more men with bowler hats after that.

When I got home my mother remarked that I looked like somebody tried to kill me. I laughed and said residency was tough. She gave me a short ""I bet"" before silently looking at me as if she knew. She has an uncanny ability to know these things, somehow. I asked if we were going to have dinner, and she said yes, then suggested I go watch the battle. I declined, I had enough excitement for one day.

As I said before, it's been nearly three years since this happened. Since then I have not encountered any more men in bowler hats, the longest I've gone. To my knowledge nobody has come after me for what I did, though I'm almost certain my old boss is dead. I still look over my shoulder from time to time, but I feel much more relaxed in the knowledge that I think my ordeal is over. Or at least I hope."

But I'm afraid I'm overreacting so I wanna ask, is it worth asking to get tested with these symptoms?

- always late

- known to be not informed about things that have been discussed before. Last to know about things.

- always had a bad memory, can't even remember multiplication tables if I'm honest. Remembering birthdays is a nightmare

- it's hard to start on things, I can desperately want to start on a task, but I just... Don't, unless there's a stress factor

- my mom used to always say I'm smart but I just don't put in enough effort or work when I felt like I was already doing my best, but I knew I was capable if I liked the subject

- barely watch any movies because I don't have the attention if I can't talk to people during the movie

- on my internship they had to baby me badly because apparently I have no organisational skills at all. Can't prioritize tasks or imagine how much time something takes.

- In high school/college I got through because it was easy, I often started studying for an exam the day before and always passed because of the time stress

- but now i'm starting my master and I'm already feeling the weight of stress because now I'll have to actually work. I can't half-ass my stuff.

- procrastination galore

- I get obsessed with things but lose interest quickly, there's every odd interest that i'll keep for like 5 years. I used to also get bored of my friends after 2 years. But now I just have way more friends to kind of divide talking to.

- always fidgeting, my mom tried to make me stop as a child so I mostly evolved to quiet fidgeting

- only did sports for maximum 2 years because I can't handle people telling me what to do aka telling me I did something wrong. I think I had some panic attacks that were written off as sport induced astma when I was younger because they kept telling me I did badly. And I fixated on those negative thoughts until I couldn't breathe.

- I lose things, or misplace things pretty often, but not so bad as to put my phone in the freezer or something.

- when i'm excited about something I talk so quickly that my mom couldn't understand me

- reading out loud is hard, I finish my sentences and it's absolutely not what's written down, it's what I thought would be the end of the sentence. Reading silently, I often miss/forget things

- always scored pretty badly on listening comprehension tests because I couldn't remember what I'd heard after a second of hearing it.



BUT 

I've pretty much always had okay grades. I even finished my bachelor with distinction. 
I had a good amount of friends when I was younger. No /real/ problems socialising, though I was an awkward kid, but like who isn't as a tween? 
My memory is noticably bad, but sometimes I'm the person to remind people of things because they just pop up in my head.




TLDR: So in general i'm asking is it worth to ask to get tested or are these like normal people struggles?"

I'm also doing a math bachelor in parallel (which I think might be a good additonal selling point) but I'm only in the first semester there. Also my math grades are pretty bad so far.

I have also taken part in a number of coding contests where I have generally scored in the top 5% (out of ~1400 participants). Last summer I also did a two month internship at a large, local research institute (1.5k employees).

I would like to do an internship next summer/year but I'm not sure where I should apply.

I believe I have a pretty slim chance at getting an SE/ML internship right now at a FAANG company due to my bad math grades and little work experience.

On the other hand I think I could have a decent chance in a few years when I have dedicated 1-2 semester full time to math, polished my grades and might have done 1-2 more internships.

Should I still apply to FAANG (or other popular companies) now or should until I have done the things above? If I get rejected now, will this have a negative impact when I re-apply in a few years?

I also have a standing offer to return to the institute where I interned last summer.

Thanks for any advice &amp; help!"

I am a sophomore in Computer Science, and I recently sat down and began planning for how to get an internship for the summer of my junior year. However, aside from core CS classes that I will take and be able to put on my resume by the end of this year, I have nothing else to show for my skills as a coder. My school does not really have us do projects as part of most course curriculum and because of Covid, many clubs that do help students make projects or involves us in projects, are not currently active for the semester. So, as of now, I don't really know what projects to do or how to better my resume. 

If you guys have any advice or suggestions, I would be glad to learn from it. For reference, I am more so interested in back-end software development. I am proficient in Java and C (though I am still learning C), and I am familiar with Python. I am also knowledgeable with Android Studio and Google Firebase so in a way, I have some understanding of app development in Java. As of right now, I haven't taken any 'heavy' CS courses like Data Structures or Algorithms but if anyone has any ideas of what I should start working on from a student or hirer perspective, I would greatly appreciate it."

I graduate in December and have a single job offer from a defense company. The thing is it is in a southern state which I don't really want to move to. (I'm from the west coast and all my family is here.) 

The reason I'm thinking of grad school instead is because I went to a no ranking school for my undergrad and had no internships during my time there.
I recently got accepted to a top school in California for their masters program in compsci. If I go there it'd probably be easy pickings for an internship from their career fairs.

In most honours courses, we covered less material than in non-honours courses but had more difficult assignments.
We barely covered material relevant to the industry, or rather we barely scratched the surface, and that shows in the interviews.
There were no opportunities for working in groups on larger projects.
I have not made any significant human connection either, which is noticeable and contributes to me having an unremarkable candidate profile when applying for jobs in the industry.

I could not land an internship last year during the tech fairs and online applications, and even then it would probably have been cancelled due to COVID.
10% of the faculty gets 4.00 year round and I'm not among them.
Zoom university may depreciate further the value of my diploma.
By fear of losing another opportunity, I feel coerced into a master's program that really won't be relevant in future applications to the industry.
I still have to write a personal statement for that application and need to find something other than ""I don't want to starve to death"" as a motivation for wanting to take higher-level courses that maybe will help me land a job someday.

There is no guarantee that I will get into grad school, and come May I'll be on my own, with no opportunity of growth apart from unremarkable side projects on Github.
The computer science and software engineering programs overlap too much for me to actually gain something from going back to undergrad studies in software engeineering.

Am I specifically fucked, or is that a feeling shared with other computer science undergrads here at McGill?
If not, then how can you break out of the loop of not having experience and requiring a job to get that experience, all the while not having any connections?
Is having completed the undergraduate program that much more valuable to recruiters?"

jmac78,0,2020-11-01,Thoughts on Accepting the First Job Offer?,owntheballot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jmac78/thoughts_on_accepting_the_first_job_offer/,"**TL;DR**: What are your thoughts on taking the first job offer you receive out of college?

I'm in a weird situation. I have an offer to start as an SWE consultant at a small, but growing technical consulting company that has an office near my college (in NC), as well as offices in other states.

I have a relatively positive overall feeling about this company, and think the small, self-starter nature of it could provide lots of opportunities for me to learn, grow, and stand out if I put in the effort.

Things I like about the company/offer: 

* Flat organizational structure 
* Supportive and collaborative culture (I've talked to 7 people at the company and had good impressions from all of them about this) 
* Better work-life balance compared to other consulting companies I know of 
* Opportunity for exposure to lots of technologies via working with different clients 
* Good starting pay ($72K) 
* Company pays for continuous learning opportunities (certifications + online courses) 
* Role is oriented around being a self-starter 
* Health insurance and 4 weeks PTO

Things I don't like: 

* Perception (by others and myself) of settling, since this is my first offer and I haven't sent out a crazy amount of applications yet
* In an industry I don't think I'll stay in long-term. I'm most interested in the idea of working on open source products at companies like Elastic and Canonical, but I'm not at the level of skill/confidence yet where I could make significant contributions and/or get into those companies. My current idea is to make open source contributions outside of work, then eventually transition into a role at one of those (or similarly structured) companies based on those contributions.
* Not sure if the fast-paced nature of consulting aligns with how I learn best. 
* Nagging feeling that I should be doing something more ""risky"" at my age, but no idea what that could be because I don't have the skills/knowledge/interest/confidence to do something like a startup.
* Some of the company's main clients include banking and financial services companies, and I feel weird knowing my work could go towards supporting certain clients, because I worry about the negative impacts some of those clients have on society at large (e.g. [this](https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase)).

*About me:* I'm 21. I struggle with perfectionism. I'm idealistic. I love learning and the thrill of programming, but I've been in a chronically overwhelmed state in college. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like I haven't been able to truly *focus* on learning in my later college years because of all the technical courses I am taking, and I really hate that feeling. I haven't really developed a particular technical interest/niche yet, either. I'm pretty frugal, and I'm interested in the idea of financial independence. I've saved about $20K throughout college from internships and working on the side, and will graduate without student loan debt, so a high starting salary to pay off loans is not a concern. I'm single, and really just want to focus on personal growth and self-improvement at this point in my life, not only in a technical sense, but also in the way that I interact with and see the world."

I graduated earlier this year from a top uni in the UK with a high 2:1 degree in Education and Sociology. I’ve always worked and had three internships during uni (two in social research and one in marketing, as well as working in events management part time during uni). In my spare time, I’m quite active in politics, sit on a local political party’s committee and I sit on a research advisory board for mental health research.

But right now, I’m struggling to find work. I know it’s not just me, I have friends who went to Oxford and Cambridge who are struggling to find work as well, but it feels so lonely and I’m struggling so much to find anything. I had two interviews last week which I exceeded requirements for, but both times I got to the second/final round and the interviewers said i was “perfect for the role” but they found someone who had “more experience”. I’m starting to lose so much hope. Sometimes I’m looking for jobs and I don’t even feel like putting all the effort in an application when I’m either going to be ignored or be told that I have experience and all the qualities they’re looking for, but someone else has more. I’m very cautious about working in retail or any public facing role because my parents both have health problems and are quite vulnerable to coronavirus, which also has affected me applying to other non-graduate jobs and I can’t afford to move out right now.

I’m not really sure where to go from here, it’s made me feel so useless and has had such awful impacts on my mental health that I was hospitalised in August for five days due to an overdose because I didn’t feel like there was a point anymore. My parents can be emotionally abusive and all I’ve wanted to do since graduating has been to move out. I feel like I’m slowly losing myself and my passion that motivated my throughout my degree and past internships doesn’t even matter anymore. Any advice?"

Couple of months ago I applied at a company but did not get the position I wanted. Instead they offered me an internship in a role which is related to the position I applied for initially, so I accepted cuz i am fresh out of college and just want to learn and experience things. Everything was going great but as i started to do more complex things, i needed help and feedback from my boss more and more. He is a strange guy, everyone has to contact him multiple times for him to answer their question, even when he knows it is time-sensitive and important. In last six weeks since I am here, this happened 3-4 times to me only, and his response time ranged from 24h to almost a whole week! This is very stressful and i find it very unsettling for me to work since i have to be in close contact with him in order to do my job properly. What really made me think of quitting soon is that recently he withheld information on a part of a project that is essential, even though we had weekly check ups and he would always say everything is perfect. He did this couple od months ago on another project as well and even reviewed and approved on the work done, knowing damn well it is not how it is supposed to be. Alongside all of this, I am not satisfied with the position I am on now and would rather quit and look for a job in something I really wanna do, but I am learning and growing so much in this company so I really dont know what to do.. is it worth stressing out and being sad daily because you are not doing what you want?"

jmcf7o,1,2020-11-01,[17F] It hurts knowing my ex-girlfriend is dating my best friend even though we broke up in January (10 months ago).,boredpersonn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jmcf7o/17f_it_hurts_knowing_my_exgirlfriend_is_dating_my/,"okay, first off, I am not sharing any names on this post so let's establish some pseudonyms: my ex, let's call her G bcuz she's a girl, and let's call my best friend B cuz he's a boy. 

This girl was *that* girl. the one on the pedestal that you *never* think you'll ever get to like you. She is beautiful on the outside and inside. She has such an old soul and is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. She can make anyone feel like they're the most important person in the world to her. And she did for me. 

In the short time we were together we fell in love. Say what you will, but I know that I fell for her harder than anyone will ever know. We broke up because G's schedule was about to get really hectic because of an internship coming up. She said that it would be really hard to keep our relationship and broke up with me. Oh, and a little side note: she told me over the summer that she didn't want a relationship during junior year (which is where we are now) because she wanted to focus on only school. Keep that in mind for later. 

My best friend, B, he had a gf of his own when I was in a relationship with G. A couple months after G and I broke up, so did him and his now ex-gf. G and I still talked quite frequently and with quarantine we had the time to. There was a period when almost every single night, the three of us (G, B, and me) would ft and talk for hours about anything and everything. From politics to the loss of loved ones to GTA. Then there was one night where B and G ft'ed together by themselves. I didn't mind and thought I didn't care. I knew B liked my ex, but I didn't think he would act on something like that so soon after his own breakup. The two of them slowly got closer and closer and I knew the inevitable was happening. I felt jealous even though G and I had already broke up and I couldn't for the life of me figure it out until sort of recently: I was jealous that they got to do what G and I couldn't. G and B live much closer together than G and I which made it easier for them to hang out. G sat on B's lap at his birthday get-together and I was jealous that I wasn't able to do something like that when we were together and show her off in front of our friends as my gf. The reason for those things not being able to happen with G and I was either distance, other plans, or even once a car breaking down. 

The problem with the distance between me and G is we couldn't exactly call it ""long distance,"" but it was a far enough distance that if something were to go wrong on our way to the other (like a car breaking down) it could prevent the plans from happening because of how far away the other person is. 

Anyway, let's circle this back to G not wanting a relationship junior year despite now dating B and still withholding an internship - two, I think now actually. After breaking up with me because of one internship, and mentioning that she doesn't want a relationship during junior year, she then gets in a relationship with B during junior year with *two* internships this time. Can you see how this looks for me? I just keep asking myself why he's good enough for her to date and not me. Was there anything I could have done so that we would still be together? I know the answer to those questions, but when I know that B is the one holding G in his arms during a time when she explicitly said she didn't want a relationship *and* with two internships, it just makes me wonder why she chose to leave me and date him instead. It makes me wonder what he does for her that I didn't, what he is for her that I'm not.. 

I know there's no definite answer to any of these questions, but really what I want is advice on how I can get over this. I hate that it still hurts me after all this time it sounds so stupid to still be hung up and hurt after we already broke up. I haven't made any attempts to ""get her back"" or anything of the sort because I respect her decision to break up with me. I respect that they want to date each other and I would *never* want to interfere with that. I just don't know what I should do about it hurting still. I cried for an hour last night after I found out it was ""official,"" I guess you could say, indirectly through a game of truth or dare because ya know- we're teenagers and we were bored on Halloween. Basically, I found out B has kissed G below the belt which is something that G and I never did. I don't know what to do, and I genuinely thought I was over this all until I heard that. 

If anyone actually cared enough to read this all thank you just for that, and thank you even more if you have any advice - I appreciate it."

I already got an extension on it so no point in asking for another one. 

I'm just so annoyed trying to put it together because I have other crap to write (i.e. cover letters for internships) and other things to do (economics problem sets) and even just also trying to keep my mental state together as we all are amongst the whole P/NP fiasco, seeing that junior university across the Bay get P/NP for the **whole year**, feeling anxiety as US deaths continue to increase from COVID-19 and wondering if me, my family or my friends will be next, or whether we'll join the ranks of COVID long-haulers, midterms surging on, this upcoming election, wildfires, all while assignments continue to get dumped on us. 

I know it's useless to get upset about other colleges getting some variation of P/NP while Berkeley will never budge despite whatever happens in the rest of this godforsaken year but...it's hard. I don't know why, but it is. Maybe it's just the twinge of annoyance I feel that Berkeley isn't even trying to be flexible during a challenging semester. 

I am actually not...awful...at writing papers - while I have gotten poor grades on individual assignments/papers, my overall grade has always been solid in all humanities classes I have taken. I just *heavily dislike* all academic writing because it's so tiresome looking for quotes that will ""strengthen your argument"" all while making sure that your points remains solid and you don't commit any of the 2342342342342342342342342 errors in academic argumentative writing that make you get a B or a C or even worse on any given essay. 

I understand ethics are important in technology but for the love of god why make us write 4 papers on random shit about ""not excluding the disenfranchised from voting in certain states"" and ""what are the ethics of stupid data-grubbing websites that people themselves choose to sign up for knowing that it's fucking shady?"" I just fail to see how that will ever be useful, *ever* other than ""intellectual growth"" which of course never pays off in any sort of job outside of academia *rolls eyes*

Why are like, I don't know, alternate methods of assessing our knowledge on ethics sufficient? 

I just...don't even know. I'm so frustrated this class is required for the minor and am frustrated that I probably didn't sign up for less intensive ethics classes, if those exist. I give props to the teaching staff for the extensions they have given me and for being more flexible than my other classes (looking at you Econ 140...)

I know it's my fault for signing up for this class and I so badly want to rage quit this class but it'd prevent me from ever getting the minor if I didn't retake it or a substitute. 

I probably sounded incoherent, ignorant and lazy but that's my rant for the day so go bears"

So, if anyone could give me some advice on what to do here, it would be great. Should i complete this project? If not, then how should i proceed?"
jmi4ve,5,2020-11-02,Worth switching into coop?,r-e-gular-throw,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jmi4ve/worth_switching_into_coop/,"I'm in 1A CS and in non coop
Grades until now have been pretty decent, and I was thinking of switching into coop. Considering my grades at the end of the term are sufficient and I do get into coop, should I actually take it with the current job situation and stuff? Wouldn't it be tough getting a job as a first year with no relevant side projects/experience in 2021? 

Also I still have access to waterloo works and jobs that I cant see as a non coop student, I can ask my friends about them and apply directly from their website? And of course i have external job sites from which i can apply. I was also thinking about postponing/preponing study terms and trying to get internships in these breaks on my own. Considering all these facts, is it worth paying $800 along with taking PD courses every term and extending my degree to 5 years ie an added year of student loans when I could finish with 1-2 less internships in 4 years and get to working full time?

Another thing, ik there is an added benefit for employers while hiring coop students but is that true outside ontario/canada?"

jmie8n,21,2020-11-02,Desperately need help during my darkest hour. Please take a moment to read my post,RayTheRogue,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jmie8n/desperately_need_help_during_my_darkest_hour/,"My name is Rishiraj Chakravarty and I'm almost 23 years old from Guwahati, Assam, India. [I posted here asking for help before](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jldxdj/i_desperately_need_help_my_survival_is_at_stake/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and quite a few people volunteered to help me. Some offered me jobs and others offered to crowdfund a scooter so I can earn money as a Swiggy delivery boy. The delivery boy option felt like the most realistic one for me so I stuck to it. I already have a few patrons willing to help me out, they are u/satanicunicorn611 u/Depressed_Maniac u/amarviratmohaan u/BlasphemousJester u/Arkhamshark u/IAmMrunal

If we can raise 20,000 Rupees I can buy an used scooter and be a delivery boy.

Also, I didn't ask for money in my previous post, I asked for a job. People offered to crowdfund.

And so that people know that I'm not trying to scam them out of their money, here are some FAQ:

**Q: How do we know you're not a fraud?**
- This subreddit does not allow Facebook links so if you want it please DM me. That way you will have the ability to sue me if I use the money for doing something other than buying a scooter.

**Q: Why didn't you use a crowdfunding site?**
- GoFundMe is not available in India, other crowdfunding platforms don't support personal causes and those that do charge a fee and right now for me every Rupee counts. Which is why I'm putting my PayPal account link. If you wish to send money via UPI, please DM me and I will give you my number.

**Q: How do we know you will not take more money than what you're asking for?**
- I will post a screenshot with a timestamp every time I receive a donation by editing this post and once I receive enough I will notify everyone by editing this post.

**Q: Why 20,000? You could get something for a lot less.**
- Yes, I could but those scooters will be very old, will consume more fuel and have a high risk of breaking down. And if that happens I will have to pay for repairs myself and I cannot afford that. Which is why I'm looking for the best option for the lowest price I can find. I'm looking at Honda Activa since they are more reliable and economical to run.

**Q: Why do you need a scooter when you can deliver with a bicycle?**
- Zomato accepts bicycles but Zomato also has a reputation of not paying their delivery staff. I cannot take such as a risk as I have no backup. Swiggy seems more reliable to me. And if it doesn't work out, I can become a Rapido/Uber Moto driver.

**Q: You have received other job offers, why didn't you take them?**
- I have taken them. I have accepted jobs for writing articles for two websites. However, if my articles are not up to the mark, I could not get paid and I will need something else to hang on to. If I deliver food part time and write articles part time, I can provide for myself and my family well.

**Q: How are we supposed to believe you're a high school dropout and haven't passed 10th grade when everyone else has?**
- Yes it is very hard to believe that someone hasn't passed his 10th grade at the age of 23. I first had to drop out of school because my father could no longer pay for the expenses. I then joined NIOS but I suffered from a lot of mental problems for a long period of time making studying an uphill battle for me. I can post my latest marksheet if you want to confirm for yourself. English is the only subject I could pass well. Others I scraped through. I was supposed to appear for my last exam in October but Covid delayed it indefinitely. If you wish, I can also provide prescriptions of the four psychiatrists and one psychologist I visited over the years to show you my mental problems are real.

**Q: How do we know you will actually buy a scooter and not scam us?**
- I will post a picture of the scooter here once I gather the funds to prove it.

**Q: What will we get in return?**
- I can't promise you anything right away. But I am a person who never forgets when someone shows him kindness and helps him. Ideally I would like to pay you back but that will take a long time. But I will try to make it up to you if and when my situation improves. And I will never forget a single person who helps me during my darkest hour.


So if you choose to believe me or at least give me the benefit of the doubt. I would be very grateful. Even if you can donate 50 rupees, it will still get me closer to my goal. As they say in Hindi ""boond boond baney sagar"" (droplets of water make up the sea).

Edit: 4th November, I have now raised my target amount. Thank you all. PayPal will transfer the funds to bank account on 6th November. Meanwhile I will get registered at the Swiggy office and sort out my license. I hope everything works out within the week. I will keep you all updated. Thank you all again for your kindness and generosity! I will never forget it!

Update: 12 November, the license turned out to be more of a hectic process than I imagined. I have also received an offer for a paid internship writing articles. A person who commented on my previous post made the connection for me. It's a decent internship and it will help me out financially and help me improve my skills as a writer so I have contacted everyone who donated and all of them have asked me to save the money. If you donated and I haven't contacted you, I deeply apologize... I will contact you as soon as I can."
jmilh4,6,2020-11-02,Someone please advise me about my situation. Does gap year affect placements? :(,SummerFloyd,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jmilh4/someone_please_advise_me_about_my_situation_does/,"So I had a gap year after 12th grade, this one is pretty common in India and I wouldn't have worried if I only had this one. But I have two gap years in total now because of reason below. 

I'm currently in 3rd year of college, was supposed to be in 4th right now but due to very poor mental health and depression in 1st year...it led to an extra year shifting my graduation year from 2021 to 2022 instead. The extra year was because I had to redo some classes and stuff. 

Now I'm worried about my placements next year, also partially cuz I have a pretty average CGPA rn. So that basically rules out two types of companies for me - ones who want students without gap year, and ones who want good CGPA. And even the ones I get in, they might as for the reason of two gap years and I wouldn't know how to answer...

All that will leave me less options than my peers. I'm currently working on learning as many skills as I can and making my resume better and will also try for off-campus later. 

It just sucks seeing my friends already getting jobs and chilling right now, whereas I'm here worrying mindlessly just because I couldn't focus in 1st year. :( I love my field computer science and I love learning, but this fact fills me with regret and despair and keeps demotivating me everytime I think about it. I know the past is the past but still..

I've also been trying to get work-from-home internships online to build my experience when I can put on resume, but it's incredibly hard since even a small position has tons of people applying. Other than that, I'm trying to do projects which will also help with my resume. 

Is there hope for me to get a decent job when placement time comes for me? Or will I have to relegate to high competition off campus jobs? There were a few companies in my current year that didn't care about gap years or cgpa so that gives me a little hope, even tho the package might not be too great."

I'm currently pursuing an undergrad in Computer Science &amp; Engineering. I'll be graduating in Fall 2021. I have done multiple internships (totaling around a year).  I have been working on my MS applications. I also recently got placed through the college recruitment drive (a software developer role). 

I've been hearing mixed opinions from my family and friends, so I figured I'd ask you guys.

Which one would be better,

1) Going for a Master's program right after undergrad?

2) Working for a few years and then applying?

I'm not really oriented toward research.

Thanks a lot."
jmj77d,3,2020-11-02,How do they verify unpaid internships?,robin1007,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jmj77d/how_do_they_verify_unpaid_internships/,"So I might be taking an 3 month unpaid internship as backend developer intern for an IT company. They have been around for awhile, not sure if any of this helps but they: have 3000+ followers on LinkedIn, have an HR team, small dev teams, product managers, etc, so I guess they’re not a shady startup.

2. Should I mention on my resume that it’s unpaid or will that hurt my chances?

jmlf94,11,2020-11-02,Has taking a break from work helped you after burnout?,localshortstack,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jmlf94/has_taking_a_break_from_work_helped_you_after/,"I am considering leaving a job after my probation period and taking 1-2 months on rest and self-improvement. 

Some context: Back in 2019 during my final year of uni I found a full time job (afternoon shift) to afford rent and other necessities. I also had a full-time unpaid internship in a lab, where I was working on my Bachelor thesis. For half a year my  schedule looked something like this: I would go to my lab at 9am, finish at 4pm and then work at my job from 5pm to 1am. Needless to say, it was a mentally draining experience, especially since my internship had a very toxic workplace. 

After some time I found a day job (current position) in fintech and was not told the entire truth about the state of the team I would be joining and the kind of work I would be working. They did not lie, but a lot of information was not mentioned. In any case, I realized I am extremelg unfit for my current job, almost every day I have severe emotional breakdowns and I feel this is partially because I never got to rest after uni (I only  took some sick days and had a week off because of a surgery). 

I guess my question is - is it a good idea to take a break? I am financially able afford it at the moment, I am just afraid it might not fix the issue and that there are other things that should be fixed.  Perhaps someone went through a similar problem?"
jmly69,9,2020-11-02,Take offer from company A now or wait until after internship with company B (preferred) which will be in 7 months?,imjive,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jmly69/take_offer_from_company_a_now_or_wait_until_after/,"Hey guys, I tried searching around on this subreddit for someone with this same problem as me but I believe their situations were all slightly different so I would really appreciate some help! :)

So there are 2 companies:
Company A is a tech startup that has expanded and grown quite a bit so it isn't very new nor a unicorn.
Company B is a more mature company which pays ~15k more annually and seems more stable.
I think working in both companies will be interesting and exciting in their own ways.

I received an offer a week ago with company A for QA engineer role but I would like to complete my internship as a software engineer with company B first before I decide. The thing is, company B hasn't offered me a job but would like me to go through the internship before discussing a job. My internship will only start in Jan and end in May so I will only find out if I have a job offer with company B in May. I would rather work at company B but I don't know for sure if they will offer me a job there or not. I would also prefer the software engineer role at company B.

I thought about asking company A to hold the offer for me until May but this is far too long right? I also thought about telling company B my predicament but I'm not sure if this would be placing the ball in their court too much. I'm also not sure if this will change anything anyway since they said the job offer is based on my performance during the internship.

I'm also afraid of the worst case scenario of rejecting company A now and also not receiving an offer from company B after the internship in May.

What should I do? Thanks in advance! :)"

jmmn27,36,2020-11-02,My mom is a Trump supporter and it made me unpack my trauma,chimkennugent,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/jmmn27/my_mom_is_a_trump_supporter_and_it_made_me_unpack/,"There's a lot to unpack here.
When the BLM protests started earlier this year, I made an informational video about systemic racism. She saw it and really liked it, and wanted to learn more.

Fast forward to this month, she's gone full Trump supporter, antiBLM (she thinks they're a terrorist group now). Her only excuse for supporting Trump is that the economy is doing well and that he's anti-China. I'm not even anti-republican, I just wish she would see how bad he was for the country. I've tried arguing, informing, showing evidence, but like a typical Asian parent she doesn't want to hear it. I'm too young, I dont realize how good I have it in America, I don't know what I'm talking about.

I'm just so upset. I'm upset that the woman who raised me under Buddhist values to have compassion and to love others can spew the hate speech she did. I'm upset that when she gets emotional she acts like a child and says anything to hurt me. She'll compare me to my deceased father (I was 7), she'll tell me to get out of the house, and that she doesn't care about what happens to me in the future. But at the same time she's overprotective/paranoid, constantly micromanaging me.

I grew up good, compliant, good grades. I had to learn everything by myself, like reading, homework, college apps, financial aid, internships and jobs. I did a lot for her too, translating, fixing the wifi, reminding her to pay her bills. I felt like I could never depend on her for help, guidance, or even a ride home. As a kid, I would lose her in the grocery store cause she would run off. As a pre-teen, I had to deal with my mental health issues alone.  I had to walk an hour home from school unexpectedly more than once. One night, I needed a ride home from an after school event, but she left her phone at home.and went to the gym.

I was also a latchkey kid, so I've grown to have an independent personality, but I am incredibly burnt out and lazy. I'm exhausted of taking care of myself. I'm not mature, or responsible, or hardworking. I feel like a little girl who wants to be taken care of. I wish that I hadn't been a teenager teaching my mom not to hate homeless people, and to not yell at food service workers. I wish I wasn't a 22 year old trying to show my mom that she's supporting someone who is exactly what she raised me not to be. 

My mom isn't neglectful or horrible, she's dimwitted. She said she was grateful that I have compassion in my heart, despite my unideal childhood. But once I use my compassion to call out Trump's behavior and what he influences, it's all fake news. I just want her on my side, I just expected her to be a decent human being and to be better than bigotry.

jmnbgh,0,2020-11-02,Can't get any OAs despite studying at a Top University!,unary_search,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jmnbgh/cant_get_any_oas_despite_studying_at_a_top/,"I can't help it, but I'm not able to get any OAs for Summer Internships in the US.

I'm a CS masters student located in Europe and I'm about to finish my studies in a year. My university consistently ranks among the Top 100 universities worldwide(!) and is especially known for it's CS track. I got my resume checked by a professional recruiter, I have a few small projects to show on github (mostly ML/AI focused), I did an internship as engineer at a local start-up last winter, I regularly answer questions on StackOverflow / StackExchange and I keep my LinkedIn page updated and connect with employees / recruiters in the industry. I feel I check all the boxes, but nevertheless no company is willing to at least give me a chance to show my potential. This makes my hours spend on coding interview practice feel like a waste of time.

Is it because I'm a European and not a US citizen and I need a visa sponsorship? Are there stupid immigration rules I not aware of? Is it because of COVID? Has the summer internship cycle not started yet? I have not heard at all from some companies.

The cost for the companies to let me do an OA seems to be close to nothing to me. I would understand if they reject me AFTER I did the OA or the interview, but like this I feel I must have something ""on"" me that makes them reject me right away, something that disqualifies me from the beginning. One time I got a referral from an alumni of my school who works at Facebook now. The rejection mail came within a few days, no OA, no interview, nothing. I start feeling like I'm not good enough for any job ...

Any thoughts on this? Maybe someone here knows more than me, especially regarding non-US citizens doing internships in the US. Who else is in the same grind? Any help, advice or uplifting words  appreciated.

Companies I applied with: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Uber, Lyft, Twitter, Tesla, Databricks. (Probably some more). All for ML/AI or SWE Internships in Summer 2021."

I know that with the pandemic happening, there is no such a thing as a us physical internship or j-1 visa.

But, I am just curious about the whole process of getting the job offer and being approved for a j-1 visa as an international student!


A few questions only,

1- How does the timeline to get your passport with the visa on it usually look like? (A month before the job start, a week or right before, even maybe later lol)

2- Based on personal experience or hearing from friends, how intense and strict is the j-1 interview at the us consulate?( is it terrifying, or pretty straight forward)


3- Is it possible to still get employed in a Canadian company for a CS major even if you get rejected for a j-1 visa and can’t go to the states that term? Or is it just too late and you have to handle all the issues with not being able to get the Post Graduation Work Permit because taking a term off?


I have been thinking about applying for a us job as soon as the restrictions are done and they open the doors again, but these questions have been draining my mind for a while.

This experience has got me to open my eyes and start worrying about my career instead of being so carefree and pathetic. The only aspect I enjoy of coding is figuring out the logic, but now I seriously need to pull myself together and start coding diligently and productively. Until now I did not code, unless absolutely necessary, because I didn't like running into errors and not manage to figure out the error, but after this internship test, I suddenly got hit with the realization that figuring out the proper code is the most fun part. So now I really want to practice and get good, but I don't have anyone to ask. How do I practice coding in general, especially with emphasis on data structures and time complexity? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, and if this is the wrong sub to ask, can anyone direct me to the right sub to ask? Thanks for reading."
jmppxg,59,2020-11-02,Be careful about what you sacrifice for a dream offer,csthrowaway5040,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jmppxg/be_careful_about_what_you_sacrifice_for_a_dream/,"This recruiting season I decided I wanted to go all out, and that's what I did. I sent out about 150 applications and did around 25 final round interviews. These interviews included non-tech companies, banks, unicorns, and FAANG. I ended up receiving \~20 offers, including ones to my dream companies for internships. For  background, I only have 1 previous internship experience at a no-name company in a rural town in the middle of nowhere. I don't do side projects, and I go to a state school (albeit a top one in CS).

Throughout the interview process, I traded my health, sleep, and sanity in hopes of landing another offer. I wrapped up my internship search very recently, and right now I've realized how much I sacrificed, and I don't feel it was worth it. When I got my the call from the recruiter letting me know about my offer from my dream company, I wasn't even *excited* anymore. And even now, I just feel so burned out, and I can't even feel happy about where I am. In other words, I just feel so empty and unfulfilled. This is not what I expected. I remember thinking at the beginning of the season how **incredible** it would feel to finally land a FAANG/unicorn offer. Let me tell you right now that I feel no different than before I landed those offers. In fact, I think I feel even worse.

I'm definitely going to take it easy for the next couple weeks, attempt to destress, and try to find my drive and passion for CS again. But I thought this might be a good reminder for some: there are lots of great companies out there, guys, but it's probably not worth trading your health just to chase after one of them. You'll have many great opportunities to take in your lifetime, but you only have one life and one body. Take good care of it so that you can truly enjoy those opportunities when they do come.

Also, if any of you guys have any advice for what I should do to get back into a proper mental state, I would love to hear it, cause I could really use some.

EDIT: in before I get slammed: I do want to emphasize that I'm extremely grateful and have been insanely lucky to be in this position, especially since so much of interviewing come down to luck. However, the point of my post is to serve as a reminder that a) learn to be happy with yourself. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how big or small you feel they are. and b) getting a top internship isn't everything. you may *think* that once you get that dream offer, you'll be all set and everything will be sunshine and rainbows. But that doesn't always happen, and instead try to focus on enjoying life in the moment and giving yourself some self-love, alright? :)"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a senior at a decent(ish) uni in India. I've been planning to apply to MS in CS at top US Universities for the Fall 21 term. However, I recently received an internship offer from a certain rainforest company.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now really stuck between the two. On one hand, I've always wanted to pursue MS, On the other, the offer is very attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, would you recommend applying for MS right away or should I take the offer and apply for MS 1 or 2 years down the line? (I don't think I will re-evaluate my MS plans)

&amp;#x200B;

* What (if any) are the major advantages of taking up the job. Does it affect my admission chances, or is it more beneficial if I decide to go into the industry?
* What (if any) are the major advantages of choosing MS?

&amp;#x200B;

Please include your reasons behind either suggestion. The purpose of this post is not only to seek a recommendation but also to identify factors I may have overlooked.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

I have graduated with a degree in both Cyber Criminology and Computer Science. Unfortunately I was an idiot and didnt take some of my courses as seriously as I should have and my coding skills are not up to par. I am currently working on projects, taking night courses, as well as studying my old textbooks to get better. My end goal is to become a software engineer at some point in the future.

But, bills need to be paid so I am currently working for a Information Services company (that hire from within at about a 90% rate for their internships, engineering positions, and other positions) as a customer service representative. 
I am part time at a $10 rate.
I have held this position for going on 6 months now. 

I noticed however that there are positions open/available to apply to.
So I have 3 options now:

1. Stay where I am until I feel comfortable to apply to an internship or engineering position (either inside or outside my current company)

2. Apply to a Data entry/ document processing position
   - still part time &amp; same pay of $10/hour 

3. Apply to a Front desk/office assistant position 
    - full time &amp; pays $13-$-15/ hour

What would you do? What do you think would be the best option for a career? Do data entry positions help to break into the software engineering world at all? Or do I take more money while I continue to work on my skills? I'm very torn between these so any advice would be beyond appreciated."
jmqnxb,1,2020-11-02,I don't actually know what my qualifications are,kalisarms,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jmqnxb/i_dont_actually_know_what_my_qualifications_are/,"I'm a 4th year CS student (that's gonna take a 5th year) and I have a slightly embarrassing question. 

I don't actually know what Linux is. 

It started bothering me a lot this past weekend when I managed to network myself into an internship opportunity, and was asked ""do you know Linux"" (or ""do you have experience with Linux?"") And I answered easily ""yes!"" Since my first CS glass freshman year, we've been using a GL server and putty (and emacs as a text editor (/ide?)) to program our assignments, organize various files, create our makefiles, and submit assignments. 

Is this enough to say I'm experienced with Linux? Is this even what Linux is? I basically just see it as a way of navigating and organizing files... Basic commands I know off the top of my head: ls, cd, rm, mv, cp, mkdir, ssh, scp, etc. I'm currently learning assembly and am using bash from my command prompt instead of through putty. I haven't done any scripting or use of any bash commands outside of what I listed above. 

Again, I KNOW how ridiculously dumb this question is. But I genuinely feel like I've never actually been taught what to call what I'm using, and what knowledge I have that's actually a skill. The possible internship opportunity followed up me saying I knew Linux by saying ""good, we tried hiring from [other local university] and it was a total bust, none of them have used Linux."" That made me particularly uneasy because I feel like you could learn everything I know about Linux in a couple hours, so I must not know what they're looking for. 

Side note: is emacs a skill for a resume? Various IDEs or text editors? (I've used tons, VScode is my current favorite) If your answer is ""Google is your friend""... You're right, sorry. 


tl;dr - What the hell is Linux? What can I put on my resume without lying or seeming like an idiot in an interview?

I was only 19 with little exp, so anything that was offered to me I was going to take. I took a Jr. Sys Admin job..

Day 2 on the job a ticket comes in to unlock a users account. Mind you this guy was just a random marketing person. No big deal. 

Boss at the time assigned the tickets out. He assigned it to me, and apparently when he assigned you a ticket the automatic email wasn’t a good enough notification for me. 

So, he then calls the guy who he assigns the ticket to and let’s them know to start working on it. I didn’t answer because I was taking a dump (gone 4mins tops). So he walks over to my desk, and was waiting for me to return... 

I’m like tf is going on lol bc he has this kinda pissed off look lol

“I assigned you an account unlock ticket. I called you. Where were you?”

“In the bathroom.”

“Do this now. I will wait here. Should only take you a minute.”

That night I said F this and took my old job back as an IT intern making $12/hr lol 

I lasted 3 days. 

Now I’m doing great. Got a good gig a short while after the internship focusing on cloud/devvy type stuff!"

Here is the thirty-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will you in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in most every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

I am a student of third year pursuing enginnering degree in IT field. Now at this time the college forces you to get ready for placement but I wonder why do most of the packages in majority of the colleges have a package range from 4-8 lakh rupees only . Moreover at the time of interview , they need internship also for locking in the placement . 

Isn't the amount way too less for a new engineer comparison to other countries .

Would like your feedback and comment on this.

Some background on me. I'm 20, live in California, my desired career is to be a fish and game warden. The minimum requirement is an associates degree but due to the competitive nature of I did community college right out of high school for a year but didn't do well. Like, basically would eventually drop all the classes. This was due to not really having a plan for how to go about things(should have seen a counselor) or understanding credits, major requirements and general education purposes. I did eventually look into EMT training both as a job for the rest of college and solid first responder experience.


I did the first half with another community college last year, started with another earlier this year but then COVID hit, classes moved online and procrastination set in. I did a 10 week program with CalRegional and am now waiting till I can be approved for the NREMT. I plan on doing classes again the coming Spring 2021 as an environmental science major and have spoken with a counselor to lay things out. When you apply to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the hiring process(fitness test, background check, etc) takes around two years, so if I hopefully line things up I can have finished my bachelor's before going to the academy if I'm accepted. The academy for game wardens starts in January and ends in August.


However I'm caught between two options: A) either I finish it in 3 years by doing a couple of summer sessions and go to the 2024 academy or B) do it in 4 years with no summer sessions and go to the 2025 academy.


If I did A, it would look like this: Spring 2021-&gt;Summer 2021-&gt;Fall 2021-&gt;Spring 2022(associates for transfer finished, apply to fish and wildlife department), break during Summer 2022, go to university to finish Fall 2022-&gt;Spring 2023-&gt;Summer 2023-&gt;Fall 2023(go to 2024 academy)


If I did B, it would look like this: Spring 2021-&gt;Fall 2021-&gt;Spring 2022-&gt;Fall 2022(associates for transfer finished, apply to start hiring process), Spring 2023-&gt;Fall 2023-&gt;Spring 2024-&gt;Fall 2024(go to 2025 academy)




24 honestly sounded like a good age to finally start my main career, but then there is seeing about some volunteering or internship to boost my chances and get my foot in the door. I'm not sure what volunteering or whatever that Fish and Wildlife might have during the pandemic though, as I know some areas are closed off as part of precaution measures. Since game wardens have search and rescue duties and operate among hunters, boaters, and hikers(drowning, maulings, shootings, etc) the EMT experience would definitely look good but I know I should try to ''get my foot in the door'' which would be easier with Option B.


Like with option A I would have summer of 2022 where maybe I could do something. There is the consideration of a social life. Not a party animal or really extroverted but I do know you need a break sometimes and relax and enjoy your 20s. Option B would also be easier in that regard but might not be impossible with Option A. There is also considering working as an EMT while in college which is not uncommon but do want to keep an eye on with summer classes and can depend on what shifts you get(12hr, 24hr, 48hr). I'm not to sure on either. Money isn't an issue, as I have high functioning autism so I get sponsorship through vocational rehabilitation.

jmxrek,1,2020-11-02,Going into sales temporarily as a recent graduate and other career advice,Connor_Sim_sun,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jmxrek/going_into_sales_temporarily_as_a_recent_graduate/,"Hey everyone, 

A little background: I graduated in May with a degree in electrical engineering and a minor in physics. I excelled in my courses (got a 3.6/4.0) but didn't have an internship during my time at school. Obviously not having an internship on my resume is kind of a hindrance but I held positions in organizations at my school that covered my tuition and helped me gain some ""soft skills"" and a good deal of project management experience. The drawback to these positions is that they required me to work during the summers, which inevitably caused scheduling conflicts with other opportunities. I figured having high grades, some unique work/management experience, and a few tangible personal projects would kind of make up for the lack of a formal internship, and graduating with as little debt as possible was a priority for me (I live in the US). 
 
As I'm sure is the case elsewhere, the job market isn't too great where I live right now and it seems like entry level positions are few and far between. The ones that do become available are expectedly getting a ton of applicants and I haven't been able to land anything yet. Earlier today I saw someone looking for resumes to fill an engineering sales position at a fairly huge company, and figured I would send mine in just for the hell of it. I got a response back pretty much immediately about scheduling an interview which is a first in the past few months. 

I am not terribly interested in doing sales. I know that the money is generally better, but I really would rather be on the technical side of things as much as possible. I feel like I could do the sales job competently, but I feel that I would really be looking to move to a more technical position as soon as I was able to. I'd appreciate any answers/advice you folks could give to some of these questions I'm having: 

Is it a bad move to go into sales for a short time (maybe 6-8 months) or until I can score something more technical? Is it difficult to move into a technical/design area when the only strictly engineering experience is in sales? Under more normal circumstances, would it really be this difficult to secure a position without an internship on my resume or did I graduate at the worst possible time? Is it worth holding out a little while longer for something I'm ultimately way more interested in? 

I suppose if there's anything it seems like I didn't ask feel free to give me some pointers in other areas. I appreciate any and all advice/insight. Thanks in advance!"

I was in talks of getting my Internship converted to a Full-time Opportunity and I have always heard good reviews from my Manager, AVP and VP of the Data Science Department. They are encouraging me to apply for open positions, once they are rolled out and then hire me through that process. 

There was a lot of restructuring going into the firm and hence I think the Open Positions are not live yet, but I think they will roll out in this Month or so.

Have anyone faced this before ? If yes, did the company hired you back after a break in your employment ?"

I picked up a pretty small internship, 15/hr and 5 hours a week maximum - it wasn't much, but it was something. I interviewed for the place, completed their assignment, started two weeks ago.

A week after I started (this was last week), I got an interview request from a place I applied to for a full time position. This interview led to several others, and I ended up snagging the job. I was thrilled, naturally, and they asked me to come in on Monday (today).

Truth is, I messed up a bit - I ended up ghosting my boss for the part-time position over the weekend. I tend to be a non-confrontational person with a load of social anxiety (something I'm working on trying to fix because it's honestly such a bad trait of mine) - and I couldn't bring myself to just tell my part-time boss that I had to quit. I felt terrible because I was pretty much the only intern doing a certain task, and I knew it'd be a hassle for them to find another one. I ended up emailing him last night telling him I'd resend the assignment I'd completed for him.

Fast forward to today, and it was orientation - I was pretty much caught up in a ton of meetings, getting to know the staff, receiving my work computer, and going through tons of slides with company policies - I was booked the entire day. Then after work, I checked my phone, and I noticed I had four missed calls from my part-time boss, as well as a voicemail - naturally I panicked.

I ended up drafting a very apologetic and long email explaining my situation and the full-time offer, and it ended with me explaining that I'd be willing to complete the week's worth of work if that would help them in any way, and that I had to quit the part time position. I sent it, and now I'm just mulling over the situation.

I feel really terrible, but also really shocked that he called me so many times - we have a Slack and email system, and he didn't reach out to me on both ends, so I'm just a little anxious and confused - also because the position is rather lax (half an hour to an hour max of work daily).

Did I do the right thing (by sending the email, obviously not the weekend ghosting - that was my fault).

tldr; I recently accepted a full-time job offer at a really nice place, with a good salary &amp; working environment, accidentally ghosted my part-time job's boss and sent a very abrupt quitting email."

I have a local offer for a position as an IT System Engineer, and was told I would just need to get my Windows Server 2016 cert to get it (they would pay for it). However, I'm not sure if I should take the job if it's not going to help my career; if that's the case, I'd rather spend that time doing research projects or applying for software internships (also the cert is 3 separate exams and time-consuming to attain).

I've done 3 or 4 practice tests and I seem to get 70\~85% of the questions right depending on the day, but what I miss seems to be scattered randomly, though I think I might have issues with ACLs and port numbers the most - though to be honest the PBQs scare me a touch (I narrowly avoided them when I got A+ cause I did both tests same day about a month before it expired).

The difference in intern comp isn't super important to me. Also was wondering why a significant amt of people prefer Msft over Amazon if TC isn't as great (is it due to WLB/culture)?

Would really appreciate any advice/help in the decision! Thanks :)))

For some context, my credentials are: 5 internships (1 of which is currently in progress), 4.0 GPA, prestigious honors program, and captain of an NCAA DIII team. That being said, I just got an offer for a Data Analyst position in the San Jose, CA area at a very big company (not big 4 though), and am a little surprised/disappointed with the compensation and other offer details. For example, I would be getting paid a salary wage, meaning no overtime and the hours could be as crazy as they want. The salary itself is only 63k per year, which given the area and the average entry level data analyst salary, is very low. The San Jose area is one of the most expensive places to live in the country. I definitely feel like I should negotiate for a higher salary, simply because 1) it is way below the relative-industry standard, 2) it is not a proper living wage, and 3) I know my value and experience is worth more than that. I would like some opinions on this, whether people agree or disagree, and any suggestions as to what I should do. Thanks in advance!"

I'm currently interning as a web-developer using react and node. 

While there is much to learn, I realize that I really want to work as a quant developer, or a trader developer in the long term. Something that is really challenging and intense, while paying well. But the problem is I have no clue how to get there, and whether it is worth the journey.

Some people say to stick with front-end and try to get into banks there, but but most of the bank entry jobs requires Java, C++, C# etc. However most of the local web-dev jobs ask for web-dev JS, React, node etc.

There is a tradeoff here. I can continue learning web-dev and have a relatively safer path, since there is a lot of positions available. But in the long-term my growth might cap-off, or I might just be endlessly learning frameworks again and again.

Or I can drop everything, take a risk and learn C++, Java and Algo+DS and have a go at getting into those banks, which there is no guarantee of getting (but neither is web dev, I'm only an intern so I don't know much)

I don't know what to do. Is it worth dropping everything to learn C++ and Algo to get into banks, to pursue something as competitive as quant developer roles, or am I being naïve and risk losing time and opportunity because even if I learn it, I won't get into bank roles anyways as it is competitive already? Or should I just stick to web dev roles. Thank you."

The interview was just a normal conversation between me and 2 company employees (turned out the company doesn't have real HR department).They got excited by my resume and told me to come again for the second phase of the hiring process.

In the second interview i sat down with the company owner and spoke for around 20 minutes about my ambitions and what i like about AI.

He told me that i got the job and that i will start on Monday.

I asked him about the work schedule and he told me its from 9am to 6:30pm. I got that as a red flag

but i didn't reply on that.He also told me to come to work with a suit and a tie. I asked him why and he told me that we have to look more professional because most of my coworkers are young.

On my first day they showed me the space and then i met a team of interns who they were working on small projects to sell on companies.

The owner told me to sit down with every other intern to see on what they are working on.

Every single one of them was assigned to build a program on their own so the company could sell it until their internship ended. Two projects had to do with CV and the other two had to do with NLP.

I learned from the guys that they didn't get any training at all and they were just assigned a job.i got very sceptical about my future there instantly.

On my second day i sat down with my manager and she gave me a dataset from a shipping company.

She asked me to extract information and find a relationship between ship repair time based on damages from past data using regression. 

When i started asking questions she couldn't answer them and told me to ask other co workers for help. After that i just couldn't wait for my day to end.

Today is my third day at work and it really didn't go as planned.I don't know if its me the company or my expectations about my position.

Should i resign and look for a new internship or every job that's  has to do with machine learning will be like that.?"

Even before I started to study CS, a big insurance company reached out to me on LinkedIn for an internship, requiring ~20h a week work. I worked for them for roughly half a year as junior SWE in web &amp; mobile (Angular/Flutter).

I quitted to focus on my studys as money is not really a problem rn. 

They offered me a job as working student for 18€ per hour. Some other guys in university says that this is a crazy good salary for a student because the offers they received are usually between 10-15€. But those guys are pretty inexperienced, with no own projects or experience in industry practices like agile working methods.

TBH I think 18€ is pretty reasonable for someone who knows some programming languages &amp; paradigms and is comfortable with git &amp; scrum. I heard of interns at FAANG who earn 3000£/month or more...

I am currently in a position where I am trying to walk in an interns shoes and better understand what an intern is looking for when scouting out opportunities for new internships.

I am currently looking for some interns for my tech start-up and want to better understand some of the key details that interns will be looking for such as pay, length of internship, micro-management levels, etc.

jncdq8,1,2020-11-03,Am I viable candidate for an Entry Level EE position?,eats_sand,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jncdq8/am_i_viable_candidate_for_an_entry_level_ee/,"I was fortunate enough to ride out some job less/the storm off of savings and continue with school for fall the semester. I could maybe stretch to spring, the bottom line is I need to start working soon. However with my experience history, general skillsets and level of education I would be wasting precious time ""Just getting a job"". The minimum default I should look into I believe is an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Background; I graduate next spring (May 2022) with a BSEE (Just a general one, slightly geared toward embedded). Spring 2021 will be my last semester of core classes. Next year will be senior design and electives. I also have a lot of experience in the field in general. (Good gpa, &gt;3.5)

\~Been tinkering with electronics/computers since middle school. I am nearly 30.

\-I've had multiple jobs now as Intern/Coop/Associate engineer type.

\-I've been working since I was 15, and just have a crap to on of general experience. I'm no fish out of water in the field.

\-I work on engines as a hobby, extremely mechanically inclined. (Almost went ME).

\-IC modems (Quectel, uBlox)/custom IoT stuff. Worked with ThreadX and mBedOS, can navigate a debugger/gcc. Actually improved existing designs.

\-Commissioning engineer; verify large scale construction sites, sign off on them (Sign off on function, legal levels of operation, nothing structural that would require any PE) read schematics for custom projects, relay info back to engineer and back to customer. Provided useful suggestions in the field. (Example I was able to test and let engineering know we were losing data to due to the length/resistance of the wire and they could design a work around that)

\-I have created schematics, 3d models(kiCad, can figure out Altium in a week), BOMs for personal projects. I even calculated real costs of production (with just using digikey).

\-Setup tests using a DAQ/python scripts, shunt resistors (I'm intentionally being vague here).

Co-Op I am almost 100% confident I am qualified for, maybe slightly over. But only big 5's are really dong co-ops in my area. I apply to everyone that pops up but still haven't heard from them. (Though they are for 2021 anyways).

Internships exist yes but I do feel somewhat overqualified for an Internship at this point. (Hence why they are plan C)

I have not heard back on any associate positions unfortunately, have been rejected at some. No reasons for rejection on Entry-level applications yet. ""Great skills, but nah"". Recruiters tell me no degree is a deal breaker every time although I check other boxes. I keep getting contacts from recruiters but I am sure most of them are not reading that I have not graduated yet. Because that's were we always end up. (I paid to have my resume structured to hit all the ATSs correctly and that's been working really well. Should also add it is not filled with fluffy BS. It is very technically succinct.)

Am I out of my head shooting for entry-level positions?

Would I be having different luck if were in a somewhat different time period? (Still plenty of engineering jobs but I'm guessing the competition and barriers to entry have greatly increased in this moment).

Am I realistic in thinking; Entry level position would be awesome, co-op probably more ideal, internship a solid plan C?

&amp;#x200B;

I've kind of aimlessly been just throwing shit at a wall seeing what sticks. (I still put effort into the app, tailoring resume, cover letter etc). But so far the feedback feels like I'm thinking incorrectly in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love any advice. (I'm trying to setup myself up to be able to work in cybersecurity/infosec, solar/renewables, embedded and maybe someday combine all 3)"
jncpv8,1,2020-11-03,State of affairs survey,panamabee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jncpv8/state_of_affairs_survey/,"I read that there are millions of unfilled CS roles out there. I believe it was the bureau of labor statistics. And the the field is expected to experience growth far greater than any other industry. Yet i see fresh graduates (I am not one) struggling to find employment in the field, unpaid internships abound. People are putting out hundreds of resumes and being ghosted. 

By contrast, My dad was hired and trained by a corporation after ten years working as a carpenter-  with 0 school experience in the late seventies, and so were all his colleagues. They were later sent to CS night school to learn more all on said Corp’s dime. Eventually running huge mainframe data centers and writing applications in all the hot languages of the 90’s (was it c++?) idk I was a kid.

jnfnjb,1,2020-11-03,Learning on my own until school starts next month,bobbyslapps,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jnfnjb/learning_on_my_own_until_school_starts_next_month/,"I feel so lost learning on my own. Currently I’m watching YouTube videos and taking the courses on freecodecamp. 

I’ve been learning about web development (front and back end) for about a month 1/2 now. I feel so lost haha. I know I’m super new but still. The good thing though is that I am picking it up fairly easy. The bad part, I’m not even sure how to be creative right now lol. 

A little backstory: I’ve been in the creative field my entire life (I’m turning 25 in 20 days). I first got into photography when I was younger and moved around from state to state a lot. I got to go on tour with a couple artist, I’ve gotten to shoot for some big fashion industries, I worked my way into web design (worked on some e-commerce stores) and became a marketing manager for a company out in CO. I’ve always been interested in how computers work. How you can program a computer and build apps, websites, robots, ect. So I’m changing my career and really wanting to have this as my main life career. Most of it is how creative you are as a person and how you can create things right? I figured I would excel at that part of it. 

But now that I’m learning it, my creative ideas aren’t really coming to me. Now I have to learn how to be creative, but describe it in words. 

I start school next month and I’m getting my associates in computer science at a community college. After that I’ll transfer to a University where I can then get my bachelors. During my college time I plan on learning on my own while learning in school, and build my own portfolio up. So by the time I at least get my associates I’ll have a solid portfolio and hopefully some experience being an intern somewhere. 

Moral of the post: what is the best thing to learn? Where does anyone start in this field? What are the possibilities with this? What can you create? 

The reason I’m going to college is because I want to learn the theories, machine learning, algorithms, and a bunch of other things that learning on my own would be tough for me. Plus having a degree can take you much further than not having one at all. Yes it’s about HOW GOOD YOU ARE but once I get good plus have a degree I’ll be set."
jnh7f6,3,2020-11-03,"Received an offer. Feels like a slight upgrade, but cannot decide if it's worth it",OforOatmeal,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jnh7f6/received_an_offer_feels_like_a_slight_upgrade_but/,"For a bit of background, I'm currently working on a Service Desk in a contract position for an insurance company. I've been here for a year, and have been doing very well with feeling like I'm not even putting much effort in. My day to day involves troubleshooting for the office suite, web browsers, VPN connections and tokens for offshore users, but I feel like in just a year I've hit a bit of a cap in terms of the knowledge I can wring out here.

My school (4 year state university. Majoring in Networking Information Technology) posted an opening for a Systems Administrator internship, which I applied for with the mindset that at worst, it would be good interviewing experience. The interview process gave me a lot of mixed signals. The job is 1099 with a slight raise, and is another contract position, but the daily duties sound like they would be much more involved, and allow me to dip my toes into a SysAdmin role, something I was considering after graduating. The two people I interviewed with (CIO and other SysAdmin) were both very nice and seemed to really like me, but explained that there is a large amount of work coming in that they need an extra set of hands to handle, as they both routinely take help desk tickets.

As I see it, the pros and cons for each job are:

Current job:

+ +WFH full time (big deal for me living with 2 high-risk parents)

+ +Set schedule that works perfectly with taking 5 classes

+ +W2 employment

+ ~Boring, but easy work

+ -Not much opportunity for OTJ learning, fear of stagnating.

Offer:

+ +New title for resume
+ +Chance to learn a lot more on the job
+ -More stringent schedule
+ -1099, another contract role
+ -No remote work available

Insight would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading!"
jnhbs8,55,2020-11-03,"The end of my internship hunt. Comprehensive post with my resume, journey, Sankey Diagram and list of companies that I applied to, as well as topics asked by several good companies.",[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jnhbs8/the_end_of_my_internship_hunt_comprehensive_post/,"Hi everyone, so I've finally ended my internship hunt and I wanted to make a comprehensive post about it.

The post will be structured the following way: I'll talk about my academic/professional background and the offers I got. My first failure last year. My interview prep journey, and the questions I was asked at some companies that have a ""good prestige"". And at the end I'll link the sankey diagram and a list of all the companies that I applied to.

So first things first, if you are reading this you probably first want to know what offers I got and based on those decide whether this post is worth reading. I got offers from Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Cockroach Labs, Uber and Snap, I know, no FAANG companies, if it helps, I have my final interview with Facebook soon but I'll end up taking the offer from Snap regardless.

So who am I? I am a senior that is currently a student at a top 20 school in the US, University of Maryland at College Park. I have held 1 internship at my University and 1 internship at a F500 company. In my first semester of college I was an EE student, took a programming class (in which I didn't do well, but I'll get to that later) and really liked it, so I decided to switch to CE. Later, in my 6th semester, I realized that I hated the hardware part of CE and that the coursework was making my life miserable, so I decided to switch to CS and a minor in mathematics, and as a result I will complete my degree in 4.5 years, instead of the traditional 4, so this is my last internship.

Like I mentioned before, CE was making my life miserable, and due to a mix of the difficulty of the major and the lack of interest that I had for 70% of its classes, my grades are pretty bang average, and the grades of the CS classes I took while being a CE major aren't good because I sacrificed a lot of time to focus on the EE classes. Why do I say this? Well, I want to convince you that grades aren't everything and that with enough effort, you can probably get into one of these great companies too!

Here are some of my grades in CS courses while I was a CE major:

* EE programming class in C: C+
* Object Oriented in Java: B
* Intro to Data Structures in Java: C
* Intro to Computer Systems: C
* Discrete Structures: C
* Intro to Computer Architecture: B-

My overall GPA is 3.05 and as you can see MY GRADES ARE NOT GREAT, and its important to understand the following thing: GRADES WON'T GET YOU THAT INTERNSHIP, but it's important that you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Anyways, now that I have made quite the long introduction, I want to talk about my first failure last year, and that is when I got to the final round of Microsoft's SWE internship barely knowing how to reverse a linked list (yeah I know that's a meme, but I'm being quite serious lol). There were in person interviews for Microsoft in my university, and there I got asked a riddle, which I solved and then had a nice conversation with the engineer, who was super nice. A week later I got a notification that I made it to the final round and that I'd be flying to Seattle in the next 2 weeks. That's when I first found out about Leetcode and r/cscareerquestions, and realized how unprepared I was for the interview. I tried to cram as much information as I could, but when I got to the onsite interviews I panicked and couldn't do 2 Leetcode easy questions about strings and trees, needless to say that I didn't get the offer. Then, I realized that if only I have prepared properly I would have been able to breeze through the interview and get an extremely well paying internship that would set me up pretty well by the time I graduate, so after crying on the phone while having a phone conversation with my dad, I told myself that I would not let that happen again, and this is when my journey to land a top tech internship started.

On the second semester of junior year (so last semester) I was taking my university's Algorithms course, which is known to be extremely brutal and difficult, but I realized how important this course was, both for upper level electives and interview prep, so I tried harder in this course than I ever did in any other course and managed to get an A-. After taking the course I felt that I had a pretty good understanding of runtime complexities, sorting algorithms, graph theory and common graph algorithms about shortest paths and minimum spanning trees, but when it came down to implementation of many data structures and Leetcode questions I still struggled, which brings me to the next step in my journey.

From my experience and the way I understand things, I have notices that those who have a solid understanding of the theory behind data structures and algorithms, tend to struggle less when doing Leetcode problems in their interview prep. As a result of this thinking, I decided to read ""The Algorithm Design Manual"" by Steven S. Skiena. And the way I structured my studying was like this:

* Week 1. Read Chapter 3 and implement each data structure mentioned here in Python
* Week 2. Already familiar with sorting and graphs, so read Chapter 4 and 5 and implement all graph algorithms presented in chapter 5.
* Week 3. Read Chapter 6 and 7 without implementing anything
* Week 4. Read Chapter 8.

After reading this book, I decided to do 2 problems a day, and focus on 1 type of problems each week. The list of problems that I ended up using was this one, and I heavily recommend it to anybody that wants to land a good tech internship: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) . I am not kidding when I say that after studying the Algo Design Manual, I could solve the vast majority of medium questions here in \~30 minutes, it is an excellent resource for sure. And for the questions I couldn't solve as fast, I usually took \~1-2 hours to solve them, but then when seeing similar problems I'd get them pretty fast, so it's extremely important that you understand how to implement those problems and can come up with the solutions yourself without cheating, and by cheating I mean looking at the solutions.

In the meantime, in early July, some companies started posting openings, and as soon as anything came out, I'd instantly apply there, the link that I used is this one: [https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships)

2 weeks before school started, after I finished doing like 90% of the questions there and some other ones, I felt very comfortable with most Leetcode Mediums, so I decided to stop doing Leetcode and that I was prepared enough. From my understanding, when you can solve a large amount of Leetcode mediums in \~20-25 minutes, that's when you're properly prepared, because often times companies ask you 2 questions per interview, so you want to be confident that you can solve 2 standard questions in the allotted time. For the next 2 weeks, I did 1 interview a day on [pramp.com](https://pramp.com)  to start practicing my interviewing skills. And two weeks later I felt comfortable talking and sharing how I thought through problems, so I reached the end of my ""interview prep grind"".

Now these are the topics I got asked for the companies that gave me offers, and other ones that rejected me.

* Goldman Sachs (offer): Dynamic programming, backtracking, and design questions. Note: I didn't get the backtracking question working and still got the offer
* Coursera (rejection): Graphs and strings in first round, backtracking in final round
* Capital One (offer): Strings, arrays, linked lists and design questions.
* Palantir (withdrew): Graphs. Note: Passed the Karat interview, but after learning about the shady shit that they do I decided to withdraw from the application process.
* Cockroach Labs (offer): First round was a design question. Final round was backtracking.
* Uber (offer): Both first and final round were graph and string questions.
* Bloomberg (rejection in first technical screen): design question
* Snap (offer): First round was graphs, strings and lists. Final round was graphs
* Facebook (currently in final round): Graphs and lists.

Finally some tips that I would give to people:

* Understand that this field, and especially top companies are very competitive, so getting these positions is supposed to be difficult
* Leverage resources like Pramp, because often times, being able to clearly express your thoughts and implementations can be just as important as the implementation itself
* When doing an interview, spend the first 5-10 minutes talking about your thought process. What I like to do is to analyze the problem as I talk, and once I come up with an implementation, walk through my algorithm in a sample case before I even implement it, this will let the interviewer understand how the algorithm works and will show that you have good communication skills
* Understand that for some people it takes more time or less time to learn. I know of a kid that didn't do interview prep and got an offer as an Amazon intern last year, so I acknowledged that I am not that skilled or capable and just focused on myself
* There is a certain element of luck and randomness in this process, and you have to acknowledge this, I have gotten rejected on resume screening by Disney but got an offer at Snap, things sometimes don't make sense, but since it's out of your control you should not worry about it
* Focus on yourself, the grass is always greener on the other side, so make sure you focus on improving yourself and you compare yourself with who you used to be, not person X who is a 5-time FAANG intern with a 4.0 GPA and multiple publications. You are you, and you should be worried about yourself and what you can do to improve yourself and your current situation.

I realize that I'm not casting a wide enough net. I'm also interested in non-tech jobs that would take me with my CS degree. I don't mean tech jobs in a non-tech company. I mean a job whose functions are barely technical but my CS degree will give me an advantage or at least be relevant in some way.

Hopefully this made sense. All I'm looking for is how I can find non-tech jobs that welcome CS majors. Things like common job role names etc that I can use as keywords when searching. Thanks in advance."

jnhwxl,5,2020-11-03,Trade-off and current state of Scala and its future,1way2improve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jnhwxl/tradeoff_and_current_state_of_scala_and_its_future/,"Hi everyone! How are you? 

Let me describe my problem. At university I mostly used Java and Python. Not so long ago I started something like an internship at a company. It's not a typical internship and more like regular classes 3 times a week + homework. When I was enrolling into it I thought that I would be a Java developer. Even though the company's clients are banks and probably there's lots of legacy projects - it was ok to me and the company seems cool.

When the classes started it turns out that my mentor and mentors of some other guys are Scala devs and they currently work with big data, building its services/microservices. So, they offered us to do our internship projects in Scala. That means we are going to do our homework for Java classes in Java (starting from Hello World and ending at RESTs in Spring, I think I already know 60% of materials of classes). But our internship projects are supposed to be done in Scala.

It's ok to me. I have a math background (am 1st year of my Master's degree) and a strong interest in big data. But here is one major problem: I live in a relatevely small city of Eastern Europe (900k population). That means there are only 4-6 Scala/BigData opened job positions in my town and they are mostly for senior and middle devs.

I am afraid that after I finish my internship the company won't hire me because of a lack of available positions. You know, companies often teach more students than they need at the moment just in case if someone rejects an offer. And I still can choose to have a project in Java.

So, my 3 main questions are:

1) How easy is to switch from Scala to Java (Spring + Hibernate, for instance)? Will I be able to be hired with no commercial experience  in Java but with an internship in Scala? Would you hire a junior dev like this?

2) What do you think the state of Scala right now in terms of demand at the labor market and where will it be in 1-2 years, in your opinion?

3) Yeah, basically, it's a trade-off between stability of finding a job in Java and trying to get into more interesting field with a chance of being unemployed at all. Though, I realise the final decision is up to me  I want to read what you guys think in general.

Thanks for reading!"

with gpa enough to pass but not enough to sit in college placements, exactly 0.5 below required.
so, as it goes, i was hikkikomori then, but i found it somewhat peaceful. now, I'm stuck with my family because i had no reason to stay there anymore.

as the title goes, I've been depressed for some time now, tho never officially ""diagnosed"" because I'd have to say to other people that something is wrong with me, which is one of my biggest fears.

i planned to end it if i didn't get a job directly out of University, but now i can't because it's harder to do with people around, even tho it's just a matter of deciding since i live quite high and would probably not survive the fall.

worst of it is i wake up everyday and apply to jobs. of i were lucky I'd get an interview, and I've never cleared the first round because i get flustered and fuck up somewhere due to pressure, even unpaid internships are too hard to get these days.

mfs these employees want years of experience for a job that doesn't require any, high GPAs for internships that don't pay any money, and expect me to live through without money.

i don't expect to last much longer at all. I'd rather end it soon.
so i guess life's just not meant for people like me.

I think my interview process was better with Qualtrics and I had better interactions with the recruiter whereas Coursera gave me an offer practically a month and a half after the final interview so I felt like I was being ghosted lol.   


I'm definitely interested in both of what these companies do, but I don't have experience using either of them lol so its hard to tell. If anyone has worked at Qualtrics or Coursera, I would love to hear about your experience! I am not team matched at either company but will be able to eventually put down my team preferences too.

I came in as pre-med biomedical engineering but then realized that the entire medical school thing might not be it for me (and also I hate biology as a subject) and switched to CS kind of on a whim bc I was told that the software engineering field has fairly good job prospects and I don’t mind programming. 

So currently with CS my ideal career would be something like a position at a tech startup for social impact in healthcare (then I still get to help people, as cheesy as it sounds, which is why I originally went premed, but I won’t have to go to medical school)

And now that I’m taking mainly CS courses I am realizing that I kind of suck at CS compared to serious CS people. I got a C and a low B on the CS 2110 and 2800 prelims. I’m honestly not even sure if I’ll meet affiliation requirements unless I rlly grind this next month. It’s also been kind of hard trying to find an internship or research, bc all of my work experience is medical stuff. 

Should I still try to stick it through and take CS 3110 next semester, or should I quit and explore other majors before I invest too much time in CS? I just have no idea what other majors I would explore. And I already accepted a project team offer for a software sub team and got involved in other CS things on campus."

Internships? Rejected.
Grants? Rejected. 

I put hours into my applications for things and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m starting to get tired of working hard in school and other areas of my life when things keep turning out so shitty. It’s really hard when I’ve been at this school for over a year and everyone I know has at least found a place on campus but I just keep getting rejected. People are already talking about internships they have lined up for the spring or the summer and I really need the money from a spring internship or something, but I keep getting rejected from things. 

I’ve tried research assistantships but I get rejected from those too. After over a year at Harvard, I’m really fucking tired of the rejection and it genuinely feels like I was accepted as a big joke so that they could have someone that other students could compare themselves to when they were feeling down. 

I’ve tried CAMHS too and when they had me wait for over a month to be seen, that felt like another rejection. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sort of spiraling and I feel like I need something to go right, even something small so I can feel like life is worth living again and that I haven’t damned myself to 4 yrs of misery at Harvard, but I can’t find that thing. I tried to keep myself together freshman year but I don’t think I can hold on to those dregs of motivation and optimism much longer.

I used to teach a CS summer camp that was a week long and I taught 12-17 year olds how to code in C-ish C++ on Arduinos. In college I was often a tutor or helping out classmates.

Now, at my job, we aren't doing interns (thanks COVID) and my team dynamic isn't really one where I can actively mentor anyone.

I would like something more involved than the summer camp so I can really help someone grow. I think that the ideal thing for me would be helping someone start from square one and helping them pursue a general understanding of CS and programming. I kind of envision something like helping a kid who doesn't have a proper CS teacher to prepare for and pass the AP CS test (I am in the US). Something involved enough where we might have regular (video) meetings or assignments or code reviews.

Now, before I get spammed with a million ""mentorship requests"" (please don't, I'm not ready for that), the point of this post is that I am curious to know if there are already organizations like this in place where I can mentor remotely or if anyone has gone down a similar path to finding a mentee before?"

I want to study masters (international) after 2 years of working experience that is also why I am leaning more on the STEM program (for more scholarships).

Hi Everyone,

I have an offer from Charles Schwab for a Data Science internship and Citi Quantitative Summer Analysis internship. I already picked the Charles Schwab one because I didn't know if I would receive the Citi one and now Im second-guessing my choice.

I'm having a hard time deciding which one I should choose. The Citi internship is in NY and the Charles Schwab one is in Austin. This is my first internship.

I liked Charles Schwab's offer because I will be helping build a chatbox and working with NLP. But the Citi position will be using my programming skills and math skills to build prediction models. The Citi internship pays a lot more but it doesn't cover housing. The Charles Schwab one doesn't cover housing either but Austin is cheaper.

Any advice on what I should do? I really would like to know your opinion and I would really appreciate any advice you can give me."

In the last month I've only found 2 suitable ones. I'm only looking in and around a major city so I'm not sure if that's massively restricting me given the pandemic. Anyone got advice for finding jobs? Glassdoor and LinkedIn are barren right now. I did electronic engineering and looking to go into embedded software. I see people who have applied to like 20+ and I'm like how do you even find 1 a week?? There's so many garbage postings with very generic descriptions like ""graduate engineer"" or just too high a level of experience needed."

- To pursue Masters in Management (could be Engineering Management)
- To be able to find work, a role of Analyst or Consultant in probably Operations
- To settle in the EU in the longer-term (at least PR if not citizenship)

Background:
- Mechanical Engineer (Graduated in July'20)
- I am a failed engineer, credits to the Indian education system
- No full-time work experience as of yet but 7 months of cumulative experience via Internships (still working)
- Good in academics (first-class division) and equally into extra-curricular
- Not a hardcore IT person but enjoy using simple technology to my advantage

Target Location(s):
- Italy - Milan (PoliMi)
- Germany - Mannheim (Uni), Darmstadt (TU)

Reasons for my choices:
- The main reason would be costs, I will be able to support myself with living expenses and low tuition fees
- Another main reason would be that hardships in India aren't worth any more and I would like to move somewhere   decent
- I would like to travel to various countries and moving to the EU certainly helps with it
- It might sound stupid, but I am very passionate about cars and F1, a Tifosi for Scuderia Ferrari

Challenges:
- Being a non-EU, it would be difficult to find a job (even part-time I suppose)
- Learn the local language (either German or Italian) and be proficient in speaking and writing

So, that sums up my situation so far and accordingly, I look forward to information and advice on the following aspects to make a sound decision:

1. Work Visa, PR and Citizenship
2. Housing and Accommodation
3. Salaries and Wages
4. Attitude of Locals towards Foreigners (Racism?)

Happy to receive any information which could help me know more about these locations and helo my research to make an informed decision."

hey guys, 
i’m going into my fourth year for engineering but i go to school overseas. I attend Korea university for mechanical engineering but I am a US citizen and lived there my whole life. i only came to korea for college. (why i decided to come to korea for school is a whole nother story lol)

my question is.. will i be able to get a decent job back in the states with an engineering degree from a foreign country(south korea). do american companies hire students with a foreign degree as long as they are a US citizen?

i do have an internship at a us company under my belt and i also have one set up for next summer at a national lab. but both of these were very hard to get and i think i got really lucky. 

what are some good ways to secure a job back in the states after graduating from korea university??"
jnwb4t,350,2020-11-04,Getting frustrated with my coworker. Is there value in bringing up my concerns with my manager?,holamund0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jnwb4t/getting_frustrated_with_my_coworker_is_there/,"I've been at my current company for a little over 6 years, and this is the first time I'm this frustrated with someone on my team.

One of the senior engineers on my team left the company a couple of months ago. He was backfilled by another senior guy from the company. He seems to be uncalibrated in his communication (often coming off as rude), expects other people to do work for him, and has shit code quality.

Expects others to fix his code:

 - He frequently gets blocked trying to debug his code. Last week, he put up a pull request claiming it was code complete, but that the app didn't run. i.e. his PR broke the app. He then took off for vacations for a week. Ok, no problem. At a glance, I can't see why his PR would break the app, but I leave a bunch of comments about other things, surely he can pick up where he left off when he's back. Once he comes back from vacation he messages me ""hey were you able to fix my PR?"" We're under tight deadlines this quarter and he knows it. It bothers me that he took off for vacations leaving us with a broken PR and still comes back expecting me to have fixed his broken code when I have plenty on my plate already.

 - Another time, he was again stuck trying to figure out how his code broke our app. He asks me for help. No problem, I take a quick look and his branch is a complete dumpster. Impossible to track all the changes he's made. Two huge commits with no descriptive messaging. So I tell him I'll help take a closer look once I'm done with my work. Not more than 30min goes by, and he messages me ""Any luck? Did you fix it?"" I say I haven't had time to take a close look. Next morning, again, ""Hey, any luck with my branch?"" Meanwhile it doesn't feel he's using his time to debug himself. I feel like he's sitting on his ass waiting for me to fix his code (I could be wrong, but it's the impression I'm getting since he _rarely_ manages to fix his code without major intervention from someone else)

Code quality is trash:

 - Related to the examples above, every time I review his code it's a complete mess. Not just in formatting/styling, but in functionality. Making unnecessary changes, breaking stuff, etc. I've never had to write so many comments on a PR before. And I'm not one that likes to nit-pick PRs. I'm not kidding when I say that in the time I spend reviewing his code, writing comments, and getting him to understand, I could've easily written the whole thing from scratch. My impression is that his code is at an intern, or junior level. This guy has ""senior"" in his title.

 - Case in point for the above, one of the times I was reviewing his broken PR which he'd been stuck on for three days, I got fed up and simply re-implemented it to save us all precious time. It took me two hours. I'm by no means a super-star engineer, I consider myself a solid average developer.

Examples of uncalibrated communication - all minor stuff, but over time it adds up and starts getting annoying:

 - When he thinks someone is wrong or misunderstanding something, he'll say something like ""No, you can't be correct because of X"" rather than something like ""Are you sure this is right? Have you considered X?"" Mind you, he usually ends up being wrong. Once it's obvious he's wrong, rather than attempting to understand why he was wrong, he'll either ghost the conversation or just say ""ok""

 - When reviewing another dev's pull request, he was commenting on some minor formatting issues. Rather than saying something like ""Change formatting to X here to be consistent with our projects"" and ""Same formatting issue here"", he'll say things like ""Formatting is wrong! Change to X"" and ""Formatting here is wrong... again!""

 - I know someone else who's worked with him in the past, so I reached out to that person planning on asking them their opinion on this guy. As soon as I said ""Hey, you've worked with X right?"" their response was ""Yeah, he's kind of rude"". I hadn't even prompted them with my complaints yet, so that gives me some confidence to know I'm not being a crazy snowflake.

So my question is, how valuable is it to voice these concerns to my manager? Our team is very small, so if my manager does talk to him he'll surely know it was I who complained. Also, I don't see how he can fix things like his code quality. What good is telling someone to ""get better""? I'm just worried that complaining would not be very productive and might just create resentment, making things worse. At this same time, I'm bottling up a ton of frustration and it's affecting my work experience."
jnxroc,8,2020-11-04,How to become a better Javascript(React) developer?,benz0is,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/jnxroc/how_to_become_a_better_javascriptreact_developer/,"Hey everyone, hope you are doing well.

After learning for more than half a year(I know its not that much) I have seen significant growth which I am very proud of. I have learned all of the basics and beyond, made a lot of cool projects, watched a ton of youtube videos on JS and other related things, and so on. Yet when the time came to search for an internship(which I feel I deserve) I only get no's, which rip'ed my confidence. Obviously I know that I have a lot of things to patch up , but isn't that the point of an internship? I just honestly dont know what to learn , since nobody gives me feedback on what I should improve ,which always makes things more difficult. I feel that the only way I could improve drastically now is being in an internship, but I need more experience for it. So im asking you , what are some more advanced topics that I should learn that is related to JS/React ? Or anything that would increase my chances into landing my first ever internship"
jnxrvz,432,2020-11-04,"I ate an 8,000$ meal",Rabbitzman,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jnxrvz/i_ate_an_8000_meal/,"
Let me begin by saying this; if you see the title and think to yourself that I am an entitled little piece of shit, you are absolutely right. My father is one of those millionaires that just came to money long ago and now can't stop earning no matter what he does. He could literally set money on fire and his net worth would still go up. Back in the nineties, he started a company with one of his friends. My dad did a small investment and became a spokesperson for the service they were selling. As far as I can tell, the other guy did all the work while my dad did all the networking with champagne, cocaine and prostitutes. Right before things went sour, my dad sold out and left his friend with a massive dumpster fire of a debt.

His friend went homeless after he couldn't afford the bills for a medical operation he had to undergo. My dad just bought a vintage Rolls Royce which he will never use.

&amp;nbsp;

So I have some pocket money to spend. As long as I don’t go into the  five figures mark, my dad doesn't even ask, let alone notice. I like to spend his money as a way of getting back to him. I indulge in being the worst version of myself I can, and I justify it by telling myself this is just the example I got. 

It's probably not true. I'm most likely an asshole like my dad. Apple doesn't fall far, right?


***


A few days ago I was at a club downtown with a bunch of wannabe rappers I had met the night before. They were taking advantage of my money, and I didn't care as long as the girls and the drugs kept coming. I wasn't having a good time, but I was ticking all the right boxes for self-indulgence. I was hoping to get into trouble just so my dad would have to get involved, although a part of me knew that he would just pay a lawyer and be done with it. I don't remember most of the evening, or even the faces of those around me. My mind was cruising and I was, as I am keen to be, somewhere very, very far away. I can't even recall why the fight started, but I was suddenly in an alley with a bunch of nerdy-looking idiots. I remember throwing a punch that hit one guy's shoulder and feeling like I had broken a finger, and then waking up feeling like my whole body was burning up. My face was so swollen I could actually see my cheek. It was hard to breathe, hard to move, hard to think...

***

My dad left my mom right after selling out his shares in the company. It wasn't nice. He simply told her that most of their life together had been a mistake, including their five years old child, me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was there for that conversation.

&amp;nbsp;

He then hired the best lawyers and left my mom behind, as he had left behind his friend. Never looked back. She died a few years ago from a cancer that wasn’t caught in time. She was barely scraping by and I hadn’t seen her in months.


***

I don't know how long I was on the floor. I was trying to call for help, but I really felt like my life was ending. Then, someone took my hand. I tried to look up through blurry eyes, and I saw what looked like a woman. Perhaps beautiful, perhaps not. She squeezed my hands gently.
“I can help you,” she said. “But I need your permission.”

“Please,” I whispered.

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up in my bed without a single scratch on my body.

&amp;nbsp;

At first, I dismissed the whole thing as a weird drug-infused dream. Nothing to worry about. My dad was gone, probably on a business trip, so I just spent the next few days playing on the couch, phone off. My plan was to spend a week or so just hanging out and playing games. I didn’t have anything to do or anywhere to be. I knew that my dad would eventually come to me with a detailed action plan for me to study some shit or another, or do some internship somewhere.

Then our doorbell rang.

I was startled and very concerned. We lived in a highly gated community. Nobody can come by without a long chain of approvals and emails to the guardians and security people. People just didn't ring our doorbell.


***

My father kept insisting I was going to take on his companies. He had about seven of them now, all of them weird shell companies that produce nothing but money. When he dies or retires, it will take a very strong concentrated effort on my part to simply not be rich. Even if I just drink myself stupid to bed each day, I will stilll be making money, just like he is. I've studied nothing, have no skills, I'm a mess... It doesn't matter. As long as I sign the will when I get it and I listen to my assistants and nod when appropriate, I will be fucking loaded.

***

A deep sense of foreboding fell over me. My first thought was that it would be the police, asking about my father. I hadn't seen him in a week, and I didn't care, but a lot of people did. Since my phone had been off, I had a nagging feeling I was probably out of the loop on some important piece of news.

Instead, when I finally opened, I saw a woman I didn't recognize at first. Her face was the kind that is always really haard to place. She could be my age and look a bit older, or my dad’s age and look a bit younger. She seemed like someone you've always known, but never paid attention to.

""Hi,"" she said with a raspy voice, ""we met a few days ago. I have a business proposal for you.""

I let her in, without really knowing why. She moved to the couch like she knew the place, and before I could offer her anything to eat or drink she was talking. She told me about a friend of hers who had opened a special business in town, and was looking for new customers. It was, she told me, a catering service for the ultra-rich. They served you one meal, and one alone, based around your life, your memories and thoughts... It was supposed to be an experience, something that would be unique to you, and they promised full satisfaction.

She didn’t look at me once during her spiel.

I was concerned how much they knew about me, and she told me that she had spoken with me at length on the night we met. It dawned on me then that she was the woman who had helped me after my fight. I didn't remember speaking to her at all, but to be fair I had been on a lot of drugs and pain.

""I know your allergies, your fears and desires, your taste in food... We will give you a meal that you will remember for the rest of your life.""

""How much?"" I asked. It seemed like the right thing to do.

""Eight thousand,"" she said, without a second thought. Right below the five-figure mark that would call my dad's attention. I accepted on the spot.

&amp;nbsp;

For the rest of the week, I got some emails with some preparations I needed to do. I appreciated the dramatic flair, but found the whole thing to be wrapped in too many theatricals. I liked the idea and concept, but the mystery was exhausting, and more cringey than exciting. Looking at their webpage, there was all sort of edgy paraphernalia about spiritualism, new age crap and self-empowerment bullshit. I was good at recognizing that sort of shit now, after being fed tons of it by my dad and his associates. I was supposed to do meditation daily to improve the flavour, as well as eat a certain type of food. I ignored the fuck out of it and ordered takeout every single day.

On the day of my appointment, I drove downtown and arrived at the address I had been given. To my lukewarm surprise, it turned out to be the alley where I had been beaten. Bang in the middle of it, there was a small table with a simple, nondescript chair. Covering the table was a mantlepiece with pictures of fish, and the whole thing gave out a very seedy vibe.

I sat down feeling anxious. There was no one there, but I knew I was being watched. I could see several cameras trained on me, and I had a tingling sensation in the back of my neck. Before I had settled in, a door opened in front of me and a young woman, early twenties came out. I realized that the theatrics were back. They had picked a woman they knew I would be attracted to; big eyes, ample body, full lips. She was dressed for the part too. She was wearing a plaid skirt with a checkered black and white pattern, that ended right before her knee high socks. She was also wearing a white shirt opened enough to accentuate her bosom with a black tie that hid nothing and drew more attention to it. Two black ribbons on her hair, stylized in two pigtails, completed the full punk schoolgirl black and white package.

""Is this a joke?"" I asked her. She was the first person I had seen, and I was kind of waiting for, if not an explanation, at least some kind of human interaction.

""Fuck you"" she said. She moved closer, and left a glass, a jar of water, a fork and knife on the table. She leaned over while doing it, just enough that I could see her cleavage and get a glimpse of her black bra. I could notice that this was very much intentional.

""Hey, is this a sex thing?"" I asked.

""Fuck you,"" she insisted.

""No, look… I mean it. I have no idea why I’m here, to be honest. Is this a sex thing?"" I said. At this point I was fine with either answer, but I was honestly curious. I hadn't expected this to be some kind of high class escort service, but I might have been into it, if I had gotten a proper explanation. I needed to know what the hell this was, at least.

She looked deep into my eyes. I saw her hate, red hot and intense. She despised me.

""Fuck you,"" she said. I swallowed. This was not a joke I could get behind, and I was starting to feel ill.

""Hey, listen to me,"" I tried to say, ""If you are here against your will let me know and I will do what I can to help. I...”

The door opened before I could finish. A second woman, dressed exactly like the first and also hand picked to pique my interest, walked out with a massive cloche. It looked cartoony really, I had never seen one of those covered plates outside of cheesy movies or drawings. I have no idea where you would even buy one of them. She set it in front of me and opened it. There was a lump of nondescript meat on it, almost charred. It was as big as a ham, but it had no bone. Perhaps it was loin, or something similar. I had no idea. There was no garnish, there was no sauce.

""Is that it?"" I asked, slightly disappointed. It looked horrible.

""Fuck you,"" said the second woman. The first one just smiled.

I didn’t know what was expected from me, but I took my fork and knife and cut a bit of the meat, on the side where it looked less charred. This was looking more and more like a scam, and I was fine with that. Not my money after all.


***

My dad once invested over 10M$ in a pyramid scheme. I knew it was a pyramid scheme the moment I heard about it, and I'm pretty sure he knew it too. He then got a shit load of money out of it. I heard him brag.

Then, as the scheme was exposed and crumbled, he cried on public TV about how he had been scammed and lied too. He claimed to have lost money. He went on to use part of the money he had won to create a lobby that would fight against regulations towards schemes. His Wikipedia page uses the word ""philanthropist"".

***

As I bit into the piece of meat, I felt myself losing a bit of momentum. The thing tasted terrible. It was oversalted, and it had been thrown into the barbecue without any kind of seasoning or sauce. It was dry and hard to swallow. The two women were looking at me like I was some kind of monster. I took a sip of water to help the piece down.

""Is this it?"" I asked. The two women shrugged but didn’t answer. I took another piece. After all, there was nothing much I could do. I moved the whole piece to my plate so I could handle it better. The meat in my mouth felt like rubber and my teeth were complaining. I ground it as much as I could, and forced myself to swallow. I could feel the sensation of it moving down my chest and dropping into my stomach like a ball of lead. I was two bites in, and I was already exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then I took another piece. Then another.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I knew it I had let go of the fork and knife, and I was holding the piece with my hands. It wasn’t getting better, but the more I ate, the less I felt in control of my body. Every time I smelled it or savored it I felt like puking and still my mouth moved into it, sinking my teeth and trying to rip it apart. I felt heavy and could feel sweat pouring from my body. At one point I heaved without control, and I saw one of the girls, I don’t know which, was ready with a pail. I leaned over and a string of vomit came out of me, uncontrollably. She caught most of it, but I saw some falling on her boots. She twisted her face in disgust and said something I couldn't understand. They looked at each other, and she suddenly moved her leg. It was a fluid and aggressive movement; one moment she was standing on her own two feet, the next she had her full leg on the table, her calf crushing my plate. Her boot, bile and all,  was so close to my face I could smell it.

""Clean it, you fuckhead,"" I heard her say.

It was at that moment that I realized I was not in control of my actions anymore. Wether the food had been spiked, or wether there was something different at play, I wasn’t the one who was moving my body along. I felt like a passenger as I leaned forward and stuck my tongue out. Her boots were leather, the good kind of leather, and as my tongue fell on it I almost felt relief from the terrible disgusting meat I had been eating. Then it moved over the bile, and I could feel the acidic, pungent smell of it as my brain was trying to shut out the taste. I was crying now, and as I licked the boot clean, I could also feel the taste of my tears and my own boogers. 

When she felt that the boot was clean enough she finally took the leg out of the table. I drank some water, and watched with a horrified sensation of fear as the second woman brought a second plate, with a different piece of meat. This one did have a bone, so I took it and bit into it with a strength I didn’t have. I gnawed at it with abandon and an animalistic fury. As my stomach filled, the bile returned. I puked halfway through it this time, and a third time once I had finished it. What little control I had over my muscles I spent trying to get all the vomit on the pails. Before I could drink, there was another plate in front of me.

This kept going on for a very long time. I drank, I puked, I ate, they put more meat in front of me. From time to time, something would shake things up. One of the women would make me puke by putting their fingers into my throat, I would stop to breathe and they would stuff the meat into my face, I would collapse from the chair and they would prop me up…

I don’t know how long it took. The pieces would keep coming and I soon lost count, but I never felt less hungry. If anything, each bite made me become more famished, like there was something that was missing inside of me, and only the terrible charred hard meat could fill that void. On one occasion, I saw my puke was mostly blood but the hunger and frenzy never ended. If my body failed the two women would force feed me, until a sudden unexpected surge of energy would once again make me dive into the meat. I was mostly using my teeth now, not even my hands. I saw once that one of my teeth got caught on a nerve, and as I pulled my head it stood there. I didn’t stop, and in fact, I swallowed the teeth whole.

If I tried to move any part of my body, there was a deep sensation of being out of it. My arms lay limp at my sides, my legs were useless, but my neck and mouth were moving on their own. I had deep gashes on the roof of my mouth and on my lips from broken bones. This didn’t stop me from eating. If anything, my blood just made the meat more tender. The taste was mostly the same.

I wish I would have passed out, I wish I could have died, but I just sat there, filling and emptying my body over and over again, past the point of natural exhaustion. I remember now every single second of it, and it feels like days went by. 

After eating one piece which, I swear, was shaped as a human foot, nails and all, I sat limp and helpless, and looked at the two women. This time, however, they didn't move. There was no new plate. They were waiting for something. I tried speaking, but I don't think my voice worked anymore.

""Fuck you,"" said one of them.

After what felt like an eternity, the woman that had been at my home came out from the doorway from where the meat had been served. She made a move with her head and the waiters left. It was just me and her now.

""Did you enjoy your special meal?"" she asked. I tried to think of something witty, something clever, but my body wasn't working and my mind was somewhere else, very, very far away.

I made a raspy, unintelligible sound that felt like a ""No"".

""Good,"" she said.

I woke up in my bed, feeling refreshed and full of energy. I felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders, and for the first time in ages, I felt relaxed.

My father once spent a little fortune to eat the last member of an endangered species of feline from the Amazonian forest. It was a sort of sick bidding war for him and some of his rich friends. He said afterwards that it was ""too game-y"" and he hadn't enjoyed it at all. He justified it by saying that the species was already extinct, since there was only one left, and it couldn't produce offspring, so it wasn't morally wrong to it. I haven't heard a word from him in a few weeks, and neither has anyone else according to [the emails I’ve been getting](https://twitter.com/Rabbitz)."
jnyiw4,5,2020-11-04,New Graduate looks for advice if I should move on to another company.,EngineerNoah,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jnyiw4/new_graduate_looks_for_advice_if_i_should_move_on/,"Hi, I graduated this spring with a Mechanical Engineering Degree from a reputable university with a decent GPA. I have 16 months of previous experience in a process engineering role I did for my internship. After graduation, I sat around for about 6 months unable to find work until I was lucky to get a role as a “Junior Engineer” at a Nuclear company where I was essentially given the task of a copy typist (I am creating a database of drawings based on 100000+ handwritten part numbers, not very stimulating work). I fought for the ability to do some engineering work and was able to work on two projects I enjoyed, under the supervision of a very knowledgeable Engineering Manager who has expressed a desire to mentor/help me. 

My goal is to attain my PEng and work as an engineer in the aerospace or automotive fields (not a sales engineer and not a project manager/coordinator, at least for 10-15 years). I am also debating on doing a Masters degree in aerospace (but I understand that I would probably have to move from Canada to find work in this field). In order to become a competent Engineer I believe I need to work in an engineering role that gives me work that will improve my engineering skills. Wearing many hats is not something I particularly enjoy and I don’t think it will help me develop my engineering skills but may help my soft skills.

The company originally hired me for a 3 month contract (which expires on Tuesday) which I happily jumped at initially because Engineering roles (especially ones for EITs) are few and far between due to covid in my area. The company has offered me a full time role change of having some Engineering work, still working on the database and project coordinator of part of their business because a non-engineer at the company is struggling with the workload. This will be at a reduced net income as they originally were paying me $26/hr for a 40hr week but told me to work 37.5 hours. Now this new role they will correct this error in pay and continue the same hourly rate but pay me for 37.5 hours. This is non-negotiable. My current manager and the manager of this new role could not guarantee what percentage of time I will have to work on Engineering specific projects, because the company has extreme highs and lows of busyness and “everyone wears many hats”. 

I spoke with the Engineering manager and he explained that I will be working under him in this new role and he will give me engineering projects here and there and give me opportunities to develop my skills. However, I will still need to do this other role of sending PO’s, sending conformance documents etc... as a project coordinator. I could see if I stay here for a few years I will get experience in robotics, ASME codes and design, but as of three months in I don’t see myself being here for more than a year as I don’t want to be pigeon holed in the nuclear industry.

This role is close to my parents house so I have a short commute time and have very little expenses so I have saved a decent chunk of money. If I accept this role I don’t foresee me staying for more than a year (this may change as I’ve only been here 3 months and that may be not enough time to make a decision like this), so I can save a lot and have a short commute time but I don’t think I’ll get sufficient engineering experience. If I leave this opportunity I think I will be unemployed until at least the early summer of 2021 if not longer.

Should I take the role and wait until covid is over and more roles become available or decline the offer and work on developing my skills at home with projects and learning new skills and wait for more job opportunities to present themselves.

TLDR: Company that hired me for a contract position offered me a full time position with more tasks for less money. Most tasks are non-engineering related but if I stay for 6 months -1 year+ I will slowly be given more and more engineering specific work. I want to be a competent engineer and obtain my Peng and work in aerospace or automotive and don’t want to be pigeon holed into nuclear."

I'm 17 years old now and I live in a Chinese household. I'm also a competitive international figure skater and a pretty good student (or so I think). Last year in March, I started dating a boy in secret and he's also an extremely accomplished figure skater (team USA, national medalist, etc) not to mention he's also Chinese which should be a bonus point. As time went on, our relationship got stronger and stronger even though we barely saw each other and mostly talked over text, but we knew we were meant for each other although this is probably something everyone says. By the time it was August, I couldn't keep it a secret anymore since we trained at the same rink with the same coach and my mom completely flipped out. She wouldn't hear anything about it, and things got so bad to the point where we were scared to even look at each other in the rink or sit close together. We would text in secret and sometimes meet up in secret when we could until we got caught hugging outside of the rink one day by my mom. She had been threatening to end my skating career if I continued talking to him and by some miracle, she didn't end my skating career that day, however things only got worse for us when she told my dad about the situation and they almost filed a restraining order in January (10 months after we started dating).

At this point, things had escalated so much and my mom had never even spoken to him, so I convinced her to sit down and have a talk with him and I think that helped her a lot because around April of 2020, she let us start texting, calling, and sometimes seeing each other outside the rink. This went well for a while because it was better than nothing, however I still had to go to extraordinary lengths to earn the right to go out and see him, but of course, things went downhill again when she said that I had to tell my dad about this. At first, he was okay with us talking but definitely not happy at all, but he agreed to let us go out in a group of 4, but the second time, he completely flipped out for no good reason.

At this point, we're not allowed to go out alone, and I'm terrified of bringing up the topic of him to my dad and I'm not sure where my mom stands with my relationship. All I know is that she doesn't want me dating right now (although she's much better about him than my dad) but even if I get into a good college and move away, I'm not sure if they will ever approve.

He is an engineering student at UD, and that's also a huge ""issue"" for them. They have this ridiculous stereotype that people who don't go to good schools can't have good jobs or high paying salaries and they are not driven and will work as delivery drivers forever instead of getting an internship. He's spent his 4 years of high school training 5+ hours a day to be such a good skater, and of course, that has taken away time from preparing for college. I know he's smart, although I'm biased, but someone who gets a 1520 on his SAT without studying on his first try definitely isn't stupid. This is probably one of his last years of skating competitively and he does plan to get an internship in the summer but somehow my parents can't get past the fact that he doesn't go to an Ivy League on top of all the other unknown reasons why they disapprove. I admit that hiding my relationship really ruined their trust of both of us and their first image of him, but we have been open and honest about everything ever since he talked to my mom.

It also doesn't help that I live in North Carolina, but I train in Delaware, where he lives, so my parents can threaten to take me back home anytime they want. I'm applying to colleges this fall and my top choice is UPenn. I have a good shot at getting into some Ivy Leagues or Johns Hopkins which is another one of my dream schools. It's been more than a year and a half now and he's waited through all of this, and you'd think that would show them something, but all they see is their standards and not our actual relationship. I just don't know if they'll ever approve of us even if I get into a good school and I have no idea what to do. Any advice would be so appreciated. This was my last resort for help :("

jnzqoz,9,2020-11-04,AWS Cloud Support Associate,DiAurix,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jnzqoz/aws_cloud_support_associate/,"Hello!

I received an offer for the CSA (student program/ entry) role in Seattle and while I'm excited about the opportunity, I have some lingering questions before I jump on it:

1. For relocation assistance, how did the process work? I live on the east coast and was wondering what steps you took to move everything.
2. How stressful is it that performance is based on customer-ratings? Is there a quota everyday of how many tickets one needs to resolve?
3. For those that have gone through the student program, what does the first 3 months look like?
4. What type of challenges occurred?
5. Does support need a strong background in coding?
6. Can you focus on a specific field/niche? Such as dealing mainly with databases or helping the client build their infrastructure?
7. How challenging was it for you to become familiar with AWS services? One of my biggest fear is not being able to catch up and absorb information about each service as thoroughly.
8. What are some advice you can give for new CSA hires?

I had this previously posted on r/aws but didn't get any response so I'm hoping to try my luck here.

Thank you for taking the time to read and answer!

UPDATE:

I turned down the AWS offer for another company that's local to me and have better opportunities for career growth. Anyways, I've received a lot of inquiries in regard to how the AWS interview process went, because I signed an NDA, I'm not comfortable discussing about it in full length.

Here is my advice:

Technical:

* Talk about your projects whether it was academic or professional. Use the STAR method to guide your narrative.
* **Always speak your thoughts**, it doesn't matter if you think it's wrong. They want to know what your thought process is and how you came to it.

Behavioral:

* For each of the Leadership Principles, have at least 2 examples for each one. You can use any type of past experience whether internship or retail job.

Best of luck!"

We are a small consulting startup with about 13-15 people and 4 devs ( 2 which are seniors / managers ). Every year we have a huge turnover of people leaving and finding better jobs which this year has not made things any better. We have lost 5 people since the beginning of march with 2 quitting over the last weekend.   
Anyways, I've been with the company for about 1 year, 6 months and I have seen this turnover happen already twice. People quit and then we hire more people and get them caught up, rinse &amp; repeat.   


I started off at a web dev. intern then was brought in full time working on mainly front end wordpress custom themes. This was for about 6-7 months and then one of our devs quit so they came  to me and said ""Hey we think its time for you to slowly stop being a junior dev and take on more complex tickets as well as coming on board and working on our SaaS solution"" It's built on C# / [Asp.net](https://Asp.net) Framework. This was on August.  


Obviously I was extremely excited to take on more responsibilities as well as learning a new language ( C# ) and being a junior, I knew I had much to learn still especially off hours which is what I've been doing. Even though I take on more responsibility, did they give me a raise? No, they managed to convince me that I should just wait for the end of year review for my raise. um okay, I'll just keep using this opportunity to keep learning on the job as well as off as much as I could to become a better dev.  


As the end of the year comes close, I'm honestly thinking of just straight up asking for a raise from 49k to 65k or even 70k. People are going to keep leaving but since I love what I do as well as my coworkers and they know I am a good worker, do you guys think I should ask for this big pay bump even though it might be unusual for someone to get more than 10% raise?  


Any advice please let me know, I figured I have really nothing to lose and if they reject my offer or give me a raise that I am not happy with, I'll just leave."

Don’t give up guys!!! You can do it!!!

I am graduating summer 2021 and I started applying for new grad software engineer positions 2-3 months ago. The coding challenges sent to me are somewhat abstract, very difficult, and most of them required me to finish in a short amount of time (e.g. 3-4 questions in 70 mins). Even though I think I did well on some of them, the bar was so high for me to get an actual interview. For example, a CodeSignal assessment with 850 possible score and I got 780 and it's too low to receive a call back. Or I got rejected after failing hidden test cases. I have internship experience in a pretty good tech company but it is still extremely hard to get my foot in the door for new grad positions.

I have been doing leetcode every week but it's just so draining. Even I've done interesting projects and apps that I am very passionate about, no one wants to talk about them if my OA scores are not high enough.

How do you prepare for your OA? What do you think it's the most important thing that helped you secure a full time position? Or just any advice on getting a new grad offer in general. Thank you."

jo6eyy,7,2020-11-04,How crucial are internships?,RunUpCommas,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jo6eyy/how_crucial_are_internships/,"I've been seeing a lot of posts about undergrad internships lately, which makes sense since it's that time of year again. I, like many others have been struggling to find a proper engineering internship; the only paid experience I have right now is a research position that doesn't really pertain to my major (mech E). My GPA is fine, I have project experience, and I've got an interview this Friday, so I haven't given up yet lol.

But I've always seen internships as a very very necessary thing to be able to get a job after college. I'm not planning on pursuing my master's, so after I graduate, I  REALLY need a job.

How much will I kill my chances of getting employed if I don't have any internship experience under my belt by that time? I'm a junior right now and it's starting to look more and more likely that that'll be the case."

I’m sorry to make a post like this but I’m beginning to feel desperate. I’m having an extremely difficult time trying to land a role in finance.

I graduated from Ohio State in 2016 with a corporate finance degree. I had trouble finding an internship when I was in school so I regrettably never obtained one.

Upon graduation, due to depression and an extreme case of imposter syndrome, I just went back home to work at my fathers company.
Until last year I had just been working there in an insignificant role. Basically I just did gopher work around the office. 

Life happened and I became fired up and eager to go out on my own and start a career in finance. For 6 months I applied to any and every job I could. I applied to countless jobs. I received a small number of interviews and 0 offers.

At some point I decided to just become a bank teller so I could at least be internal at a bank. So that’s what I’ve been doing for the last year. 

My superiors all have confidence that I’ll grow within the bank but after a year I’m starting to question how likely that actually is and I’m growing tired of waiting. 

I’ve continued to apply to credit analyst positions, rotational development programs, etc. but I’m not receiving any calls for interviews.

I realize the combination of no experience and 4 year old degree isn’t very attractive but I refuse to believe I’m helpless.

I’ve been considering working to obtain a certification such as the CFA or CPA but I know what would take a lot of time and I need a better job as soon as possible.

What can I be doing to help my chances now? In the few interviews I’ve done, I’ve been told I’m good at communicating and my resume is good. I’m truly baffled as to why I can’t even score interviews. It’s becoming a struggle for me and I’m open to any advice and constructive criticism."

The context: I'm a recent graduate (software engineering degree), my latest internship (6 months duration) was at a big tech company. C++  was the main language I used during that period, I love this language and its ecosystem so I would like to continue my career using it. Unfortunately, the place where I'm from has rare C++ opportunities and I'm not that proficient with Web Dev.

Pros and cons of the offer,

Pros :

* The company has a C++ team not recruiting for the moment but maybe I can ask for a transfer to later on.

Cons:

* The language I will be using mainly is developed internally so learning it won't help me elsewhere

So what are your thoughts should I wait more (I was applying for more than two months now mainly abroad), or go with this offer?"

I've been sitting on some work-related stories for a while, debating if it would be a good idea to post them, but after some thought, I've decided to go through with it. Maybe you can offer some insight along the way, or find some enjoyment from them. Any spelling/grammar errors are mine, made in what was likely a sleep-deprived rush of typing and spacing out.

I'll introduce myself first. My name's Marie, and I'm a floating keeper at a zoo. I move between areas and help keepers work with and care for the many species kept on site, and I’ve been here for about 3 years. Some days, I shovel poop for 8 hours. Others.... well, let's just say the interview questions I got weren't run-of-the-mill, and neither is the job itself. I’ll tell you how I got this position in the first place, because I think it helps explain my own disposition in this set of events going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

In my defense, I'd just graduated college, and was becoming fairly desperate for a job. After rejection after no-call after rejection, I found this place. Good sized zoo with a few impressive exhibits, a little out of the way location-wise, but who was I to complain? They'd called me back.

The first few questions were normal. ‘What’s your experience with different species’, degree, volunteer work, etc. 

The interviewer was a middle-aged man, dark hair that was going gray at the sides, and smile lines. He introduced himself as Aticus, which I didn’t think was a name that existed out of books I had to read in high school. He had a firm handshake, callused fingers showing years of hard work. He sat straight-spined, asking questions and throwing in some light banter on shared experience.

And then we got to part 2 of the interview.

At this point, as he flipped a sheet over on his clipboard, the smile that Aticus had maintained throughout fell slightly. “Alright, we’ll move on to the more…. unorthodox portion of this interview.”

I’d thought this would mean some hands-on tests. I was not correct.

“Do you have any experience with or knowledge of unnatural or deformed species and individuals?”

It took me a few seconds to reply, but the bullshitting that got me through college english prevailed. “I’ve volunteered at shelters with injured and inbred animals, if that’s what you’re talking about.”

He smiled. “That’s good, but not really what I meant. We have a few inhabitants that aren’t on display who maintain a certain…. Contractual agreement, you might say. We provide them with care behind the scenes, and don’t discuss them with guests and other non-zoo folk. Do you have any experience with that?”

“Uhhh…” I was not prepared. “I took a course in cryptozoology my sophomore year, and I’m pretty good at following rules and contracts and the like.”

“And how do you do with blood, viscera, and the like?”

I’d worked with large cats and seen a few births at local cattle farms, so this wasn’t as strange a question.

“I’ve asked about your general response to stressful or fast-paced work environments, but what  is your general fear response?”

Ok, so this one I didn’t have any idea. I bullshitted something about quietly holding in reactions, and not making sudden movements, things I knew that kept people safe in wild animal attacks and encounters. I’d done an internship with some pretty large carnivores, and having something like that roaring at your face tends to elicit some instinctual fear, experienced or not.

He seemed to like something about my answers, because three days later Aticus called and offered me a floater job. The first day was general beginner things: learning my way around, getting my badge and a set of keys, and filling out a bunch of paperwork that I didn’t pay much attention to. The place seemed clean and well managed, the keepers seemed nice, and overall I was excited at the prospect of an actual job in my field.

Then, Aticus led me to the boiler room. 

We’d been discussing something, some nuance of food prep or specifics of animal handling, when we hit the bottom of the stairs and the dim electric lighting registered. As I looked around, Aticus walked to the darkest part of the space, gesturing me forward before stopping me with an arm. He looked conflicted, but said “Look into the corner for me, please.”

I’m not sure how to describe what I saw there to you all. Some days, in that time between sleep and waking, I can see it, just barely. The shadows swirling at the blackest point of the corner showed me things that I shudder to recall. Heads, faces changing from emotion to emotion, growing tusks and fur and eyes, losing shape and color. They all connected together from what you could have called necks if they didn’t twist and bend like a rope, squeezing in and convulsing with every sickening breath it took. They took? Scientific description escaped me in that moment as my mind seemed to fold in on itself, a buzzing noise permeating the room and crescendoing like a descending hive of bees. I couldn’t tell if the sound was coming from my mind or the entity itself, but the multitude of mouths opened before me, showing rows and rows of broken and jagged teeth. They spiralled into the darkness of the throats beyond like a lamprey, and I could almost feel them scraping against my skull. Ichor dripped and pooled until it drowned my mind in black. Aticus later told me that I fell to the ground, shuddering and moaning like someone possessed.

He also said this was one of the better reactions.

I woke up about an hour later, past when my shift would have ended, back in the room where my interview had taken place. I had a wicked headache, and the flashing images behind my eyelids made the dizziness worse. Aticus was sitting in the chair opposite of me, examining a small skull encased in glass.

I asked him what happened, and he told me that it was Bekhurst. According to the original builders of the zoo and surrounding facilities, it had moved in around the time that the first animals were being brought in and housed. They had initially tried to conduct experiments and do research on its presence, but the madness and wild imagery that followed their attempts seemed to discourage it. There was an apparent agreement that it was some sort of fallen being of power, originating from the nearby forest. Its changing features suggest that it either consumed of or manipulated animals in particular, hence its binding to the zoo originally. Any attempts for removal had resulted in disease and madness falling upon the different species. A keeper had been trampled a few years beforehand by the zebras, and the lions had mauled a janitor after escaping their enclosure, despite the locks remaining in place. Aticus and a few other members of management had been sent down at that point to attempt to reason with the entity, and an agreement was made.

“We’ve been looking for someone who could not only help the other keepers keep up on their day-to-day duties, but also maintain our more…. unusual inhabitants. Most of them are fairly benign, don’t require cleaning, only feeding and a general eye kept on them. Our agreement with Bekhurt is that our animals remain healthy and safe, as long as the creatures it has attracted here are allowed refuge.”

I was silent for a bit. I mean, how do you even process that? I was weird, sure (Cryptozoology was an elective course, but I would have taken the major if it had been available…. or real), but what does a person do when confronted with the things that stay in the dark? How do you reconcile the world you’ve known with the one that gets shoved onto your plate?

I looked at him, one eye still winced against the headache. 

“Can I get a raise and an ice pack?”

&amp;#x200B;

And that’s basically it. I got the raise (above minimum, baby, we’re rolling in it!), and a packet of extra duties to be done on my shifts. Overall, I’ve gotten pretty used to it. Sure the snake in the back of the reptile room keeps trying to pull my deepest fears from my psyche, and the bathroom on the third floor keeps spawning new Cavor worms, but the pay is good and the guests aren’t too rude. It’s been about 3 years since then, and I’ve settled in, gotten used to my daily schedule, and actually become a rather integral part of the zoo system.

I haven’t seen Bekhurst again. Every so often it visits my dreams, I think. It lets me know if something is wrong, or a new creature needs a place to stay. I’ve asked the other keepers if they’ve had similar experiences, but they don’t seem to want to discuss the other entities that reside at the zoo. It makes sense, they tend to avoid the public areas, and the keepers assigned to specific species rarely venture into the darker areas of the facility. It’s my job now.

If you’ve made it this far, you can see why I’ve been tempted to throw something on here. I’ve done journaling and such, but there’s nothing quite like some real humanoid conversation. There are the normal (‘normal’) duties that take place throughout my day, and the more…. Interesting occurrences that have been happening lately.

See, there seems to be something stirring. Something in the woods at the edge of the property, where the entities are running from. 

And I don’t think it's far behind.

joag8f,10,2020-11-04,Should I transfer out of a top CS school?,ShouldITransfer_1,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/joag8f/should_i_transfer_out_of_a_top_cs_school/,"I currently am a sophomore at a top 5 CS school.

I have hated my school passionately since the middle of my first semester here, and now I've lost almost all hope that I will grow to enjoy it.

I am and have been doing well academically, and I feel that CS, math, and related disciplines are almost certainly my calling. However, I just can't bear the lifestyle I have here. I'm friends with almost none of my classmates, I have no relationships with any professors (which essentially bars me from having any meaningful recommendations on transfer applications), and I'm not involved with any organizations at all. I (and my family that finances my education) believe that I am most likely wasting my time stressing out about grades and internships.

I feel guilty about wanting to leave because I know there are probably countless people that would kill to get a spot where I am now, but I'm so miserable and it feels like I'm wasting my youth hunched over at the computer when I should be acting as college kids normally do before I enter the ""real world"". I could stick it out for the next few semesters betting on getting a good job after graduation, but the thought of graduating without having had any fun or having made a single connection at this place makes me sick. On the other hand, if I left and did enjoy myself somewhere else, I could potentially end up regretting that I gave up the career prospects that my current school offers.

I've been considering sending out applications to transfer to mid- to upper-tier schools, where classes won't be as demanding and there will be fair shares of both relaxed people that I could vibe with socially, and smart people that have career aspirations. Also it would give me some peace of mind to go to a cheaper school. 

What I wanted to get out of this post were some opinions on how a transfer from where I go now would appear to employers or grad schools, especially considering that I currently have a good GPA. Also, if any of you have faced a similar situation, how did it play out for you?

TL;DR - Hate my current school, want out. Could transferring poorly affect me permanently?"
jobyy1,1,2020-11-04,Should I rush/pick up the pace to my desired career?,Zen-Paladin,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jobyy1/should_i_rushpick_up_the_pace_to_my_desired_career/,"Hey there everyone. Some background on me. I'm 20, live in California, my desired career is to be a fish and game warden. The minimum requirement is an associates degree but due to the competitive nature I know it's best to get a bachelor's. I did community college right out of high school for a year but didn't do well. Like, basically would eventually drop all the classes. This was due to not really having a plan for how to go about things(should have seen a counselor) or understanding credits, major requirements and general education purposes. I did eventually look into EMT training both as a job for the rest of college and solid first responder experience.


I did the first half with another community college last year, started with another earlier this year but then COVID hit, classes moved online and procrastination set in. I did a 10 week program with CalRegional and am now waiting till I can be approved for the NREMT. I plan on doing classes again the coming Spring 2021 as an environmental science major and have spoken with a counselor to lay things out. When you apply to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the hiring process(fitness test, background check, etc) takes around two years, so if I hopefully line things up I can have finished my bachelor's before going to the academy if I'm accepted. The academy for game wardens starts in January and ends in August.


However I'm caught between two options: A) either I finish it in 3 years by doing a couple of summer sessions and go to the 2024 academy or B) do it in 4 years with no summer sessions and go to the 2025 academy.


If I did A, it would look like this: Spring 2021-&gt;Summer 2021-&gt;Fall 2021-&gt;Spring 2022(associates for transfer finished, apply to fish and wildlife department), break during Summer 2022, go to university to finish Fall 2022-&gt;Spring 2023-&gt;Summer 2023-&gt;Fall 2023(go to 2024 academy)


If I did B, it would look like this: Spring 2021-&gt;Fall 2021-&gt;Spring 2022-&gt;Fall 2022(associates for transfer finished), Spring 2023(apply to start hiring process)-&gt;Fall 2023-&gt;Spring 2024-&gt;Fall 2024(go to 2025 academy)




24 honestly sounded like a good age to finally start my main career, but then there is seeing about some volunteering or internship to boost my chances and get my foot in the door. I'm not sure what volunteering or whatever that Fish and Wildlife might have during the pandemic though, as I know some areas are closed off as part of precaution measures. Since game wardens have search and rescue duties and operate among hunters, boaters, and hikers(drowning, maulings, shootings, etc) the EMT experience would definitely look good but I know I should try to ''get my foot in the door'' which would be easier with Option B since I could do it in the summers.


Like with option A I would have summer of 2022 where maybe I could do something. There is the consideration of a social life. Not a party animal or really extroverted but I do know you need a break sometimes and relax and enjoy your 20s, plus I didn't grow up exposed to the outdoors much so definitely want to explore it more. Option B would also be easier in that regard but might not be impossible with Option A. There is also considering working as an EMT while in college which is not uncommon but do want to keep an eye on with summer classes and can depend on what shifts you get(12hr, 24hr, 48hr). I'm not to sure on either. Money isn't an issue, as I have high functioning autism so I get sponsorship through vocational rehabilitation.

I just was curious if anyone had any recommendations for resources to learn how to utilize the Geopandas library and some of the other spatial analysis modules in Python 3.x. I've been doing most of my analysis with Python 2.7 &amp; ArcPy over the past year, but come Spring, I'll no longer have an ESRI license. I'm fairly familiar with the QGIS/GRASS applications, doing analysis manually, but I was hoping to learn more about the Python augmented side of things of the open-source options in-case I end up doing contract work over the next year (as there's no way I can afford an enterprise-level Arc license at $4000/$14,000). I'm open to any format, and wouldn't mind buying a few books on the topic. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, I am planning on buying a private Arc license for 2021, to grow my portfolio &amp; get more practice. Hopefully I'll be able to find an internship or more permanent position, apparently my 5 years of experience are irrelevant to most employers because I don't hold a B.S. but rather a B.A. in Anthropology &amp; Geography, but c'est la vie.

I’m a college student majoring in computer science and nearing graduation. Now I chose CS because I’ve always just had an obsession with technology. It’s always been interesting to me seeing new things come out every day and just wondering how these things are physically possible. I love computers. I’ve always been drawn to them for some reason. Maybe because I like video games who knows. All I knew since I was a kid was that tech was the space I wanted to be in. 

I started coding around like middle school and I enjoyed it. But whenever I’d start to learn about the inner workings and real technical side I’d start to zone out and lose interest which is a huge problem especially now when I’m doing it at a college level and all of my classes are basically just the technical stuff. 

I noticed this lack of interest stemmed from a problem with my adhd. I love learning new things that interest me but only at like a surface level. I feel like a jack of all trades but master of none.

And it’s not just limited to academics it even effects my hobbies. I like editing videos for fun but I can’t be bothered to learn all the advanced techniques and all that jazz. I’ve tried my hand at photoshop and music production, both of which I enjoy and have fun with but have no further interest in advancing in. I love electronics and electrical engineering but drop it as soon as I have to go learn about electricity to make whatever I’m trying to build. I REALLY want to learn to invest in stocks and I’ve learned the basics about how it works but lose all interest when it comes to the actual parts that matter. 

I just don’t know if I’ll be able to hold on long enough to get through college. I find myself bored during lectures and my brains refuses to follow along unless I have to study for an exam. I want to get an internship but I keep forgetting to research and apply. I feel like my courses should be simple enough to follow if my classmates aren’t complaining but my brain just turns foggy. As much as I want to be in this field, I feel like I’m not capable of making it solely because of this mental block that refuses me from getting into the nitty gritty parts of anything I do. 

I want a job in the IT industry as it would give me great financial security also make my parents happy but realistically, the way things are going, I doubt I’ll be successful even if I make it. I feel like the struggle would just continue but with more importance. I just don’t know if this is the right career fit for me anymore. If anyone is in IT please hmu with some advice. 

I’ve never considered a second career option besides maybe business but I’ve had a few stray thoughts about pursuing music in some form. Not that I’d ever abandon my current path for music but I’ve a lot of odd signs in my life pointing me towards it. In multiple readings things (I don’t really know exactly what they were based on) I was predicted to be successful in music, and I never really believed in those things but it was too much of a coincidence to ignore. I’ve always been musically inclined since a child and I’ve been able to use that ability to learn a lot of instruments.  I feel a natural inclination towards music but logically know it’s too risky and too late but can’t help but think, what if they were right? And how could they have known that about me? Anyway not really something I’m taking too seriously just a side thought.

Anyway I just needed a place to get my thoughts out it was taking over my focus from my work lol. Thanks anyone who actually read my spew of words and if any of you are in or have been in this type of situation I’d love to hear your thoughts and how you handled it. I guess I just need some advice from people who get it lol"

I received about 25 coding test and I completed about 20+ from them in about half the given time with optimal solution and received 2 interview. I screwed up the first one in behavioral round and moved to final round in the second company but they had to cancel the internship due to COVID. I was unable to get even a coding round after that.

It was really heartbreaking, to not able to find a single company to trust me in whole wide US. I still kept myself together. I worked every single day during summer. I spent more hours during summer every single week than a full time intern would spend working, all on learning and creating projects. ALL TO GET ONE FINE JOB.

It's hiring season again. From the beginning of the fall semester I've applied to about a 100 new grad positions and not receive a single interview. It's just disappointing. I don't know how much more do I have left anymore. I've always been a nerdy and studying guy so skipped over a lot of opportunities to have fun and I never thought I'd say this but I seriously regret it. If I knew it was going to turn out like this, I would rather have had some fun here and there than to spend all day in library.

Can someone please help me either helping me build a better resume or giving me tips on how to get interviews(based on their experience).

jod7kj,1,2020-11-05,When is the good time to find a new job?,Throwaway2722551363,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jod7kj/when_is_the_good_time_to_find_a_new_job/,"A bit about my background first. I graduated with BS CS last year from top-20 University (GPA &gt;3.70). I had 2 internships (3 months each) prior to graduation, one of which is from Big-N tech company. Unfortunately I didn't get a return offer, but experience definitely helped me getting more interviews. I interviewed several top-notched companies, including Google, Apple and Amazon, but I didn't prepare well at the time. I ended up joining the company that I wasn’t interested in. It was still a big tech company, just not type of my area.

I left that company only 4 months after I joined. I know I shouldn't have done that considering I was only in the early stage of career, but I just felt my situation weren’t good at that time. I worked on some legacy product that I didn't even understand, and I barely got any help from team members because they were all busy.

As soon as I quit, all of a sudden pandemic occurred. It was the thing I had never expected. It took several months to find a new role with all the hiring freeze, but luckily I got an offer from mid-sized company as entry-level role.

I've been here for 6 months now. So far I'm having a good time at my company. I enjoy working here and learning a lot. However, I'm not satisfied with compensation. The payment is just too low compared to any companies that I had worked in the past. I could probably ask for salary increase after a year, but when I take a look into Glassdoor page I don’t think that’s going to happen. I'm planning to find more high-paying role in the future, hopefully Big-N tech company again.

How long should I stay for current company? When should I start looking for a new role? Since I had two 3-months internships and 4-months full-time experience before I joined this company, I had total 10 months experiences already. If I change the job right now, I fear that I have to join entry-level position again. Pandemic thing may also affect hiring bar. Maybe I could spend about 1-year here and apply for the job that requires 2 YOE, if that’s even possible.

Any advice would help. Thanks you.

**TLDR**: I have a solid background with CS degree from Top-Tier University and total 10-months experiences (3-month internship + 3-month internship + 4-month full-time) at big tech companies before I joined my current low-paying job. How long should I stay here until I can move to high-paying role?"

The way I've always seen college was like this:

Good grades --&gt; get recruiters to hopefully notice me

Internship --&gt; Opens the door to other internships, and perhaps full time conversion?

&amp;#x200B;

So with that being said, how important is maintaining a high GPA after you've landed an internship, especially one that you are content with returning for full time employment at? It's been extremely difficult for me with school being all online to really engage with the material, and given that I neglected my schoolwork for the past couple weeks to prepare for the interview, I have alot of material to catch up :\\

I am currently looking for internships, esp remote ones due to the current covid scenario. 

I have interned before at 1-2 locations , and worked on live projects too as a full stack developer. I have tried applying to firms like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Flipkart , Amazon, etc. but haven't received any replies from them.

Can someone guide me on how to select companies or how to reach out to them ? So that I may land an internship?

I have also heard that it's easier to get an intern at startups since they are more than willing to hire and give out pre-placement offers. How much is this true? Is it a good idea?

Ps. I have a resume and an online portfolio as well, currently hosted on GitHub.

join36,7,2020-11-05,[Uni] Advice needed on furthering studies in university,Fee_New,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/join36/uni_advice_needed_on_furthering_studies_in/,"Hello, I don't come to reddit often but recently I was reading and found this to be a great place to ask for advice (while remaining anonymous). There was a post dated a few years back by someone also asking for advice on paying for their Uni education and I think I can really use some advice now. I might be long-winded and this post may take time to read, but I will try my best to summarise.

**Background:** I'm 21, Singaporean male who came from JC and just finished NS at the end of last year. For those who take the JC road, most would be in uni already. During yr 1 NS, I applied for and was offered a 3 year course in NTU which I accepted. Things changed after ord when I found a job and decided to continue working.

**Now:** I am aiming to matriculate next year Jul/Aug (JC intake). I am interested in engineering courses in NTU/NUS and I will likely choose the cheaper of the 2 options (though from my current research the tuition fees are the same per annum). I have been interested to read engineering for quite some time now but I am unable to decide which engineering course I want to choose as my specialisation. (I know this can be an entire post on its own).

As for what I want to do in my future, I want to be an investor/entrepreneur (eventually getting an MBA) once my life starts to improve after getting a degree. I am open to doing a sales job after getting a degree (especially if it gives me opportunities to travel since I love travelling). An ideal pathway I would want is to work for several years (and pay off my loans) before saving up to invest/start my entrepreneurship journey (my ultimate goal in life). But before that, I would need to get my finances right and also secure a degree and I found out the hard way that having just an A level cert in Singapore is as good as not having one.

In particular, I am interested in Electrical/Chemical or Environmental Engineering courses, although I am not sure where the road will lead after getting that degree. Given that I didn't excel in my A's, I might not be offered the course which I want when application window opens next year too. I scored just below 80 points (which is one of the worst in my school as I came from one of the top schools in SG). I find the most important issue to work out now, though, is not the course but the cost if I were to matriculate next year.

**Moving on:** Below is what I have gathered so far from some research. I plan to use these methods to fund for my uni education. If you have answers to my questions or know of anyone with experience dealing with funding for university, please help to clarify my doubts. It would be even better if you can compare both NUS and NTU's way of settling such payments too.

Disbursement of Funds: For general undergraduate programme students who are using a combination of loans &amp;/or subsidies to settle their MOE subsidised tuition fees, the disbursement sequence is as follows:

PSEA funds

CPF funds under the CPF Education Scheme

Tuition Fee Loan (up to 90%)

Study Loan

Higher Education Bursary

GIRO deductions from bank account

1. Does that mean that I have to follow this order and use up my PSEA funds first before I pay the tuition fees using other methods? If that is so, how is it that some people have advised others to let the amount in their PSEA account compound (2.5% IR) till the last semester before using it to pay for tuition fees?
2. One guide (Guide A) I came across mentions that I should consider if I am eligible for the CPF Education Scheme. (Of course I am using my own CPF since I will be working for almost another year before matriculating and I would likely have a significant amount in my CPF OA by then. I have a terrible relationship with my parents since young and I am no longer in contact with my parents to use their CPF, neither would I want to go back home to seek their help)

Another guide (Guide B) mentions that ""after all available CPF OA monies have been deducted, if there is still a shortfall, the student will need to make up the shortfall in cash, take a loan under the MOE Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, or seek out financial aid.""

3) According to the CPF website (link below) it mentioned that if I do not have enough savings in my OA (which I will not) I will need to make alternative arrangement to pay the tuition fees in cash, or consider other financing options such as the Tuition Fee Loan or use of the student's Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) savings. Does this mean that I can only use my CPF if it is enough to cover the entire tuition fees? Can I make part of the tuition fee payment using my CPF OA? According to Guide B, it seems like a partial payment can be arranged. How would I go about applying for that and like the disbursement of funds, how will I go about paying partially?

4) If I take a tuition fee loan of 90% (and if my bursary covers more than 10%), how will the deduction go about? Must I calculate so that I take a tuition fee loan equal to the remaining of what I owe after receiving the bursary to maximise the use of the bursary?

5) I am staying alone in a rented room now and I don't live with my family. (Yes, this is life) How would my bursary amount be determined? Since my address on my NRIC shows the rented room now, will the gross monthly per capita income be just my own income (if any) when I am schooling? Would I also be able to qualify for study grants?

6) How does a combination of the PSEA funds, CPF funds under the CPF education scheme, tuition fee loan, NUS/NTU study loan and bursary work?

7) As for the study loan, does anyone can give a rough estimate which category would I be classified into? (I also do not own my own laptop)

Below are some of the comments I came across while reading online.

""I became resident assistant in the hostel and received free accommodation."" - Malaysian who studied in NUS

8) How does one become a resident assistant in a hostel?

""Do internships every summer. Internships are very helpful, a better paying one will easily cover your daily expense and even allow you pocket or save some extra cash. Internship will also help to boost on your portfolio!'

9) What is the likelihood of an engineering student finding an internship? (assuming my results are not spectacular, mine has always been average. To be realistic, since I have lost touch with most of the things I learnt in High School/JC below average would be more accurate). Would I be better off working odd jobs in the summer or doing internships to earn money?

10) I saw that there is a Work study scheme in NTU, while there is also a prestigious NOC programme in NUS which develops entrepreneurs which I am really interested in (it might be way above my league, but if it isn't I would defenitely apply provided my results and finances permits) Again it is a comparison of both institutions

Taking into account that I will still need to have fixed expenses of roughly 1.3-1.5k per month throughout the entire course of study, I am looking to apply for as many loans as possible to minimise the amount I pay on my own (until I graduate and find a job, when I will aim to clear my debts as quickly as possible).

I have shared almost everything about myself. Hopefully I have given anyone who will advice me a better understanding of my current situation. If you have/know anyone who has any experience with this, please share your experience and advise me. Thanks"

So if the acceptance of this internship isn't legally binding, can I just accept and if I am able to snag another internship offer that I'm more interested in I can pull out of this one and probably just get blacklisted from them? Or is that something that people don't really do and I should just try to request a week or 2 extension for the acceptance and hope and pray I get some calls back, or just suck it up and accept it because I'm lucky to have gotten an offer anyway?"

There is also a program at my school where we are able to work for a year in Europe (nothing related to my major). I thought that this might be  a good backup plan in case I still don’t know what to do and would give me time to figure it out, especially if I choose to go to grad school or anything else that would required an extended time of studying.

Throughout these months I had a few online coding assessments that seemed really difficult to me so I started grinding LC and reading some books over DSA and I am improving but now it seems like other than some more online coding assessments I am not hearing back from any companies except for rejections. I am beginning to lose a lot of hope applying and starting to feel as if I am just not able to get a job.

I have been applying to internships since my sophomore year and was never able to land one, but I recently figured out that my resume back then was definitely lacking LOL and I applied to an average of 50-100 each semester but now at the end of my college career I don't really have much to put on my resume.

One good thing this semester is that I was able to get a part time Coding Instructor job teaching younger kids, I enjoy this job alot and have alot of passion for Computer Science and love to teach others about it but I definitely want to get into the actual software development field.

I am beginning to suspect it is my resume that it preventing me from getting much back, Ill be attaching a link of it below and I am open to any thoughts, criticisms or anything else anyone has to say!

The manager seemed to basically give me an offer right then so I'm a bit surprised there was no ""we will contact you if we'd like to move forward"" type of thing that's usually expected. Its also my first offer of the season so I'm a little lost on what to do and have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The location is in Lynchburg, VA. Its definitely not a place I expected to be working at this summer. (I really want to be in a bigger city like in cali, ny, texas, etc.)  Would it be possible to ask the recruiter if there are available spots in any of those locations, or am I stuck with the Lynchburg one?
2. If I do have to move to Lynchburg, could I ask if they offer relocation assistance? The manager asked me how I would commute, so I said I'd have to seek a living arrangement in Lynchburg if things were to go in person. I was gonna ask right then if they offer relocation assistance but I wasn't sure if it was too early to do that then.
3. Do you think I can find a better company/better location later this year? I sort of feel like I'm selling myself short with this opportunity but I'm also not sure if I'm aiming too high.

But I feel like all my work throughout college means nothing. I've been working my ass off for a 3.9 in computer eng as a 2nd-year student at a top-10 engineering school and I'm graduating in 3 years on track to get a masters in one more (4+1 program). I know its seems like a flex, but trust me when I say, I deprived myself of a lot of things to get to where I am with it. Outside of that, I'm involved with IEEE where I hold a small leadership role with responsibility, and I'm involved with another club where I also hold a leadership role.

Despite the stress I have juggling everything along with internship hunting, I have gotten fucking zilch. Not a single call back, not even a SINGLE interview. I have had professors who used to be recruiters look over my resume and cover letters and said they were pretty good. I even have leadership experience in project-based engineering groups. But literally nothing matters. I talked to 8 recruiters at a career fair and had great conversations, only to get ghosted by literally fucking all of them. I know I'm not entitled to an internship at all, but I would think that I'd at least get ONE call back for an interview. I've applied to at least 50-60 positions and custom tailored a cover letter for any of them that required it. I didn't only apply to big companies, but small ones too -- still nothing.

It doesn't help that I'm a first-generation American and my parents have no connections whatsoever. They have degrees from their home countries and haven't ever really used them. Learned that school doesn't matter at all for internships, it's all fucking connections. I'm sorry I have none and when I try to make any, apparently I get ghosted :)))

Am I supposed to ruin my fucking social life and work on personal projects out of class? I'm sorry I'm not a fucking computer savant who codes apps in what little free time I have (I even take time to do leetcode, but what's that fucking worth if I cant even get an interview). Apparently I'm not allowed to keep my fucking sanity.

Does anyone have any advice? I apologize if this post seems like I'm screaming entitled (and call me out if it is), but I'm feeling hopeless and my work all feels like it doesn't matter anymore. I'm usually not this negative or vulgar but this post is just as much as a rant as a plea for help. I'm seriously demotivated and COVID doesn't help. Just about the only thing that keeps my mental health up is my gf and a couple of friends.

I couldn't get an internship last year, and that made sense since I was a freshman. I took courses over the summer to fill the gap and allow myself to graduate in 3 years.

Thanks for reading."

There are a lot of variables there; whether I'm mentally prepared, how it will look price wise, etc. But before I even begin to answer those, what could I research as someone who prefers higher level languages? 

Right now I'm focusing on web development (had a Ruby on Rails internship and am in a grad level MERN class) and I reallyyyyy want to avoid lower level stuff like C but my concentration is software engendering so I imagine I'll be writing code for something. I don't mind C# or Java at all but would prefer something along the lines of JS or Python.

What options do I have? What is being researched that would be a good fit for me? Of course, it would depend on why my university has to offer but assuming that isn't an issue, what's out there? I've been so focused on WebDev stuff I haven't looking outside my bubble."

Just thought I'd put this out here for anyone who might find it interesting.

[Sankey Diagram](https://imgur.com/a/lIlA9zO)

As for my background, I'm a junior at UT Austin with a 3.8 GPA and 2 prior internships at smaller companies. I sent out the bulk of my applications in the first two weeks of September and kept steadily applying until the first week or so of October. I spent mid-September to mid-October prepping for technical interviews by going through problems on this list [here](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU), watching YouTube videos covering leetcode questions, and doing random medium-level leetcode questions. I also did practice interviews on [pramp.com](https://pramp.com), which I felt helped a lot with becoming more comfortable at talking through technical problems. Ironically, none of this technical prep really applied to the interview process for the DevOps position (it was the only DevOps interview I did, and only applied for it because the recruiter nudged me away from from generic SWE intern role after noticing Jenkins/Docker on my resume), but it absolutely made a difference for the rest of my interviews.

Some of the more recognized companies that I reached the final round with include Duolingo, Bloomberg, Okta, Nutanix, and Optiver (bombed the final round). I received two mediocre offers pretty early on in my search with deadlines that expired earlier this week, but decided to keep interviewing. I still have a handful of offer decisions / final rounds that I am waiting on, but am unlikely to consider them unless they are unexpectedly good offers. If I get any more offers at this point, I'll just ask those companies if they would be willing to move the internship to the Fall season since I'm interested in doing a co-op. 

Overall, I'm really happy with how things went this recruiting season given how rough it is, and am so glad to wrap things up and unwind a bit (though now I need to spend time trying to recover my grades lol)"

She’s going to assume I sell it which I do not/have never.  I’m currently in college and working a terrible 40 hour a week job.  One huge reason I stay at my bad job is that it provides health insurance and a prescription plan at a cheap rate. 

I’m scared to leave the job even though I could make more money/get better work experience because of this.  Over the past 6ish months I’ve begun not taking my medication unless I need to and saving the extra pills, so that I can have the medication if I choose to take an internship or better job in the near future while in college.  

How do I approach this situation?  Should I take my medicine and asked to be retested or should I be honest with my doctor?  I’ve been with her for about 3 years.

I’m scared of going without my medication because when I last tried going off of it I dropped out of college and it has taken me a couple of years to build myself back up and reattend.  Now I’m older, but also struggling to manage my 40 hour a week job and 15 credit hours.

The reason I haven't fully decided to go back to college is because I don't really want to go back but I thought I would just apply to a couple universities while looking for work. That way if I end up getting an HR job and hating the career or not managing to land a job at all, I'll at least have college to fall back on again and shift careers into software development (I dabbled in coding about 2 years ago because I wanted to be an independent game developer on the side and found it challenging, but also interesting), only problem is I know I could go back to college and graduate but still not have a job afterwards.

Around a year and a half ago a colleague of a colleague reached out to me asking me if I'd like to join their team in a very big, well steemed silicon valley company. However at the moment I was about to graduate and I am a person with a broad range of interest and I didn't feel ready to ""marry"" such a big company so early(it was a minimum 3 year contract). I also knew this company tend to be very protective of their employees, making it very hard for them to do jobs after hours and for personal reasons I needed to do a lot after hours work. On top of that the job required me to change cities, and I wasn't emotionally ready to do such thing and seemed there were many offers in my city at the time. Finally, at this time I felt corporate full-time work might not be the thing for me, but more a freelance type of things.

After a short email exchange with this person they left the ball in my court and I followed the advice of one of my mentors and didn't answer anything back. It felt off, but then commencement came and I got an internship right way and right after that a 6 month contract in an mid size company.

With Covid I got unemployed, and since then I've been doing things here and there, half assing the freelance life. Thinking back, one of my most satisfactory times was at that big company in my internship, and I've been thinking  about reaching out to that old contact in that Silicon valley company. But I don't know how to re start the conversation, or if I should at all.

Do you guys have any idea of how could I reach out to them after all this time? Should I tell them why I went silent? Should I just continue like nothing happened?

Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Had this good contact at a great company. I let it get cold and I don't know how to reach out to them again a year later.

P.S. sorry. I don't know how to use the location Flair. I am in the US."

My gpa wasn’t stellar (2.8 iirc) and I didn’t manage to get an internship while at school (I did other summer jobs instead) but I did pass the FE so I’m a certified EIT.  
Now I work at a grocery store and haven’t had a relevant interview since probably February. I got some interviews and such last year but I guess I didn’t impress anyone much (I managed to get to the third interview at one place, which lasted 3 hours and I thought I did well at, only to be rejected with nothing but a short email. That hurt.)  
I’m currently working on trying to learn new programming languages with Codecademy, but that hasn’t seemed to increase interest.  
Quite a few of the jobs I see for my experience level require less than a year since graduating so I’m concerned that I may have missed the boat. I often apply to them anyway, but no luck.  
I’m getting really discouraged and worry that I did all this work to get my degree for nothing.

I did most of my applications october/early november but then I read a post on this sub where people where saying the application process is much harder this year and everyones struggling to get internships and now i incredibly worried.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, im so happy to not be alone in saying that this application process feeling more difficult. Any coding interviews i've done this year seem ridiculously hard and its been really off-putting and demoralizing. I spend the entire summer and early lockdown working on coding projects so I could have a chance but now im failing every interview and its depressing. 

  That being said ive only heard back from like 10/40 ive applied to but something tells me a lot of them won't even reply. 

  
Should I start making plans for what happens if I dont get an internship?   
I live in Miami, honestly there aren't that many small tech companies i could even apply to. I was really trying to get a swe-intern job next year and honestly really need one as well.

It has been a full 2 years since I graduated from college. I was an esri intern before graduating but did not get an offer. After graduating it took about 4 months to get a job as a technician collecting data for an Energy company. It was awful and I ended up leaving. I was doing a web development course and continued on with that. Graduated and COVID hit. 11 months after graduating from web dev, 14 months since my last GIS job and almost a full 2 years since graduating from university. 

The job I got is a technician/analyst role. Though I don’t have much experience. What they told me one them over is my technical skills not just in GIS but other things such as programming, algorithms, and so on. 

My message to all of you is of PATIENCE. Do not let yourself believe you are entitled to a job after four years. If you don’t get a job right out of school. Keep learning!!! Work and work on yourself. Gain marketable skills both in and outside of the field. Don’t be discouraged. Don’t give up! You spent the money and you may need to continue to spend money but that’s the path we chose. Get a masters do certification. Everyone make a portfolio! Even if it’s simple things made in QGIS. Have something tangible!

I wish you all luck, especially in these hard times. If you need any tips for creating a portfolio. Hosting a portfolio online or just general question. I’ll do what I can for you!"
jp3266,1,2020-11-06,My internship at a printer company is boring!,Drayzens,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/jp3266/my_internship_at_a_printer_company_is_boring/,"Hello, I don’t know if this is the right place to complain about an Internship, but here is the story:

Since October 18th I started an 10 months internship in a Printer-repair Company in Germany, they work for Epson but  they are an own Company, we‘re only three workers (except me) i earn like 247€ every month, my boss said in the application talk they do some networking stuff and some other IT-stuff which is a big lie! so the bad part comes: the working time is from 8am to 5pm! also.. 9 hours! and this on every weekday from Monday to Friday, the work there is kind of the same, inspecting printers from customers, find the solution and then repair, most of the time there is nothing to do so I either sit there or standing there till work ends, so there was one customers visit that freaked me internally out, me and that trainee went to an customer which is some hundred meters away, we have inspected the printer and then I have standing there for 3-4 hours because that trainee tried to fix why the printer prints very thin lines, and now it ended up in our workshop, When we’re always in the workshop, that trainee do some weird noises when fixing printers and let me often do his work so he can play on his phone, which outrages me internally. 

November 7th 11:35AM:

It’s 9:30AM, Me and the trainee found from the boss phone call out that our other workers car got malfunctioned and then we drived to him where he left us that car and took ours, after that we called the car repair service where they told us they would come in 1,5 hours, after that they called us again and told us they come in 3-4 hours, worser can't this internship not become..

The boss greatly imagined me as future trainee but from my side I find it highly boring there and would not continue to do this terrible job for the next 10 months.

So my questions to you are:

Would you do an internship if it offer bad working conditions and fake promises like this?

Can you imagine to apply to an internship where you have to work the whole day and doing like nothing and always fixing printers? 

Would you do the 10 months or ending it early?"

Every detail is relevant though, but regardless I doubt this will garnish much support. Sorry for the wall of text and personal problems — we all have them — but understand that me having to post here is an act of desperation. I genuinely hate my life when it’s like this and even lately have had thoughts of suicide...

—-

I don’t want to go into too much unnecessary detail, but I’m really struggling living with my dad right now. If you’ve ever had to deal with the same sort of problem, you’ll understand that these situations can be hard and lengthy to explain. So I apologize if you don’t want a story, but this can’t be helped without context.

First of all I’m living just with him in my family’s house while I’m attending my last few semesters of college online due to covid. The house isn’t his, it’s his dad’s, and the power of attorney is within my aunt; she’s somewhat aware of the situation, but so far my dad has been living here alone for the past 6-7 years and has precedence.

The drug problem:
My dad has severe bipolar disorder, among many other health issues. He has medicine but rarely takes it as prescribed. He’s also been prescribed Fentanyl for the past 4 years for back pain; he’s fully addicted to it and abuses it each 2 weeks he gets it, just to detox when he runs out prematurely. He may very well be in pain but still he manipulates doctors to continue to give it to him, and later on if they decide to deny him healthcare he simply goes and finds a different shitty doctor. Overall it seems they want to wean him off it for obvious reasons, but I mean he’s been abusing it for the past 4 years like I said. Additionally, he’s stockpiled Clonzapam which he often takes in conjunction. He’s had a fucked up life, a successful life at one point, has been a great dad in the past, and has been a very shitty person as well. Eh overall he’s a shitty father ever since he’s been unemployed when I was in high school. He’s tried to kill himself on multiple occasions, sometimes based off the notion that he thinks he can’t die, and has direct influence on the world — typical manic shit. He hates his life, and if he wants to take drugs to avoid his problems that’s his choice and not mine. In his own words he’s given up and there’s not much I can do to try to help him, I’ve tried...

Why I’m asking for advice:
It’s very difficult to talk to someone like him without offending him, or allowing him to take something in his own direction which he then turns and interprets into something very negative against me. At the same time he’s quite honestly fine to deal with and pleasant to be around when he’s sober and detoxed from anything; he’s my father, I more than anyone else know how to deal with him.

What I can’t properly approach is, when he’s high or in an altered state of mind, whether because of drugs and/or days without sleep, he constantly tries to instigate with me. He thinks I hate him, and HE wants me to hurt him and bring out some type of violence he thinks I’m repressing, and I’ve tried to make it clear that I’m not...  I value forgiveness above all. I think he thinks this because there have been a couple altercations in the past where we’ve physically fought because of all this negativity. For example I told him, when he was sober, that I was going to take his Fentanyl if he tried to feed my cat again. He did, so I did, and he tried to stab me with scissors and broke my thumb as a result. In that situation for example, the only thing he took away from it was the fact that I tried to hurt him in self defense. He’s a big guy and at least twice my weight so any instance of domestic violence results in me getting fucking hurt.

Regardless, he choses to act psychotic in ways I won’t elaborate further. He chooses to provoke me and make my life miserable. He chooses to keep me from sleeping some nights. He chooses to also fuck with my cat by grabbing him and feed him bullshit, or encourage him to overeat. I’ve asked a lot of family the best way to deal with this and the best advice I’ve gotten so far was to be passive with him, and respond to his shit with kindness or reason. As an aside, when he found out I talked to other people about some of this he only further accused me of being a shitty son, and reinforces in his mind that I’m the origin of all our problems.

In the end I try to reason with him, and I want to be in good relation, but still deep down he thinks I hate him and he wants me to move out. If I’m passive or try to get away from him, he just attempts to push me further (I can’t lock the door to my room btw). And yes, the drugs are the main issue, but he is not incoherent when he’s manic or high, he’s fully aware of what he does, so our interactions carry over the next day even when he’s sober. This makes it very difficult to be kind to him, even though I really try to bottle everything up and move past our bullshit. I’ve fucked up myself and tried to treat him like he treats me, and it doesn’t work. I’ve been mean to him for reasons, and I’ve argued with him for reasons. Admittedly I’ve fucked up in my past, personally, and he has reason to think of me as a failure. I’ve changed and improved though, so when I moved back in I assumed he would have changed too.

But still, I have no other place to go, apart from back to my campus which I’d love to do but can’t afford. I just moved back in with him a few months ago. I desperately want things to work out here; I NEED to focus on school and have an internship and job here for now, last thing I want to do is move yet again. I’m here to fix my problems AND our problems, but I need help. I’m done moving and avoiding my problems. It’s time to fix this."
jp36l3,781,2020-11-06,May 2020 grad here and just got my first job offer!,happygradd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jp36l3/may_2020_grad_here_and_just_got_my_first_job_offer/,"I’ve been a long time lurker of this sub and just wanted to share my experience with other recent grads out there who came out of school without a full time job lined up (I was also a bit dejected because I was unable to secure a return offer from my internship). Like a lot of people in this sub, I'd applied to hundreds and hundreds of jobs for the past 5-6 months, and felt very stressed most of the time.

For context, I’m actually a mechanical engineering major who minored in CS. My job offer is with AT&amp;T in Dallas, TX as a Software Engineer through their Technology Development Program.

I was so, so incredibly ecstatic to get this offer because it seemed like the perfect opportunity to kickstart a career in development. I wouldn’t say I have really strong programming knowledge especially as I'm not a CS major, but I’ve had 4 months of relevant internship experience, a web app project I deployed on the Google Chrome Web Store (I worked on this during the summer after I graduated), and did really well on my behavioral interview, which I think is what got me the job in the end. 

As for getting the interview, I attended my school’s annual career fair in the fall as an alumni. At the time, this particular program wasn’t taking applications yet, but a recruiter sent a link out to be notified when the program was open for apps. I applied right when I got the email saying the program was open, and received an invitation for an interview a few weeks after that.

So my advice is to definitely see if you can still attend your school’s networking events as an alumni if you can! All the recruiters I spoke to were actually very understanding of how I was looking for a job as a May 2020 grad in the crappy COVID economy. Hope this is encouraging to my fellow recent grads out there!"

So, I am a 3D animation major that was supposed to be going into my junior year, but decided to take a gap year due to Covid. I've been thinking of applying to animation internships, specifically for 3D modelling/asset creation, but I only really have one school year's worth of knowledge of 3D animation (basic Maya, Zbrush, Substance, etc.)

Is this a bad idea since I'm still a beginner and feel nowhere near confident enough to be working in a professional environment? Or is it okay because internships are for people to learn and gain experience? I'm mostly worried I would screw up/annoy the pros and would ruin my future potential to get jobs.

Also I know that actually getting an internship is sort of a longshot for me right now, but am still curious as to what people think or if anyone else has been in this position.

**TL;DR**: Is it a bad idea to apply to 3D animation internships with basic 3D animation knowledge/experience?

Any thoughts would be appreciated, thanks!"

jpa9eo,17,2020-11-06,How do you fix not being 'polished'?,proforrange,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/jpa9eo/how_do_you_fix_not_being_polished/,"Hey fellow MBA's. Hoping some of you guys and gals would lend a hand a bit on some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

In my second year of my MBA at a top school going for Marketing. Did an internship at a top company but did not get a return offer (loved the job but they had reservations on the 'executive presence' piece). I lucked out getting it in the first place since it wasn't so competitive and I did fail like 20 interviews getting that 1 role.

&amp;#x200B;

Now though that I'm interviewing again, I've been BTFO'd from several top companies in my interviews. The feedback I got from my career coach is that I come up as unpolished...potentially very unpolished in comparison to my peers. Her words: 'You come off like a professor. Some think brilliant, others think unworkable'.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've practiced to hell and back my stories and my resume has gotten me a lot of great interviews. I naturally speak super fast and practice so I can tone it down....but I just don't really know how to be relatable when doing a STAR story especially on Zoom. On my own I go into the weeds in a story so I dumb it down to the bare essentials of my actions. I've gotten good feedback in mock interviews on the stories themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

It's the way I come off....the subtleties of body language. The tone of confidence and being able to project that 'executive presence'. I don't know how to fake this part, and it doesn't help being virtual and not seeing peers do this with grace. I think that I can get better at it, potentially be super proficient, if I can have the opportunity to do it and see others in action with time (maybe a year or two). My career before my MBA was mostly in a desk so I have little experience with it... I was thinking of asking one or two sympathetic ears on this in my school who are the MOST polished, but I have a feeling that'll just be awkward to bring up (or they just don't have the time).

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who has been in a similar situation, how do you at least 'fake it till you make it'? I just need to show 'fit' in the interview process to move on. I know I can do the job. But because of the way I come off I can't get the job..."

If so how hard were the technical questions? And what types of questions does the hiring manager ask at the end?

I had two interview one after another. So, my first interview was really good, I had a lovely conversation and that was what I was looking for. But for second interview, I don't know why for some reason the interviewer was cold. The guy seems like he really hates me before I even speak a word. I can see it in his eyes. 

So okay don't give me job, that's fine but at least try to have a good conversation. I was applying for intern and I asked both interviewer that what skills does the  successful intern should have in your company in your view.  

First Interviewer: I think for intern what we are looking is a curious, problem solver, and ability to work on team. I think technical skills is important but you will be able to collect it as you move forward.

Second Interviewer: I think coding skills is a must. 

Yeah second interviewer is correct but the way he communicate with others is alarming. I am really having doubt working with the second interviewer. Both interviewer are from different locations so, if I have a choice I would definitely choice the location of first interviewer. I don't want to be only tech guy... staring at screen and work with persons who only values tech skills. I am confident that I have technical skills and capabilities to learn new technologies. So, I believe working with the first interviewer team match my personality and help me prosper on team. What I believe is company should also look at the person who is taking interview: okay they may be very good at his SWE but he may not be good at taking interview.

But I may not get intern there Lmao because I think the second interviewer will not recommend me although the first interviewer told me that she was really impressed with me and would  recommend me.  

Btw I was also awesome on tech interview and he recommended me, the second HR interview is where I may slip.  

It is what it is. ( sound from tiktok is going through my mind)"

I have received a few internship offers from FAANG/Unicorn startups, and I frankly feel incredibly undeserving of what I'm about to receive. As a 20-year-old, I'm going to be making 2x what my dad, who has worked hard his entire life is making. Frankly, we should feel incredibly fortunate to receive these kinds of offers, and to even have a chance at them. 

In addition, I think that the ""basic cs skills"" market is incredibly over-saturated given that a considerable percentage of my friends and I were programming at their level around Junior year in HS. I think that if you can learn the necessary skills for a job in less than four years, then you shouldn't expect to be highly sought after and well paid for those skills.

For reference, I go to what I consider the top CS school (I'm not a tree hugger), interned at a large defense company freshman year, and a unicorn startup sophomore year. I'll be working at fb next year."

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really even know how to start this. I feel like the only important information I need to share is that I'm gay and no else involved in this story knows that. Okay so I have been working an internship for the past 2 summers. While I was there, I met someone who we're going to call Toby. I would say that Toby and I are pretty good friends. We didn't necessarily spend a lot of time together outside of work, but while we were at work we always had really good conversations, and eventually I really came to like him. Well, spoiler alert, he's straight. I sort of figured that he was straight from the beginning which is why this is really all my fault, but I never got a 100% confirmation. Anyways, the first summer I fell sort of hard. I had just gotten over a really hard year at college and he was really the only person I wanted to talk to day in and day out. Even if I came into work feeling like shit, or if I was in a bad mood, I would always perk up when I saw him because he made my days so much better. That first summer was when he met his girlfriend too. This was obviously difficult for me, but I guess maybe there was some part of me that held on to some sort of hope. Eventually, the summer came to a close, and I left the state and went back to college. The distance put between us helped me feel better about the situation for the time being. 

Fast forward to summer 2020. Our place of employment is considered an essential business so by the time my spring semester finished up we were back to working together. It went okay, but I always sort of had that thought in the back of my mind asking me if I was really sure that things couldn't work out between us somehow. But still, at points over that summer it was really hard to see him, which was super paradoxical because all I wanted to do was talk to him more. Considering we were in the same building for 8 hours a day it was pretty hard to avoid him in the end, especially since to him we were just good friends so he always wanted to have a conversation about something. While I knew it was bad for me in the long run, I valued my time with him too much to make any attempts to totally cut him out of my life. Once again, the summer ended, and being 1000+ miles away at college has helped me a lot. 

Fast forward again to about a week and a half ago, and I see a social media post that he is proposing to his girlfriend in. Well, if nothing else closed the door for me then this certainly did. I'm not even surprised, they're absolutely perfect for each other. I couldn't be happier for both of them that they have each other, and I truly, genuinely mean that. It's just hard because there is this very selfish, narcissistic part of me that wishes I could be that person for him. I think what hurts even more is that I don't think I'll even meet someone like this again. Toby is incredibly smart, kind, caring, motivated, honest, and frankly I think I would've done anything for him. If I got a call tomorrow and he needed me, I'd be on the next plane back to where he is. What also hurt me is that I never even had a chance, like at all. There was no opportunity there for me to make something happen or for me to truly express how I feel because it wasn't going to accomplish anything. I probably would have just made the situation extremely awkward, and it would've been the end of our friendship. I don't really know how to deal with a lot of this, I'm overwhelmed sometimes with how I feel and then all of the sudden I'll just be numb to it, like it comes in waves. I need help navigating this, I want to talk to someone, but I don't feel like anyone in my life will really understand what I'm feeling, I don't really even know what I'm feeling half of the time. I understand it's been over a year since we've known each other, and that I need to grow up and move on from him, it's just been hard. If anyone has had a similar situation, I would love some advice right now."

How did you guys decide you like web development, how you decided being front-end or back-end or full-stack or be the Php guy, how can or experience what I like better? What is the pathway?

I have a few Python projects and a few basic HTML CSS websites. I like Python because it is easy to code and I like web dev because I can see my project via live preview step by step. But I know real job programming will be different.

If you can share your experience what helped you decide what kind of development you want to do, it would be very helpful. Any advice is appreciated as well!

jph1t8,4,2020-11-06,Advice on PCB Designer Job as ECE Grad,spikesonthebrain,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/jph1t8/advice_on_pcb_designer_job_as_ece_grad/,"I'm a BS ECE student at a major US University.  I graduate next May, and of course have begun applying around.  I have 2.5 years of intern experience as I worked for a small startup during the semesters where I wrote MCU firmware, did circuit design and PCB design for an aircraft-mounted sensor project.  They trusted me to do high to low level design on major modules of the project as an intern, it was an awesome experience.  I also did a summer internship at a major aerospace company this last summer where I was the sole designer for a fairly complex PCB project (I also designed the circuit, SPICE, etc.).  

My #1 choice would be to work for the latter major aerospace company, so I applied to 2 EE (Hardware Dev) positions, and 1 PCB Designer position.  The positions are at a different facility than I worked at over the summer so I have no idea how the workflow goes as far as EEs vs PCB Designers there.  They recently offered me an interview for the PCB Designer job and I haven't heard anything about the 2 EE jobs.

What I'm worried about is that it may be a bad idea to take the PCB Designer job.  I understand at these sort of large companies, PCB Designers usually just do layouts (not circuit design, simulation etc.) and are also generally paid less.  Most PCB Designer job listings (including this one) also don't require a degree.  I really really enjoy doing layouts, but I'm worried I may be shooting myself in the foot by taking this job, both financially and for career development (if I never get to do anything other than layouts).  I was hoping to be able to do circuit design.  I meet all the basic requirements for the 2 EE jobs there, and was honestly hoping that they would reach out to me about those first.  I plan on interviewing and being honest that I would prefer to get an EE position, if possible, and asking lots of questions about pay range and possibility to move up to EE, etc.

Do you guys have any thoughts on my situation?  Is PCB Designer job not a good idea for me as a fairly-experienced-for-an-entry-level ECE?  Should I definitely wait for an EE position?  I still have about 6 months to graduation so I don't necessarily need to make a decision immediately.  I'd love to hear what more experienced folks think.  Thanks everyone!"

I’m a 23 female and I’ve been wanting to seek mental health help for a couple of years now, ~~does anyone know any good doctor who cares?~~

For the past few years I’ve been feeling very sad most of the time, I’ve lost interest in many things that made me happy in the past, like reading and writing and playing the piano, I can’t get through these things easily. I used to be a really good student, I would remember what I read very easily, for the past few years I’ve been struggling to even start studying, my grades are falling down and I’m barely passing, I love what I do, but as soon as I stop, it’s hard to get back to doing what I do.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past too, not too long ago, I’ve thought about cutting my wrists, hanging myself, overdosing on expired medicine, jumping from the window, stabbing myself with a pair of scissors, these are all thoughts, I’m too scared to even try.

I feel guilt about everything, I’ve been crying a lot lately regardless of my menstrual cycle, I’m always scared that I’ll receive news about a family member dying, I’ve had a few panic attacks, one was even during an exam in front of everyone which made me feel humiliated, I’ve hated myself on and off, I don’t like myself most days, I’ve had mental breakdowns, last time it was around 7 months ago and I couldn’t control myself and just screamed at my mom at the top of my voice and I didn’t feel like I’m the one who’s saying all these things, I try to stop and think about controlling myself, but during those times I always feel paranoid, and get severely insecure that I’m unwanted and never loved. 

I’m sick and tired of feelings this way, ~~and I do want to seek help, that’s why I’m making this post, please, if you know a good doctor,~~ I just need help

When I was in middle school, the doctor prescribed zinc stress tablets because I was dealing with anxiety that always made me dizzy during school &amp; I would end up calling my mom to pick me up and then proceed to feel guilty because the dizziness stops. I stopped taking the tablets a few months after prescription because I thought I felt better and never took anything for all these years. 

I feel like my world is falling apart, my grades are shit, I am passing, but seeing my percentage makes me feel like shit, when I’m studying, I remember and understand the things I’m reading, even when practicing, I know what I’m doing. When I solve past exams I know the right answers for most questions &amp; feel proud, but during the actual exam, I fuck things up and end up with a grade just barely passing.

I’m a senior in a college of medicine, I’m a few months away from my MD exam, I don’t have any motivation to start studying, I think about it and make plans for it, but never get to opening the book, and if I do, I can’t bring myself to read and study.

When I go to the hospital for the rotations, I love it so much, I love how we have to figure out what’s going on, and knowing what to do and which medication is the most appropriate, I love going to the clinic these days and take history from patients or see the clinical features and make a diagnosis, or when we discuss the patient with the doctor and see where I went wrong and what I did right, I love simulations so dearly and they always make me feel like a real doctor who’s capable of taking care of the people seeking help. Yet with all that, I can’t stop feeling guilty and scared that I’ll fuck things up.

I feel helpless most days, I wake up late, stay in bed for a while, sometimes even hours, get up, eat, watch Netflix or something, daydream a lot, feel guilty that I’m not studying, go to bed, sometimes cry before going to sleep, cycle repeats.

I’m so sick of this, I want to feel motivated, I want to feel capable and confident, I always thought that I might have bipolar disorder or depression since high school, I have a good support system which’s my family and my best friend who is the most wonderful person in the world, I feel guilty that I even feel this way when they always support me, I try to support them as much as I can but I don’t want to be inadequate.

I sometimes want the world to stop for a day, so I can catch up and sort my shit out, but I can’t and I feel helpless, and I can’t feel helpless anymore because I’m about to graduate &amp; be an intern during a global pandemic."

Aka 13k pre-tax. Also, does anyone know if they will reduce bay area salary down to 8.2k if it goes remote or reduce the stipend like MS did/does?

AFAIK this is significantly higher than F/G and much higher than Apple/MS (I believe apple pays so-so for swe) not to mention most unicorns like stripe. Roblox has better base salary but if you include the stipend amzn is king.

Edit: and no, just to clarify, this is neither a humblebrag nor is it written to make anyone feel bad about their internship TC. Nor am I implying amzn is the be all end all of internships or anything of the sort.

2nd edit: i went thru levels.fyi and the only tech company internship that may or may not pay more from there is indeed at Austin, which is 10.4k + housing and transportation. There are some companies that come close though. And ofc there may be other companies that increase intern salaries like amzn did this year but with the pandemic and recession, i'm guessing those companies are far and few between."

jpjj65,1,2020-11-06,Do I move to take a job in the middle of rural America with no other leads or should I wait?,Beeg_Boi_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jpjj65/do_i_move_to_take_a_job_in_the_middle_of_rural/,"Need advice for a job position in the heartland of the US.

Thanks for any advice in advanced. 

So here’s the situation. I (24/M) got laid off back in the spring due to Covid and have been job search since. I’ve since moved back home to save money and am looking in the eastern/southeastern parts of the US for jobs. (I’m from a border state to the north and south) I’ve worked in automotive and aerospace as these are extensions of my hobbies so this is also what I have searching for. 

I recently had a recruiter reach out to me about a company in Nebraska and set up a few interviews and actually an on-site visit. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to expand where I’m looking and possibly a go into a different industry. Everyone at the company seems nice, the position itself is somewhat interesting, and the benefits are what I would expect with my background as an engineer. It would be a great learning experience but is it worth it when you’re not that interested with the industry?

I have a few issues though. Location is a huge one. It’s very rural and the town is only about 20k people. (It’s about 1.5hrs from Omaha and &gt;1hr from Lincoln.) I went to college in a midsized city and had my first job out of graduation in another midsized city, both around 3/400k. I enjoy a somewhat city feel to be able to keep things interesting but not too big so that you can get out into nature on the outskirts when possible. I’ve lived in small towns before but they were for internships and knew I’d be out in a few months. 

I feel like I could keep searching and find something with the same benefits and be a notable company, as I have with my past jobs, but I’m unsure. 

Have any of you had this dilemma and/or what kind of advice would you give to someone in my position? I’m sure I’ve left out some info so I’ll answer any questions you have. 

TLDR: Do I move to the middle of nowhere for a job when I don’t have other leads at the moment?"

I'm stuck with a hard choice because I'm also doing second/ final round interviews at better companies such as Optiver and Cloudflare, and I've been doing well on OAs for other companies as well. But I will hear back from these companies far later than next Friday, and getting an offer is definitely uncertain.

I want to decline the offer at optum and keep trying for other internships, but I'm worried that I won't find another offer, especially given the current state of the market and job searching, and I really don't want to be stuck without an internship for summer 2021. 

What should I do? Take the offer? Decline it and hope my other interviews go well? 

Also, is there any way I can negotiate for an extension even though they said no initially?

i feel absolutely zero motivation now that november 1st happened. i didn't even apply to that many 11/1 earlies (4 and one of them is northeastern (bless northeastern and their lack of supplements)) but i feel so drained. i feel so apathetic about everything, and i'm trying to get myself motivated but the election &amp; regular schoolwork is not helping :// this whole process feels like i'm running a marathon, and each deadline feels like the finish line but every time i reach it, the finish line is moved another mile. i'm sick and tired of the constant stress mode i have to be in, and i haven't even talked to my friends in a while. things are just sucking a lot, and i wish i can finish this without having to go into regulars.

i applied to mit ea, which has been my dream school for most of high school, and my confidence in my application is either at -5828493 or 80 all the time. i really want to get in but knowing how many extraordinary ppl from just my school are applying makes me feel shit ngl. i tried my best w my application, and i know i should try to not think about my lack of control in this whole process but it's so hard knowing that you don't measure up to a lot of the other applicants. i'm dreading the mit decision date, and statistically, i would most likely carry my false sense of hope in getting accepted until march to be utterly disappointed. this shit sucks. i tried my best but i feel so incompetent?? like i didn't know doing research and internships as a high schooler was a thing until last year lmao

this whole system is so flawed, and i probably shouldn't blame myself for trying to build a perfect application throughout my four years but damnit i'm slowly inching towards that self blame!!! i just hope that my application reader finds some likable quality in me to advocate for me in front of the other aos lol

ok even with that statement, you can see the major flaw in this system? like as applicants, we're supposed to package ourselves into a perfectly likable and qualified applicant just for an application reader. four years of work, and it all comes down to how quirky and likable we sound in short answers or essays. i loathe this whole thing w all my heart &lt;3

i need to be more optimistic but it's v hard when you're drained of motivation and only rejection from your absolute dream school awaits! i just want it to be post 1/1 already goddamnit

jpmxgn,0,2020-11-07,[KY] Should I bring this potential harassment/discrimination to HR?,croweye0,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/jpmxgn/ky_should_i_bring_this_potential/,"Hello,

I am an intern at a mental health clinic. My supervisor and I...do not get along very well. She is rather abrasive and everyone just kinda accepts her rudeness and everyone loves her. Except me.

She is constantly telling me to be more ""genuine,"" but despite the fact that I am, I find it astounding that she does not see the irony when she has given me little reason to be comfortable being genuine with her. In my very first meeting with her, she asked (in a clearly pejorative tone): ""Do you have many friends?""  I remember after a conversation with her, I mentioned it to one of my coworkers who said: ""yeah feedback from her can be pretty tough. I cry all the time!"" I have various other complaints about her poor ability to give feedback but I doubt that's 100% relevant here.

The most egregious thing has to do with prejudice. They had a session with a trans client who just found a trans partner. She unknowingly said several problematic things during the session, like ""so if youre a girl who wants to be a boy, and they are the same, how does that work?"" that the client laughed off that made me cringe hardcore in the corner. After the session, she calls up the old therapist of this partner and says: ""If they want to pretend like they have penises and call themselves gay men, more power to them! Maybe I can call myself skinny now!"" There were 2 other people in the room who said nothing (and who I expected to say nothing). I knew I couldn't just ignore such a clear ethical violation, so I asked her if she would like ""some resources to address some of the questions \[she\] was posing in-session."" She said: ""always!"" So I drafted an email basically quoting portions of the APA practice guidelines for trans and GNC clients that addressed the misconceptions her remark represented. I ran it by my professor, and he said it was great. She...did not response positively. I did not make it clear that it was in direct response to her remark; she thought it was disrespectful because ""she knew all of that already."" I clarified my intention and she said that she needs a ""safe space to vent without censorship, otherwise \[she'll\] be a less effective therapist."" She tried really hard to get me to agree with her, but I hesitated, and said: ""but it was still transphobic."" she then said ""I dont have a transphobic bone in my body"" and also ""I grew up in klan country."" Then, another employee interrupted and supervisor started venting about a different client's situation. She said some irreverent things in frustration that didn't bother me, but she would turn to me several times and say: ""you see that, croweye, that was a joke,"" as if to demean me as an insensitive prick to another staff person. It should also be noted that I am non-binary. She doesn't know this (she knows I'm gay, but not a demi-guy), but it made me feel flat out unwelcome after already feeling uncomfortable around her.

She gets all the other therapists to report back to her about me, so I know I can't ask them for their thoughts because she'll just end up hearing about it, and besides they all worship the ground she walks on. I have no doubt that she will critique my ""lack of genuineness"" and lack of effort to build a connection with her on my evaluations once this internship is finished in a few weeks. Luckily, my professors backs me up 100%, but I want to know if this would be worth reporting to HR as harassment or hostile work environment or something along those lines. The employee handbook states that:

""verbal or physical conduct that may constitute discriminatory harassment includes, but is not limited to, actions, words, flirtations, advances, propositions, verbal abuse, jokes, verbal commentaries, or degrading words used to describe an individual based on an individual's sex, race, age, religion, disability, national origin, veteran status or other legally protected characteristic...Because some conduct may be considered offensive by some and not by others, you should, if you are comfortable doing so, advise the person engaging in the objectionable conduct that you are offended by the conduct or comments.""

I feel like I did everything right, but I'm honestly just unsure of what to do. I am just worried that, if I report it and it turns out that this isn't really significant enough to do anything about, I will have unnecessarily burned bridges with the people I do like that are there. Would appreciate insight on this\~"

I'm hoping to get a Masters in CS in Fall '21 to transition into a tech-related career in industry.

I'm trying to get an honest picture of where my chances lie for grad admissions, and would appreciate any input. I'm most interested in CS bridge programs, or programs that don't require a formal CS undergraduate background (such as NYU Tandon, UChicago, NEU Align, Cornell Tech, UCL Conversion, etc.). I only recently found my passion for CS after taking my first course this year.

**Work Experience:**

\- **Teaching Assistant** for the majors-stream introductory CS course at my university since this term (\~2.5 months, current)

\- **Research Assistant** within data science at a university-affiliated hospital research institute under supervision of two professors (\~2.5 months, current), self-learn Python on the job

\- Intern at a venture capital firm as an **Investment Analyst** (4 months)

\- **President** of my faculty's student society, generally very involved with the community since my first-year and also sit on committee of my city's Board of Trade

**Grades and Test Scores:**

\- **GPA**: Not so stellar, B+ 76% (I'm very worried about this), mostly weighed down by my Economics courses and 2 math courses that I didn't do well in 2nd year during a term where I had too much on my plate (failed one, and got a C- on another). On the other hand, I took linear algebra last term and got an A+ to try to make up for it, and have gotten an A in my previous calculus class. There has been an upwards trajectory since 2019 and my CS course average is around 87%. I'm confident I can get my GPA to 77-78% by the end of this current semester and hopefully up to 79-80% by graduation.

\- **GRE:** 167Q, 164V, 5.5AW (would this save my GPA?)

**LORS:**

\- I'm confident I can get at least 1 strong LOR from a professor, most likely with 2 good/average ones from another prof and a previous supervisor.

Thank you so much - I really appreciate any advice and any tips!"

The only other offer I have right now is a data engineering internship for a smaller company with less pay/benefits. However, this seems to be more aligned with setting me up for a career in data engineering.

Any insight as to whether I should still accept the AWS internship? Is there any flexibility there as far as where it may take me? Do you think it still aligns well with my career goals of getting into data engineering?
I know it's just an internship but itd be nice to get some insight to make a good decision."

The course is going great, and I am currently working on it during the evenings and weekends while employed full time (I spent the last year teaching myself as much Computer Science as possible, so the first few months of the course have been grand for me).

I'd really like to make the shift to working as a software engineer as soon as possible, so I was wondering what criteria I should use to judge when I am ready to apply for jobs?

Also, it appears that most graduate job applicants have a few internships under their belts. I was wondering if anyone has any experience here with transitioning into Software Engineering while working full time and how they managed to get that crucial internship experience. Working full time in an unrelated field complicates things, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."

The videos are supposed to be educational, and inspire kids to pursue higher education. At each place, we ask if there is a young person just starting out in their career who we can interview to generate interest in their STEM career.

All well and good, but this last week, our interviewee was really timid, spoke quietly and warned us beforehand that she ‘doesn’t do well on camera’. She stuttered through the entire interview, but really found her voice toward the end, and spoke rather passionately (though still quietly and still stuttering) about following your passion and not being discouraged because the adults in your life don’t get what you want to do.

My mentor said afterwards that the interview is unusable because the interviewee is ‘not engaging’ and isn’t planning to use the film. This sits badly with me. As a moderate introvert myself, I think it is not inclusive to see nothing but cheery extroverted confident people gushing about how amazing their job is. A quick Google search showed me that stuttering is listed as a disability under ADA guidelines. 

So... is she promoting ableist stereotypes of who makes a good recruiter, or just being true to the harsh reality that charisma sells; that kids will not understand or look up to someone who is ‘not good on camera’?

Which says something because we have sex anywhere from 3 to 7 times a week.

It’s also destroying my emotional state one/two week(s) a month.

I simply fall apart and feel terrible and lonely and needy and moody and my anxiety SKY ROCKETS.

I (28, 2 kids) don’t feel supported by my boyfriend (25, 0 kids) during these times. I want to make excuses for him because I love him so so deeply and I do not doubt for a moment that he loves me in return. I also want to make excuses for him because I have had past issues with communication but I can’t help feeling that he is quick to accept my sacrifices but isn’t quick to reciprocate sometimes.

To put this into perspective: I drive up to see him every almost every single time (30 min each way) because my parents whom I live with disapprove of him simply because of his age. I also pay for a lot of dates because I know he’s finishing his degree and I want to do the things we’re doing and places we are going. He hates this vehemently so I’ve decided to finally ease up and we go 50/50 on most dates now. Over the course of our relationship though... I’ve probably spent anywhere from 8-12k on our dates. He makes me feel like I am truly loved and his personality is childish and fun and full of life but serious when it comes to our future together. I know he is a ways off from that stable job. I don’t mind supporting our time together while he does an internship and works part time.

I’m not looking for grand gestures when it comes to support while I’m emotionally fragile due to the birth control but ...  just an acknowledgment that the week before I have it and during is very difficult for me and that he cares enough to DO something to show me that. I see other women getting chocolate bars, back rubs, spa treats, extra attention, flowers... but maybe tiktok and my other girlfriends are hyping up how well they’re treated... but that doesn’t mean I’m okay with lowering my standards. It’s not only the lack of monetary shows of affection while I feel I am pretty consistently doing cute things for him. 

My taking the birth control allows him and I both the luxury of safe safe but it comes at a serious cost to me.

The last time I got really upset and emotionally frazzled before a rough period ... he seemed agitated with my inability to communicate what I needed .. and actually told me to “go home and collect myself.” I felt so stupid and uncomfortable and silly and small. He has apologized since.

We made up from this fight but it stuck with me deeply. 2 more periods have passed since this fight and with each one I feel nervous to divulge how awful I feel in case it bothers him. I’m walking on eggshells. 

I want more from him in these ways but I don’t know how to communicate that. I’ve had really terrible abusive relationships in the past and it’s made me so scared to speak up for myself. 

I’m also scared he will turn it into “I’m the worst boyfriend.” which he does sometimes when I point things out and I end up feeling so guilty for bringing it up. 

I want to approach him without making him feel bad.
I want to approach him without de emasculating him.
I want more support.

HOW DO I APPROACH HIM? 😭"

I'll have my bachelor degree complete by july/2021 and i was focused on building my career towards a finance area. ( I was an M&amp;A intern).

After my internship,  I realised that I didn't like the work environment in the financial market, but I liked to study about the topic. During that time, I chatting with my professor and reading/studying a little about data analysis and data science I'm really getting into it, as well as having a lot of synergy with the financial market (in case I work with it again). 

I am planning to do another degree in data science / statistics. Do you think I'm making a good choice? 

some observations: 
- The university in my country is very prestigious worldwide and I have no problems with money and have no more 4 ~ 5 years of my life studying. (I think I like to learn and study in general _ I'm 22yo) 

- I value the quality of life more and have a greater ""balance"" of my time. (I know it's unreal, but in the financial market, the quality of life  tends to 0)."

I have been looking to change careers to software engineering. Right now I work as a customer support rep. I have a bachelors degree in math and I took some CS classes while in college. I accepted this customer support role right out of college to make sure I had a source of income after graduating, and now I kind of struggle to improve my skills when it comes to anything cs related.  In college I took an intro class on Python, Java, and SQL. I also took a DS&amp;A class using Java, and OOP using Java.

I have no internship experience but I do have a couple of projects I was able to work on for my team at my current company. I am super lost and do not know anyone who is a software engineer to help me. When asking software engineers at my company for help, they look at me funny and refer me to improving my skills by grinding out problems on leetcode or hackerrank. 

\-The first project was a data mining project where I had to write a SQL query to provide data to show my account manager that we were having problems with a specific customer. 

\-The next project I wrote a Python program that wraps around a SQL query to print broken down information that is easy for a customer to understand based on the data that was pulled from the query. 

For awhile I was grinding through leetcode and hackerrank problems but got tired of doing that because I was not landing interviews for companies I was applying for.  I want to work on an independent project  because I feel limited to what I can work on at my company. I just do not know what kind of projects will help me stand out and help me land an interview.  I appreciate any tips and advice!! Thank you in advance!"

Of course ideally I'd just get a temporary position such as an internship but unfortunately ones for graduates are not super easy to come by and are usually for summer 2021 anyway..

My question is: is there another common option for people like me in my situation? I don't know much at all about contracted work but could that be the way to go? I'd like to avoid joining a company and leaving after a bit as it won't look great on my CV and I don't want to ""punish"" a company for hiring me but it seems that I might need to end up doing that.

So my question is twofold: Does anyone have advice for short term cs jobs and how negatively does staying at a job 6 months look on your resume? How about 9?"

Thank you for your overwhelming support these past few weeks with my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/jftc2z/to_anyone_still_considering_pharmacy_at_uoft_or/). As I'm sure you are aware, the licensing exam was once again delayed with &lt; 48 hour notice - you can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/jpsaop/uoft_pharmacy_class_of_2020_has_licensing_exam/) and share to support the cause.

So, what is this about? This post is likely my last, and I am writing it to call out the utter incompetency, tone-deafness, and shameful response of our advocating body (OPA) and UofT Faculty of Pharmacy.

**In response to my post, OPA Executive Vice President** [Allan Malek](https://twitter.com/OPAProfAff) **said unlicensed grads are a ""hot commodity"" and ""can make some money while waiting to be licensed. It's better than sitting at home.""**

**After my initial post, an article was published in the Canadian Healthcare Network, where I was** ***accused of spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories*** **on social media about the profession of pharmacy by the OPA and the reporter**. This article is conveniently locked to the public, but I have attached screenshots courtesy of my classmates in this post, along with Allan Malek's comments.

Allan Malek has been with OPA for 12 years, and from his response, I can clearly see why our profession has fallen to the state it is. He is supposed to be advocating for our profession and the value of our contribution as front-line healthcare workers - but instead, he showed absolute disrespect for it by telling grads that our services are worth only a few dollars above minimum wage, and that accepting this is better than sitting at home. **Allan Malek, as someone who hasn't worked in a community pharmacy since 2004, you should be ashamed of yourself. I urge pharmacists across Ontario to request that you be disposed from your position.**

[Justin Bates](https://twitter.com/justjbates), CEO of OPA, did not speak up until 3 hours ago when pharmacy grads finally took their concerns public (our class reached out to them in May, with no avail). I should note that Mr. Bates, despite being the CEO of OPA, is not a pharmacist and has never practiced in a healthcare setting. I think we can see a pattern here that those closest to advocating for us, are well removed from our profession.

We are told that we are capable of practicing at our full scope, but only for a fraction of our value. Going back to Allan Malek's words, we are only a hot commodity when our wages are $15/hr (I mean, it's ""better than sitting at home,"" but this sentiment doesn't extend to us getting a provisional licensure, as that is suddenly not a priority in the face of COVID.

Before I sign off, let me call on Dean [Lisa Dolovich](https://twitter.com/LisaDolovich), who swiftly informed community chains during March when COVID peaked, that pharmacy students have a duty to continue practicing for free to serve the public, but her tone suddenly changed when it comes to the safety of the setting in which we can be licensed. **Dean Dolovich, your concern for safety seems to extend only in unpaid environments where pharmacy students are taken advantage of. To this day, you still haven't responded to why UofT refused to host licensing exams while the building sat empty.**

Pharmacists, pharmacy interns, and students alike - you need to advocate for yourselves. You shouldn't shut down dissenting opinions and mock whistle blowers; only you can save yourself and the field right now. I applaud everyone who has voiced their concerns and encourage you to continue doing so. I wish you the very best moving forward. Good luck.

**UPDATE:  Please see Allan Malek's updated response here** ([link](https://imgur.com/a/nwgfnew)). Unhappy that we aren't willing to backdown, **he now accuses us of being unprofessional and an embarrassment for exposing our regulatory bodies' hypocrisy (after he called pharmacy grads ""hot commodities"" for the $15/hr wage we can command).** He wants this post to be shut down - if you don't see it here tomorrow, save a copy and please continue to spread the word. *We need to stand up for ourselves in light of Allan Malek's unprofessionalism, and frankly embarrassment to this profession.*

I want to become socially dominant and attract people to magnetically with ease. I want to put in work now improving looks (building my body, taking care of my skin, whitening my teeth, etc.),  practicing Leetcode in my free time to practice for a Software Engineering internship interview, working on socializing religiously by taking notes of interactions to see how I can improve my social skills, getting better at fighting to improve confidence, just do things that make me happy and make my life amazing.

The problem is that taking notes on every interaction and trying to improve started making my social anxiety (which was sm less before) way worse and I started basing a lot of my self worth on how well I did in social interactions (How many ppl like me and how many people I made laugh and how cool I appeared to ppl). Now obviously with this much pressure, I started to shit socially because I was up in my head overanalyzing EVERYTHING. Now I am just focusing on improving myself in other ways and just talking to ppl with no outcome dependence. This is gonna take work to rewire my brain but I can do it! I have the power to change and since I don't like the way I feel and am thinking of myself I am gonna focus on improving in other places of my life.

I still want to build an amazing social circle and be a ""social god/high value man"". Any tips on what I should do now. And have YOU ever went through a similar situation of having too many high expectations?"

jq5zm0,3,2020-11-08,How important is the content of your first post-college job?,cheezyhamster,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jq5zm0/how_important_is_the_content_of_your_first/,"Some background, I'm a biochemical engineering senior with undergraduate research in biochemical engineering and an internship in a biotech/pharma industry. I came across a few roadblocks in both of these experiences when it came to more coding-heavy aspects, so I've been taking a Java class and spending a few hours each week doing extra MATLAB.

Even though I only started to take computer programming more seriously recently, I was lucky enough to land a job that could potentially be pretty coding-heavy and it involves things like developing technology, applications, databases, etc for the healthcare industry. The funny thing is, I didn't expect much out of the interview because I knew the other candidates were all computer science students from brand name schools. They thought my answers to a technical skills test (which I thought I bombed) were ""creative"" and I somehow got the offer, and it pays well with benefits.

The minor issue is, it's not very chemical-engineer-y heavy and my potential end goal is doing R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals and finding a cure or developing medicine, that kind of stuff. So if I take on a job that is leaning more heavily towards what one would expect of a software developer, would that pigeonhole me into that area? The job *is* in an industry that I prefer (healthcare/pharma), and I do plan on getting a Master's or even a PhD maybe a couple years down the road depending on where I want to go next. Does the first post-college job heavily impact the trajectory of the rest of your career, or can I still expect to move around as long as I keep on learning new skills?

Perhaps this might sound immature to say, for someone who's going into an adult world, but one of the reasons I took on a chemical engineering degree was because I heard it could be potentially applied to many different industries and positions. I kind of wanted to hop around and get a taste of a couple different jobs, explore what the world has to offer, before settling down on something. Would doing so be unfeasible?

TLDR: Chemical engineering senior, preferred industry in pharma/healthcare, want to do R&amp;D and hands-on engineering in the future. First job is a more software programming-heavy role, but still in my preferred industry. If I ever want to switch to a different type of job or industry, will the work content of my first job affect me drastically?"

The reason I am terrified is because I am going to a new city knowing absolutely no one and knowing that my college friends will quickly turn into long-lost acquaintances that I will probably only see when I'm visiting their area or for 10 mins if they attend my wedding.

I know that I will be able to make tons of **acquaintances** at my new city, but what I am looking for is lifelong friends that I can trust, invite to my wedding to stand beside me, a regular group of friends that I can invite over, etc. I fear after college, it is going to be extremely hard to find friends like these as my older peers have been struggling as well.

About two years ago, when my family was visiting our home country, my dad said I should get the double eyelid surgery. This was the summer before my senior year in college. He told me that I would have an easier time landing jobs if I had bigger eyes.

I'm an engineer and at this point I had already finished two internships at a FAANG company. I went to a prestigious university. His implication that my appearance would affect my employment was completely insulting and ridiculous.

Now, I do not want to boast and not that this even matters in big scope, but I believe I am attractive, I have dated professional athletes and receive attention on my social media and in public from men every day. However, growing up, I always believed I was too fat to be pretty and that my face was ugly. My body has never been unhealthy by obesity standards but I am chubbier than the ideal woman from my culture. Growing up, as early as I can remember (I remember my weight from when I was 5-6 years old), my parents always commented on my weight and I was bullied at school and by my relatives (I have avoided meeting any of them since I've become an adult because of these memories). As a result, I had an extremely low self-esteem growing up. However through college + more interactions with others I grew my confidence and love who I am and how I look now.

It took so much work for me to be happy about myself despite the constant criticism in my life. So when somebody threatens my still fragile confidence, it makes me extremely angry thinking about the work I have put into loving myself; all the more when it comes from someone like my parents. I would personally never go for cosmetic procedures because for me, who I am is the most important and I won't change that. It is core to me. Even to this day, my mom never fails to comment on my weight. The first greeting is always ""you've lost weight"" or ""you've gained weight"". They really don't think  much of this, I think they must not understand how traumatizing all of this was for me.

I just don't understand why I was always told to change myself and never taught to love and cherish who I am. To know that when my parents see my face they see imperfections, and that my hard work that I put into my career is negligible for them to suggest ""surgery for employment"" is too painful to me."

The other jobs I looked at all needed knowledge of SQL or some other language which I've never used. Out of all the jobs I looked at, this is the one I feel I'm most qualified for and am most willing to work for.

I've no experience with Java EE or Hibernate, but Java has always been my favorite language and I'm motivated to learn. One of the main tasks of this job is the further development of existing software modules such as the carrying out of update strategies. This is something I've never done independently, but I did do very well in my Object-Oriented Design and Development class.

I'm a quick learner and have recommendations from my internship supporting that.

Some questions I have are:

What can I do to maximize my chance of landing the job? What are some good things to say? A friend told me once to pretend like you know more than you do and that it's difficult for the interviewers to tell the difference. I don't really believe him though, and am planning on being honest.

From the listing: ""Knowledge of testing and experience in programming with Java FX and C ++ are just as desirable as knowledge of connecting databases""

I've never used Java FX either. I'm good in C++ though, just haven't used it in a while. I've never done anything with databases, but like I said I'm a quick learner and am willing to struggle to get up to speed in whatever I need to.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

jqe6l5,1,2020-11-08,"I think I might be on the spectrum, though one psychiatrist has dismissed it as overthinking on my part. If I actually am, is there any use of getting an adult diagnosis in India? Or will it make things even more restrictive?",TenRoadsDiverged,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jqe6l5/i_think_i_might_be_on_the_spectrum_though_one/,"I have been assessed as showing some schizoid traits (introverted nature, inability/lack of interest to connect with others beyond a superficial level, muted reactions, in general tending to keep events/thoughts to myself and often not sharing even with immediate family because I think it is unnecessary and often getting scolded for this) though not severe enough for a personality disorder, plus anxiety which has been present and increasing since a few years now due to severe career confusion and indecision and fear of becoming professionally irrelevant.

There are a few reasons I think I might be on the spectrum, listed below. I know that self-assessment is not recommended. I had tried discussing some of these points with a psychiatrist recently, but he dismissed them as overthinking without going through all of it, and also said that even if I was on the spectrum, 'the problems end around the adolescent/early teenage years and don't suddenly come up in your early 30s', despite my mentioning that confusion/physical awkwardness/asocial nature were always around since childhood. This was not the same person who had done the schizoid/anxiety assessment a few months ago. I have had issues with depression and have taken meds briefly because of some severe stress I faced a few years ago, but multiple therapists since then have pretty much focused on the depression aspect and not really looked into the pre existing issues (except for one of those generic suggestions like making pros vs cons lists).

**Asocial nature, solo activities:** Always immersed in things like sketching, reading or playing with blocks/action figures as a child. Also spend to use quite some time reading books and illustrated books on how different machines work and other 'general knowledge' related things. Used to go for some activities for 2-3 years around age 10-12, then football for quite a few years, but rather than making friends, some of these activities turned into brief obsessions (horses for example was a pretty strong one for a few months, so was writing down lists of players in different teams). Playing with a couple of friends/myself often involved creating modified scenarios from cartoons etc around age 11-12. For a brief couple of years in college and just before, I was \*very\* outgoing, made a lot of friends, but ended up being ignored by pretty much all of them as I didn't try to restrict myself to a single group (maybe I was trying to fit in with too many different sets of people?) - and also hated the fact that they couldn't even show simple courtesy, for example of informing me of changes in plans we had made (where the f\*\*\* is that 'empathy' which everyone exemplifies?), not even occasionally giving me a phone call (why should I ALWAYS be the one who makes the call?). Have no problems with meeting relatives/participating with others in large groups/functions etc, but never feel like talking too much to others. Now am pretty much asocial and typically have no problems with it except when I constantly get talked down about not being social enough and it being a major reason for my career issues (as if the constant misguidance and invalidation of my, in hindsight, reasonable thoughts by you had no role to play in it).

**Interests - sketching:** Frequently drew only a small number of specific objects as a small child (around age 3), then some specific vehicles, then planes (after my first ever air journey), then trains, then 3-4 selected animals, in phases, and always found it difficult to draw anything apart from the 'in-phase' thing. Always used to get a lot of praise because of how accurately I was able to sketch these things. Lost interest in sketching after appearing for a couple of exams and getting decent grades in them. Tried to restart after my 12th, did it for a little while (not even a few months) and gave up again because I felt I just couldn't go beyond some very limited things.

**Interests - maps:** Reading and drawing maps from atlases as a kid, several flags and capitals/cities memorized, creating imaginary ones, now surfing Google Maps and often looking for public transport routes in metro cities. I have lived in multiple metro cities for small durations (work, internships etc) and can still remember names and approximate locations of areas I have never ever visited.

**Interests - trains:** As a kid I used to get extremely engrossed in railway routes and timetables, and even today am familiar with names and approximate locations of several places and trains. Also interested in the actual trains themselves, with the interest taking up an added angle as I studied electrical engineering. I still sometimes watch random train videos etc.

**Others:** If something new interests me, I can suddenly immerse myself into it for a few days and then I quickly lose interest in it and give it up. A couple of psychiatrists have said that changing interests is quite normal, but I am concerned about the intensity when they are 'on' and the rate at which they wear off, so am a bit worried about my inability to sustain things in the longer run (especially about careers). Sometimes there is this impulsiveness when I suddenly want to do a lot of things, start off with a number of them and give up on all of them. But some interests, such as trains, maps and even an interest in languages/wordplay, have always lingered on. Have always liked music, but right now it is restricted to only a few selected songs/artistes. Haven't really 'updated' beyond the early 2010s.

**Physical/body related:** There are some body movements and habits - a long-term one in scratching/fondling my scalp, a phase in childhood when I was frequently scolded for blinking my eyes in an unusual manner, a brief phase when I used to tense some of my facial muscles, and most recent ones in the form of abdominal muscle/shoulder tensing/vibrating. The abdominal twitching was noted as 'fidgeting behaviour' and formed part of the anxiety diagnosis. Around age 12-14, many people used to remark that I walk with a bit of a limp, with the remarks and probable motion defect reducing to much more subtle levels around college time. Sometimes I find myself in awkward positions, for example when I am doing some work and have to handle multiple objects, I sort of get confused in figuring out how to hold which object, how to adjust multiple things - it takes me too long to realise that I can simply keep one/two objects aside for the time being and focus on the rest. My handwriting is poor and messy and I sometimes feel awkward when handling tools, but I never faced any problems while handling tiny Lego blocks.

**Confusion/indecisiveness/double checking/overthinking/time management:** I always feel I don't know enough and want to find out more. Constant career indecision is now troubling me more as I have been introduced to many more possibilities, but given my age it is also a question of whether anyone would be give me a chance (already rejected for entry level jobs, before and throughout Covid) without a massive pay cut (already a somewhat low salary, though sufficient; but non-software entry level pay scales are \*abysmal\*) as it is of my willingness to try out something. When writing an email I always think a lot about my words, and sometimes need to ask another person if they think it's OK even for simple issues. I have been told on a few occasions that I am not able to express my thoughts clearly, and I do get confused and fumble under pressure or when suddenly put into the spotlight, though many also say that I make solid, brief and powerful statements when I do say something. There are often situations when I get scolded because there is a simple, common sense solution that I wasn't able to think of; there are also occasions when I myself question why I did what I did despite that lingering feeling saying that something seems off. These things often result in wastage of time, which brings me to time management issues and of late, wanting to multitask and not being able to accomplish any of the multiple tasks as a result, then again feeling the need to 'cool down' and losing more time in the process. This issue was noted in the assessment as 'problems with time management at work due to large number of interests', which is not the case as career indecision is the only thing causing me problems with career, while actually having no/minimal impact on my work output. I sometimes find myself lost in fantasizing over what might have been had things turned out differently at some select points in my life. I face several situations where I feel the need to check, double check and recheck, tending to sometimes miss out things and panic at the last moment regardless.

\*Realised that I spent over two hours writing and revising all this\*

Now if I do happen to be on the spectrum, is there any point in trying to get evaluated and get an official diagnosis **in India**? If I do get diagnosed as being on the spectrum, what kind of options would I have in terms of support, careers etc?"

3. **Keep the restaurant experience or no?** I haven't included it on jobs I've applied to before.

Text from original post:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hi all.  
&gt;  
&gt;I graduated from a data analytics coding boot camp in July and am looking to start a career in Data Analytics. Ideally I'd like something less corporate - education, journalism, or nonprofit sector. But I'll take anything to get my foot in the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've applied to about 50 jobs since May. Out of those I've heard back from 2. One was a state job that I made it the final round on but was rejected. The other I had an initial interview but during the interview I was told that the position was being reworked internally and they had reached out because they wanted to shortlist me for the re-worked position when it became available. That was a couple months ago. I've also been contacted by a couple of recruiters but wasn't contacted again after our initial talk.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My background:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I graduated with a humanities B.A. in 2014. I double majored and double minored and graduated 7 credits shy of a earning two bachelors. I never did  internships because I couldn't afford to work for free and I had to maximize earnings with limited time. Not uncommon. I worked in higher-end restaurants for nearly 10 years eventually becoming a bar manager.   
&gt;  
&gt;When I worked nights as a bartender, I used my days to explore options in local museums and non-profits, working multiple volunteer and part-time jobs until getting a full time job at a private liberal arts college library. I want to do Data Analytics because it combines all the things I love about library/archival work - it's all about creatively categorizing and analyzing information and making that information usable and available to those who want it. I firmly believe that librarians are the OG data analysts. That's what I've chosen to highlight. But to excel in the library world and make more than a high school teacher's salary, you have to have several degrees and an impossible amount of experience. I've decided I can't afford that.  
&gt;  
&gt;My career experience is a little jumbled and the path I've taken thus far isn't very straight-forward. I'm worried I've pinned myself as an unfocused career hopper. Or, possibly worse, that the job experience I've highlighted makes it look like I'm used to cushy, posh, slow paced jobs when that's completely untrue.  
&gt;  
&gt;The coding boot camp I went through is one of those private companies who partners with universities so they can put their name on the certificate. I took it for free since I worked for the university. I've used some of their career services to make this resume, but want to get outside advice!"

I graduated w/ a B.S. in Mass Communication in 2014. Outside of a short internship during my final semester, I have never worked in the communications field. I would not exactly say that it’s my passion. I do enjoy some concepts, such as writing and graphic design. The reason I went into it was because it was the only thing I could see myself doing as a career, but I was 18 years old and naive. I can see myself possibly being happy in an advertising, marketing, or PR role. However, now that I’ve been out of school for over 6 years, and have extremely limited professional experience, I feel really out of touch with the communications world, and I don’t realistically know who would be interested in hiring me. I have the piece of paper saying I obtained a degree, but basically no experience. 

After nearly a decade of retail and food service, I currently have a decent paying job in manufacturing ($50,000/yr in a Midwestern city). It has long hours and it’s exhausting, but it sustains me for the time being and the benefits are really good. I’ve been doing that for about a year and a half.

All that said, I just feel like I need something that’s going to be not as hard on my body in the long run. I just don’t know what my options realistically are. Realistically, I can’t work a 12-hr/day physically demanding job for the rest of my life, and I just feel like if I don’t get the ball rolling now, I may one day be 40 or 50 years old and have next to no options to get out of manufacturing. Plus, there’s the looming risk of automation. 

I really enjoy problem-solving and being creative (hence, the communications degree). I’ve searched for different jobs within my field of study, but so far almost all lower-level communications jobs that I’m qualified for would not sustain me, quite frankly. I’ve seen jobs asking for 1-3 years of experience, and the starting pay is $12-$15/hr. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a catch-all degree. I know a little bit about a few things, but not a lot about one thing. 

I’ve thought about going back to school or exploring other career-advancing options like getting into a trade through a union or obtaining certificates that would maybe help me in the technology field, but my biggest concerns with that are:

- Having the time while also working full time in order to live (pay rent, pay other bills, etc). It’s much easier to pursue a degree when you’re 18-22 years old and living with your parents or taking out financial aid to live on-campus. I’m nearly done paying off my first student loan bills, so it’s a bit scary to dive into those again.

- The risk of going to school to get a certificate or another degree and not finding a job in that field, and feeling like it was not worth the money and time spent if it did not get me closer to a career I actually wanted to be in. 

Now that I’m older and have some more experience in different jobs, I feel like I have somewhat of a clearer picture of what the process of job searching, resume writing, and interviews are like. At 18 years old, I was naive and listened to everyone who told me that it did not matter what I studied, as long as I got a 4-year degree. I wasn’t 100% sure I wanted to go into communications. Academically, I did well. I graduated with honors. What I did not graduate with was real world experience, which is necessary in pretty much any field above low-level manufacturing and retail haha. Basically, I got good grades but I didn’t really network, seek out career advice, ask for recommendations, etc. I was there for a diploma and that’s it. If I did go back to school, I would 100% have a different attitude towards all of that. 

Do any of you have recommendations for what I should do? Every time I think of a new career path, Google inevitably tells me the reasons why I should not go into it (low job prospects/over saturation of the market, too many years to actually get to a point where I could get a decent-paying job in that field, etc). I really enjoy analyzing things and solving puzzles—I’m a huge true crime junkie—and so I thought maybe something with tech would be good. Cybersecurity interests me but I understand that I would need to know more about computers as a foundation and then build on that. For instance, I don’t even know how to code. 

TLDR; have a degree in communications but never worked in the field, currently work in manufacturing but looking to get out and find something not as brutal on my body."

How’s the internship search going for y’all? Is it as bad for you as it is for me?

I think covid has really shut the market down. The main reason I’m asking this is because I just received an internship offer and I’m wondering if I should just take it (deadline to decide is this Friday😬) or wait for something at a company I like a little more. 

The company who has given me the offer is in the top 1/3 of my list of companies I’d work for, but it’s not directly in the field I’d like (the company manufactures tools for the automotive  industry, but I’d like to work for a major manufacturer like Ford or Tesla). 

TL;DR: Has the internship search been hard for you during covid?"
jqmish,11,2020-11-08,QA experience will not pidgeon-hole your career if you want to make the switch to development positions,Wroif,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jqmish/qa_experience_will_not_pidgeonhole_your_career_if/,"Hi everyone, 

During the end of my bachelor's in software engineering, I was a bit worried about the future of my career, as I found quite a few posts in here (as well as blog type articles online) talking about how hard is it to make the switch from a QA type position to dev positions. I wanted to take the time to write here to offer a different perspective on the issue that I've seen here. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I've had one development internship, I have worked as a test automation developer (returning from an internship in test automation) for about 2 years part-time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have often heard that people who take those ""QA"" positions were seen as less skilled than people who went to dev positions. I would like to challenge that idea, as I have learned a LOT as a test automation developer. I learned how to work in a professional agile setting, write good quality code that is used ""in production,"" set up/manage and maintain CI environment, and even had the time to hop on some regular dev task to help the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like all of this made me a better Software Engineer that I would have been without this experience. While looking for my next position, having mostly that as professional experience, I had no issues getting responses to my job applications. Right now, I get a response rate of between 10-20% (as in, I get about 1-2 interviews per 10 job applications). 

During interviews, I leverage my experience in test automation as experience learning how to write good quality code, learning to see patterns problem in code that might lead to issues in production, as well it gave me the ability to have a different perspective on the quality of the code that I deliver since I've been part of a QA team. 

Interviewers seem to respond positively to those points, as I had no issues getting offers for ""regular"" dev positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the post seemed a bit humble-braggy, as it was not the point. I was trying to make here that taking a position in test automation is not a career-ender. It will not pigeon-hole you in QA for the rest of your career, and if you know how to talk about this experience during interviews, it can actually be quite valuable to potential employers. I wanted to offer my experience as proof of that. 

Thank you for reading :)"

This is for an analyst, and I’ve seen the general progression to associate, VP, director etc at the bank (my interviewers, for example). 

I was curious - what is a realistic progression for a bachelors only in a role like this? My plan before this was to get a masters or PhD in math/computing but I’m not sure if that’s necessary if I can do similar research work at higher levels in the career (same time career progression as a higher degree)


Additionally, are there any expectations I should expect from a role like this career wise? Will this set me up for any sweet exit ops (preferably in the US)? Is there likelihood for me to fuck up my entire career in the industry by making a big mistake or two?

Thanks for any advice! Just trying not to mess shit up"

Also got my resume reviewed by 12 other people, including senior SWE at these companies and all said my resume is pretty solid for an intern application. At this stage I came up with these options:

1. Apply for new grad for 2022 and take more courses and graduate. If I can't get one at faang, apply a few years down the road.
2. Apply as new grad and if I can't get one, go to grad school and apply as an intern again.

The problem with option 1 is that I heard it becomes impossible to pass experienced interviews as they become increasingly harder. On top of that I don't know how much luck will matter but overall one pro is that I heard they usually give out interviews more often to intermediate/senior positions more often. The problem with option 2 is that seeing how much luck based the application process is, I might be wasting my time and money on schools that I really don't need ( I am not interested in research at all and was planning to do course based masters at my school or online but at this stage, I really don't enjoy the pressure it comes with schoolwork)

What do you think I should do to ramp up my knowledge as a potential hire by the time I graduate?,-PK_Thunder-,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jqoe5i/parttime_online_compsci_student_who_works/,"First off, a couple of facts:

* I'm currently 31 years old in an online Computer Science BA degree in the US that I started this fall. 

* I work full-time as a Application Analyst for a healthcare system in configuring the electronic health record. 

* This is my second bachelor's degree. 

* I'm only able to take 2, sometimes 3 classes at a time and because of this, I'll probably graduate by Fall 2022 or Spring 2023.

I'm kind of worried about a couple of things that might negatively impact me as a potential hire for companies. 

* One: I HAD to go to an online school because I need to work full-time. This school is a pretty large school in my state but I don't think  it breaks the top 100 CS programs in the US. It does get a lot of recruiters from top companies but mostly for the diverse student body. 

* Two: Because I work full-time, I cannot break from my current job and pay to do an internship, not even for a summer. I worry that what I'm missing with an internship is the opportunity to learn what happens in the SE/SD world that isn't available in my current organization. 

* Three: Because the school doesn't have that prestigious of a CS program (and I just completed Programming 1, so what do I know) I'm kind of worried that I'm not learning the best or the ""most"" to be a competitive hire.

I've thought of learning ""extra"" beyond my school scope, like doing this: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science

I think my questions stem from insecurity of myself in the program. What should I be doing in the meantime to elevate myself? I know there are projects, but I've only just scratched the surface with Programming 1 and Java. So I'm kind of confused about where to start from here.

Or maybe there are books to read to supplement school, what books are there?

Or because I won't have the availability to do an internship, what should I do? Keep in mind I do want to continue working with health-related software, so I do feel my job experience here is a plus."

Just graduated from the University of Toronto with a minor in Comp Sci. Towards the tail-end of my degree, I realized that I enjoyed development and swe. I ended up getting my minor late, so I wasn't able to take advantage of any CS internships, which I regret everyday. The only internships I have are analyst positions.  

Looking forward, I'm not sure what to do. I'm having difficulty finding any junior roles or internships (pretty sure this ship has sailed). I know the job market is in a rut but I'm not sure if that's the reason or if I'm not an adequate applicant. I have decent side projects with React and I'm building something out everyday - have a lot of ground to make up. 

I'm not sure what to do at this rate. I feel like I've messed up in a way. 

Is it possible for me to find something with merely a minor in CS?

Should I return back to school and get a more complete CS education (Masters or undergrad?) There are many courses that I often look back at and wish I had taken. (multi-threading, operating systems, visual computing). Would any specific masters program help me formalize my education? I've thought about  undergrad to take advantage of internships, but I'm not sure if that's the best route. 

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated."

The arrest was for possession of petty amounts of marijuana, and the kicker...a felonious THC pen. All this was nearly 1.5yrs ago while still attending school. The court systems slowed to a stop during quarantine, it may still take several months to resolve due to administrative backlog.

My attorney assures me the chance of conviction is near-zero, and the case may even be dropped due to 4th amendment reasons and other technicalities, but no one seems willing to take the ""risk"" of hiring me until it's resolved.

What can I do to increase my chances of keeping an offer? My Economics degrees make government and the financial sector very prominent in my job search, should I steer clear to avoid these dreaded fingerprint checks?

jqs14t,65,2020-11-09,Corruption in USAC (A breakdown),USAC_AAC,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/jqs14t/corruption_in_usac_a_breakdown/,"Hey y'all,

So here it is a response to a [recent post made about AAC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/jqlsq7/corruption_in_usac/). I want to preface this by saying how this isn't Breeze (She's at work), I am the graphics director for AAC and this isn't a super political or generic post where the main objective is to say ""Oh no you can't criticize USAC"" or you can't be mad at any form of student organization. This post is being made to clear up some things that I've noticed being on this sub for the past three years, some misinformation and a way to educate on what actually goes on. Being as transparent as I can be the purpose of this post is that you should be mad and critical of any elected officials and offices, but make sure that anger is properly directed. Anyway i'll be breaking down every point of the post, go over some other posts made about us in the past and some other general things I see pop up in the sub every couple of weeks.

&gt;Hi Reddit,  
&gt;  
&gt;So I’m new to this but I figured this would be a good way to anonymously share some corruption I have uncovered in USAC. I am currently a part of the USAC AAC Office and over these past few months I’ve discovered what a big fat pyramid scheme USAC is and how corrupt it is.

So before anything, let me explain how AAC (this is not the same for all USAC offices) is structured, we have Breeze as the AAC, then we have 27 directors that are stipended using the allocated funds that we are given at the beginning of the year. The directors are basically leaders for whatever platform or specialty they are running. When we all were given our positions, since we are stipended we had to go through a hiring process with ASUCLA and sign contracts, the whole shebang. Under directors we have general staff which are not stipended, there are around 100-ish gen staff and then there are interns that can later on be part of general staff.

Anyway, I can tell you that this person is not a director, and probably isn't in gen staff considering the misinformation given which would be known if they were part of gen staff, but that possibility isn't a 100%, maybe they are but really that doesn't matter they have the freedom to criticize.

&gt; I’m sure many are already aware but USAC gets over $300 for each and everyone of us. Significantly more than anyother UC campus. And I wouldn’t have trouble paying it if they actually provided $300 worth of utility to students. However beyond the laundry price decrease, usac doesn’t seem to have produced anything useful these last couple of years. 

Yep, that's true. Not sure about the ""more than any other UC campus"" though. In, terms of producing anything worthwhile, it really depends on if you take advantage of any of these programs provided by any of the offices. AAC for example has Books for Bruins, the Travel Grant Mini Fund, the Academic Success Referendum Fund, etc. The amount of value also depends on the amount of budgeting given to each office, AAC for example is on the lower end of this budget allocation.

&gt; Where does that money go then? Most of it is circulated and put back in the pockets of USAC wannabe politicians. 

Never trust politicians, invest in grass root organizations.

&gt; I’m not even joking. All the USAC elected people make like 12 grand a year. People in there offices make even more sometimes. 

USAC elected officials are stipended around 10k a year that is true, in terms of the amount ""people in there offices"" get you can actually look at the [breakdown of this when it was passed recently](https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/minutes.2020-09-22.pdf). In terms of AAC specifically, directors are stipended using our budgeting which is given and finalized during the start of the year, AAC was actually one of the only offices to stipend their directors using budgeting, the other offices recently have followed suit by getting that money from surplus. What is surplus? Surplus is basically money that can be allocated to anything, given that it is approved by USAC, surplus is around 100K per quarter. From this money a lot of things are funded or supplemented, for example Books for Bruins, BruinBash, a lot of on-campus events when that was still a thing :(.

So as graphics director how much do I get paid? Welp, I can tell you right now across the offices no one is getting over a 1,000 save for the actual elected officials who are given that stipend not to themselves, but by the school and ASUCLA. What it says on my hiring form, is that I am paid a total of $13.23 per week from the months of Sept-May, with 38 weeks that means my yearly stipend is $502.74 just enough to barely pay for my Creative Cloud license (Before it was free for UCLA students) and by the amount of hours I average on AAC stuff I get around $1.23/hr.

However, there is still a frustration there, I am privileged enough to do advocacy work while still getting some monetary compensation from it. However, the issue with paying student workers is a systemic issue with the institution. However coming from a working middle-class background I am privileged enough to do ***some*** unpaid work, many of my fellow  directors are not as privileged. 

&gt; What other club gets paid? We have clubs that literally go help people in Africa, help homeless people, and so much more and they don’t get paid shit. Literally these people get paid to make graphics that 20 people will go like on Instagram. And while some information is useful, I don’t think that’s worth 300 a year. Heck: me and my friends can probably do the same work for free. 

As stated above, it is privilege to work for free essentially. Also, achsually 🤓☝️ our posts get an average of 500 likes. But in all seriousness, I am the only who makes graphics, none of my staff make graphics, yet. But I get the argument, but also the work that we do isn't publicized too much because it takes a while to do, whether it be passing P/NP during the pandemic or finding new ways to increase the funding for our scholarships without increasing student fees or providing the necessary tools to students to make the online transition easier or advocating for leniency during these times.

&gt; Now to the corruption. So these offices will often use the money we give them to start scholarships and like other handouts. Like I’m sure some people remember the covid relief fund. First off all, if usac wasn’t overfunded these scholarships wouldn’t even need to exist since we’d all save like 300 a year. 

This year, AAC actually got their funding cut. Also, (Personal take), if UCLA was able to adequately provide for ALL of its students then there wouldn't be a need for scholarships, as well the money given to USAC as a whole, is a not even a percentile of UCLA's endowment.

&gt; But I degress. So when these scholarships are given out, usac people get to create a committee and in these commitees they prioritize themselves and their friends to receive the scholarship. Like people that get stipends to be in usac shouldn’t be eligible but almost all of them got the scholarships while we the common student suffered. Another scholarship I barely learned about was books for Bruins. It’s run by usac AAC breeze Hernandez and has to be the most corrupt operation on campus. Basically you can apply and get a couple hundred dollars for books. But that money is literally distributed on Venmo. No accountability and no proof that the money is used for books. 

It's one task-force that decides which award is given, this year 515 students applied for Books for Bruins, all 515 students received an award (from $25-75). The task force is there to decide, because unfortunately we have to decide ""who deserves help the most"" because again AAC's funding was cut. Again most (Ballpark 90%) of AAC directors are low-income and they are free to apply as it is opened to all students. Secondly, the pay out through Venmo is true, multiple options were given for the sake of accommodation. However, what is not true is the not ""needing reciepts"", if you did apply for Books for Bruins, you would have received an email asking the applicant to submit any form of receipt. These receipts are necessary on not AAC's part, but the Commissioner's part any money unaccounted for comes out their pocket. Also the money, isn't only for books, AAC advocated and expanded the usage of money to any type of education related material (Hurrah for LS majors and access codes). 

&gt; This is our student fees. Further, when someone brought up the idea of advertising this scholarship on Reddit, the idea was shot down because Reddit is racist. 

This is news to me considering I was the one who created this account the first day Breeze was in office (Check the account age) and continually advocated for south campus outreach (Because lets be honest this in the only place filled with CS majors, pre-meds, and every other flavor of south campus that isn't Young hall or Boelter). Literally, I am the only one with access to this account, Breeze did have access but logged out and has not logged back in. So unless I missed the memo, this is news to me.

&gt; These scholarships (aka Venmo payouts) weren’t heavily advertised and almost all the people in the usac AAC office got one in addition to the stipend they get for making graphics. We should demand transparency. USAC should be defunded. 

Again, only one that makes graphics, hey that's me and my 30 tabs open on illustrator. Also, Books for Bruins was heavily advertised within our means, as of writing this, our initial post about Books for Bruins received 540 likes, 455 shares (not including story shares), 284 saves, 1,383 first time profile visits, and 3,216 non-follower reach. This was all just on Instagram when we barely had exactly 3k followers. And with the biggest amount of applications received in all the two years it has been around, I say it was good for our first quarter doing it. 

&gt; How do we do that? USAC can only be defunded through a ballot measure like CUB. How do we get that? Two options. Either usac approves it. Or like 5% of the campus has to petition for it. We know usac won’t approve it. So time to mobilize. 

It is your given right to see an organization you disagree with and either reform it or abolish it. No bad blood there. Someone got close to doing it a few years ago, all it takes is one person. Also, I think it's like 50% of the student population needs to sign the petition, I remember someone in Calprig told me how it worked, but I could be wrong.

# FAQ on all things controversial

&gt;Where is the 2 million that is unaccounted for?

That's CPO not USAC, 

&gt;Why do our elected officials say politically charged statements on twitter?

Idk man, people have opinions especially on twitter and about politics.

&gt;What about the $15 buckaroos for voting?

I also don't know a single person who got that, also that was eBoard, not USAC. I also want my 15

&gt;USAC unfairly targets south campus

I mean i'm south campus, i'm premed. Honestly, not that many south people join, which is sad :(. But out of the 27 directors, 7 of us are southies :).

&gt;Do you know who BruinBaddie is?

Nah, I thought I was the only weirdo on Reddit.

&gt;Wait AAC doesn't get a billion dollars?

Na, we actually made a fundraising director position last minute in order to raise funds for scholarships. Because increasing student fees to fund scholarships doesn't follow the rules of PEMDAS.

&gt;Why are there so many call out posts on you guys?

Honestly this one has stumped me for a while, when we usually respond, people delete their accounts and posts.

# In conclusion,

We ask everyone to continue putting your elected officials in check, always advocate and mobilize for yourself and y'alls communities. But we also do ask, to do research (I know its hard even though its supposed to be public info, but we are working on that I promise) in order for that energy to go into positive change rather than that energy being misused. Please also, voice your concerns in the comments, this is your shot, I am not the most educated person, but i'll try getting you the facts in a somewhat timely manner (Physics midterm tomorrow). But yeah that's pretty much it."
jqsn33,0,2020-11-09,Is it worth interning for this company?,[deleted],uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jqsn33/is_it_worth_interning_for_this_company/,"I got an offer by a company for a winter co-op engineer position. 

The job would teach and require me to use a graphical software to program programmable logic controllers and interfaces.

The HR said there might be code to write but the team would like me to focus on the graphical software to program.  

I am in computer science regular and never had a company as big as this one (5000 employees with locations in the US and CA) offer me an internship like this.

I’m worried if this is a waste of time. Haven’t been given any other option either. Since I’m not in co-op, I could just graduate ASAP. But I am also scared to graduate no experience."

Where do I stand in terms of getting a job?,OrangeMissile,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jqu8s2/about_to_graduate_where_do_i_stand_in_terms_of/,"I’m graduating next May with a Computer Science degree and a cybersecurity minor from a well known university (extremely well known in my state). It has taken me 6 years and I’ll be around a 2.9/4.0 GPA in my major related classes, with an upwards trend in class performance. I had a couple of rough years that wrecked my GPA and any hopes of graduating close to on time, but I’m finally finishing. My goal is to get a dev job and eventually transition into a security role, although I suppose this fact isn’t completely relevant to this post. 


I’ve had 3 internships, but none of them dev related.

1. “General” engineer working for a state government department. 
2. Research related to animation at a foreign university. 
3. General IT internship at a medium sized company. 


I have few personal projects (web apps) and many class projects (more web apps and other typical class assignments) showcasing my limited development ability, as well as an active GitHub account. 

I’m aware that my experience isn’t ideal and a 2.9 gpa is low, but my performance in upper level classes has been decent (B/A). Compared to my peers, I’m at least average in terms of coding or class performance and I’m pretty confident in my ability. I’m just worried that my lack of experience and low GPA will be enough to prevent me from getting interviews, which is where I’d be able to hopefully show I’m not a complete idiot.

I’m sure I’m not going to be getting a job with any big name tech companies, but what types of companies should I apply for that’ll even hire someone like me? If you have any tips, let me know!

Also, could someone explain to me what this hype about Leetcode is and if it Is still important to people who don’t plan on applying to big name tech companies to practice Leetcode?"

My original plan was to get a BS in CS and then possibly pursue a masters in cybersecurity. Would I be stupid to pass up this opportunity to get practical experience and knowledge, but set myself back on my BS of CS, or should I continue to get my CS degree first and then specialize in cybersecurity? If I undertake the Cyber Security degree, I would continue to get my CS degree afterwards but it will take a lot longer to get there. I’m current a first year, about to finish my first semester. Should this be of any value, the degree is paid for with financial aid, just like my normal CS degree would be, and it’s completely covered.

* GPA : (Cumulative) 3.83
* GRE: (unreported) 315
* 2 months internship in top US university.
* Participated in few hackathons (but didn't win any)
* Have  a couple of projects but most or all are not complete

Some of the biggest factors that I believe makes my application not as competitive as others is:

* Lower than average GRE score
* Little to no research experience
* No competitions or awards won 
* Very weak projects

I believe my recommendation letters are alright (I haven't viewed any; But I am certain that all profs wrote a positive letter). 

Those who are currently studying CS in top 10 graduate school, do you have any advice or tips to help me improve my chances to get into such schools?

My undergrad was Business Info Systems.

None of these jobs were fulfilling for me and after contemplating for many years/months, I decided to return to school to complete a Ms in Data Science. 

I have completed one semester in a top 100 school (world) which has no prerequisites and anyone with a bit of cash can pay to get in. I did extremely well and have transferred to a top 30 school which has a seemingly strict selection process with a renowned  stats school. I have just completed my first semester at the top 30 school. 

Long story short - I feel like I’m not ready for this course. Specifically, the one at the top 30 school. I don’t have a statistics or mathematics background nor a strong programming/computer science background. And the courses I’ve taken this semester have relied HEAVILY on prerequisite undergrad units like linear algebra, calculus, probability, algorithms, data structures in which I’ve only had an introduction to from starting my Ms at the top 100 school. 

I was planning to quit work to focus on school full time next year but am worried that doing so would bear no fruits, especially if I fail units due to the persisting lack of “common knowledge” for some of these subjects. I wanted to learn EVERYTHING i require over the Christmas break which is around 3 months. 

Any advice DATA scientists?! Is it possible to learn all undergrad math/cs prereqs to a point of comprehension within 3 months so that I can comfortably learn Data Science and compete with my peers?! I just want a good wam with solid fundamentals so I can cop an internship and excel. 

Or is it just simply an impossible task in which I’ll need to do many more years of studying to catch up.  

Any pointers will be appreciated. Thanks all!


TLDR - Work not fulfilling, went to do grad school for Data Sci, did well at good school, transferred to better, now struggling and worried about decisions. Did stats class and confidence shot down and require advice from current professionals in the field"

I'm a current undergrad with a Computer Science major and minors in Statistics, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Biology. Relevant coursework that I'll be taking includes:

Biology: A&amp;P, \[Bio Structure, Function, Cellular, Molecular\], Cell Biology, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics Principles, Bioethics

Chemistry: Chem I, Chem II, Intro Organic Chem, Biochemistry, Cell and Mol Bio Lab

CS Electives: Tech Ethics, Database Systems, Advanced Database Systems, Bioinformatics Computing Skills, Intro AI, \[hopefully Machine Learning\]

Statistics: Regression &amp; Experiment Design, Nonparametric OR Quality Control, Statistical Programming, Visualizing Information, Managing Big Data

Naturally, this includes other important CS courses like algorithms, systems, etc. etc, but those were the electives that I assume would be the most relevant to trying to break into this field. Does this look good? Also, what sort of postgrad should I be looking at? Should I be more concerned with biology-related research or with tech internships in undergrad?

I'm also involved with a few clubs, a few that are career-focused, them being: Bioethics, ACM, Microbio club, IEEE, Management and Leadership, Chem club, Game Design club. I'm also in a few others, but they're more for outreach into my other interests.

Any thoughts? I have looked at Anschutz' Computational Bioscience program in Colorado, which is definitely my current #1.

Here is the thirty-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will you in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in most every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

My first option is my former Internship Manager from an F500 company. I worked under them for about 3 months and they really liked my work and have a good relationship with them, however, they want me to draft the letter to send it to them for modification.

My second option is from a Professor from a class I took a few semesters ago. I did well in the class and got an A and participated and went to office hours a few times, but don't have a very close relationship with them.

I'm currently leaning towards my former manager, as they know me better and I am afraid my professor will just write more of a ""Did Well in Class"" (DWIC) type letter which can weigh me down. But at the same time, I know it's more preferable to have all letters come from academia and professors.

I'm a TA for a course that I took, so I think I have a decent relationship with that professor, but apart from that, I have no personal relations with anyone. I'm also starting to take grad courses, but I'm really struggling to find any ways to get to know them well enough to have them write me a recommendation. Research opportunities are also really limited.

I feel like this is a problem even before Covid though. Beyond going to office hours and research, is there any other way to get professor recommendations? 

For context, I'm looking for MS/PhD programs in Applied Math and/or Computer Science. Undergrad Math GPA 4.0 at a great but not ivy-level college. Haven't taken GRE yet, and I don't have REUs, but I do have multiple software engineering internships at tech unicorns and FAANG. I'm a US citizen, but I'm open to look at schools globally."

I'm currently doing my first semester in engineering and I'm seriously considering switching to computer science next semester.

I was planning on going into electrical engineering, but I think that it's not actually for me. I don't like the physical design component of engineering, and I'm more interested in the software aspect (I'm not a big fan of SolidWorks). I also learned that I like physics, but I don't think it's something I want to learn in university
 I also like math (which I've heard there is a decent amount of in cs too), and think that some of my credits would transfer over.

Anyone have any advice on deciding if I should switch over? If anyone else has dealt with a similar scenario I would value your input as well."

Nonetheless, I have grown to have a love and hate relationship with CS, depending on the class (I despise Discrete Structures, but relatively enjoyed Intro to AI, for example).

I am currently ahead in college credits, by choosing to take classes in the summer and choosing C++ as my preferred language, but also taking an independent study in C# as well. But despite all of this, I still feel like I am bullshitting my way through every class, every programming assignment, test, and what have you. I also have no internships, no programming side projects or apps to speak of (I don't think I would even know where and what to do, or how to do it), no resume planned or even started, no hack-a-thons, no awards, you get the point I think. I have been mindlessly wasting my time doing bare minimum to pass and making music and albums as my coping mechanism for the last year now.

Just recently, I have realized this behavior and want to get my act together but I don't know where I should start. A friend of mine recently told me that the place at which he works has an internship for the summer of next year, and that I should apply, but I am not sure if it is viable, as it asks me for a resume, which leads into a feedback loop with my other current issues of having no experience to put on a resume, and etc.

I had an internship that was at the college, but the internship was basically useless since the project was made in Javafx and no one gives a crap about javafx anymore. I had planned to continue working on new skills after graduation, but unfortunately, life happened and I got overly involved with the life of my toxic, suicidal, ex best friend, who would get upset unless I hung out with him every single day. This factor halted a lot of side project progress for me unfortunately. The august after graduation, I got scammed by a company in NJ and burned the savings I had for the summer. The following October,  I tried to get a security clearance for a Data entry job because I'd figured something was better than nothing. I made a huge mistake of lying about my marijuana use in college and didn't realize this was gonna be a problem until the following March. This time gap was unfortunately the most damaging because I barley worked on anything during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

In panic mode, I got a job at Chipotle for the summer while working on programming skills. While I got a little done, I didn't do near the damage as I was hoping, because as I said, my toxic, suicidal, ex best friend would literally have a panic attack unless I hung out with him every single day and this cost me a entry level software engineering job at the biggest company in my town. By September, I barley got the results I wanted, but I lucked out and got an IT support  at a town an hour and 20 minute drive from my hometown. This is where things went from bad to worse. My days were really long (7AM - 7pm), and my ex best friend still had no sympathy for my long days and passive aggressive work environment and he demanded I spent time with him in the evenings. We were also planning to live together after his lease ended in April, but his narcissist ass came up with places to live no where near where I work. All of this was affecting my performance at work. When I finally cut him off, it was too late. I was let go from that job a week later, and then I couldn't even go back to Chipotle due to the covid-19 pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, I have an interview at a local computer shop in my town. I'm thinking of doing IT support to help fund a masters with the goal of using the masters to help prepare me for entry level software development job. My other friend who is usually really supportive and knows a thing or two about computers himself, says I shouldn't a masters because  I can go get my masters but he don’t think it will get me the results I want. There is likely nothing in a masters besides the paper that says I did it that I can’t learn on my own. He also said, I need to figure out how to walk the walk and talk the talk.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem, is two and a half years is a HUGE time gap and even if I get this help desk job at the computer store and spend 1000 hours coding side projects outside of work over the course of the year, it may not matter for getting entry level help desk jobs, unless I get a masters, because the GAP would be a red flag. If I get a masters, that opens the doors to more side projects, and good summer internships that I lacked in undergrad. At this point, I feel like I almost need a masters. What do you guys think? Should I get a masters? Should I get what I can for now and work on side projects until I dev job? Or am I utterly fucked? Please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Please don't lecture me on how much of an idiot I was. I'm aware I was an idiot and have spend months in total regret from the mistakes I've made after graduation. I just need advice for what my best options are as of now."

I think that I don't actually have any objectives/projects in mind so I don't know what to learn or build...

I'm a physics student but I'm not sure if I want to follow the  academia path, so maybe I'll do a masters later in Computational Physics and try to be as employable as possible in Industry.

So what should I learn to be employable (being able to land an internship or job in the future) and at the same time maybe use my math/physics skills?

This would be my last summer internship before graduating, so I'm trying to gauge the intern to full-time conversion rate, and the flexibility intern converts have in choosing teams to join as new grads.

For those who have interned at Oracle, did most of the interns you interacted with receive full-time offers? Did you have the flexibility to try a different team or location from your internship as a new grad?

I'm excited about the team I would be joining for this internship--it sounds super cool and I think I would learn a lot working with them. However, I am concerned about the Bay Area being a really, really expensive place to start fresh out of college if I were to go full-time with this team. I grew up in the Bay Area and my family basically had to move away because the cost of living was so out of control.

I have a lot of friends who are going to be in Seattle post-grad, which is also quite expensive, but still has areas that are literally half the cost of the Bay. I am wondering if it would be possible to intern with this team I am interested in based in Pleasanton, but then network with Seattle area teams for full-time opportunities.

Basically he's reported to about the progress of it and his office is attached to the warehouse but he doesn't manage shifts or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my dad was able to get me an internship where I got some experience in both the ""office"" of the warehouse as well as the warehouse itself and this is what I found (if anybody was considering working at one):

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

1. The pay is pretty decent, the starting pay isn't bad at all and one thing I certainly did not realize until I interned there was it's actually very possible for somebody who works in the warehouse to make more than people who work in the office area. I think part of that is honestly that both the office and warehouse people are underpaid though. Really only the VP and the person who ""ran the building"" got paid well where I worked. Everybody else was around the same depending on how long you were there for. 
2. There's kind of a ""blind spot"" or ""sweet spot"" I found when it came to the warehouse. If you are able to get to the position of a supervisor (many of them start as a lower position) than work life could honestly be enjoyable and easy, at least where I worked. In theory, a supervisor is a necessary role but they end up not really doing a ton other than ""monitoring"" the bulk of the day, which involves talking to the workers and making sure they're ""on task."" One of our supervisors was phenomenal at the warehouse and yet even I can't say he ever seemed super busy simply because there's not a ton to do in that role. If you can get to  this spot, life could be very good!
3. Nice blend of backgrounds of people working together. This is also partially a con as drama is more likely to start this way due to all the culture mashing but it's also cool to be introduced to new cultures.

Cons: 

1. Very bleak surroundings, warehouses certainly aren't pretty and can be rather depressing looking.  It also can be rather loud depending on where you're working in the warehouse. Despite my begging, my dad refused to put music in the warehouse due to ""safety reasons.""
2. The work isn't the most exciting, at least for starting roles. Although that being said not every position is the same (see my tips on more for that).
3.  You aren't treated as an adult, this is probably the biggest thing! Clocking in and clocking out, can't be a minute late, and if you're caught with your cell phone than you're being written up! This was absolutely the biggest con of it all, was the fact they don't treat adults like adults! It was especially bad at my warehouse with their clocking in process being as strict as it was (even the higher ups thought it was ridiculous, only HR thought it was a good idea). 
4. There was a lot of drama at my warehouse but that also may depend on the warehouse you work at.
5. At my warehouse, overtime would sometimes be mandatory, as well as working on Saturdays.

&amp;#x200B;

Tips:

1. Not every warehouse job is the same. Find out the specifics of each job before applying. I personally much preferred labeling to picking but some people are the opposite. I would say if they had running machinery as an entry level (or driving the truck) to apply for that position. 
2. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO QUIT!!! Ask different employees when  you first start to find out how easy/difficult it is to move up in the organization. Do not take it from HR/supervisors as there is no guarantee they will be truthful with you. At this specific warehouse, moving up was practically impossible with the new HR person (who was awful) but it used to be where moving up was the norm. If everybody is telling you how difficult/impossible it is to move up, than quit and go to a different warehouse. It's not giving up, it's being smart!
3. The office people really don't have it much better than you. Like I said, it wasn't unlikely at all for somebody working in the warehouse to be making more than a person in the office. Office people aren't treated like children in that they don't have to clock in and can be on their phone but really the job itself isn't that great. They aren't ones to envy even though you may be wishing to work in there instead of the warehouse! Although few of the office jobs require college degrees if you want to look into that route!"

I'm 29 year old F and I am in a relationship with 28 M. We met in college around 2012 and started off as friends all through out my college years from 2012-early 2016 and then we started dating in July of 2016 after I graduated from college. The plan was to move to Cali to become a news reporter and bet famous but that didn't happen because I decided to fall in love. We had our ups and downs, not too major and probably only had a handful of arguments. I do have some concerns on commitment since we have been together for four years and there has been no talks about our future. And in this trying time a lot of couples are being very dependent on each other and I get that. 


Anyway, my boyfriend is really nice and helpful and he has helped out in many ways than one and I love him. 

Before I go on about what is happening now. I have just a little background on my life before him. I come from a single parent home my mom was born in Florida but raised in Los Angeles and left her life there to move to Cincinnati Ohio with my father who later left our family (I was born in Los Angeles and so she has always told me that that is my home)  when I was 11 years old and so my mom raised my brothers and I on her own with little to no help besides help from my grandparents and family friends. 


Since the divorce, I've been the family cow steering and helping everyone out. Trust me I didn't mind at the time but looking back I've never had my own life/identity outside of my family.  All of my college years were focused on driving my family everywhere in my moms car and never really having time to myself. I would complain to my ""friend"" now boyfriend  at the time that my family wants me to do this and that and I am too exhausted. 


During college I juggled unpaid internships while working part time in retail and then also being a full time student. But my mom needed the help and I would do anything for her because I love her. Even in college I went for Journalism for the hopes of being on TV and I believe that ""dream"" stems from needing attention after my father left the family and needing validation from strangers.  I never really cared about the art of journalism, just being on TV and that was so stupid and immature of me. I thought that if I got on TV I would be rich and help my family out financially and all would be well. Cringy, I know.


 Anyway, so when I started dating my boyfriend in 2016 after years of me rejecting him due to having my identity and goals linked to my family. For the first time in 2016, I gave love a chance. My boyfriend and his family is from Europe but they lived in Cincinnati for many years and so his family resides here. Right before Covid19 blew up , which was November of 2019, I decided to move out of my mom house for the first time. I was  28 at the time and fast forward to now, my boyfriend has been temporarily living with me at my apartment with is a mile away from his parents house.

 I don't consider us ""officially"" living together since most of his stuff is at his parents house and I think he is only living here so he can work from home in peace and spend time with me. So back to my mom....her brother bought my aging grandparents a house in California and now her parents are pressuring her to move in with them after covid or in the next year or so. 


Once I found out that news, I've been very depressed and crying everyday but I love my mom with all of my heart and having her move back to Cali is going to break me because I like having her around but I know that in her heart she wants to move back to Cali and have for year and here is her chance. 


I like Cali as well and would like to live there but I dont want be in crammed in a two bedroom house with my grandparents and mother. In the perfect world I wish I could provide for my mom and set her up with a place in California while I have have my own apartment there as well. California is beautiful and it would he nice to live there but I also love my boyfriend and don't want to leave him. I am conflicted now because the thought of me up and moving from my boyfriend breaks me heart and the thought of me seeing my mom fly off to Cali breaks my heart as well. 


My unrealistic second dream is to make money off of youtube so I can stay with my BF in OHIO and visit my mom in Cali (if she moves there whenever I want). Speaking of YouTube, that has been a dream of mine to have my own beauty channel and I  regret not working  on that after I graduated from college after my other dream did not work out. I think I liked YouTube more than college. Oh and another background  on my childhood. 


Before my father cheated on my mom and left the family for another woman, my dad would take me to acting classes so my mom has always said that I should have been an actress. Did she say that because she grew up in Cali and has put that pipedream career on me? Idk, I need advice, I am very depressed.  Since I was born in Los Angeles they always tell me that LA is my home not Ohio....I'm so sad and I need help, should I see a counselor? Is my childhood and my moms regrets affecting my own relationship and choices. Fyi: my mom is doing what's best for her parents, her dad is 81 and has stage for cancer and her mom needs hip replacement."

[Part 3]",Born-Beach,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jre5ar/if_you_hear_a_nursery_rhyme_called_snippity_snap/," Just joining us? I recommend starting at the [beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jpwsol/if_you_hear_a_nursery_rhyme_called_snippity_snap/). Too far back? You can read the previous transcript [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jqqsph/if_you_hear_a_nursery_rhyme_called_snippity_snap/). 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;I sit back down, slowly. Hearing Becca speak, the concept of Snippity Snap being a vengeful spirit is a plausible theory, and one that I make certain to write down in full. Still, it leaves a lingering, uncomfortable question. “What did you offer it?""
&gt;
&gt;She looks up at me then, her eyes and mine, and I see a worry in her expression. “What?” she says.
&gt;

&gt;“You said it knew it wanted an offering. Someone to suffer like it had.”
&gt;

&gt;“Oh,” Becca looks away. “I um, I offered it the only thing that I could."" She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath and then brings a hand to her mouth to stifle a sob. ""I offered it Heather.”


&amp;#x200B;

I clear my throat. “You offered Snippity Snap your friend, Heather?”

Becca wipes the last of the tea from the table, then tosses the rag into the sink. “She was dead anyway. Her arm was practically amputated, and she'd painted the bathroom red with her blood.” She sits down in the chair and puts her head in her hands. “Besides, it wasn’t like any of us were escaping while that... thing was standing in front of the door.”

I write the details down, but each word digs a pit in my stomach. A sickening sadness grows inside of me for that poor girl. It’s difficult to imagine the horror she must have felt. “How did you offer her to Snippity Snap?” I ask quietly. “Was there a ritual involved?”

Becca’s eyes appear from her hands, and her cheeks are wet with tears. “I just told it to take her; take Heather and leave me alone.”

I stare at her, wondering if her terminology was an accident, intentional, or a psychological slip. She asked it to leave her -- Becca -- alone, and not both of them. In that moment, Becca only had regard for her own safety. 

I reach for my mug and take a sip, reminding myself not to judge too harshly. Becca was just a young girl herself. To be confronted by a nightmare at her age would drive anybody to act in strange ways. 

“After you offered it Heather, what did it do to her?” I’m not sure I want to hear the answer, but I know that it’s important. 

Becca shrugs, lowering her hands from her face. Her eyes are red and puffy, and a trail of snot winds its way from her nose to her lip. She lifts a hand into the air, and raises two fingers. She makes a cutting motion. “*Snip*,” she says.

""Snip?"" 

“The monster took Heather’s head off.” She wipes her leaky nose onto her sweater sleeve. “It was over so quick, thankfully, but there was so much blood. Both of us -- Fran and I, were drenched in it.” She smiles, but it’s a broken and twisted sort of smile. “On the bright side though, we didn’t have to listen to Heather screaming anymore. Just each other.”

I write her words down, and as I do I realize my penmanship has grown poorer and poorer with each passing paragraph. My hand is trembling. “After Heather was killed, did Snippity Snap leave?”

“Vanished. Like it was never there.”

I lean back in my chair, taking a breath and looking over my notes. That was certainly a harrowing account, but a valuable one. In this interview alone I’ve accumulated a small textbook on Snippity Snap, much more than the Facility’s managed in over two years. Sill, I suspect I’m only scratching the surface.

“I heard about that story, you know,” I say at length. “It was the birth of the Elktorch Slasher. The police believed a brutal killer was on the loose.”

“Yeah. They threw my dad in prison for three months because they were convinced it had to have been him. Who else was at the house, right? It’s not like we have serial killers in sleepy Elktorch.”

“He was exonerated though,” I say. “After two more murders occured.”

Becca’s quiet. She glances back down the hallway and swallows. “Yeah. After two other people were killed, the police finally realized my dad was innocent. They decided there was a serial killer on the loose after all.”

Pieces begin to connect in my mind, and I’m not certain I like the look of the puzzle. “The people who were killed,” I say darkly. “Did that have something to do with you?”

""No shit,"" she says, rolling her eyes. ""Of course it did. My dad was in prison for murdering a little girl, and I knew the only way he was getting out of there, and the only way I’d ever see him again was if…”

“...If Snippity Snap killed again. The presence of identical massacres made them acknowledge your father's innocence.” 

“Bingo,” she says with false cheer. 

Outside, the sun’s nearly set. Its last rays cast shadows across the room, filtering in through the narrow openings in the blinds. The way they play across Becca's face, it's difficult to discern her expression. Is there a sadness there? Or an indifference?

“You traded people’s lives for your father’s freedom. They didn’t die peaceful deaths, you know.”

“Are you fucking kidding me?” She slams a hand on the table, shooting up out of her chair. “You really think I don't know just how horrible each and every one of their deaths were? You don’t think that shit keeps me up at night, hating myself and wishing I had the courage to just let Snippity Snap take me instead?”

“Take you instead?” I say quietly. I speak my next words with a measured calmness, though my heart’s beginning to race in my chest. “Did you make some kind of deal with that creature?”

She glares at me, one side of her face draped in shadow, the other bathed in shrinking sunlight. We sit in a tense silence, and the corners of her mouth twitch with unsaid words, but she keeps her lips pressed together. 

I ask again, this time more forcefully. “Becca, did you make a deal with Snippity Snap?”

“I did what I had to do.”

“What does that mean?”

She closes her eyes, runs both hands through her dark hair, and groans. She doesn’t want to speak. She doesn’t want to tell me this next part, but then her mouth opens, her voice cracks, and it all spills out. “I summoned it. When I mutilated my finger. When I said the rhyme and brought it through the veil and into our world. I created it, and it wanted me. Never Heather. Always me.”

My pen scratches at my clipboard, my eyes straining in the waning light, and I’m beginning to believe Becca Galdun isn’t the girl I thought she was. There’s a cunning to her I didn’t account for. I assumed she was like so many other children who’d encountered entities or spirits. Enamoured. Perhaps believing themselves special for having had the experience. Pulled into their orbit like a macabre cultist.

Becca wasn’t manipulated though. She wasn’t pulled into any ideological orbit. She chose to commit the murders. She chose to massacre innocent people, multiple times, all to save herself. 

“Would you mind if we turned on a light?” I ask. “It’s getting difficult to write.”

“Sure,” she says, walking over to the wall and flicking a switch. A dim light flickers on the ceiling fan above us. “Better?”

“Much.” 

She settles herself back into her chair, and I'm beginning to think I should be leaving about now, but I still have one question I need to ask. One of incredible importance.  

“How does it work, then? Your deal?”

She pays me a joyless smile. “I give it life. Blood. Pain. And in exchange, it lets me live a little longer.”

“Why does it want you though?  I understand that you summoned it, but that doesn’t explain--”

“Are you fucking deaf? Or were you just not listening? I didn’t just summon the thing, I fucking *created* it. I pulled Hope Delvine’s twisted soul out of the ether, and ripped it six ways to Sunday.” 

She reaches a hand up and grips a clump of her air, pulling at it with a pained, manic glint in her eyes. I notice her teeth nervously chewing on her lip, and a thin trail of blood snakes its way down her chin. 

“I didn’t mean to,"" she says, her voice strung out. ""I didn’t realize it would create that monster. But I did it. I did it, and now Snippity Snap wants me to pay. Blood for blood. Agony for agony.”

My pen scratches across the clipboard, and as it does I hear something else. Something in the hallway. I pause, focusing on the sound, and it’s unmistakable this time. 

It’s scissors. Opening and closing. *Snip. Snap. Snip. Snap.* 

My heart thunders in my chest. A primal part of me screams that it’s time to leave -- that it was time to leave ten minutes ago, but my curiosity got the better of me. 

I clear my throat, pocketing my pen and rising from the table. “I think that should do for now. I’ll take this information and do some research at my hotel, and hopefully tomorrow I’ll have a solution worked out for freeing you from this situation.” 

I say the words quicker than I should. I let my unease slip into my voice, and I hope she doesn’t notice. 

“I’m not finished telling you my story though,” Becca says, and this time the tears are gone. Her expression is cold. Calculated. She stands up from the table and there's a hunger in her eyes. “Stay awhile longer. We’re just getting to the good part.”

I lower a hand to my side, where my service weapon is holstered within my jacket. “I think the good part can wait until tomorrow."" I give her a curt nod and a false smile, and turn around to leave. As I do, something presses against my throat, and I freeze. 

Ryan Halflow is towering in front of me, a pair of scissors in his hand. He's holding the cold steel flush against my neck. “Don’t move,” he says. “And I won’t kill you.”

There’s the squeal of a chair sliding on linoleum, and a moment later Becca strides in front of me, just behind Ryan. “I honestly didn’t expect it to be this simple, but it was,” she laughs. “You *actually* walked right in here after hearing Ryan’s sob story, and now I’ve got a perfect offering that nobody is going to be looking for or talking about.”

“My employer knows precisely where I am,” I warn her. “We’re GPS tracked at all times.”

“Sure you are,” she says in a singsong voice. “But the Facility isn’t going to risk revealing itself to the public in the name of avenging some stupid *intern*. In the meantime though, you’ll keep Snippity Snap satisfied for another few months.” 

She smirks, her tongue sliding across her teeth. “Think of it this way, your death will save another life. Isn’t that what you wanted? To help people suffering from these mean old legends?”

“Listen,” I say, and with each word I can feel my adam’s apple dig against the scissor blade. “I can help you. I wasn’t kidding about that. I have enormous resources, more than you can possibly know and--”

“I know all about your resources,” Becca snaps, grabbing me by my hair and pulling my throat against the edge of the shears. I feel a thin trail of warmth trickle down my neck. “All you’ve managed to do at that Facility is fuck things up. You think I’m going to risk pissing Snippity Snap off, just on the off chance some fresh out of Orientation dimwit can solve a nightmare I’ve suffered with for a decade?”

She lets go with a violent jerk, and I wince as the blade slides across my flesh, drawing more blood. Her face contorts in a mixture of revulsion and glee, and I realize this is the real Becca. Everything before this had been an act. 

“No,” she says. “I’m better off doing what I’ve been doing all along. Keeping Snippity Snap satisfied. Offering it people that nobody’s going to look for. People nobody gives a fuck about.” She steps away, and a moment later the dim, flickering kitchen light goes out.

Then, from somewhere in the darkness I hear her voice. “Do it, Ryan.”

Ryan grabs my hand in a flash, pulling the scissors down from my throat and closing them on my index finger. 

""*Snippity Snap,*” Becca chants beside me. “*You’ll come [back!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/js1lky/if_you_hear_a_nursery_rhyme_called_snippity_snap/)”*

I’ve been applying to internships but obviously a lot of them require knowledge in machine learning and other kind of upper level concepts that I just haven’t learned yet. Especially considering how I fell a class behind because I had to retake a course I was struggling with my first semester. So I just don’t really know what I should do for the upcoming Summer because I want to be able to do something relevant to data science that I can add to my resume for future applications. I’ll keep applying to stuff I believe I am qualified for but any advice or ideas would be great.

I genuinely feel that I am not in my prime for most of this year, I have some wellness issues because of the pandemic and lost my mojo. I flunked a lot of hiring processes because I simply just didn’t have time to practice myself up again before the big days.

In the midst of this, the last company I interned with offered me to return with double pay, which in perspective, is very near to median fresh grad salary. I’m not some godlike programmer, so this is quite insane for me.

But the catch is, I was asked to return to the same role and department. I want to explore industries, solve diverse problems, and keep climbing up to bigger names with each internship, the offer is not particularly in line with it. Also imo it doesn’t look particularly great on resume, doing the same thing twice over? I don’t know, feels like I don’t show growth and just stuck there. Moreover, I don’t know if it’s just because of covid, but my experience with the internship last summer, even though the company got a big name and all, was pretty uneventful. I didn’t do much because I never got the opportunity to contribute to production, what I developed weren’t really notable things for me (no new industry knowledge out of it, felt like just some convenience things the devs put in the back burner), I didn’t learn or get taught about industry-related topics, office life was so unexpectedly bland (no one in my team even casually chatting with each other during work time). I just felt like I didn’t get anything out of the internship.

But on the other hand, I’m faced with the fact that I don’t have any summer internship offers to this day, and judging my performance so far compared to what I know I can do on a good day, I’ll just have to be real: I probably won’t get any better offers than this one (if at all) in terms of company name and pay, especially this late on the summer internship search. This next internship is important as it will be going to my degree requirement (just like the previous one), so I must have an internship for the summer no matter how.

I have to reply to the offer by this week, and I don’t really know whether any named startups/companies would still be hiring after this month. Should I just take the safe option for me, take it and accept all the things implied with it, or risk it all and keep looking and going for new opportunities despite the seemingly low possibility of getting one? It’s kind of a dilemma for me"

What is your favorite part about being one?

What is your least favorite part?

Do you do a lot of dev work? What would be the ratio like (dev vs non-dev work)?

I love Cybersecurity and I would prefer dev work, but my ultimate goal is a manager position (or upper management). Would Product Security Engineer be a good starting point for this path? Or should I stick to SWE (Cybersecurity related)?

jrexq9,21,2020-11-10,[QUESTIONS] Experience as a Product Security Engineer?,s_colon,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/jrexq9/questions_experience_as_a_product_security/,"I already tried searching on Google, Quora, etc. I figured it would be best to ask on Reddit.

I'm a junior CS student right now and I'm also specializing in Cybersecurity (my school has specialized pathways). This upcoming summer, I will be interning at a company as a Product Security Engineer intern. I would like to get as many perspectives/experiences from other Product Security Engineers as I can.

Questions:

What is it like being a Product Security Engineer? Typical day?

What is your favorite part about being one?

What is your least favorite part?

Do you do a lot of dev work? What would be the ratio like (dev vs non-dev work)?

I love Cybersecurity and I would prefer dev work, but my ultimate goal is a manager position (or upper management). Would Product Security Engineer be a good starting point for this path? Or should I stick to SWE (Cybersecurity related)?

Thank you for everyone's help!!"

I have internships from 2 largish companies and projects from classes, hackathons and group orgs. I try my best to work on this skills now and learn new languages, tho it gets more and more difficult to motivate learning and working on projects with the pandemic. But despite this I almost never make it to the next round of interviews.

The first chat with the HR people always seems to go well, I do my research, ask questions, even get told I'm a good fit but rarely make it to even the second round to talk to someone on the tech team. What are people looking for when they're considering that first group of people and deciding who should move in? There's gotta be some common thing that's taking me out of the running so early on each time, right?"

I am currently a junior in college and live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Being someone who has grown up around technology my entire life, I've been really into the industry and have known for quite some time its what I have wanted to do.

Originally I was a Computer Science major but found I could not keep up with the course load and needed to regroup and find a new major.  Now I am in marketing (and minoring in CS because I had enough credits from before).  I still practice my coding skills on the side with python primarily and although not great by any means, its improving.  I've seen as I have matured, that my brain works in a more creative way compared to incredibly difficult algorithms and equations (my adobe + spreadsheet skills &gt; coding).  With that being said I think it would actually be cool to have a unique look in this field and I'm honestly really excited to compete for a Product Manager Role at a tech company!

I have had two other internships under my belt now (both in tech but not PM Intern roles; one being a lab IT role and the other a business analytical and design role)....HOWEVER: I know that this type of position is different and after having not great luck so far in applications **I was actually wondering what your best advice would be to be competitive for these kinds of positions (or other entry level ones that would help me get there eventually)!**"
jrfwat,7,2020-11-10,"Learning AI, ML and DL for Biomedical Research",TwiningLeek881,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jrfwat/learning_ai_ml_and_dl_for_biomedical_research/,"I’m a college freshman and this past summer, during quarantine, I decided to teach myself programming. As an aspiring physician, I would inevitably need to get involved in some biomedical research to get into med school. As it is, clinical research internships ask that their applicants have some programming experience. But aside from that, I genuinely did start developing an interest in how computers work in terms of hardware and software and I gained an overall interest in how artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and GPU computing could be applied to not only biomedical information, but general data (I’m a diehard philomath).

I started off with the Harvard EdX CS50X course. Off the bat I noticed something. I didn’t really have an issue learning how functions or certain elements of programming worked, but rather implementing these elements. Learning the constructs of programming and how to logically think through problems in a obsessively binary and objective manner and break them down is something I failed horribly at. I thought it was an issue with the course being too hard so I kept jumping around from EdX course to EdX course and from language to language to try and find a sweet spot...nothing ended up clicking and I wasted the entire summer. 

Ultimately, when my college semester started, I took a introductory CS class. The course description is below. This class teaches Java alongside the fundamental concepts of OOP and how to logically structure programs, something that I’m getting better at gradually. I understand that going to such a level of computer science not only takes time to learn the theory but also hours and hours of practice.

However, I want to get involved in research ASAP and I wanted to know what is the most efficient way to learn how to use these tools and fields. Is there a particular online course that gives a good introduction, a good textbook, YouTube channel? Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated and I’m hungry to start acting upon learning these tools.

Just some background, I came from a co-Ed SAP secondary school (L1R5 7-4), went to VJC (PCME 4H2), worked a ton (internships + random part time work) and currently in NUS first year. In my first sem, I continued to work quite a fair bit and if y’all look at my post/comment history, y’all would know that I’m also running a non profit organisation with some friends, an initiative called One Step At A Time.

Oh yah I also have experience with going for tuition for Os and As lol so you can ask about that too, if y’all have questions about that.

This has been something I really enjoyed talking to my juniors about, and I’m still talking to them about their options, but I thought it’ll be cool to open this up to more people.

So ask away:)) I have a couple of submissions this week so my replies might be a little slow, but I will definitely reply as soon as I can!!"
jrgt2l,7,2020-11-10,How can I best make up for lost time after a shaky start to my career?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jrgt2l/how_can_i_best_make_up_for_lost_time_after_a/,"I'm not gonna sugar coat it; I was (am) an abysmal CS student. Mid tier school (think 150ish in ranking), 3.4 major GPA, no internships, I didn't even code on my own time until halfway through senior year (AKA last summer), and the side projects I did since then are video games that are more exercises in creativity than in technical skill. All I can say is depression's a bitch, and I only recently managed to get it under control (not ""fixed,"" but under control) a few months ago after struggling with it for 8 years.

Against all odds I managed to get a job for $68k in a LCOL city with a company I really like via continuously targeting their recruiters. I start that in January.

I was a smart kid growing up until I got hit with depression; while I'm excited to get to work because the work the company does looks quite interesting I really feel like I could've done better and ended up in a better spot if I wasn't mentally weak at the time. Now that I've hopefully recovered, what is the best way to make up for lost time?

I quit gaming so I have more time to focus on developing my skills, so I'll basically have nothing but free time after work.

I've been trying to find similar advice in the sub's history but all the advice seems to skew towards current undergrad students; surely you aren't permanently screwed if you don't immediately get off on the right foot after graduating, right?"

Normally, I would've left by now but the team is cool and the salary is great, and I don't know what to do. I even tried to talk about it with my supervisor but that didn't help.

I don't really need a job right now, even though the money is good, as I'm still a student and my parents are helping me anyway.

I was on the path to building my career and working my dream job.
Everything was well and good until two weeks into my internship.

Maybe it was impeccable timing or maybe our boss saw potential in me, perhaps both, but I was given a job (probation with pay) at a new department that the company started up.  I moved in with my current team members into a new office, plus because I am the one who reports directly to the boss, whenever I or my team are in need of anything (like resources and the like) we don't have to wait for the long process of obtaining it.

That's when things got messy. While not everyone is problematic, the majority are. There are individuals from other departments who rats on me  to our boss for the silliest things while  they do the same things 
themselves. Like for example snacking at your desk. I feel like I'm being micro managed by seniors.  Once I was shouted at for double checking something for a project. It was humiliating. There are people scrutinising my every move waiting for me to do something wrong. 

It was bearable at first as my team mates and I get along really well until recently. Because I report directly to our boss any mishaps are my responsibility. I try my best to always be polite and professional yet there was one urgent incident where I had to push to make sure the job gets done well.  It was for an important client of ours and my team mate didn't like it that I told her (respectfully) to try out my method of solving the problem we had. 

My team mates are giving me the cold shoulder ever since. There have been times whereby I've heard stuff said about me when they thought I wasn't around. 

I self reflected for days trying to figure out if I've done any thing wrong or rubbed someone the wrong way but I came up short. I always make an effort to be considerate, polite and helpful to people. I work overtime unpayed to make sure our team always have no problems. 

I try my best to not take anything personally but its gotten to a point where I feel extremely isolated and I fear my job will be jeopardised. What do I do?"

I have been applying for entry level jobs for about 18 months now. I'm qualified and have worked in the area b4.

I have a lot of classmates who don't have the same level of skill in softwares such as excell or photoshop, don't have any experience and don't have any extra courses as I have, and those classmates have gotten good internships at big companies.

I always go through 3 to 6 rounds of interviews just to walk away with nothin. I feel like I'm wasting my time, browsing through job websites everyday, doing interviews everyweek, I probably wasted over 1000 hours in the last 18 months and I still have got no Job, only stress and bad feelings, in those 1000 hours I could have done so much.

I have the feeling that the best thing to do is to just start a business, I have the skills, knowledge, motivation and time to do that, I'm willing to risk things since I'm young and don't have kids to feed. I'm tired of wasting my time doing interviews just to walk away from it with nothing but stress. 

What do you think I should do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I still pursue the internship of 40 hours and try to make my minor into a my 2nd major  (2nd major would be in Statistics). Would need to take 4 stat major courses at once.

2nd option sounds better ofc but I don't know how feasible it is, taking 4 stats courses while doing the 40 hours.

Would adding that 2nd major really benefit me that much if I'm already getting real work experience? (this would be my 3rd internship)"

I'm having a problem redefining my problem statement. Its about the high percentage of unemployment and underemployment of recent graduates

I used the 5 why's to get to the root of the problem and here what I have so far

1. They cant find a job because they either lack experience, or/and  they dont have the skills or/and they just didnt network. I broke down these three reasons ....

* They dont have the **experience** that employers are demanding in the entry level position; which is 2-3 years.   **why &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;** because they havent gotten the chance to do internships while in college. **why &gt;&gt;** because they either cant afford to take an internship due to a heavy college course load or because there isnt enough internship opportunities for every student. not to mention that alot of these internships are unpaid and students might not afford to have unpaid jobs because they need to pay tuition somehow. **why** there isnt enough opportunities ? because its too much hassle for employers to set up an internship program
* They dont have a **network** and we all know the power of knowing someone who knows someone. **why ?&gt;&gt;&gt;** they either dont know how to do it or they dont understand the importance of it. **why ? &gt;&gt;&gt;** they dont have communications skills and/or they dont have enough exposure of of its importance. **why ? c**ollege doesnt teach communication skills and/or they dont emphasize the importance of network.
* They cant find a job because they dont have the **skills** that employers are demanding from them "" Ive read many research and survey papers that back that statement up"" **why? &gt;&gt;&gt;** education providers are not teaching demanded skills. **why ? &gt;&gt;&gt;** they are not directly communicating with businesses and employers and/or they arent flexible enough to change an entire system of education that is built on teaching knowledge rather than skills.

1. They cant find the right job -underemployed- **why ? &gt;&gt;&gt;**

* First possible reason &gt; Because they have chosen the wrong major in college, either it wasnt aligned with their true interests or it just not in-demand major anymore **why ?? &gt;&gt;&gt;** because they didnt have access to tools that help them become more self aware or/and they didnt have access to labor market information and career counselo**rs**
* Second possible reason &gt; They dont know how to promote themselves and/or translate the skills they have acquired during school to skills that employers want **why ? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;** because they either have psychological barriers like fears or they just not able to communicate/articulate their transferable skills.

Please give me any feedback/insight on this. Are my why's heading in the right direction ? do you have any ""why's"" you can add ?

* Supportive student body with relatively diverse backgrounds (ie, not all rich white kids)
* At least 25% acceptance rate
* Merit scholarships I can still apply for LMAO oops I realized too late I needed to find more targets/safeties
* Decent amount of school spirit and school traditions! Whether sports or something else

Hello, I am from Mexico, I have been dating a girl for more than a year, she is studying medicine and I am studying international relations.

In Mexico, when studying medicine, you do 4 years of theory and practice in local hospitals and universities, then you do an internship in a hospital assigned to you within the country, generally in another city, and after the internship you carry out ""social service ""in a rural community in the country, thus completing the degree and having a medical degree.

I am the same age as her and I would finish my university studies when she finished the theory and practice of her career.

Currently she is nowhere near starting her internship, and I am finishing my degree, I have plans to study a master's degree in my local city.

I find myself unsure about the future of our relationship, she will stop living with her parents, will move to another city, will begin to meet new people and will stay several hours in a hospital, sleeping with other people and perhaps without the possibility to communicate with me as it used to be before, the worst thing is that it would not be a matter of months, it would be a matter of years.

In addition to later obtaining her degree as a doctor, she plans to do a 4-year specialty in another city, also involving long hours without the possibility of sleeping in her own home.

My fear lies in the distance, the abrupt break from what we were used to living, the infidelity, that her career involves a full-time dedication throughout her life and that there will be special moments and dates when she will not be able to be

I am too physical a person, I would love to see my partner every day, wake up next to her, go to work and know that I will see her at home, I do not want to absorb her future, I want to see her happy.

Did someone go through a similar situation? What was the outcome?"

I have a good general understand of the most common data structures, and some sorting algos, etc. I am currently planning on:

1. Review and solidify my understanding of common data structures and algorithms. Should I be able to implement them from scratch and know then in and out before doing Leetcode? Should I learn and know undirected/direct graphs?
2. Read CTCI (in entirety?) and do Leetcode top 75 that dabbles in the most common types of questions(dynamic programming, dfs, bfs, sorting, etc)
3. practice leetcode problems based on what areas im weak at
4. practice with other platforms? Codesignal? Is it enough to just use leet and CTCI?

The consulting one has already given me an offer that expires this week, but the product management one won't have an answer for me until the next, even though I told them I had a competing offer.

I already asked to push the deadline of the consulting one back so this deadline would be my final deadline. I'm really distraught on what to do because I really really want the product management one, but I'm not sure that I'll get it. My superday for it went okay, I think I answered one technical question a bit weirdly but I emailed her afterward to thank her and she asked me to connect with her on LinkedIn.

If I get the product management one, I'll probably take the return offer, but I can't say the same with the consulting one. The worst case scenario is that I don't accept the consulting offer this week and I don't get the product management one, leaving me with no internship.

(To give a little more context about the companies, the consulting one is from a firm that's a subsidiary of a really-well known consulting firm, but is a really small firm by itself, and the product management one is for a well-known credit card company.)

I'm just really tired and burnt out - my mental health is crumbling and I don't know if I can do this again and again. I just want to finally be able to support my family when I graduate college. Any advice would be so so kind &lt;3

tl;dr: I don't know if I should wait it out past my internship offer to see if the other company will take me, or just take the offer right now."

&amp;#x200B;

For example: My parents wanted me to be a doctor. Lately, they've seem to think that I can't become a doctor because I am ""lazy"" (It's quite the opposite as you'll see later in the post). Even then, they want me to go somewhere in the medical field, and are 100 percent set on putting me in that field due to uh, ""job security"". (I am a 17 year old high school senior, for reference). It honestly seems more for them than me, as I've brought up computer science as a very viable option (one that has been proven, and one that I'm personally more interested in), and they do not care.

&amp;#x200B;

They insist on me going to college for any biology related degree and going into the medical field whichever way possible. Now, at this point, I *could* just accept it, although grudgingly. But at the end of the day, I'm EXTREMELY motivated towards computer science, and personally, I just couldn't accept going another direction in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I didn't. Come what may, I'm not going for a fuckin medical degree. Or a medical profession, etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been around six months now since I've been planning literally *everything*. Community colleges, majors, colleges to eventually end up transferring to, potential jobs, mapping out worst case scenarios (if my parents suddenly kick me out, etc). I think the only thing I really need that I'm missing right now is knowing my social security number lol.

**Just as an example, here's how I'm approaching a big hurdle, which is college:** 

For my specific situation, like I just stated, I'm going to a community college firstly. Meaning my major is decided once I transfer to a university from community college within 2-3 years. For those unfamiliar with that process, essentially, before you transfer, you have to make sure that every class you take at the CC will be accepted by the institution you want to transfer TO, on top of being specifically for the major.

I've set ALL of those classes for the next 2 and a half years. I'm not sure how much my parents know about that process, if anything, but by the time I'm 18, I choose my classes. Not them. And they're really just general STEM classes with more of an emphasis on comp sci, ofc with some bio mixed in so they don't get suspicious. But it won't be enough for a good bio program, and they won't know that until it comes time to submit the applications.

And when it does come time, preferably I'd tell them AFTER I've sent them out myself. The plan is to do the entire process myself, make SURE I send every application for comp sci, fake a bio essay or two if I have to along the way. And once it's set, I'll tell them sure, I mean eventually I'll have to so might as do it when they can't do anything about it. 

I've been preparing for a worst case as a result of that, which is they straight up kick me out. It's a good thing I have some years ahead of me to fully prepare with money, places to stay, etc etc. 

I'm hoping it doesn't come to that, that if I secure any internships or maybe I can get my professors to try and convince them...but if it DOES I have no problem cutting ties right then and there. It's my future, not theirs, at the end of the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically the spark notes version of what I'm trying to do college wise. I feel like as a person, just because of this, I've just grown a lot more mature. Grown into my own person, and it honestly feels like my life is in MY own control for once. In an asian/brown household, the feeling is pretty rare. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point with all this is to try and encourage all of you to plan your own life out. I can't stress it enough, this is YOUR life. Most of us are more than capable of doing what we set our mind too, DESPITE whatever your parents say. My parents insult me a thousand times a day lol. 

I've come to realize this is just how they're built, and it might not be their fault, they might have the best intentions for you deep down, but the mentality of ""setting our kids up for success no matter the cost, and only the way WE define success"" is extremely toxic. Only we know what we want. I'd advise all of you to go out and chase it, as corny as that sounds lul. 

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you need advice, feel free to DM as well. I'll try my best to help yall out, as a fellow struggling kid of overly controlling parents."

My parents are pretty old fashiones Asian parents so they were always telling me to get a real job and keep cooking as a hobby. I disagreed when I was younger so there would often be arguments between me and my mum. My dad was dissapointed but accepted and supported me, which on the bright side was a pretty good thing.

After the arguments started becoming too frequent and too much I decided i would just give in and listen to them. My mum had said some pretty harsh things but at the end of the day shes my mother and I love her to death so I didn't wanna strain my relationship with her. I was good at math and physics and ive been doing that for the past 3 years. Im now a month away from finishing my last year of high school. This last year has been really tough and has drained me. I like math and enjoy doing it to some extent but doing it for the rest of my life is an idea that scares me because of the lack of satisfaction I feel from doing well in math. I don't have the same passion for academics as i do for cooking and its been like that for a while. I get decent grades without putting in that much work and I never go the extra step because of how unsatisfying it is for me to do math.

I didn't have that much time to cook anymore because of my classes but every chance i got I leapt at. I love everything about cooking; learning the technique, trying new flavors, experimenting with new ideas. My YouTube feed is flooded with food and its less about the food and more about how i love watching other people cook.

Im making the decision that I want to pursue cooking professionally again. Despite the course ive taken and the money spent on me for tuition and added resources. My parents don't fully suspect that yet but im planning to surprise them with a fantastic meal that'll test me as a cook. Ive never cooked anything on that level before and i want to impress them. Show them what ive got.

What Ive been thinking about recently is what if they still say no, even if i knock their socks off. Then what? Ive only just turned 17 and don't have any income of my own. They'd have to finance me going to culinary school or anything else similar. My dads friend runs a pretty successful resturaunt where I live and the owner knows how much I love cooking. Hes willing to let me come for an internship over the break to learn the ropes, but only if both my parents agree. As you can guess my mum is really unsupportive of this.

Im hedging my bets that I can really WOW them, if they say no then I really don't know what I can do. This is probably the one thing ive wanted most in recent years, to be able to do what i love for the rest of my life. Any help on what I can do will really help.

Tl;dr, mum doesn't approve of me becoming a chef. Im going to make the best meal ive ever made so far  to help show them what ive got. If they say no, i don't have financial support to go to culinary school and i lose an internship at a resturaunt.

Also sorry for any typos i wrote this on mobile"
js2rbx,19,2020-11-11,ATTENTION PRE-PHARMACY STUDENTS *Pharmacy Summary/Recap*,Suspicious-Tree1189,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/js2rbx/attention_prepharmacy_students_pharmacy/,"I am a canadian pharmacist 2019 grad

IMAGINE:  Imagine this you spent 4 years in pharmacy. you spent 80k in tuition. you look for a job. most jobs are retail. most jobs in retail are part time. you have to make ends meet to pay back loans. you are stuck and wished you studied something else while you work 12 hour shifts with no break and phones constantly ringing in the background with irate customers, now repeat this with 5 days per week x 50 weeks x 40 years. you certainly are not going to be paid overtime for those 12 hours. Listen to the people who are in the pharmacy profession (not from outsiders who think so what you guys are getting paid 40 per hour hurr durr)

Your employers Shoppers and Rexall (who provide 70% of jobs) won't care whether you are canadian grad or international grad. They dont care that you are a doctor or that you spent 100k on tuition. Its whoever can take the lowest rate of pay.

If you are interested in HEALTH CARE. CONSIDER instead: optometry, nursing , dentistry, medicine, OT, PT, SLP, radiation tech, and physician assistants and many more. I don't see any posts regarding their profession on this subreddit

5) Would you want your advocacy group to call you an intern a ""hot commodity"" and encourage you to work a couple of dollars above minimum wage as a doctor because it's better than sitting at home?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Its also difficult to explain but because there is an oversupply of pharmacists, there is the backstabbing /everyman for himself/hunger games kind of culture I can't quite place a finger on especially for the desirable positions. I heard many stories of u of t pharm students being treated poorly during their hospital pharmay rotations. Survival of the fittest. This is another stressor of mine . I see everywhere signs of dismay. I heard U of T pharmacy just admitted 270 students instead of their usual 240 for this years class. I strongly do not think its due to more pharmacists being needed

&amp;#x200B;

IT IS NOT JUST THE LICENSING ISSUE. Lets take a step back. Connect the dots and reveal what is the true picture of pharmacy"

Looking at the hiring websites it seems most of the 2021 summer internship application has started, I am coming from a non-CS background and I might just finish 1\~2 courses before the internship application deadline which makes me less competitive and I doubt if I could ever find one.

For anyone who have been through this , could you share your experience how  you managed to get your first internship without CS background before MSCS. Your advice and insights are much appreciated!"

After that I felt the expected fear and depression but programming was my ""plan b"" all along. So after I left  I started to learn programming (mainly frontend web development). Eventually I got an unpaid internship at a small start-up with three senior and very experienced developers that accepted to do some on job training with the possibility of being hired.

I just started two weeks ago so I haven't been offered but they gave me a _real_ project and yesterday I was able to create a small typescript react app that (successfully) accessed their API and returned some values.

I know it's something very small but for me it's huge and I feel very proud and have a sense that I actually might just make it on this field.

I just wanted to share this because sometimes it feels like we're going down a path to nowhere but that may change from a moment to the next... Keep at it, guys/gals!! You might just make it! :)"

I have decided to make a career change and try to start working in IT, since computers have always been my passion since I was a kid.
I was planning on getting the A+ certificate to start and try to study and learn as much as possible from home (I am currently in lockdown for Covid reasons).
My question would be, is it worth it to go back to college and get a specific degree (it would have to be part time and would take me 6 years to finish) or are getting certificates and studying from home enough to start a career in IT, I was thinking something related to help desk and hardware maintenance or servers and network.
Thanks for any reply and help."

I haven’t had any internships due to covid and I haven’t done very well gpa wise for personal reasons. I’ve heard about certifications that u can get online that can add some flair to a resume. Idk if that’s true but if it is I’d like to know which ones actually help. 
I definitely want to get certified in coding, probably multiple, I do like coding and I’m good but I didn’t want to major or minor in it. As well as things like boot camps and code competitions. Also maybe certifications in engineering programs? I feel like just having a general sense for them is never a bad thing. I use to be certified in a few CAD programs and some similar to CAD. Idk if that could help. I’ve also seen things like certifications from google. Do they actually do anything on a resume? I think I’m interested in project management but I do want to keep my options open and stay broad about it. I’m a math major w a stats concentration. Is there anything that I can get to get certified in fields like that? Please let me know if there are any that actually help or if these would just be a waste of time. I want to spend my winter break on this.

I have also seen things like online websites w programs where u can do like mini projects for partnered companies to add to your resume. Is that soemthing I should also spend time on?"

They have a system for student employees to apply for a non-specific CS internship, and they then pass your resume onto teams that they think you can contribute to based on your skill set. My interests and long-term career goal is in the realm of networking and security. Today a recruiter reached out to me about interviewing for a software engineering internship which focuses on localizing and internationalizing our consumer products. I really have no interest in these things. The qualifications they sent me aren't a great match--out of the technical requirements, I probably meet about 25% of them.

Should I interview anyways? Every interview I've ever had has gone reasonably well, so I don't want this to be a disaster that gives me anxiety in future interviews, especially with technical questions that I have no chance of answering. If I somehow get the internship, should I accept it with the hope that it will be a stepping stone?"

I also have minimal experience with Angular. The thing is: even though I know the basics of HTML and CSS I wouldn't even know how to start making a good-looking website. 

How can I start learning that? Should I look into videos of people making clone apps (like a clone of Spotify Web App or Facebook) and try to replicate that? Is there a Udemy (or Youtube) course that teaches this? 

My main goal is to eventually be able to make full applications on my own (for working as a freelancer probably) .

Another question: Is it better to use Bootstrap or just learn advanced CSS (I guess the latter allows greater customization)?"

js9hus,2,2020-11-11,Internship at Big Financial Firm or Series E Startup in Bay Area,throw-away-dork,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/js9hus/internship_at_big_financial_firm_or_series_e/,"TL;DR If I was aiming for Big N/Unicorns when I graduate, is it better to intern at a big name finance firm or at a startup in Bay Area?

First off, this sub has helped me so much with interviewing and navigating job applications so thank you! Right now, I’m looking for some guidance on where my first and last internship should be. I’m currently a CS junior. I was offered a SWE internship at a big finance firm (A) and currently on final round interviews for a series E funded startup (B) in the Bay Area. I was weighing pros and cons between the two.

Pros of A: return offer rate for FT SWE is fairly high so not much stress come post-grad job hunting, good name on resume (subjective), LCOL office location

Cons of A: it’s a bank and not a software company (heard that working as SWE in banks is not a good way to get interviews at Big N companies but I’m not sure), not front office location, FT salary is not as competitive (but I’m fine with this due to LCOL)

Pros of B: an actual software company, if I get return offer for FT, I might gain from future IPO, their product is used by many Big N companies/unicorns, 1200+ employees so might be more tight knit

Cons of B: startup culture and in hyper growth stage so WLB is probably not as good, name might not be as well known so might have a hard time applying to Big N companies

Any insight is appreciated, again thanks!"

I am a recent college graduate. Throughout middle school and high school I was a pretty active and outstanding student, exercised every day and somewhat confident. It all might turned for the worst when I entered college though.

I have a minimum wage job ( 315.76 usd per month in my country) as an intern, I cant live up to the expectations of my family and friends, they think I am smart only because I have a bachelors on engineering. Every day I feel tired, even if I sleep 8 hours or more, sometimes I feel motivated and take courses or try to learn new things but that burns out quickly. I am also doing freelance jobs after work so I can save some money . I also feel absent minded, I say or do little stupid things that I would normally wont do, and my head feels heavy as well. I thought this was all due to my nasal polyps and what not but even after my second surgery I still feel tired, I have made several check ups with some doctors and everything looks fine. If you look at me rn I look way older, I look sick and way older. I want to improve and have the energy to keep growing, how can I start?"

My current university also has really nice professors that interact with the class more directly due to the smaller size (4000-5000 students).

jsc0eu,10,2020-11-11,Can someone pull me out of my remote college anxiety spiral please?,sunnirays,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/jsc0eu/can_someone_pull_me_out_of_my_remote_college/,"For context, I'm in the US, which we all know has been handling this whole pandemic better than the rest of world. *laughter sound effect*

So during the summer I decided to go ahead and be completely remote for my very first semester of college because I didn't want to have to deal with the drama of sudden spikes and anti-maskers potentially shutting down the campus and having to be remote anyway. 

In addition to that, I really have no way to get to school that's 30 minutes away by freeway (still working on getting my license, but once I get that, I still don't have a car). But my parents told me they could use this semester to potentially save for a second car I could use.

And this semester was okay. I'm a Computer Science major but I decided to spend this semester just getting my Gen-Eds out of the way along with my Calc prerequisite. The professors and TAs are nice, and most of them have done a good job adjusting their class to a remote setting. And I'm on my way to ending the semester with a 4.0 GPA which I can't complain about.

And I'd definitely be able to be on campus next semester right? It seemed like that until cases and hospitalizations starts spiking again, and apparently according to most experts the winter is probably going to be the worst and it won't start getting better again until March at earliest.

So you know who had to talk to her advisor and move her classes to the remote sections again? Do ya? It was me, yep.

In addition to that, you know you *still* doesn't have a car to get to campus with? YEP. Because you what's really been straining my parents financially??? YEP MY DAD'S PARTIALLY FURLOUGHED HOURS BECAUSE OF THE FUCKING PANDEMIC.

See, I already knew I'd be missing out on cool college stuff for the first semester. But now the entire school years been wiped out for me. And now I'm just spiralling thinking this is how I'll be going to college entirely. Never stepping a foot on campus. Never making any friends, because where do you talk outside of Zoom classes and overly organized virtual events? Never dating or fully coming out the closet because I can't go anywhere and my parents are super conservative and have no love in their hearts for queer people like me.

Also did I mention I've done my entire school career like this starting from first grade? That's right, I did virtual classrooms before it was cool and how poetic it would be if the fucking universe never let me in a real classroom where I can interact with real people!!

Imagine if I just did everything from my childhood bedroom huh? I go to school at my desk. I go to internships at my desk. I accept my diploma by mail and hold it up on the Zoom graduation (again). I go to my first money-making job from home with my mom constantly knocking to ask what I'm up to and how fun it is we'll get to be together forever.

I can't even really go to my college's virtual counseling thing to talk about all this because I know my mom would just interrupt and wondering who I'm talking to and it delve into a whole thing about how I just need to pray about it and I shouldn't be talking to them because they'll just tell my professors and future employers how crazy I am (that's not how it fucking works at all, but oKAY)

So yeah, I'm just frightened and sad and right now I can't tell if I want to laugh or cry (I also don't think I really know how to cry more than a couple tears every so often, but that's an entirely separate thing).

 If you made it through that whole thing, good job for surviving my emotional word vomit. Please send help :D

**Tl;dr:** very first semester of college is pretty well academically, but I am completely failing emotionally and socially due to isolation and family issues. All of which may persist because the pandemic is spiking again which means my second semester is also going to be remote"
jsc3mr,1,2020-11-11,Working as an engineer the first time,Zarr1,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/jsc3mr/working_as_an_engineer_the_first_time/,"I never worked as an engineer. And yet my master degree of Electrical engineering comes to an end soon.

I'm happy that I will be finishing after approximately 8 years of studying. But having not the best grades or studying longer than my peers makes me uncomfortable at times (most of my friends finished in 5 to 6 years).

But what did I do/experience what others may not? 
Well my father died during bachelor's degree. My gf left me after approximately a year later. 
I had my financial problems because of which I had to work more and focus less on studying (failed a few exams after starting the job).
Still things seemed to improve: I got a job in the university library and since last year I even got a coding job as a student in web development. 
I really would like to excel in coding but everyone other than me seems to do better than me. Or I am just focused on my self too much that I don't see the struggle of others?
This current job really drains me at times and I am worried I am doing the wrong thing, as I don't seem to be similar to others. 
I am a pretty social guy and thought about going to more sales related engineering positions. Is there something like this? Wherever I lurk, everyone seems to be telling that you need those superior coding skills (they will be coming by time for sure!). Do you need these skills there too?
I am the founder/organizer of a yoga group and we managed to approx. 15 people to join yoga with me at best times.
Today I got a problem with my laptop running into problems with my manjaro linux OS (I wanted to learn some basic shell commands and stuff like this). This problem really drained me to the core I couldn't even cry. The pure despair!
Having experienced again such a miserable experience (I still couldn't resolve my problem), I am asking myself whether you are happy with what you do as an electrical engineer?
Soon I will be in my internship and it will be the first time I'll be working as an engineer, provided that I can land an internship. Covid-19 is making recruiting much harder. 
What would you do differently now compared to when you started? 

Will there ever be a day in my life where I can routinely work through stuff and get home and love my kids?
I tend to take the work home. Especially now that everything is done from home (work/studying/seminar/sports) I don't have the separation between job and private life."

Is there any way I can have this send me alerts or notifications once a certain name has gone into the first or second rule implemented through conditional formatting? For example, if one name goes to ≤30 days, the cell turns red, but how could I have this notify the appropriate people? I believe it would have to be done through VBA, but not sure how.

Company A interviewed me and said they think I’ll be a good fit. They wanna call me later on to “go over details” not sure if this means I got the job, or if it means there’s a second interview. 

Company B has asked me to interview for three different departments. I completed the first two interviews today and they both went well! They said I should know if I got it by Friday or Monday.

Only thing is, my third interview for company B (the one I want the most) is on Friday, so I won’t know the results of that one until probably next week. __Human Resources schedules all the interviews and offers for company B so hopefully she will understand that I want to wait for all my offers at her company to come in.__

Basically, I don’t want to make a decision until I hear from company B. 

Do I ask company A to give me some time to think? Company B is a muchhhh better opportunity at a very prestigious company.

I just wanted to make sure that I'd be getting some type of valuable experience with digital ICs at this place before I turn down an offer at a company I could have only dreamed of working at when I was younger.

Which is what brings me to the title of this post. Has anyone here interned at a primarily government contractor doing work with digital design/verification? Was it worthwhile?

jsdlh1,5,2020-11-11,[UNI] SMU JD - only an opinion/rant,Additional-Fox-6168,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jsdlh1/uni_smu_jd_only_an_opinionrant/," 

This is just an opinion/rant.

The easy way through any education course, I suppose, is to basically do what the teacher tells you; by hook or crook, if you do it well, you get a A.

The SMU JD is designed the same; you are encouraged to do as the instructor says and thinks; intelligence is subjectively measured as opposed to being objective measured, e.g., if the instructor says 1 + 1 = 3, then in answering the same, you get an A, however, if you answer ""2"", then you get marked down; this is reflected in the how exams are graded; there is no external overseeing board of examination, just the same 1 guy who ""taught"" you marking your papers within record time (under a load of about more than a hundred papers, usually in 2 - 3 weeks, after teaching a couple of 10 week modules, with attendant research responsibilities still prevailing in the same time frame); so naturally that guy is just looking out for what he already believes and what he had said; there is no time to think about the utility or making sense of what you written; case in point, presentation marks are given for beautiful exam scripts (not sure if this is practiced elsewhere; surely not where I came from; answers are answers). At a public event, some lady who had climbed the public legal service hierarchy said, proudly, to the effect, just do as your instructor tells you to.

So...basically, this is a warning (I sure wished someone warned me; but if everyone is comfortable ceding their thinking to someone else because it gets you that grade, then...there wouldn't have been anyone out there to warn; looking to reddit, that may be why I found so little) to those who proudly experiment with their thinking and pride their originality and individuality above all else, who strive to be original thought perpetuation entities (I do pride myself as so, so, here I am warning) who knows that making mistakes in the pursuit of an ideal is fine and sometimes even necessary, please do not study at SMU, at least the JD programme; ask lots of questions of the programme staff and maybe audit a class to get comfortable before signing up; things might have changed after this post, but this advice, I think, stays true with time. I guess I should have known that something's wrong from the get go when students are deathly afraid of how an innocuous tone of voice may be found offensive by the instructor( finding it necessary to fear an instructor...what the hell...that is very messed up) or how some instructors are referred to as gods (...); or how an instructor told everyone, ""What you think does not matter"".

Again, please know that this is just an opinion/rant with some coinciding interest of informing one side of the JD story at SMU. After all that is said and done, I am looking forward to helping people solve problems as a lawyer (the probono attachments and internships are very good fun and inspiring), and very glad to be done with this s\*\*\* whenever this s\*\*\* ends. If you have any questions and don't mind a cynical-bias answer, I will try my best to answer them; I got some frustration left over, for now; I just really do not want anyone suffering from this disappointment, thinking about SMU as a university (again, maybe this is just how Singapore works) where you become a better person. Thinking now, I might actually suffer adverse inference for this from the institution; that's just my impression of SMU; and may be that's why, again, not so much stuff on reddit. Agreeing to play the game, does not necessarily mean I am happy about playing the game; I am not going to quit, but I am going to be stuffed about it."

Ive been working at this job for a little over 2 years now. Recently, my performance has been struggling, but overall, it's a job I'm pretty good at. However, the longer I do the job, the more I realize that this isn't what I want to do moving forward and it's been killing my motivation. I've told my supervisor that my motivation is down and I've asked for help and coaching. I've implemented my coachings and I've still been pretty unhappy with work for probably 3-5 months now.

My supervisor and I get along, but she isn't the best at what she does. Not the best leader and a massive micro-manager. I've lately been contemplating switching departments within the same company where I can do something different. However, the position I have now is one of the better paying positions in the company and I have a wife and a 3 year old at home that I plan on providing for(obviously).

I've had different career aspirations before, but when I tried to pursue them previously, I was unable to get a job in the field despite taking 2 unpaid internships, so my confidence in being able to pursue that again is minimal and again, the job i have now is better for me and my family financially.

My wife has been super supportive and has told me multiple times that if less pay makes me more happy then she'd be fine with me looking elsewhere. The problem is I don't know if I should risk the financial security, especially during difficult times like these.

Should I stick where I am, continue to ask for help and put forth my best effort, explore other departments in my company, or maybe give my dream another shot?

I appreciate anyone who may take time out of their day to help me out."

I'm a CS student who recently accepted an offer at a Unicorn Tech Company for an internship, and I will be going through an employment / background check, but I am worried about one of my experiences.

I had a data science job at a startup , which was temporary and meant for students. On my resume, I listed it as data science intern (My supervisor told me calling it an internship is fine given the context), and I put startup name for the company. However, this was actually an independently contracted role, which means I was not an employee at this company, and technically I am self-employed (I was not aware that independently contracted roles meant self-employment until recently).  I am worried because on the actual employment application form, as well as my resume, I listed the company as an employer. I am also slightly worried because I classified it as an internship as advised by my supervisor, but the official title would be something like ""Independently contracted Data Scientist"", and the company might not even have me on record, and say I didn't work there.

I'm wondering if this will be an issue? Should I tell my recruiter first or just let it play out? Lastly, do background checks tell you to give a contact for each job or do they find the contact information for the company themselves?

jsfzx9,305,2020-11-11,Tips for Graduate Admissions,rigrg,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/jsfzx9/tips_for_graduate_admissions/,"Hello Everyone,

I think it is the time when you are in the middle of your graduate applications. The deadlines will start knocking on your door starting next month. So, here are some of the pointers that may benefit you:

1. Please check out the WHOLE application requirements for your intended schools. Even if you don't have the stuff prepared, just go through with the entire requirements that the form requires.  
**Why am I stressing about this?**   
a) **UT Austin** requires you to submit **2** applications. That's right, and one more thing, you have to submit the first one **at least 4-5 days** before you submit the second one.  
b) **Harvard** doesn't (internally)parse links or any media file in your application. If you are planning on including hyperlinks on your SoPs, or attach any other image/video files, then you have to post all those things in a separate section of the application.  
c) **Columbia** asks you to find the courses that you have taken in your undergraduate similar to what they offer and input the relevant grade in those fields. That is such a pain in the a. If I remember correctly, Harvard does something similar.  
d) **Georgia Tech** asks you very selective questions with a very limited word count. It can be challenging.  
e) Stanford (or at least ICME) asks you to send the **Hard copy** of your transcripts. This is not common in other schools.
2. Please maintain an excel/keep sheet of all the deadlines. Sometimes, as many as 4 schools have a deadline on the same day. You really have to push through on those nights(or days depending on your timezone).  

3. Your SoP is not your extended CV. However, it is not very different from that. If you are confused then here are some of the pointers:  
a)Read very carefully what they are asking you.  Every word is there for a reason, and hence it is important to highlight those points in your answer.  
b) The first paragraph should be split between two parts. The first part should highlight what you want to do and the second should describe what you will gain from that experience. The following paragraphs should relate the past experience(not all, only the major ones) from your CV that lead you to choose the field that you chose. Example- Say you took a Biology class and you learned some awesome things (maybe a cool outcome) which kindled your interest in that field. Then you did a particular internship to get your hands dirty and after doing that, you got to know about the subtleties associated with that field. Do not forget to include the things that you learned from that experience. Then, write about the impact that the experience had on you which made you either continue on the field or switch to another one.  
d) In a nutshell -&gt; Why did you do it -- What you learned from it -- How did it impact on your future explorations.  

4. It may not be the case for everyone, but I think SoPs take at least 4-5 (or more) iterations to shape up. It's like pancakes, the first one will turn out to be bad. Be ready for that. Also, when you send it to your friends/colleagues, don't ask them 'how is it?', instead ask them 'What is wrong with it?'  

5. Some schools offer multiple programs with varying deadlines. Like **CMU** offers MS in CS, Vision, MCDS etc. If your budget and recommenders allow it, go ahead and submit for all of the programs. Also do keep in mind that some schools like **Stanford** only allow **1** application in one academic year.  

6. Please proof-read everything. It is not catastrophic, but it sometimes just kills the mood when reviewing and you don't want that.  

7. Do not hesitate to remind your recommenders if they delay in submitting their recos. It is always a good practice to get this done at least a week before the deadline, but if the deadline is approaching, do not hesitate to send them a polite reminder. Also, do check for the reco deadlines (sometimes it collides with the application deadline).  

8. Finally, just give your all. Please do not delve on the past. You messed up some grades; you can't do anything about that. You could have done better internships; yes it's possible. You don't have any publications; ITS OKAY. THE PAST IS THE PAST AND YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD DO. Please don't wallow and waste your time. You have the chance to present yourself in the best way possible. This is still in your hand. Go ahead and do that.   

9. One last thing-- It is very hard to tell you by looking at your profile if you'll get in some X school. Let me rephrase that, it's practically impossible. A publication boosts your profile, but a lack of that doesn't mean rejection. You're opting for a CS Masters and you have a B in Data Structures. This doesn't mean that you can't get into CMU. It is highly subjective and depends on a lot of factors. Do not get depressed and do not speculate on your results.  

10. JUST DO IT.

All the best! (I have not proofread this, so, please forgive me for any typos :P"

Advice,PenguinWithATuxedo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jsh4ld/sophomore_internship_and_life_advice/,"I'm pretty new to this subreddit, but I'm definitely in a bind, and need some good advice because I want to be able to be successful in getting big future internships next summer and a great job when I graduate. I go to an okay school for CS, definitely not considered top-tier by any means and I might be possibly transferring next year to UT Austin, but I chose this school because my National Merit Scholarship gives me a full ride here and I don't have to stress too much about anything financially. I'm pretty much breezing through my classes with a 4.0 GPA, which is part of the reason I'm thinking trying to get into UT Austin and getting a higher-level CS education would be beneficial but obviously it'd be a big change. That's probably a whole long post for another time. 

My main bind I'm in is this fall my main companies interested in me were State Farm and Microsoft for their Explore Program. Yesterday, I received an offer for the State Farm internship this summer, and I was ecstatic, and also let my Microsoft recruiter know immediately that I'd received an offer. This triggered an invite to the final round of interviews for Microsoft Explore about an hour later. Unfortunately, my offer from State Farm would expire (even with an extension) before I'd be able to even have the Explore final interview. 

So now I'm stuck deciding on taking the safe bet with State Farm or taking a change on a big fish with Microsoft. Obviously, my brain tells me logically to take the offer you have and not to wish on a star. But I've met so many people that have only gotten one chance at these huge companies and let it pass them by. Each internship has great pay and benefits, and I wouldn't be upset with either, but Microsoft would definitely be my number one choice. What should I do?

 Would turning down the final interview hurt my chances with them in the future for next summer? Or should I take this as a good sign that they're interested in me and I have a good chance for next summer, especially after having a strong internship like State Farm?"

I've been fortunate enough to have been offered an internship at a well known investment banking firm. I will be very happy to work there after I graduate if I get a return offer, but I want to aim for a different field and work at a trading company or hedge fund like JS/HRT/2Sigma out of college. I have been rejected for some of these companies this internship cycle, so I was wondering 

* What sort of student work do they tend to value, especially if I want to work on backend/devops stuff? Algorithmic research? Some project with evidence of highly optimized algorithms?
* If working at an IB will help me break into trading companies relative to other firms or does it count as a regular internship 
* What tech stack would be most helpful to enter the field (for example, JS purely works in OCaml and HRT only wants C++ coders)? Looking through all the trading companies all of them seem to be hiring FPGA engineers and stuff like that. 
* What field of mathematics I should focus on going forward to get those roles? I was planning on doing my undergrad math thesis on LTSMs, but given how saturated the ML field is getting I'm not sure if that's the right move.

jsihp9,41,2020-11-11,"After generating $2,900,945 I called it quits to agency-land and told my co-founder I was done. Toughest business decision I've had to make.",mizkos,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jsihp9/after_generating_2900945_i_called_it_quits_to/,"In 2016 - I decided to end my $2,000/day lead design contract role to focus on building my very first business. A design agency. It was an extremely exciting time for me because I had felt that I've learnt everything I could at the 400 person startup I was leading design at. 

Nov 2016 - I opened doors to my very first design studio (from my bedroom). It was tough. However there was no time to waste. I started responding to all the enquiries that had come through to my personal portfolio. Soon I was juggling 4-6 projects at a time. My goal was to save up enough to make my very first hire within the first year. 

I spent the first 6 months building runway. Another 2 months trialing interns and bringing on freelancers to see what it's like to have people 'in the team'. I also saw this as an opportunity get the feelers on all the boring accounting side of things.

Mid-2017 I had made my very first full-time hire. All I could think about was, crap I need to make $80,000 just to cover their salary. Figuring out the accounts and legalities around setting up the business efficiently was also a draining.

Early 2018 - I realised how quickly things could grow when you have a great team player and process in place. I had forgotten about the $80,000 burden and was already thinking about how I could bring on a second member to ramp up our capacity. 

April 2018 - I employed my second full-time product designer. Within the same year I hired another 4 more designers (1 Australia, 1 USA, 2 remote from the UK) and a product manager.

Things grew quick but in 2019 I felt stagnated. Personally. 

The company was running on it's own and I felt that I had no involvement anymore. The endless cycle of chasing project after project and not being able to see it through to the end (Eg. track how the product is performing, deeper understanding of the customers, increasing conversion rates etc) left me feel a little un-motivated. This really is just the nature of how agencies operate. 

Sadly, I had to make the tough decision to wind down the company because my heart wasn't in it anymore. I didn't want to waste everyone's time and sticking around to make a quick buck wasn't my intention. It was obviously on good terms and since everyone was such a snatch, they found themselves a new gig fairly quickly. 

By this time I had built over $1.7M in revenue and a dead agency. 

June 2019 - One of my best mates (who also so happened to be a product designer) had jumped out from his lead role to startup his own studio. Similar to me he had the same ambitions to start an agency and also run an innovation lab on the side to explore new ideas. To me it made sense to join forces so we could take what we had to the moon. My idea was that I would focus on the business and he could focus on the product/development side of things. 

December 2019 - We officially merged and I was happy to bring everything I had under his new brand. I thought a fresh start might be the solution to all my problems. There we were, ready to take the world by storm. We moved into a co-working space and we started working. We harmonised his strong visual style with my heavily growth-driven design strategies. With my contacts and networks we were able to immediately ramp up our top line profits and build a brand that the tech scene recognised. 

March 2020 - Within the first 2 months, we had brought on 2 new members but then... COVID hit. Nearly all our clients froze up for a month. Luckily we had an engagement locked in with a couple of very large corporates that helped keep us a float. Shortly after, one of our internal members breached our contract agreement and we had to let him go.

Throughout 2020 - We moved to a brand new office with great city views. We hired 6 more people (our very first developer as well) and generated over $1.2M in 9 months. With COVID and everything happening, we both agreed it was a up-hill battle every day. Throughout 2020 there were a few things I also came to realise:

1. Expectations - I'm fairly aggressive when it comes to business but I would never put it above my friendship. Since my co-founder and I have very different leadership styles and pace, I consciously made a number of trade offs to consider his preferences.

2. Timelines - My co-founder and I have the same vision but are living on different timelines. I've built a successful agency before and everything we were doing was reliving my previous agency life. On the contrary, he was fresh and excited about the new journey - as he should be. The different timelines led to different expectations and it was hard to stay aligned.

3. Passion - Ever since I was a teenager I've been creating websites and apps. I've always been curious and loved tracking and seeing how people would use them. I've also loved growing products, thinking tactically on how we can get more users, more usage etc. The agency was great as it gave me the opportunity to lead a team to create highly successful products for well funded companies. What it lacked was the ability to join them on the journey and really experience and see how they would perform and evolve. 

I also realised my passion for creating other people's visions started to deteriorate. In total I've directly helped over 70+ companies raise over $300M in venture capital. That's a lot of strategy and design work. 

November 2020 - In retrospective 2020 was a great run. We hit all our targets and since I was able to focus more on the business side the numbers we produced were very meaningful. $1.2M in 9 months is not too shabby. However on the 6th of November I pulled my co-founder aside and let him in on the news. I told him exactly how I felt and everything running through my mind. I knew I had to be 100% transparent with him. I had to tread carefully as I needed to balance the business and personal relationship I had with him. 

He understood but told me to have a think about it more over the weekend and we'll regroup on Monday.

The weekend was the worst I've had in years. However I still put together my thoughts in a Notion doc and what might the exit plan would be.

I was less worried about the business and more anxious about how he might feel or think. He had been one of my closest mates for the last 5 years and I didn't want the business to be involved.

Monday came and we had a catchup scheduled for 9AM. I'm normally quite calm and collected during these situations. However being on the other side of the table, I was nervous and went straight into the exit plan. Obviously feeling a little let down and disappointed, he acknowledged everything and also understood which was a relief. It was also good to see him approach this with an open mind. He was aligned that it would be best for us to part ways.

The wound is still fresh but I'm just glad we were able to align and meet each other half way. 

We're still in the process of organising all the paper work, the split etc. I know during these times we have to be VERY clear and document every little detail. The last thing I want is to end up burning bridges right at the end. We've organised numerous chats to iron out all our expectations so we don't miss any of them. 

What am I going to do next? 

I have a few ideas up my sleeve but I'm not in a rush to execute. 

A few things I have already started are:

1. A Javascript course that I'm 50% of the way through. I've been off the tools for quite a few years. I use to dev but I decided to go all in on UX back in 2008. I'm determined to up-skill and start building a few ideas into reality.
2. Document and share my journey more frequently on Twitter as I plan to launch a few new products.
3. Since I've been a mentor at Antler (A global VC fund for early staged startups) and General Assembly + Academy Xi (Mentoring UX design graduates) I realised I do get a kick out of seeing people crush goals. Something I'm fairly passionate about is to release for a couple of courses over the next few months.

jsikc3,0,2020-11-11,Anyone have experience with taking an unpaid leave from work?,braca_belua,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jsikc3/anyone_have_experience_with_taking_an_unpaid/,"TL;DR burnt out; title

I have been working for this company for a bit over 2 years now and have been feeling very burnt out since day 1 of working full time. I worked part-time as an intern while I was doing my masters and was only given a week after graduating before starting full time (I asked for longer but was told they needed me immediately). Since then, I’ve gone through multiple management changes and very little actual progress due to the company’s structure, and therefore my skills have gotten rusty. I live with my parents who both have cancer (one diagnosed within the past month) and I’m at my wits end with having my life on pause in the burbs.


Rant over, but I need a break and I’m hoping to ask my manager for unpaid time off. Right now my workload has been pretty light and my relationship with my manager is good, and he knows about my family situation, but I’m not sure if I want to float this idea by him. Because of the industry I’m in, things usually stay pretty light throughout the winter as well, but I’m worried due to this lighter load and companies making cuts cause of covid they may decide to remove me all together. There’s been discussion of giving me more tasks but it’s been months and I haven’t seen much change.


My questions: does anyone have experience with taking an unpaid leave from work? What effects did it have on you and/or your return? Did anyone lose their job after taking their leave? My reason would be to spend time and help with family while also trying to use this time to regrow some of my skillset/refresh. I’m hoping to take a month off just to regain some composure and process the changes going on in my life."

I already have an internship for this summer, so it would be like taking the next year-ish off. This would push my graduation from Fall 2021 to Spring 2022. Not a huge difference, I know, but I will have been in college for 6 years at that point and I wonder when delaying and delaying becomes too much. In normal circumstances, I would just turn it down and focus on graduating, but since online classes are really rough for me, I am considering just pushing graduation back another semester. My parents are very against this and think that there's no point since I'll be graduating will 3 internships anyway. I think this is a good and fair point, but in my mind, what's one more semester when I'll already have been in school for 6 years? 

What would you do? I kind of want to just get it over with and be done with school, but I also never expected to get an opportunity with one of these big tech companies. (ME for reference)"

I can barely cook and take care of myself, my sleep schedule is a mess, I can't get my classes ready - I burst into tears every time I try. I spend most of my time either contemplating death or trying to distract myself from the mental pain.

Both my best friend and my mother have adviced me to go on sick leave until Christmas. 

The thing is I'm a teacher in internship since September only, and I've already be on sick leave twice. 
- once because of an annoying cold I caught from the children's germs, being new to teaching, it happens a lot apparently. 
- once because I got covid19. 

So I've missed 3 weeks out of 9 so far, which I find is a lot already. 

I was visited by my tutor in October and he told me quite clearly that I was putting myself and the kids in danger because of the lack of disciplineand the lack of structure in my lessons - and I was just overwhelmed and anxious back then, not flat out depressed. 

Now I'm not in some weird country where I could get fired from justified sick leave, but I am still worried about the image it would give of me.

What everyone's been telling me is that kids are like sponges and it's no use going there depressed and with classes not ready when I was already struggling before that, and that if I do try there'll be no coming back.

What are your thoughts?"

I applied to 300+ places and they offered me first and I had to accept by a certain date. I accepted and will not be reneging, and now I got an offer for a spring co-op with Collins Aerospace and a fall co-op with Lockheed Martin. The collins Aerospace offer is perfect since it is work from home and They are allowing me to take an extended lunch break to take a mandatory class this semester. It is not exactly what I would love doing but it is an awesome wfh opportunity. The Lockheed Martin fall position is in person in fort worth Texas. The position at LM is much more interesting to me and I could genuinely see myself doing it in the long run.

jslm6h,408,2020-11-11,I started an incel chatroom and found love. HONEST!,DepthZero,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jslm6h/i_started_an_incel_chatroom_and_found_love_honest/,"As a female studying computer science, the ratio of men to women is four to one. I wouldn’t say I regularly dealt with full-blown incels, but there were plenty of ‘nice’ guys. I want to note that the majority were fine and just wanted to finish their degree.

It was only the small minority that made lude comments or sent me unsolicited messages just to ‘talk’. Their perception of reality and women, in general, was shocking, and I would always feel a mixture of pity and disgust as the messages I left unread piled up.

In mere minutes or hours, the messages would become hate filled and they would act as if they were owed something for bothering me. In the first year of university it didn’t take long for me to wisen up and limit my visibility on social media platforms.

Group assignments became a challenge because they were done over Facebook messenger but I’d created a separate account specifically for these occasions. The one place I couldn’t escape it was LinkedIn. It was important for networking, internships, a professional online presence and potentially securing jobs.

My efforts acted as a filter for the most motivated and quite frankly disgusting incels to find me.

Can’t find me on social media? Can’t get my number or email address? Well let’s systematically go down the list of every possible avenue of contact.

In my third year, I was sick of it and the anxiety of how I’d be treated in the industry upon graduation started affecting my grades. It wasn’t right that I had to limit how I lived my life because of these people.

A few things came to mind. Some are more disturbing than others.

1. Continue living my life under the radar of social media and overthinking every social interaction? No, I can’t keep this up.
2. Blast and block every creep on social media for their behaviour? Half of them didn’t use real accounts and the other half probably didn’t care.
3. Pretend I have a boyfriend? Like that would even work.
4. Actively try to make myself as unattractive as possible in the hopes I’d receive less attention. Fuck, no.
5. Drop university, disappoint my parents, give up my dreams and try something else. Again, fuck no.
6. Try to understand them? Maybe force them out of their echo chamber? Could it work?

Number six on the list got me thinking. If I started a chat room, I could remain anonymous and David Attenborough the shit out of them. I’m smart, my approach logical and analytical. Perhaps I could eventually think of something to change some minds.

Run a few trials, create some half convincing chatbots to do all the work and just see where it goes. The thought lingered for weeks before I spoke to one of the female professors about it. Professor Menzies office had been a place to confide for me and I’m sure many others.

After convincing her it would be an anonymous venture with limited danger, she gave me some advice and her approval. Even going so far as to say she’d find ways to provide me with extra credits for it even though it was outside the realms of my major.

I got to work after leaving her office. The hardest part was building the website and chat room which was more time consuming than difficult. Soon, ‘girlsforniceguys.com’ was up and running. I didn’t bother with chatbots in fear I wouldn’t be able to attract members to my honeypot.

But my god, it was the easiest part. I put some spare change on advertisements for google keywords such as

‘why don’t girls like me’

‘why don’t girls like nice guys’

‘why do girls like guys who are mean’

‘chads’

‘why do girls like bad boys’

‘why do girls like tallboys’

‘Why do nice guys finish last’

It was like shooting fish in a barrel. I scrambled to get my chatbots up and running. Their profile pictures were all generated with ‘thispersondoesnotexist.com’. They weren’t very useful, incels seemed to have spidey senses to detect them.

But what I found was I just needed one real girl in the main chat to keep them interested. For the next few weeks my evenings were divided between developing the chatbot’s framework, collecting data and maintaining interest in the chat.

It was over these weeks I started to notice one user in particular, UnlovedShadow. His comments weren’t the regular incel bullshit but rather very specific and detailed descriptions.

UnlovedShadow (20:13): My love smells like the freshness of flowers after a spring rain. Her scent dances around me on a bed of white lily flowers and violet leaves.

UnlovedShadow (22:28): Her cool brown eyes move in my direction through fiery red bangs. My heart flutters and cracks when I notice her stare straight past me.

UnlovedShadow (23:04): When my love writes her e’s she starts from the tail. It’s the little quirks that make me fall harder.

If these messages had come from three different people, I wouldn’t have picked up on it. Hell, the first was strange but I only picked it up going back through the chat logs. The thing is, I have brown eyes and red hair and I started my e’s from the tail-end. It was a habit I’d picked up in elementary.

Checking the back of my perfume bottle, I almost dropped it. I just liked the smell, never thinking of the actual ingredients. But there on the back was ‘white lily flowers’ and ‘violet leaves’.

Fighting the urge to shut the whole thing down and move countries, I gave in to curiosity and messaged UnlovedShadow privately.

Heather\_G4NG (18:02): I’ve noticed you in chat. It seems you're already smitten… Why are you here?

UnlovedShadow (18:02): She doesn’t see me.

Heather\_G4NG (18:04): Have you spoken to her before?

UnlovedShadow (18:04): Love can’t always be communicated verbally.

Heather\_G4NG (18:05): Well, what’s the lucky girls name?

UnlovedShadow (18:05): Eve.

My throat tightened though I’d already known it could be me, hearing it made it real. *Eve was my name*.

UnlovedShadow (18:05): It’s complicated. I’m not sure it would ever work. But if it did, I could help her in so many ways.

*What. The. Fuck.* I could hear my heart beating in my chest. My hands trembled as I replied.

Heather\_G4NG (18:06): What?

Heather\_G4NG (18:06): What would you do to help her I mean?

UnlovedShadow (18:07): It wouldn’t be appropriate to say. My darling’s curious, I’m sure in time she might approach me to find out.

*How do you even respond to something like that?*

Heather\_G4NG (18:09): UnlovedShadow sounds so dark. What’s your real name?

UnlovedShadow (18:10): Drew. Yours?

I couldn’t think of a Drew. He could be lying or maybe I really hadn’t noticed him before..

Heather\_G4NG (18:11): Heather haha

UnlovedShadow (18:11): Mhm.

*Did he know?* Panicking, I wrote an excuse before clicking out of the browser.

Heather\_G4NG (18:11): I have to go. It was nice meeting you.

I couldn't go to my remaining classes for the week. My anxiety flared up at the thought of leaving the house. On Saturday, I decided to finally email Professor Menzies about what had happened.

When I opened my university emails, I found a message from her sitting in my inbox.

‘’Hi Eve,

Prof. Jackson notified me of your absence and I started to worry your side project might be taking up your time. I did mention it to him last week in confidence so here’s to hoping he cuts you some slack.

Please let me know how everything is going,

Prof Menzies”

*Wait, she told him?*

I didn’t know his first name, our university was very strict on proper edicate when speaking to professors and lecturers. Checking back through my emails, I found an old class-wide email from him at the start of the semester.

He’d signed it off with *‘Professor Andrew Jackson’*

I started to type out a reply to Professor Menzies when there was a knock on my door. Peering through the peephole, I could see Andrew standing there. I won’t tell you what HE said to get me to open it.

But, it was Sweet enough for me to open iT. He’s so nice, smart, gentle And caring. I’ve Now let him spenD the weekend here and I’m so Infatuated that I had to tell everyoNe (with his blessinG of course) about this story. Don’t hide from those you love because it can change your life.

Go against your Better judgEment and give tHem a chance. It really Is worth it, Now I should say, Don’t give up people, Meeting the right person is a different experience Each time."
jsly1e,2,2020-11-11,"What is a more valuable experience? An engineering internship in the exact industry you want to be in or an ""Operations Leadership Development Program"" in a similar industry?",Emergency-Cookie,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jsly1e/what_is_a_more_valuable_experience_an_engineering/,"First off, let me preface this post by acknowledging that I am extremely privileged to have been given the opportunity to even have a choice between internships during this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a good dilemma, I have the choice between two different internship offers for this upcoming summer. The first internship offer I have already accepted (OLDP) because I was not expecting to get an offer from the second company. Both companies are in the medical industry, but they have different specialties. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first company has more of a focus on capital equipment for laboratory diagnostics and pharmaceutical production, they also produce some of their own pharmaceuticals. Their leadership development program is mostly involved in manufacturing/project management. It is basically a pipeline to their full-time rotational program after graduation. I accepted the offer even though their part of the medical industry doesn't necessarily align with my career aspirations because it was the first offer I received. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second company designs and manufactures implantable medical devices. I would be working as a manufacturing engineer intern in process development for these implants. This opportunity is in the exact part of the medical industry that I want to be in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both internships pay about the same, pay for housing and relocation. Company 1 is much closer to home and company 2 is about halfway across the country for me. At this moment both of them are planning to be in person, but I think Company 1 has a higher chance due to them having less interns than Company 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue comes down to whether I just bite the bullet and accept the awkwardness of rescinding the first internship offer and go with the second. Or if I stay with the first internship because of its potential leadership experiences/potential full time employment opportunity in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could anybody help to give me any insight on what may be the best choice here? Are leadership development programs worth it?  Also if you have any tips for rejecting accepted offers? Thank you."

The class is not hard. Or rather, not too hard. But I'm having an awful time. I feel like the words go over my head and I feel completely unmotivated. To the point where I'm questioning whether I even want to work in this field. I thought I loved Verilog, but it is pretty awful.

For instance, they're having us implement the logic behind Google TPU for our next lab, and none of the arithmetic makes any sense to me.

I remember going through resources and being so excited about being an engineer in high school, but the magic is gone. I need to finish my degree because I'm close to graduating. I hardly ever even study anymore, I'm always trying to get by doing the bare minimum. If I go down this trajectory, my GPA is going to plummet.

I'm learning nothing, but somehow I manage to soft-skill myself into super-prestigious internship roles and such (think Big 4 computer engineering). I like the money, but I'm not entirely sure if any of this makes sense to me. I've recently been thinking if I should figure out how to move to a less technical role.

Did anyone here ever go through phases of disillusionment in college, and how did they pull themselves out and work hard to make it through the hell that the degree can be? Did things get better once you got into the industry?"

I am a Junior who accepted an offer at Goldman Sachs NY Office in September for a summer internship. I'm studying cs and math at a top 10 CS school and since GS has an exploding offer, I didn't try to try to interview at too many companies before I accepted.

Once I accepted, after searching around, I realized that GS isn't as prestigious as I thought, but honestly, I was getting no interviews at any FAANG companies, so I think I made the right choice in accepting, rather than gambling I would find something better.

My question is, where do I go from here? I know interviewing for a grad job is even more difficult than internships, and considering the amount of traction I was getting from my intern apps, this is not good news. I have been taking mainly math/theoretical cs classes -- should I take more applied courses? I enjoy theoretical CS/math more than applied, so I was hoping for a shot at companies like JS,citadel, etc. but that seems like a long shot, so I'm pretty confused where to go from here.

Is there anything I can do in the next year to make myself a good candidate for prestigious/well-paying companies?"

I'm a student who recently accepted an offer at a tech company for an internship, and I will be going through an employment / background check, but I am worried about one of my experiences.

I had a data science job at a startup , which was temporary and meant for students. On my resume, I listed it as data science intern (My supervisor told me calling it an internship is fine given the context), and I put startup name for the company. However, this was actually an independently contracted role, which means I was not an employee at this company, and technically I am self-employed (I was not aware that independently contracted roles meant self-employment until recently). 

I am worried because on the actual employment application form, as well as my resume, I listed the company as an employer. I am also slightly worried because I classified it as an internship as advised by my supervisor, but the official title would be something like ""Independently contracted Data Scientist"", and the company might not even have me on record, and say I didn't work there.

I'm wondering if this will be an issue? Should I tell my recruiter first or just let it play out? Lastly, do background checks tell you to give a contact for each job or do they find the contact information for the company themselves?

Thank you!"

I am a computer nerd since I was a kid and absolutely love coding and my cs field.

My university isn't very good though (not even in the top 1500) but luckily in CS you can learn most of the stuff online so I don't really feel very bad about it (I had to choose this Uni because I cannot currently afford going abroad for my bachelors). My plan is to go to US or UK for masters in a top ranking university after my bachelors is complete.

I plan on building ML/AI skills so when I graduate I have an amazing CV which would allow me to get internships or jobs opportunities in big companies like google, and allow me to get into universities like Harvard, Stanford and Oxford etc for my masters. To compensate for my below average university degree I want to build my skills better and since I believe AI is not as saturated so it would be easier for me to stand out.

So what skills should I learn and how do I build a good CV as a Ai/Ml engineer.

Just to add currently I know C++, studying data structures this semester. 

Thank you in advance for any help and guidance."

I’m currently considering switching my major from Biomedical engineering to Aerospace for multiple reasons. 

- My family has had major connections with a company that manufactures airplanes for the military for three generations. This company is one of the largest in our area. This company is always offering opportunities to offer experience, co-ops, internships to my university. My family worked (still have family at this company currently working) under this company with no college degree, no education background. Their job was assembling the F-14, F-16, and F-18 planes. My opportunities for getting a job at this company I would hope are very high and getting a degree in aerospace would be even better. 

- I live in Texas (DFW area to be specific). Jobs and opportunities for Aerospace engineers are rampant out here. Boeing, NASA, Lockheed Martin, DFW airport, U.S department of transportation have many opportunities for people living in this area.

- I have taken an aerospace class but am currently taking biomedical engineering classes. The difference is that aerospace is more difficult but it is a lot more engaging. Biomedical is extremely boring but a little easier. 

- My university combines aerospace and mechanical engineering (I don’t know if all universities do this) so I’d be getting more out of it than biomedical. 

- Aerospace was going to be my major before biomedical. The only reason I did biomedical was because my parents talked me into it. I told them about me wanting to switch. 

Just the reasons I’ve considered switching. 

Anyway I made this post because I have so many questions. If you have any experience with any of these two degrees what is your advice? 

-What is the job outlook like? 
-Would you recommend me switching majors given the things I listed above?
-What should I know before switching?
-What are the pros and cons?
I’m interested to hear anything you’d like to say regarding this situation along with some experience you’ve had. It will be extremely helpful."

So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. I was diagnosed with cancer in my 3rd year of college and, as a result, I was not able to secure an internship during college due to having surgeries and treatment such as chemotherapy. I fell into a pit of depression and lost a lot of passion and interest for CS and school in general. I forced myself to finish school and graduated with a 3.1 GPA. 

I've been having trouble finding work after graduating in December 2019. Before covid hit, I was getting a decent number of interviews (I applied to 200+ places and got 7 interviews between December and March). I made it to the 2nd round for 1 company and final round for another before they stopped the hiring process due to covid.

In April, after a checkup, I discovered that my cancer had come back and I would have to begin treatment again. This destroyed me mentally because I thought I had taken care of this issue. I took a half year break from looking for jobs and just focused on getting better. In the meantime, my friend and I teamed up to re-sell clothing for cash. I was making a decent amount of money from this and just decided to do this for the time being. I was also teaching myself some web development such as the MERN stack and made several projects, while also working on leetcode.

Towards the end of September, I was able to stop treatment and was declared to be in remission again (thank god). I started applying for jobs again in October. Now it's been almost a year since graduating and I feel like almost every application I send is just being ignored. It feels almost hopeless for me to start my career, especially with nearly a year gap after graduation. I'm lost and need advice on how to proceed. I don't know how to explain this gap as I feel like employers look down upon illnesses.

Thanks."

jsqouy,77,2020-11-12,Unfair Advantages of a Rich High School vs a Poor High School in College Admissions + College Life,AtomicLeetC0de,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jsqouy/unfair_advantages_of_a_rich_high_school_vs_a_poor/,"I am making this post to hopefully help out any current students that come from a similar low-income background as myself and to draw attention to the disparities of a low-income first generation student vs rich students in College. I also wanted to shed my experience of high school and college admissions for any students trying to enter a top 4 year university.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**My background is:**

I am a first-generation student that went to Delcastle Technical High School in Delaware. Now for anyone who doesn't know, DE public high schools are lacking heavily in education. In Delaware for example, all public high schools have an SAT of about \~1000/1600, many fights, heavy drug-use, many dropout, etc. My high school for example has an average SAT of 980/1600, 15% math proficiency, 39% reading proficiency and is ranked #13,345-17,792 in the [National Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings), has no AP classes, no college prep, no SAT resources, highest level math offered is Senior algebra, only honors English offered, etc. Many of those from my high school end up not going to a 4-year university let alone barely make it to community college before dropping out; this is very similar to others from equally low high schools in DE.

Now when you compare to the best high school in DE, Wilmington Charter (which is ridiculously far far better than all other schools in the state), their average SAT is a 1350 and all of their students can end up at a top 20 university (many ivy league).

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Now, my personal experience during college admissions as a first-generation, under $50,000 household was that it was very very difficult. You navigate everything on your own, no resources available, but you try to make the best out of it. I took the SAT and managed to obtain a 1230/1600 which is +250 points far higher than my school's average with no help whatsoever, no tutoring, no SAT prep. I'm guessing that due to my ""high"" SAT score, Harvard actually ended up mailing me an admissions letter and upon first seeing the letter, I could not believe it. I showed the letter to my family and friends and we were all very excited. When college admissions came around I decided to apply to Harvard even though I had no idea of what to do or where to begin. At this point ask yourself: how do you prepare to apply to Harvard when college prep is non-existent to begin with, when your school has no AP courses, when your school has no extracurriculars to stand out, etc? Regardless, I applied and was interviewed by a Harvard alumni that is a CEO of a major chemical company in Delaware at the Wilmington country club (the most fanciest place I have stepped foot in to say the least), they were very nice. They began interviewing me, asking me about extracuriculars, high school experiences, but I could barely give any adequate responses due to the lack of any of these things during my time in high school. Long story short, the interview went okay, but unfortunately and of course I was rejected. At the end, I only managed to apply to 3 schools: Harvard, University of Delaware, and some random school.

Fast-forward later I am currently attending the University of Delaware (could not afford out-of-state tuition so decided UD was best since it is a top 100 ranked university and their CS program is alright), and I am studying Computer Science. Initially, I struggled very hard due to the lack of preparatory math courses in my high school and this was first apparent during Freshmen year where I struggled with Calculus I, ended up dropping it, and instead took Pre-Calculus for Engineers. Simply put, I worked hard, spent many sleepless nights working and working to catch up while noticing that others from within my major that went to very good high schools from their states where they had average SAT scores of 1300, cruised through classes because they did not have to learn everything from scratch. 

**Now currently November 12 2020:**

I have had 3 software/CS internships (I have another internship lined up for Spring 2021), I am doing undergraduate research, have a 3.5+ GPA, and I am a few courses away from graduating. I have received 4 offers during this Covid season and everything is working out well currently. My future goals are to work full-time as a software engineer and plan to acheive my Masters + PhD in the near future after working for a bit.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**To summarize and what I hope to bring across to any student with a similar background as me or to any student in general:** please in any shape or form, don't give up. I often found myself saddened by the fact that I had to work much much harder than others for the same result because they came from a great background surrounded by networks upon networks of people they could receive help from. They did not struggle in any way as I did, nor did they have any financial struggles (I pay university on my own with money that I earn from my CS internships). Be proud of where you come from and if you keep that same work ethic to catch up, you will ultimately pass others who are in a comfort zone.

What’s good about my current employer is that I did my internship there so I’m familiar with the environment, it’s very easy to learn new skills as the other engineers help and as a junior you’re allowed to touch high end stuff in production, management are very chilled out, we have the option to move teams so can delve into different parts of DevOps such as the security side, or the infrastructure side, on top of chilled out management we also get to WFH whenever we need to, and have flexi hours so can get an extra 2 days off a month.

If I look for another junior DevOps role, I’ll almost certainly get a higher salary, but it’s not certain that I’ll be working somewhere like where I am right now, where I get all the support I need, and allowed to develop how I want to, with the freedom of switching teams and areas, as well as seeing production level stuff, and also potentially losing out on the benefits of a relaxed office environment where I can WFH and have flexi days off.

I am here seeking suggestions and help with my carrer/life.

I don’t know where my life is going. I am scared that I’m not good enough. I see all these people solving hard questions on leetcode when I’m struggling with medium and easy ones. I lost my motivation to solve leetcode. I pretty much just look at the question and if my brain feels confused and thinks its a hard one for me and it gives up. It doens’t let my even think about the solution. I don’t know what this is called but I am pretty sure it’s fear of failure and I don’t know what to do about it or where to get help.

I am trying to get out of this situation but with all the online classes and almost zero interaction with other humans, I think I’m failing and going into depression. All i do in a day is attend classes and open leetcode and feel depressed. This is really affecting my daily life. (I couldn’t focus on anything, cannot exercise and can’t even apply for internships as this is the only thing that runs in my mind and it doesn’t let me do anything). 

How do i overcome this? How do I code everyday consistently like those guys who post on leetcode that they did for 60 days and got an job? [If you’re one of those, congrats]

Any new server turned on would sputter and die before it even got to the main boot stage.

jsyicv,1,2020-11-12,Internship Offer Dilemma,weekendbillionaire,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/jsyicv/internship_offer_dilemma/,"I'm currently really invested in 2 internships - one of them is for consulting and another is for product management. The consulting one has already given me an offer that expires today, but the product management one won't have an answer for me until the next, even though I told them I had a competing offer.

I already asked to push the deadline of the consulting one back so this deadline would be my final deadline. I'm really distraught on what to do because I really really want the product management one, but I'm not sure that I'll get it. My superday for it went okay, I think I answered one technical question a bit weirdly but I emailed her afterward to thank her and she asked me to connect with her on LinkedIn.

If I get the product management one, I'll probably take the return offer, but I can't say the same with the consulting one. The worst case scenario is that I don't accept the consulting offer this week and I don't get the product management one, leaving me with no internship. I don't think reneging on the consulting one if I get the PM one is an option because the consulting firm is a subsidiary of this really well known consulting firm that I might want to recruit for next year.

(To give a little more context, the product management one is for a well-known credit card company.)

I'm just really tired and burnt out - my mental health is crumbling and I don't know if I can do this again and again. Taking the consulting one means I have to recruit again next year, and if I get the product management one, I might be set for a job if I'm offered a return. I just want to finally be able to support my family when I graduate college. Any advice would be so so kind &lt;3

tl;dr: **I don't know if I should wait it out past my internship offer to see if the other company will take me, or just take the offer right now.**

for more context if u read this far: my brother is unemployed and I feel so much stress to support my parents and finally have some security in my life."

Gonna be a really long post, I’d appreciate if at least one person can read through this and make me understand why I am / how to stop being an asshole. 

I think it first starts out with me being touched / abused by my female caretaker since I was 5-8 years old. At 6, I end up being in a Roman Catholic all boys primary and secondary school. I never knew how to make friends, still don’t exactly know how to. I was bullied to oblivion for being that “nerdy kid who doesn’t have friends” And it basically carried on till I was 13. Managed to make a few “friends” in Secondary school, but I ended up fighting / arguing with almost all of them. I just thought they’d always make fun of me and they never truly were my friends. That wasn’t the case I think. I started to realise I was bisexual when I was 14, and honestly a huge part of me believes why I’m attracted to men is because I was touched as a child; and I no longer see women the same way. I also used to get beat by my mum for not getting good grades in primary school, it sort of stopped when I was around 12/13 and she just gave up on me. 

I came out to my parents and told them what happened to me as a child and also me telling them I’m bi, but they just brushed me off and said I’m crazy and didn’t talk further about it. Never told anyone else, apart from my therapist I had for a while. 
Therapy is very looked down upon in Asia. It sort of signifies something is wrong with you and you shouldn’t exactly be part of society. 

I got bullied into oblivion in secondary school for making harmless YouTube videos (gaming skits etc etc) and even my teachers made fun of me for it. One of the Teachers allowed me to get made fun of while she was in the class. I gave up on studies completely when I was around 14, I got U’s for everything (I was basically scoring between 0-10 marks for my subjects (except English and Literature, because those were the only 2 subjects I enjoyed)

I was told that I had ADHD when I was young, but my mum never got treatment for me because she never believed in the idea of ADHD. She wanted me to be a normal child. So I never got medication / therapy or anything for it. I think I live with it now. 

Going back to being bullied in secondary school. The cyber bullying was so bad, I ended up developing psychotic depression, ptsd and general anxiety disorder with ocd features / symptoms. I nearly killed myself 4 times. I couldn’t handle the voices or the hallucinations, my sleepless nights, the bullying. I had comments saying I should kill myself on YouTube 

I made a lot of “neighbourhood friends” who I used to play soccer with daily since I was 6-16, but again I always felt bullied by them and made fun of. Somehow I ended up having oral sex with one of them at 14, and I’m still incredibly ashamed of it. He was my best friend out of the lot, he never bullied me tho. But after that act, everything changed. I could no longer look at him the same way. 

Being in all boys Roman Catholic school means I never interacted with girls ever. The first time I ever interacted with a girl was when I was 17. I somehow miraculously managed to get C’s and 2 A’s for my GSCE’s and was lucky my school didn’t make me repeat twice (I was warned twice but they let me off) 

So in private college; I just didn’t know how to act with girls. I still don’t. In fact, I secretly hate women. I just can’t help it. Every time I think of a girl, I always end up thinking it’s my caretaker. Again somehow I managed to make friends in my class, some of them being girls, but again I would end up being made fun of. But actually this time, they were actually nice and were joking with me; but I saw that as a threat and would always burst in anger when they made a joke about me. Same went with the friends I made in an internship. Nobody wanted to hang out with me, not after class, not casually, not on my birthday. I spent my 18th birthday alone, drinking 6 shots of vodka and pretending I’m alright. 

I always think people are out to get me. I just can’t stop thinking that way. It’s just hard. I have major trust issues. I think of girls like they’re enemies, I can’t help having these preconceived thoughts that most girls my age are gold diggers / untrustworthy and I can never date a girl because I’m afraid they’d end up raping me. I’m even afraid to date guys because being gay is looked down upon. Anti-LGBT, and I hate that I’m gay.  Yet I crave for a relationship and friendships. I can’t stop being an asshole. I can’t go to therapy because of circumstances here and especially because of Corona. 
My parents views have slightly changed about mental health and LGBT, but I’d be never be able to out to them and they still think that I’d never have mental illness “he’s my son so he wouldn’t be gay / have mental illnesses” 

I just can’t stop being an asshole and I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t think I’m gonna reply, but I’ll be reading comments. I’d appreciate if anyone takes the time to reply to my post"

Background: I recently graduated in May from a non-target (but top 15 public school) with a degree in Finance and Management Information Systems. I had above average grades, but didn't do as good of a job as I could have networking. This, combined with the pandemic definitely hurt my job prospects, and after a long search and many interviews I was able to get a job as a middle office trade support analyst in FICC S&amp;T for a BB in New York City.

I know that my stats aren’t fantastic; if you think that there are ways to improve my stats, please state what summer programs I could do, what ECs I could do, etc.

Edit: I got a wholesome award from an awesome individual!  My first award!  Thank you so much!"

I am a Canadian who is looking to move with my partner to The Netherlands. Being a software developer, I'm interested in working specifically in Amsterdam because of the level of opportunities and higher salaries, compared to the rest of The Netherlands.

A lot of companies have been asking me for my expected salary range, and after some research, I came up with 4500-5000€ (edit: per month, before tax). Factors I have considered include:

* 4 years of work experience, on top of 1 year of internships
* Working with in-demand technologies like Javascript, UI frameworks like Vue/React, and Ruby/Python
* I am working for a renowned company - not necessarily internationally famous, but HR seems to recognize the name when we talk in phone screenings.
* I am aiming for bigger companies that are widely known in the Netherlands.
* I work in a pretty competitive environment and aim for a position that will be more challenging than usual. (Work/life balance is still important though, so not sure if that range accommodates that.)

I have researched using LinkedIn salaries, some recent information I found online, and extrapolated from other Reddit threads I found here and in /r/Amsterdam.

**Is this salary range too high or low?** I'm worried that I would be so off as to scare away my chances or risk getting lowballed. The salaries seem to be wildly different, and I'm guilty of not valuing myself as I should in the past.

\-How long is too long when it comes to graduating and getting your first job? I graduated 6 months ago and am beginning to worry about this gap getting larger and larger. I know the circumstances going on with covid and how brutal the job market is, but its still worrying to me.

\-With the way things are going, is it a good idea to do a bootcamp just for that little bit of extra oomph on the resume?

\-Is a CS degree applicable to other related professions? Can I start applying for business/financial roles elsewhere? 

\-Other new grads, how is the job search going for you guys, how many applications have you sent out/how many responses have you received?

Any advice is appreciated, I know there are threads like this posted almost everyday, but I wanted to condense my questions into one post so that me and other new grads can get their questions answered."
jt3vzw,1,2020-11-12,Assigned to fix failing tests. Need help figuring out how to get help.,_alber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jt3vzw/assigned_to_fix_failing_tests_need_help_figuring/,"**Background**

I am doing an internship with a large software company. I work in the data team, but have recently been assigned to be the data teams representative to a team who is responsible for overhauling the entire UI of our main product. The changes to the UI and resulting code that handles how data is passed to the UI has caused a large number of tests to fail.

I suppose in order to speed up the work, the failing unit tests have been assigned across multiple people, including myself. I have been given responsibility to fix the failing tests that have to do with the data team's code. 

**The Problem**

Now, I haven't actually worked with this code at all, nor have I done any of the changes causing the tests to fail. So naturally there is a bit of a learning curve for me trying to figure out how to fix these tests. However when I have asked for help, I have been told just to ask questions when I get stuck, so what I have tried doing is just looking at why the tests are failing, following the code, finding where something is returning nothing where it should be returning something, and trying to figure out what it should be returning.

This takes me a really long time, because I don't actually know what a lot of this code is supposed to do. If you were in my situation, what sorts of questions would you ask in order to get the help you needed to solve this?

**Extra Thoughts**

Is it a normal practice to have interns fix failing tests that another developers changes have broken? I have had 2 software development jobs before this, and it has always been the case, that if your changes break tests, you should be the one to update the tests."
jt44ro,0,2020-11-12,Is CS TA-ship worth it?,NINE3888,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jt44ro/is_cs_taship_worth_it/,"Hello, I am an undergraduate student in my second year currently. I was wondering if being a TA for a CS course is worth anything when applying for a job/internship in the industry. I was thinking of being a TA or a Research Assistant over the summer instead of looking for internships as applying to multiple companies (and most likely getting ghosted by them) feels like a lot of work with very little chance of success. I have applied to a few companies and am in talks with some of  them right now, so if there comes a situation where I get an offer to work for a decent company in town and also get the opportunity to be a TA or even a Research Assistant, how should I rank these 3 offers?

I have heard stories about how being a TA is like a life settlers as you have the reference letter of a professor who has a lot of connections in the industry, but I'm really confused as to what to do during my summer. Of course if all fails, I will be working on my personal projects.

Any words of wisdom are welcome."
jt45t3,10,2020-11-12,Landed an Entry level SOC job!,Reddituser_56,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jt45t3/landed_an_entry_level_soc_job/,"Hello!

I just recently accepted a Jr SOC Analyst position and thought some of you might be interested in my IT journey so far.

Summer 2017: Internship with small govt contractor working closely with Sys. admin 

Summer 2018: Internship as a Tier 2 deskside technician in federal building 

May 2019: Graduated with MIS degree 

May 2019: Joined full time as a Tier 2 technician at the same place I interned ($54,000)

January 2020: Received raise bring salary to $56,000

July 2020: Completed Sec+ certification 

November 2020: Accepted position as Jr SOC analyst ($68,000)




Some Notes:

Location is DMV so salary is definitely inflated due to high COL. 

I began applying like crazy after I received Sec+ and noticed the job market is definitely heating up in the DMV compared to spring/summer.

Sec+ was massively helpful in getting interviews in my area. Some places had Sec+ as basically the only requirement.

Interview for the position was basically a panel interview where they asked me vocab terms from the sec+ exam lol (ips vs IDS, tcp vs udp, worm vs virus) 

Starting on night shift but felt experience/salary was too good to pass up on.

I also got extremely lucky because the position is full time remote even after covid. 


Overall I feel extremely fortunate with how quickly my IT journey has progressed!"
jt47gw,0,2020-11-12,Hate Computer Science going into college..switch to Physics?,thejazzy420,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jt47gw/hate_computer_science_going_into_collegeswitch_to/,"I've been at uni for a semester now, and I declared my major in computer science. I chose it as a combination of a lot of things (high paying jobs, good career prospects, how dope it sounds, + a genuine interest in the subject). I remember in middle school and high school being involved in several coding camps/hackathons and I even created an android app in 8th grade and won first place in one, which was dope then. In high school, I also took a physics course for science sequence and also took two physics dual credits courses at a local college, which I completely loved. I was immersed in every lecture and loved talking to people about how things worked. It was a feeling that I've never felt in any other subject - a close second being math. I'm currently in my first computer science course and I absolutely hate going to lectures, writing code, going to labs, it simply doesn't excite me. I thought this would change within the past few months - but it hasn't. I've gotten several offers to intern at companies for summer 2021 and the thought of sitting down for hours on end writing code seems soul-draining to me; I constantly think there is something wrong with me because in a field of innovation and something I'm supposed to love, I'm simply not excited to even learn. Due to the pandemic and other personal stuff, I've had several friends and family die, causing some very low days-weeks and a realignment of my priorities. So, just wondering if anyone has any input? Should I continue to pursue CS in hopes I'll come to enjoy it in the future or switch major to physics, which I know I'll enjoy, especially since they have more team-oriented environments and are also very focused in academia."
jt4hf7,2,2020-11-12,Keep Cushy QA Co-op or Accept Riskier Software Engineering Internship?,Nonethewiserer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jt4hf7/keep_cushy_qa_coop_or_accept_riskier_software/,"It looks like I will be offered a software engineering internship but I can't help but feel *discouraged* by the prospect of accepting it. On the one-hand it seems like a career break-through, yet I'm worried it will be a downgrade overall. Trying to weigh the options.

Background:

* My goal is to become a software engineer.
* Online degree (half-way done), basically year-round (short breaks in fall/spring)
* I prefer to stay employed at all times. I have a family and I'm transitioning careers. Maintaining an income stream is important, although not vital.
* about 130 internship applications and this is the 2nd phone interview I've gotten (no other competing prospects ATM)

Current position:

* Manual QA (meh...)
* Co-op, which is basically an internship that lasts until I graduate (\~2 years)
* Workload in this position is unbelievably light. Most weeks I work less than 4-8 hours, but get paid for 40.
* Work from home and spend most of my workday actually doing school
* Large company, lots of internal positions. If I could switch to a better position (unknown likelihood) it would come with increased workload and complexity (which are the main benefits of this job ATM).

New position:

* 3 month internship, maybe more according to hiring manager, but no guarantee
* Project to assist embedded software engineers. Project is a web-app that parses log files, normalizes them, displays them, and visualizes useful info from them
* No mentor, not on a team of developers
* Project is brainchild of 1 electrical engineer, says this project is outside of his expertise but thinks it's doable and thought my experience was a good match
* Offered a proof of concept but mentioned that he wasn't married to it and I could do it however I wanted really

I have put together some pros and cons for accepting the job from these lists:

Pros:

* Make jump from manual testing -&gt; software developer
* Increase marketable skills (software dev, data analysis)
* Valuable professional experience in making a real product
* Embedded exposure might be valuable in the future, as I'm planning on moving to Detroit area

Cons:

* Task sounds hard - not sure if I can do it
* Feel like I will have a lot of responsibility but no support and very little useful direction (other than ""this is a feature I want you to implement"")
* Less time for school, more stress
* Not guaranteed work beyond August 13th (possible)

Unknown:

* Compensation, although glass door information suggests it's likely about the same as what I currently make. We will see...

On the one hand it is much better experience and gets me closer to what I actually want to be doing. However, my natural reaction to his overview of the project was quite negative because of the lack of support and feeling like I can't do it, but I don't want to sabotage myself. It's only guaranteed for 3 months, which is a good thing if it doesn't go well, but I prefer to be employed year round. My current job is extremely easy, low-stress, and indefinite, but I really need to graduate from QA at some point.

Obviously compensation is a big factor. Still have to figure out my expectation there. I think at least 25% more than current, but maybe even more. Although I'm not sure that's in their range based off info online, although I realize that's not necessarily accurate."

jt5afb,9,2020-11-12,I got my first full time offer ever (and accepted!) :'),sweetbrypie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jt5afb/i_got_my_first_full_time_offer_ever_and_accepted/,"Some background: I took my first coding class in sophomore year but didn't seriously consider it until the end of my junior year. I switched careers in my last year of college and took an extra semester to complete the CS minor at my university. My personal projects were some coursework projects and an app I built for my students to use in a class I teach. I had my first internship this past summer (Ruby on Rails / React Native) and it went great! But the company wasn't hiring new grads so I had to go back to recruiting. I'm currently still in school and will be graduating in December 2020.

I applied through asking people for referrals, going to online recruiting fairs hosted by my uni (which are lowkey whack lol), Handshake, Jumpstart, etc.  Ultimately, one of my first applications to a company (whose job listing I found and applied through LinkedIn!) panned out and I'm so excited to announce that I got a full-time offer from them! The process took the better of two months because I was scheduling interviews with other companies and trying to balance school, but I feel pretty lucky to be accepted with a company whose values align really well with my own. I plan to start in March (WFH) after finishing up at the non-profit I currently work at.

So if you're someone who might be feeling some imposter syndrome, especially with the job market right now, I totally get it! I started to learn programming only really recently, so I'm still struggling with feelings of inadequacies -- and this didn't help once I started interviewing and getting rejected. But you can really do it! It might take another hundred applications to sent out, it might take another month of interviews, it might take another week to hear back -- BUT keep grinding, keep coding, and a company out there is bound to notice your efforts.

I've been lurking on this subreddit (and also r/computerscience and r/learnprogramming ) for the last year, but I wanted to pop out and say thank you to everyone here cause honestly this reddit has been great for getting my questions answered, getting motivated, and putting my best foot forward for interviews. So yeah, thank you so much for the help and advice :') take care!"

Hopefully its of some help,U03B1Q,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/jta7dg/my_first_swe_internship_interview_was_exactly_a/,"Exactly 1 year ago, I was interviewed for an SWE internship at one of the Big Five. I was lucky enough to get in and get a returning FTE offer. Summer internship recruitment seems to have started because I've been getting a lot messages from juniors asking for advice.

I see a lot of people giving great advice on how to do well in coding tests, but that's just one third of the process. I'm making this post to give my 2 Paisa on the other 2/3rds. I'm hoping that this helps someone going through the process now.

My interviews were pre-covid, so not sure how the virtual hiring processes are like, but a majority of these points will hold is what I'm guessing. 

\---

# Part 1 : Before the coding test

&amp;#x200B;

* **What do I need to know?**  :

As a general rule of thumb, Data structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases and networks are the core concepts you need to know. Unless your college is particularly terrible, almost always the core requirements you need for those last 3 topics will be in your CS syllabus. For non CS folks, ask your friends for their material.

I highly suggest learning about dynamic programming and string matching algorithms. They are super handy (not just in interviews but for applications too!). For data structures, trees and linked lists are the main 2 things you should know.

&amp;#x200B;

* **How much Competitive Programming do I need to grind?**

For DSA and Algo, a lot of people say do leetcode/codechef etc etc. I do agree that doing competitive coding is a great way to help hone your skills, but you need to make sure you're learning the right way. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MUG UP QUESTIONS!

Your goal with doing CP should be honing your ability to figure out solutions quickly, not being able to identify questions. Why? Because usually while the initial coding tests have somewhat common problems, a lot of the questions you will be asked in an interview setting will be modifications or new questions that you are unlikely to have seen. You need to be able to figure out how to approach a problem that you haven't seen. This is by no means easy, but this is what recruiters are looking to see.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Fleshing out your resume**

By this I don't mean throw in random buzzwords. Do a few projects. Enter a few contests. These could be anything related to topics you're interested in. The goal here is to be able to show the interviewers that you are willing to learn and experiment for your learning/objectives and not just for marks. Do these projects yourself and don't flick them! You will always be asked questions about projects on you resume, and you must know the workings of your project flawlessly.  Don't worry about knowing only X number of languages or frameworks - a majority of the time as an intern you will be expected to pick up a new tech stack on the job. Your resume should just be one page

\---

# Part 2 : The coding test

This is probably the most well documented part available online. Geeks for geeks is your friend. Google the company name + geeksforgeeks and you'll get a great set of the kinds of questions they may ask for both the coding tests and in their interviews.

**Attempt every question!** These are usually scored tests, and you may often be able to get one or two points even using brute force.

\---

# Part 3: The Interview!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Understand the requirements**

You will often be asked some kind of problem statement and then told to write (on paper so no execution)  code to solve it. Make sure you ask all the questions you need. For example stuff like ""does the list have only positive integers?"" ,""do any elements repeat"" etc. The goal here is that since you don't have input test cases, you are trying to understand exactly what you need in your solutions. This is super important for system design questions - where it's about understanding the problem as much as it is coming up with a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ask the interviewer what they're looking for**

This is on multiple levels. There is the standard expected space and time complexity they're looking for (don't worry you can always start at a higher complexity and work your way to a smaller one). But it's also in terms of what they look for in the code itself.

For example, I asked my first interviewer what they expect from a select and he said (paraphrased barring the last 2 sentences) ""I value robust code the most. People often assume that a user will use their programs correctly. This is never the case! I always keep an eye out for how well a person can account for errors. **I should be able to throw a stone at your code and hear it bounce off. That's how solid it should be**"". I had multiple rounds of interviews and so I made sure that in subsequent rounds I explicitly added as many error handling sections that I could identify.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Do not give up at any point**

When there are multiple interviewers, one of them is probably the guy who wants to psych you. They may attempt to haze you and will ask if you really think that's a solution. Sometimes you may be wrong, but on occasion you might be correct as well. Until you're told sorry we don't think you are a good fit, never give up on the process. In one of my rounds, the interviewer said ""really? Is that the best solution according to you?"" and I thought I messed up big time. Turns out it was the right solution! He was just trying to make me second guess myself.

* **Ask if there is a better way to do it**

When you finish, your interviewer will ask if you have any questions. Aside from the previous point on what they look for, please make sure you ask what the solution to the problem was - if nothing else it will give you more knowledge to prep for the future, but it also enforces your ability to seek answers, which all these big companies value.

&amp;#x200B;

* **General stuff**

Be polite and respectful (this is a no brainer). Carry some water and a bar of chocolate or some easy to eat snack, because sometimes these interviews can be extremely long, and it's hard to think on an empty stomach.

\----

Luck is definitely a huge part of the process, but remember that the more work you put in, the more that luck matters less :)

All the best to everyone sitting for placements and internships! You'll do great! Hope this was of some small help to someone!

EDIT : I am not from an IIT/NIT/BITS. I study a good college in my city and I don't know what Tier it comes under but it's either 2 or 3. The important bit is to take advantage of the opportunities you get! If any company is coming to your college it's an indicator that they feel that there is talent there and the rest is in your hands. Its only if your college's placement record/situation isn't all that great, that you will need to reach out and search on your own - multiple Big 5/FAANG -type companies have off campus recruitment for interns/freshers that are basically identical to college placements.

Remember, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take!"
jtaej4,0,2020-11-12,I’ve had it with people being shitty to me for being a business major,FEStienewb,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/jtaej4/ive_had_it_with_people_being_shitty_to_me_for/,"Hey everyone before I start I wanna say that I hope everyone is doing okay in these harsh times....  so to begin this with some context. I am a senior graduating in the spring. I have always been a business major and actually enjoy it for numerous irrelevant reasons. Time and time again, almost everytime I say I’m a business major people either respond with a passive aggressive comment or give me a “judgmental look.” The one that people say often is “of course you are.” I always get these kind of remarks but one of the worst ones was awhile ago but I was at a average size party and everyone was talking about their majors and things of that nature. I end up saying that while 7 or so people are listening to me and no exaggeration. This frat guy who is a engineering major says “ohhhhh really, I could tell. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t allow business majors to get bachelors.” .... this is just a few of hundreds of comments that have been shot at me. 
I’m not even trying to make any STEM major feel bad by any means but I have a couple outlooks on why people feel this way towards business majors. The main thing is that a lot of business majors (not all and that’s important to understand) get really decent jobs after graduation because they have something lined up. Sometimes these jobs pay just as well as medical professionals or engineering related jobs. So they see it as kinda  a “cheat” card. A lot of people don’t understand that as a business major you absolutely have to have a decent resume before you graduate if you want something that is going to pay well which means, extra curriculars and definitely an internship or two. there are a lot of outside of education factors that you need in order to confirm something that pays well. 

All of that being said, the main difference between me and someone who is a communication or education major is that we are usually in it for the money and a lot of times positions are obtained that pay really damn well. People exaggerate how secured jobs are after graduation as a business major. NOW ALL OF THIS TOGETHER= STEM majors that don’t think we deserve to get high paying jobs.

I graduated from the bay area and the competition was tough. It felt like there was always someone I was competing against that was more qualified than I was with every job I applied to. I only had one internship as a web developer but I talked about that and some of my other best projects. Something that did help me get more responses was I started applying to remote jobs all over the U.S. 

Good luck to everyone out there! There is hope!!"

I am in the middle class (will need finical aid from some, but not all schools).

**Major:** Political Science and Philosophy double-major (where applicable). Also interested in communications/journalism and history as potential minors

**Academics:**

GPA: 3.97 UW and 4.51 W. Hardest course load (except for one math class) at my school.

SAT: test optional... got cancelled 4x (rip)

APs are not offered at my school but I self-studied for APUSH (5) and AP US Gov and Politics (4).

Have done out of school honors projects for non-honors classes to receive honors credit.

**Senior Year Coursework (all honors unless noted):**

Calc BC, Calc-based physics, 20th century Political and Intellectual History, Advanced Conversational Spanish, Utopian Philosophy, Advanced Literary Analysis (English), Model UN (not honors and, yes, this is a real class)

**Extra Curricular Activities:**

Model UN - Secretary General of an online international conference. Junior and senior year. About 10 hours a week, but it goes up to 20 before a conference. Last year, built a conference that attracted participants from five countries. 

Campaign volunteer - In both English and Spanish (my second language). 10/11/12 grades. 8 hr/week time commitment. I worked mainly with the Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign, but I also lumped by work with other progressive campaigns here as well.

Internship at city councilmember's office: Summer before 11th grade. About 40 hrs a week for a month. An ordinance using my research was eventually passed.

Work experience: Summer after 9, 10, 12. Camp counselor for 40+ hours a week for a month. Paid since last summer, volunteer (as Junior Counselor in Training or Counselor in Training) from 5th grade through summer 2018. Got cancelled this year due to covid. Responsible for 17 children.

Creator of blog about hockey: 9, 10, 11, 12. About 5 hrs/week. In 7th grade, I created an instagram account (over 1600 followers now) to talk about and analyze my favorite team, the Los Angeles Kings and in 11th grade, I turned it into a website where I now write articles covering them. This is purely a passion project as I love hockey and people like to hear what I have to say. To the best of my knowledge, I am the only female independent writer covering the Kings and my content has been praised by members of the organization.

Co-Founder/Co-President of my school's GSA (Gender Sexuality Alliance): Member 9/10 at my old school. Pres. 11/12 at my new school. About 2.5 hrs/week. We manly discuss current events through historical contextualization and promote intersectionality. 

Art: 9, 10, 11, 12. About 4 hrs/week. I have taken several art classes throughout high school and I also spend a significant amount of my free time drawing and painting (specifically about politics). I am by no means Picasso; however, I do think I have a very methodological/philosophical approach to my art so I am submitting a supplemental art portfolio to some of my schools.

Stuff I do at school: 12. About 3 hrs/week. My school has started a ton of new initiatives this year and I have joined several of them. I am an ambassador at admissions events. I am on the scheduling/social committees. I am a peer tutor and a peer mentor to underclassmen. 

King's College Pre-University Summer Programme in Political Science: accepted into competitive, international pre-college program in London, specializing in international relations (one of the biggest eye-opening experiences of my life). Summer before 11th grade.

Built a greenhouse in Peru: 2 weeks after 9th grade. Helped community develop more sustainable and productive method of farming. 

**Awards/Honors:** National Spanish Exam (NSE) bronze (freshman year) and silver (sophomore year.. scored perfectly on one of the sections). I will graduate with distinction from my school; this involves a lengthy senior thesis. Accepted into the advanced messing and Spanish group with Bernie Sanders' Presidential campaign. I have high honors status at my school (getting straight A's).

**Essays/Letters of Recommendation:** 

Common app essay: I am writing about my friendships with two international friends and their impact on my life within the greater metaphor of how saying goodbye can lead to wonderful things. 

Additional Info: Explain how I had a 3 hour daily commute to school but I did it so I could have the best possible education and also expand a bit on my ECs and how I kind-of created a lot of them myself to fit them within my schedule. 

Covid: Explain how I was pretty lucky but that my SAT was cancelled and that my family and I are now the sole caregivers for my grandmother. Also talk about how I have been making lunches for newly food insecure people and I finish it off with a positive note of how our communities will emerge from this stronger.

Switching schools: This is my Achilles heal. I switched 2x. The first after 10th grade due to constant bullying and an insane wake-up time and the second literally two weeks into my 11th grade year because I realized that the curriculum was completely unchallenging. I explain how I finally found the perfect place that truly challenges me on an intellectual level.

**Schools:**

Columbia (ED), UC Berkeley, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Brown, Georgetown, Princeton, Reed (EA, Junior/Senior Scholars), George Washington (political communication program), Boston University (legacy), Brandeis, NYU, Barnard, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB + some safeties. 

If you made it this far, THANKS A MILLION!"
jtbqvx,1,2020-11-13,How to decrease self pressure?,munchies392,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jtbqvx/how_to_decrease_self_pressure/,"Hi friends, 
I struggle with putting too much pressure on myself. This realization came as I reflected on my summer and pretty much most of 2020. When the state wide shut down happened, I lost a lot. My internship, gone. Volunteering, seized. I was forced to move back home away from campus. Then I struggled to find a job. Much of my skills weren’t applicable to what was available at the time. I felt so useless. I couldn’t contribute much to anything. It was bad. 

But the flip side was that my feelings were all internal. No one made me feel bad except me. My family were supportive. My boyfriend was supportive. Literally everyone was in the same boat. I mean luckily my fam and bf were still employed working from home. I loved w bf and he essentially provided the entire period (rent and food). Perhaps having a man provide was foreign to me. Growing up seeing the mom do it all was my home. So to feel dependent on my bf during that time felt very weird to me. 

TL;DR how do I not put so much pressure on myself? What can I do to decrease my self criticism?"

I minor in Computer science and currently at the last two weeks of my internship period. The period is only 3 months. I'm drafting my report when I realized that I may not contribute a lot to my company. My current company is a small network security company. It only has roughly 9 employees. They focused on providing network security solutions. So far i havent done any technical stuff. Normally I communicate with an outsource developer and work on our website. So my main activity comprises of documentation and content research. I also did alot of research into networking concepts, those that are not covered in university. I do however observe my colleagues work on networking stuff, such as switch config, port mapping etc. Have I done enough as i could in this 3 months? Or I could have been more productive and be aggressive and ask for things to do. But again, i dont know alot of things, and when I get to know some term, there are more questions than answers and thats keep on going."

Now I got a project as an intern -not a programming intern btw- to automate an excel file.

Basically there is a huge dataset which is made into tables in excel, all parts of the table use formulas, except one column, in where you type in a number, which is used by a SMALL(OFFSET) formula, thats the dynamic part, my boss wants to check data based on that, so that should be modifiable within the code.

Any ideas/tips on where to start this, because I never worked on a python project like this and im kinda clueless on how to start. The libraries which I can use: pandas, numpy, matplotlib (its very troublesome to install others due to it being on a work pc with shitty systems and limitations)"

I’m currently a second year Electronic and Electrical Engineering student. Although I’m leaning more towards the electronic stream, I still have another year before I can choose to do. Currently, I was thinking about making an individual project on my own aside from school work (while I still have some spare time to do - especially with the upcoming Christmas break). I figured it’d look pretty impressive for any internship I’d apply for. Anyways, I was wondering if anyone in here has done one- I wanted to see what kind of things people have come up with to draw some inspiration. Obviously with my 2nd year knowledge I’m sure there’s not too many intricate ones I could even attempt, however, I’d be happy to learn some concepts I haven’t seen yet. This also applies for any electronic projects too if anyone has done one of those!"

jthddi,5,2020-11-13,I really need some help MIT-ifying My ECs,Thegaycooward,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jthddi/i_really_need_some_help_mitifying_my_ecs/,"A hello everybody! I hope you're all doing well especially with all the jazz of Applications season, but I'd so so appreciate it if you could help me MIT-ify my ECs (Make Them Literally Perfect For MIT assuming that exists):

*TL; DR: I like research, track and field, MUN/Public Speaking, Writing, and doing random personal intrest projects, how can I pursue all of these in such a fashion that'll impress MIT's AOs.*



1) Research: This one is rather straightforward but I am facing some difficulties, I hope one day I'll be able to make it to ISEF but I'm still working on it. I tried contacting local Profs. and Institutions but to not much avail. Regardless, I'm applying to RSI this summer, hopefully, and I'm also applying to 2 other ""Local RSI"" programs offered where I live, here, these programs are basically my best chance of making it there so I'll certainly pursue that. I also did an internship at a local hospital assisting in research by essentially doing a lot of data-gathering and other grunt work for a few hours a week for about 2 months. Is there anything else, besides what I mentioned, that I could do? I heard of people making clubs and whatnot so I'm really not sure what else I should be doing.


2) Track and Field: Again, a rather straightforward EC, I love track and field and I've been on the team for over a year, sadly our trainjng led up to nothing because COVID but I'm still hoepful for next year. I'm regularly training and if I have time in the summer I wanna try to maybe run/organize a marathon. One big ol' issue here I fear is that this really isn't STEM-ey, from what I've read, MIT doesn't penalize people for Athletic ECs but they're just considered mere hobbies. Ive though of designing an app to help people train and run and find local races, but I'm not sure if I should, since I've seen enough college app videos to notice that so many people do it that it probably won't be impressive enough to account for the effort. So yeah, don't really know what else to do?

3) MUN/Public Speaking/Debate: These things are similar enough that I'm just going to group them into one; for Debate and Public Speaking I am the School Club's Founder and President for the past year, I also am a part of the local Toastmasters Club. I also did a quick internship teaching underprivileged people Public Speaking. For MUN, I ran for Pres. but lost, and I'm gonna run again next year. But, I have my own conference of which I am Director and Founder, which I've been doing for 2 leaning on 3 years, I got over 100 people the first time, and 200 the second. I also have about 10 MUN conference experiences and 7 Best Delegate Awards, 1 Honorable Mention, and 1 experience chairing (directly running a committee). This is one my most wow Activities in the sense that I'm actually pretty decent at it, yay, but, I don't know what else to do, how can I innovate on itnto reach that MIT-Wow-Factor? I've though of doing a TedX but my life isn't intresting enough to merit a story and I don't have the ""damn that guy is smart, we should listen to him"" affect that'll merit an opinion talk. Any help?

4) Writing/Poetry: For this, I've submitted my work for competitors and papers but to little success. I'm still trying though. I've written enough to hopefully self publish a book of poetry and I have a blog on which I am rather active. I still have a long ways to go here, but what else can do to ""Wow MIT""?

5) ""Random Shit"" (Better Name Coming Soon):

This is THE thing I'm piggybacking on, I love doing the most random of intrest/curiosity projects in the world. Last year I wrote a super simple program that basically double checks my Algebra in HWs, after taking inspiration from breaking bad I tried to use fancy chemical processes to create the perfect cup of coffee (turned out decently good), I also like making homemade rockets, like the ones you make with a pump and old soda bottles, and the list goes on. Of course it isn't all that way but it's just a collective of intrest fueled personal projects that largely involve scientific research and rxplodation, is there any way that I can formalize this or turn into something even more than it is?"

I think I have a pretty strong resume. Tons of people, including industry professionals, professors, and career advisors all find it very impressive, and would always compliment me on how much I’ve done in college. Problem is, I’ve historically struggled IMMENSELY with getting career opportunities. Internship interviews were extremely sparse, and I was lucky to get the internships I did. 

Now, I’m looking for a full time job, and I just feel like my resumes aren’t getting into the hands of actual engineers and managers. Whenever I feel good about an application (ie, have all of the basic and preferred qualifications, and good experience relative to the role), I get ghosted. Just feels like whatever screening software or HR people are throwing my resume away.

I’ve put in as many hard skills as I can. CTRL+F highlights a ton of skills that pop up on job postings. I’ve used many online resume scanning services and have scored high on most of them. Yet I feel like I’m throwing my applications into the void.

Yeah I get it’s COVID and jobs are tough. I’m doing my best to network and get referrals and so on. It’s an uphill battle, and there are millions of other engineers looking for the same thing.

Sorry if I sound whiny and entitled. Just getting really frustrated with myself and how this whole industry works. Any advice appreciated, as we’re right in the prime time for hiring."

I am a Marketing Analytics major...pursuing...a job? I am interested in working in marketing and consulting, but feel like it is impossible to get even an email back from anywhere these days. I spend hours upon hours each and every week searching and applying for jobs on LinkedIn as well as my school's website that posts jobs/internships.

I'm a hard worker and have been learning to use SAS, SPSS, Tableau, Google Analytics, Hubspot, and many other softwares and programs in the past couple years at school. Though I have no work experience with them, every class I've taken has heavily relied on these programs for projects, labs, and exams. Almost every ""entry-level"" job I've seen lately specifies 1 or 2+ years of experience, which is so frustrating to me. I'm a very quick learner, so if anyone has any suggestions on skills/certifications that would make me more marketable, I'd love to hear your advice! 

I'm also having issues actually finding what I think I would enjoy as a career. I've been given multiple opportunities in sales, as I've had interviews with a couple companies in the insurance industry, as well as a summer internship. After my internship was finished, I was more willing to go into sales than before, but overall do not see myself going down that route. I was far into the interview process for a position at a firm as a financial advisor, but had to really think about what was in *my* best interest. I want to find a job that I'm going to be passionate about for a long time.

If anyone is in the same boat as me, I'd love to chat. I also want to hear how others got through this stage in their lives. I don't have many family members that graduated from college, so I don't have an extremely large network to get career guidance/advice outside of my professors and close friends."

I'm graduated in Data Analytics a year ago and I have not had time to work much in my field due. it has been difficult to enter the job market as most have asked for several years of experience and not a recent graduate one. I did a internship and worked at BI consulting company and then they kicked me because of lack of work.

Now I got two job offer to choose between a employment and as a BI consultant for Capgemini. Both of them are same job tasks. But different it's as consultant my CV are being ""sold"" to potential clients.

As I have heard and the fear as a consultant is that you can be fired at any time and you have no employment protection that you have with regular employment. The advantages of a consultant are that you learn a lot.

I'm confused I get the feeling that I'm safer with regular employment. But I'm still new or junior so I do not have much experience about what would suit me best as a recent graduate.

I recently graduated, but with the pandemic and other personal reasons, I’m unfortunately living at home and despite being fortunate enough to be working, I was still in an intern position at a company I had been working at for over a year and half now. I was (fairly aggressively) applying to jobs since graduating in May, but nothing was working out and any positions that followed up with me were essentially to say, ‘we think you’d be great, but we’re not hiring atm bc of the pandemic’ which definitely started to hit hard after the first few times. With this, my parents were actively encouraging me to pursue my masters, which I did want to do, but I needed a break. 

All the stress has started to compounded and lately I’ve been consistently having a steady stream of thoughts in the back of my head. At first it was about how I could die and I wanted to die. It then moved to I need to die and I should just die. This is definitely new territory for me, and although I’m not self harming and I havent in years, the fact that these thoughts won’t leave me alone is really upsetting me. When it started, I thought it was caffeine related, but it’s just all the time now and I feel like there’s no end in sight. 

My boss is great and he was fortunately able to work out a full time salaried position for me that I will be moving into within the next couple of weeks once some paperwork gets sorted. The expected salary is much, much more than I anticipated it would be, and frankly feels to be much more than I deserve. I feel like this should make me happy, as it takes some of the stress of finding a full time/ well paying job, but I’m not. My boss stopped by earlier to congratulate me and assure me that I deserve the position, but I think he could tell something was off, because he stopped for a moment to ask ‘are you as excited about this as I am for you?’ I reassured him I was before sending him on his way, but I’m not. I just feel so exhausted all the time and I constantly have headaches, which have worsened recently. 

Theoretically, I should feel better, and I feel like such an ungrateful brat for not. But I can’t seem to shake this and if anything, I feel even more stressed out for seemingly no reason. Has anyone been in a similar position? any advice is much appreciated"

I have completed 2 previous software internships and I’m interested in trying out quant trading to see what it’s like. The main concern I have is: if I want to become a swe after this internship ends (if I don’t like finance), will companies look favourably upon this experience for swe jobs?

I will have one more summer to do another swe internship (I received a capital one offer that I am trying to push to then) but I’m not sure if I can get a good one.

jtju2x,1,2020-11-13,"Dealing with overprotective parent,",Justablondeguy123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jtju2x/dealing_with_overprotective_parent/,"Hello. I'm a 25-year-old man, My name is Marek. I feel a little bit odd asking complete strangers for advice in such a personal matter, so it isn't easy for me to write this post. I tried to find a solution for this for many years and I don't know what to do.

So I'm currently living with my retired mother. My father passed away 2 years ago. My relationship with my parents was always a little bit off... I never looked up to my father and my mother was always overprotective. I have learned very early that I cannot count on any sensible advice from my parents - especially about my job or university because they would either criticize me or switch topics instantly. That and my poor health during childhood years made me a very secluded child that was playing computer games or skipping school to get wasted most of the time. I tried to get out of this hole many times, even had some anti-depressants prescribed but it had a little effect when I was stuck at home with my mother. 

  
Since father passed away this situation got even worse, mom went for early retirement and was sitting at home 24/7. I tried convincing her to maybe find a job or any hobby that will keep her occupied - she ignored me. So she lies in front of the tv for 90% of the day and doesn't allow me to do anything on my own unless I do it secretly. She, just like her mother before, loves to play with people's emotions in the most annoying ways possible. I was working 13-hour shifts, before lockdown and every time I was leaving she was saying ""OH YOU ARE LEAVING ME ALONE AGAIN"" and if she was confronted why she is saying it like that she would either put blame on me or make a sad face. 

Before summer I had an opportunity to go on an internship in Italy for 2 months. When I told her about that during our conversation, she basically ignored what I said and after I repeated myself louder she just walked away. So a few days later I just said to her that I'm going to Italy next week. She was visibly pissed but said nothing. And during those 2 months in Italy, I felt truly like a free person, but she still was calling me too much and I often declined her calls on purpose because it was pissing me off. 

And now we are here, the second lockdown, I don't have a job, I just graduated and I'm stuck at home with her at home and my mental state is slowly getting worse and worse every day. I sometimes try to ignore her and just do my thing, but she plays with my emotions so much that I start to feel bad about treating her like that and the circle continues. Especially with all this bullshit that I hear everywhere that you should treat your parents like kings. But I seriously feel more relaxed and free when I'm in the dentist's chair with an open mouth than in my own home with her. I don't think she can be taught that I just want to live my own life and she should keep her nose out of it. Should I just ignore my softheartedness for her and just cut her off completely?"

Get a job at any company that deals with your field of engineering for ANY position/title. Once you’re in with the company doing whatever it may be, getting hired on as an engineering intern/co-op will be almost a guarantee as long as you do you job well and you show up on time. Most companies/businesses prefer to hire internally, so your name will likely be at the top of the list of applicants because they know you are reliable and you also probably already have an understanding of how their systems operate to a degree. 

I got a job at my company as an assembly technician and did that for three months before getting promoted into the engineering department. every time that one of the engineers came down to the floor I made an effort to converse with them and get to know them. Now I have been in the engineering department for over a year and I am co-oping this semester and will likely have full time employment when I graduate. 

If I had kept applying to internships and co-ops I honestly don’t think I would’ve gotten anywhere, so if that is what you are experiencing I recommend you give this a try."

jtkw5r,18,2020-11-13,A Guide to Cold Emailing for Research Internships,empowerly,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jtkw5r/a_guide_to_cold_emailing_for_research_internships/,"***Steps to getting a research internship from the Empowerly team.***

**Who the heck are you?** I am an Empowerly counselor who earned my Ph.D. from Stanford University in Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology. In the past, I’ve mentored students working on their research projects for Science competitions and have served on the admissions committee of Stanford's Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes. Hence, I wanted to share a post from the perspective of the person who would be reading your email!

**Step 1: Prepare your resume.** 

One of the key factors in getting an internship is if you have some skills that could help the lab. For example, data analysis skills for life science labs that conduct experiments which yield a lot of data that needs to be analyzed. Remember to highlight your skills in your resume and if applicable provide a link to an online portfolio such as a website or a github repository. There are countless resume templates. Try to make a resume that is clean and minimalistic, not colorful! Attach your resume as a pdf to prevent any formatting issues.

**Step 2: Draft an email template.**

Professors get a lot of emails and there is a good chance that they have received countless emails from high school students asking to work in their labs. If you want them to read your email, you need to show that you have not sent a mass email by making it clear that you have looked into their research. Also, you should attach your resume. This is ""cold"" emailing and the response rate is usually poor. But....you never know.

\*A tip from one of my students: Ask questions about the professor’s research and what specifically interests you in the email.

Here is a template for the email that you can edit to make specific to you:

Dr.  \_\_\_\_\_,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_ and I am currently a \_\_\_\_\_\_ in high school. I am emailing you to ask if you would consider me for an unpaid internship in your laboratory.

I am interested in the intersection between medicine/healthcare/neuroscience/machine learning/AI/Etc. and hypothesis-driven laboratory research and I plan to go into (career, e.g. healthcare) in the future. It is for this reason that I would be very excited to have the opportunity to contribute to your  laboratory’s research in/on \_\_\_\_. I am particularly interested in \_\_\_\_\_. Last summer I  \_\_\_\_\_\_ . I was introduced to \_\_\_(subject/topic)\_\_\_ in my \_\_\_\_(class) where I learned how to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  I really want to explore this subject further by being able to conduct research first-hand.

I have attached my resume at the bottom of this email. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like any additional information.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my request.

Sincerely,

**Step 3**

Research professors and be able to fill in the template with specific details about their research. Remember, the more specific you are, the greater your chances are of a professor accepting you. Always try to add your own skills and what you have learned that you can bring to the table. Despite what you might think, you learn a lot in your high school classes that at least give you the baseline skills to conduct lab research.

**Step 4**

Realistic Expectations! Getting research opportunities is difficult at all levels and extraordinarily difficult at the high school level. Thus, do not be dissuaded by hundreds of negative responses by professors. In fact, in all likelihood, you may not even receive a response! The key to getting research as a high school student is persistence. Never quit and you may very well need to reach out to hundreds of Professors in order to have success."

""we have this code and we want it to do x"" (even though it wasn't set up to do x in the first place).  Which I need to then run with and make the functionality possible. 

This usually requires me to update large portions of the code to accommodate for the new code that I have written. I feel like my procedure for updating and refactoring code is lacking steps that would allow me to do it as productively as possible.

I follow a guideline somewhat along the following:

1. Read the code and documentation (if there is any) 
2. Attempt to understand the code and what it is intended to do
3. Think about ways that it could be improved for my new requirement
4. Start writing some code 

I feel like I'm either missing steps, or I am just slow when it comes to understanding code and creating new code.  I'm wondering the following

1. What ways can I approach code to understand it faster?
2. Should there be a design phase where I understand how it should all be put together?
3. When should code writing start? 
4. How can I stop from getting off track and updating things that are not necessarily important to the overall goal?"

This morning I saw the post on this sub about working from home and how it affects Canadian jobs, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/jt87ft/is_workfromhome_a_threat_to_canadian_jobs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), and the valuable discussion it brought forth. I just made a reddit account today to join the conversation.

This move to Digital by Default and removal of city-centricity has supported our existing Canadian Shopifolk, allowing them the freedom to move around the country to fit their lifestyle and family needs. 

What does this new approach mean for new hires? With the dissolution of office centricity, it no longer makes single city hubs a barrier to joining our team at Shopify. By being digital by default we are able to hire from all over the world opening up the opportunity to a global talent pool to help us lead. 

Regarding Computer Science graduates, we hire over 200 software developer interns a year as paid interns. Long term - I think there is still going to be a place for offices; from onboarding, to project collaboration, to in person bonding, this will still continue to exist. 

The physical office will no longer limit us physically to the talent that can join us and the places where we can unite to power entrepreneurs around the world. We have and will continue to hire in Canada. Canada remains our highest growth region for hiring software and data engineers. Our hiring philosophy has and always will be to hire the best, globally and locally.

I've been only stressed out and unmotivated with college. Although I end up with very high grades (3.8 GPA+), I just don't know whether all the stress is worth it sometimes. I'm in college to develop a skill (computer science), but I lack experience and have no idea where to go...and college has taught me next to nothing how to code. I have no idea how to make a basic GUI program in Visual Studio, only experience with 1 language, am pretty darn bad at problem solving (I ALWAYS need help to figure out solutions in school), and no guidance for internships (I do not know if I can even qualify due to my lack of experience).

Has anyone here had a similar experience?

I know for sure I do not want to do anything in the medical field. I haven't been so interested in biology, chemistry, or physics (I have an A in physics and understand next to nothing...). I'm honestly lost and unsure if dropping out would be a better choice.

I am sick of having to throw away my youth for studying at a PC all day, but I feel like I lack interest in anything else. I find myself doing childish things like write a bit (I never did a long novel), blogging (on-and-off), etc.

Maybe it's just my ADHD...

We work on the same team of 3 (she isn’t my boss and works at a different office). I moved my (new) husband and me 600 miles away from North Carolina to the Midwest and we haven’t been happy here. Our careers aren’t progressing in the ways we wanted either. 

I’ve tried to make it work this past year but my husband and I are looking to find opportunities that are a better fit. We also don’t like the Midwest. My mentor is a great person and so is the team I support but we have different goals and ways of working. I’ll probably be leaving this field (market research) entirely for something more technical (benchtop science) since that’s what my degree is in. 

I have the opportunity to move to another company that will better match my career goals and will be closer to our family on the east coast. It’ll be great for my husband as well. 

The problem on my end is feeling like I’m “betraying” my mentor and team. I feel like I’m pressuring myself to stay for my mentor because I don’t want her to look bad for referring me. I also don’t want to burn bridges with her since I mentioned I was working to stay in the company a little while ago—but I changed my mind. I’ve been networking a lot to find a position that would be a better fit here but I’m not really finding anything that wholly clicks with me. I’m learning I would be much happier at a smaller company. 

Does anyone have suggestions for speaking with her and explaining why I’m leaving in a respectful way so we can maintain our professional relationship? How can I talk to my boss about leaving after my one year mark when I’ve given no indication that I’m unhappy? It’s all so intimidating."

This year, after working really hard to improve my resume, I’ve applied to over 400 different places and gotten more than 30 coding challenges which i feel like i’ve been doing pretty well in.

But after congratulating them on so many different occasions, the realization that I’m so far behind them sets in and i question how i’m so much worse than them. Of course i don’t tell them that i’m jealous cuz that would only make them feel bad about getting offers and how bad of a friend would i have to be to make them feel bad about their success. So i congratulate them but i’m starting to get really down on myself and really frustrated cuz i feel like i’m going to end up with nothing. And yes, i know there are people who don’t get offers until late march or april but I feel like i have put in so much energy time and effort yet i have nothing. Again, i am not trying to say my friends hard work is worth nothing because they definitely worked extremely hard to be where they are and they deserve to get their offers. If i know this, why do i feel jealous still?  What am i doing wrong? sorry this is a rant lol

P.S. This also slightly applies to the posts on reddit about ppl getting offers, I’m really happy for all of you and i’m sure you all deserve all the success you’ve received but damn does it hurt to be on the other side."

It's been about a year since I left college, and the only coding language I took in was C++, but just the basics and nothing too advance. 

I did learn about SQL, html, and CSS in college. But It’s been a while, and I’m starting to forget what I learn. Should I focus more on these language?

Right now I'm stuck. And where I'm at is simply with no job experience in the IT world, no degree, but one certification by Juniper the JNCIA. I choose it because it was 50$ to get. Money is tight. And I'm also without a job right now.

I've spent some time studying over various certifications, getting familiar with the overall topology of things, networking, security, development, operating systems, some hardware/homelab setups. I've collected a pretty decent library on more than several topics. And right now it feels like I'm being torn in every direction, because I don't know what's going to get me a job. 

Personally I don't want to apply to hundreds of job applications for networking related jobs, when most are in fact labeled has Help Desk Support (I,II,III), or System Administrator. I wouldn't mind a helpdesk job role, but I can't even imagine how I would be a victim of HR without a degree, relevant job experience, and getting picked over by an unemployed Retail Manager because they have 'more customer support experience' and a family to feed.

So my options were to continue studying for a next level tier tnetworking cert JNCIS-ENT, or the direction I'm leaning into is linux with RHCSA and get put to the top of the list for Sysadmin/Support roles, I feel as though I wouldn't even need a windows certification, because the troubleshooting for Desktop is easy, but I don't know anything about Windows Server/Powershell/Azure, but I have books on all three of those topics. Also windows allows compatibility with Bash. 

Either way I truly feel like I need another certification to be applying to jobs, I live in the US Northeast outside of Boston and it's a highly competitive job market now that retail is done over here. Everyone is trying to get into IT. I feel like I'm going to be passed over because so many people got their bachelors in whatever from the dozens of schools that around here. 

Should I go for the RHCSA? Another thought I had was to learn SQL, but there are not many certifications, and there are no intern database jobs, because low level tasks are mostly done by sysadmins or back end engineers.

With RHCSA I'll be really getting my money's worth compared to the CCNA &amp; Trifecta in total that's like 1000$ And with this path I'll be able to learn bash which can translate over to some easier tasks in automation in the cloud. Should I double major in learning Python as well? 

How does this schedule sound? Python 2 hrs, Juniper 2 hours, RHCSA 3 hours. And for these topics I'll be reading a pdf book and doing commands in the terminal and taking notes. I think this is the plan I have to stick to. I recently just deleted Twitter and Instagram. Instagram was easy to do first because I'm not on my phone much. Twitter was much harder, especially now with everything going on and I would find myself going over my TL, while listening to yt video courses that don't feel that retentive. 

So I guess that's the end of this blog post, touching on caution-able doubt, setting a path, taking away the distractions, and solidifying my learning style. Would love to hear any feedback, and if anyone is going through the same thing."

I majored in dance (primarily education) and art history, worked as a stitcher in the costume shop and as a dance teacher for 4 and 3 years of school respectively. My summer jobs were temp office and theatre gigs, and after graduating I landed a competitive internship working in production at an amazing dance festival. After that I moved to a major US east coast city, near friends and my partner, started working a retail job plus dancing and teaching professionally.

Pre-covid, retail made sense, flexible schedule, I could teach and rehearse during business hours and have something consistent and part time with good benefits (several forms of bonuses, just not healthcare) and lots of options to get extra hours. Now, I'm working a consistent but not huge number of hours, plus I feel at risk every day and have very nearly stopped using all of my benefits due to covid related constraints. My company does their overall best, but I don't trust our mallgoing customers and the stress of working in a high contact position during covid is weighing on my mental health, even if it is deemed safe enough. 

I have been job searching for nearly 3 months now. Initially I was picky, applying to arts organizations and things I could really see being long term matches and rarely hearing back. I got zero interviews besides one small teaching job I got at the beginning of October. I started applying to more generic administrator roles in the past month and have been in contact with three potential positions this week, two already resulting in offers, for in person office jobs. I am waiting for my next interview with would the third on, which would be remote but similar general administrative work. The base pay for any of these would be same or a bit better than my current retail job plus consistent full time hours (with less potential for bonus than retail). 

Financially, taking pretty much any full time job will allow me to save and pay of debt better, plus have better hours than my current job. Personally, I am worried I will be bored and restless, and continue to search for a job in an arts/non-profit org anyways once I'm at a new job, as most of these administrative jobs have little to do with the career I am seeking for myself, working in education and the arts. On top of all of that, I feel immensely guilty for being close to quitting my retail job during holiday, which is the busiest season and I am one of the few associates they have left who isn't brand new. The company paid us during shutdown and I don't want to abandon my coworkers, but I am still stressed by the high contact environment and loosing steam with the current work-life balance not being great. 

What have been other people's experiences leaving mildly enjoyable retail jobs for desk jobs? I feel very naive and unaware, as I have never had a long term position like this and I think I am nervous for the change, and I am afraid I will be unhappy if it doesn't match my career trajectory. Should I just feel lucky and take what I can get in this job market and stop complaining? Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated."

1. 310 gre (self assessed havent given the test yet hope to boost it further up),
2. 3.0/4.0 cgpa and LORs from department chairs.
3. 1 year internship experience (kind of management oriented rather than technical.)

But rates for translators have their limits until you've climbed to a certain strata.

As a young child, I learned some basic html and made a few simple sites. At around 20 I randomly decided I wanted to make rpg games, so I researched programming, and settled on programming in C++ (plus some graphical addons). Prototyped a nifty action rpg with the graphic libraries.

So coding is a reasonable option, but honestly I can't think of many remote positions without a year or two of professional experience and maybe an internship. Freelance web dev comes to mind. I'd love to pick up Python in a more productive way than games, but HTML/CSS looks like a really chill intro.

I'm pursuing a Bachelor's (unrelated) and considering a Master's in IT or a related specialization. Remote work is really too beneficial for me to go back to local salaries (third world country). I know things aren't always possible the way we want them but I figured I'd ask those who know."
ju17kn,1,2020-11-14,Internship Resume help,brandonofarabia,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ju17kn/internship_resume_help/,"Hello everyone! I'm a non-traditional student at a major university finishing my BS in mathematics while also pursuing a computer science type certificate as well. I'm 29 and only ever worked in the restaurant industry, but since March have been laid off unfortunately. So, now I am taking this time and opportunity to buckle in and push the pedal to the metal to finish.

Before transferring from a smaller university, I majored in computer science and have some novice experience in Java. In that class, we got up to Chapter 18: Recursion from Y. Liang's textbook, but that was in 2016.  I have gone over all of my code from those past programming assignments and believe if I needed to, I could quickly reacquaint myself with Java. This semester and next semester, I'm retaking classes covering those same topics with the addition of going further into advanced data structures but instead we are using Python. Also, I will be taking a class that covers theory and numerical methods programming in C++ which I never touched before. So, after this Spring 2021, I believe that I will have intermediate knowledge in more advanced data structures in Python and Java with novice knowledge in C++. At the end of this semester, I'll have a total of 90 credit hours finished and will have hopefully 3 semesters left before graduating in Spring 2022.

Saying all of this, I am wanting to start constructing my resume and would love to start looking for internships for the summer and beyond.  I started reading *Cracking The Coding Interview* and think I have and will have enough knowledge to pursue most internship opportunities, especially because of my math heavy background. I just have no idea where to start putting a resume together for an internship. What should be on it? Should I make a personal website? Should I make a CV with the addition of my resume?

Thank you everyone and I look forward to all the help I can get!"

ju3znw,12,2020-11-14,My mom plays hardcore favorites,asackofsadpotatoes,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ju3znw/my_mom_plays_hardcore_favorites/,"I (22F) am the middle daughter of the family, and my mom and I have always had the worst relationship of all my siblings. Things got better when I moved away for college, but my school kicked us out in March because of COVID, and I've been home since then. After I graduated in May, I started a master's program with a thesis project at my dream job all remotely. My thesis is being done in the form of a year long internship, and I was excited that I'd be getting paid (at least a little) while doing my master's. My parents were very generous by paying some of my tuition fees up front when I couldn't afford it all myself. I am keeping track of how much they've contributed to my education and have budgeted aggressively to be able to save and pay them back as quickly as I can. 

Recently, I noticed a problem with my paycheck, which I brought up with my supervisor. He said that everyone would start working on fixing it right away but he's not sure how long it would take. In the meantime, my salary is lower than what I was told it would be, but would be enough for me to both move to the job location, and save for tuition. I just wouldn't be able to save as much as I'd originally hoped, once I moved.

I told my mom this information and she immediately said that as long as my salary isn't fixed, she doesn't want me to move because ""saving for tuition and paying her back should be my top priority"" and living at home is of course cheaper than moving to California. And while I agree that saving for tuition is extremely important, what bothers me here is the difference in how much she thinks I'm supposed to prioritize saving for tuition, versus how much my brother is.

My older brother is also in a master's program and will be moving to NYC in December. His tuition is more than twice mine, and NYC cost of living is notoriously high. He doesn't work or have any income. He has some savings but my mom is already paying all his tuition and living expenses without the expectation that he contribute to any of his own costs while he's still in school. While I was finding the cheapest apartments in the area where my job is located, he went out and found an apartment in downtown NYC that my mom will pay for with no expectations. 

If he wants to move to NYC early, my mom will fully support that. If I want to move early, my mom won't allow it because even though I can pay my own living costs, I need to be saving for tuition and it's cheaper to live at home. If he spends all day in his room on his laptop, that's fine because ""he's studying to be a doctor"". If I'm in my room working my part time job and doing full time classes, I'm being lazy and not pulling my weight around the house. When she gets back from grocery shopping and lunch isn't made, she yells at me and my sister until she's red in the face, but when my brother comes down for lunch all she says to him is ""make sure you eat enough"". When my sister and I didn't have time to show him how to play Among Us, he threw a temper tantrum and complained to my mom, and she yelled at us for ""not including him"" even though we were too busy with work and school to deal with him. He's 25. He acts like a spoiled toddler and my mom enables that to the max.

The only thing making living at home bearable is that my younger sister is still here. But she's going back to campus for her spring semester in January, and after she leaves I'll be alone with my parents because they won't allow me to move until my salary problem is fixed and my supervisor doesn't know how long it will take. I don't think I can live here as an only child. I don't know what to do.

Anyway, sorry this is so long. I'm grateful this sub exists and although this is a throwaway because people know my main account, I've been lurking here for a long time, and this sub has helped me feel less alone."

However, I landed anded a comfy job that pays 32k USD annually earlier in the year. Which is more than enough for my minimalist life style. I'm not sure if it will be wise financially to make the jump.

I brought this up to my professors. Both suggested I should keep my current job and be an unpaid intern for a year. This way I'll gain the experience/connections to make the finacial transition smoothly.

We're students in UC Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, pursuing dual degrees in engineering &amp; business! We're on the Student Board Admissions &amp; Marketing committee, and here to answer any questions you all have about the program! :)

M.E.T. was started 4 years ago for students interested in the intersection of business &amp; technology. We just accepted our 4th class and had our first two students graduate this past year. The possibilities with the two degrees are wide-- our students often take internship roles in product management, software engineering, machine learning, consulting, technical/data analytics, and [more](https://berkeleymet.wixsite.com/internships?fbclid=IwAR2pa-RVGIDi5k_ox4kqJUhCGc7kiX075qnk30IV_eETj-a8gZoli33uLSE) (click to find out more about where our students have interned!).

Our program has now expanded to include 6 engineering tracks within UC Berkeley's College of Engineering with a Business Administration degree within the Haas School of Business. The tracks include Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science, Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research, Mechanical Engineering, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, and Material Science Engineering!

College application season can be hectic-- especially during the pandemic, and we want to answer your questions to help you make a more informed decision! College is definitely an amazing experience, even during a virtual semester, and choosing Berkeley M.E.T. has been the best career decision I've made so far. One of the most special parts of our program is that each class is a small cohort of 50 students-- it gives you a community of students with similar interests from the moment you step on (or Zoom into) campus!

Feel free to hit us with any questions about the program, whether they're academic, social, career-wise, or anything else.

My mom makes me so tired mentally with all the things she said and that makes my day more tired then I wanted too. I really try to stay positive with things going on like college, future, and my own self. Though it’s not working out. I’m 19, 2nd year college right now stressing about my major and add with my mental emotional problem it cause to stress out more. I try to do the things her way around the house because I’m staying there until I figure out everything and it’s cheaper. In the end no matter what I do she doesn’t appreciate it and never admit any sorry to me when it’s her fault. I can admit my mistake if I have too, but if it’s her she flat out won’t say it. I don’t get why she wants to talk behind my back. There this one time this lady said I had nice handwriting and in Vietnamese she said “what nice handwriting?” Under her breath in front of me and I was like in my mind why don’t you do these yourself, but she doesn’t understand anything and I’m frustrated I try to be understanding, I try not to get mad and frustrated but its so hard. She has these bipolar madness moment the most common one is I work hard and earn more than you and I’m paying for your education. She gets paranoid if someone is taking about her like an enemy. I too get paranoid but not to an extent to question everything. I really do appreciate it and try to be respectful if she doesn’t hang this over my head every time she yells and also I have to take care my siblings and their old enough to do some of the chores around yet she turn to me I’m older I’m suppose be responsible. I already have enough on my plate. I already long time realize this feeling is not really love, but obligation because she done a lot for me. I even try to get a job to try to help because they ask and then when I mention a job they told me it’s bad or maybe wait more. My dad he’s understanding, but my mom she is unreasonable that I even sometime call her names in my head. Sometime I envy other people when I should be grateful for things. That why I don’t have work experience and try find an internship over winter break and just hope for the best. I’m just mentally exhausted I could have talk more but that would have been forever. My mind is just of indecisive and tired. I’m sorry if this long. Can anyone relate?"
juai31,3,2020-11-14,"My experience using cold emails to get internship, local job and job at FANG",MinMaxCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/juai31/my_experience_using_cold_emails_to_get_internship/,"**Caveat:** Everyone gives advice based on what did or didn't work for them. Cold emails have worked me as someone who had neither connections in the industry to give me referrals nor credentials to get past a resume review stage. I've decided to share what's worked for me about cold emails.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I've been reflecting on what's gone well for me over the course of my career and realized that a lot of my opportunities came from sending cold emails.

I studied computer engineering in middle eastern country where internships were not that easy to come by and were sometimes unpaid. Most new graduates also struggled to find jobs related to CS. Cold emails helped me get an internship, full time job as well as another job at FANG in silicon valley.

**First Internship:** Cold email with a followup 1 week later. Recruiter responds saying company doesn't hire interns but that she would forward my resume to some managers. One of them decides to hire me as an intern after a short conversation/interview.

**First Job:** Cold email to a company that was hiring full time engineers. I sent a followup 1 week later. Got a response, an interview and then an offer. Thanks to this sub's negotiation advice I got much more than most new grads in my country.

**FANG:** I sent dozens of emails without followups to big tech companies' recruiters in silicon valley. A recruiter from Google gave me a shot. I changed the format of my cold emails sent after that to include that I was coming soon to interview with Google. Facebook also gave me an interview after that. This was after getting rejected with a referral from a random on blind. One of those 2 gave me an offer and I moved to silicon valley.

I came across this video about SaaS sales: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PuKwEfXZqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PuKwEfXZqc)

The guy in video suggests sending follow ups a lot after cold emails. I've gotten up to 5 follow ups from recruiters when they send me cold emails. Looking back, follow ups got me responses from recruiters for the first internship and job. Lack of followups may have hurt me when looking for a silicon valley job.

Another caveat: Referrals are usually better if you have connections. If you go to a good school or have worked at FANG, it may be unnecessary to send cold emails.

Either way I think it's a useful skill. Here's an article with tips for sending cold emails: [https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team/](https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team/)

Although I wanted to pursue a master's degree from Europe, after graduation I immediately enrolled myself for a master's program back in my home country while I kept on searching on scholarships abroad. By the time I got offered a scholarship I had already completed my first master's degree however I decided to go for it since it would give me some international exposure. I was hoping that a higher education from within the EU world open up new opportunities for me and help me start my career especially in europe. 

I graduated this year and I think we can all agree that covid really did not help out anyone looking for a job. I had to move back home since I wasn't able to find a job after graduation.

So here I am now. With one bachelor's degree, two master's degrees, numerous academic / extracurricular achievements, and some limited working experience. I've applied to hundreds of jobs only to wake up day after day to countless rejections. I'm either overqualifed for entry level positions or underqualified for higher level positions. Worst of all is that I can't even apply for graduate positions in the EU anymore because most of them don't sponsor visas for non-EU candidates. 

Despite my qualifications, I'm ready to start from an intern position and build my way up if only someone gave me a chance. 

I'm just so lost because I can't see a way out of this situation."

However, this would mean leaving my friends, my long term partner and giving up my last year of being a student and enjoying university life.

The internship sounds good and my parents are pressuring me to take it because they think it will help my job prospects in the future. but if I decide to stay at university I will join a research group instead on a project of my choosing.

Either option is equally as respectable, but the internship requires me to move to a different city alone and leave behind the life I’ve created for myself in my university town. However it sounds like a great opportunity that I shouldn’t turn down. But I feel like I have also missed out on a year of uni due to Covid so would like to have that experience once more before I go off to work for the rest of my life.

If I stayed at university I would be getting a flat with my partner and I’ve been getting both our hopes up about that because I didn’t expect to potentially be moving away so now we are both crushed.

I don’t know what to pick and would be grateful if anyone had any advice as I’m starting to wish I had never applied with all the stress it’s causing me trying to choose between an internship and university."

I'm currently finishing my bachelor degree work, and I've received some project proposals, in addition I started to look after jobs or internships as a programmer.

I'm fine with C++ and Python - I'm obviously not a pro, I don't even know if I'm on junior's level, but I feel confident in these langs, I can manage to solve problems with them. 
BUT
Most of the offers I've seen during my research demand strong webdev skills (HTML CSS JS, occasionally PHP), so as a self-taught graphic designer and enthusiast I thought that front end may be interesting at well - for sure it will be a good idea to get into it.

As far as I got into HTML and CSS pretty quickly - its nothing hard though - I can't get into JS, and especially i don't even have any ideas how to connect HTML and CSS created website to any good JS idea. I've made simple todo app, following the YouTube tutorial, with some animations (I'm speaking of vanilla JS of course - won't start learning react etc. until I won't be confident with vanilla), but I really don't get it how all of these things work.
It's much harder for me than getting into any backend language, I just feel lost, can't ""connect the dots"", documentations don't help me much (which I find strange though). 

Could you give me some hints, tips - I dunno, just how should I get into this webdev stuff, because I'm feeling more and more anxious and uncertain about this idea...

First, a quick disclaimer. As you will soon learn, the immigration system varies significantly by country, so not every country will follow this style exactly. Not every country allows dual citizenship, not every country allows the passage of citizenship through the maternal line, and not every country has a clear distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. A basic guide to permanent immigrant cannot cover every case, of course. This is just a starting off point.

Soon, this subreddit will reach one million subscribers, and to commemorate this, I thought I would write a basic guide to permanent immigration. After participating in this subreddit for several years and successfully immigrating myself after a few amateurish attempts, I have learned that there are really only three methods of legal immigration: win the lottery, get sponsored to work, or buy a golden visa. 

#The Distinction Between Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Visas

Key to legal immigration is the distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. Briefly, immigrants can renew their visas indefinitely and eventually apply for permanent residency while nonimmigrants cannot. Exactly who is considered an immigrant vs. nonimmigrant and the clarity with which this is explained varies by country. Generally, certain family members, certain employer-sponsored employees, and certain investors or business owners are “immigrants” while long-stay visitors, students, interns, au pairs, remote workers, seasonal workers, working holiday workers, and exchange workers are all “nonimmigrants.” Yes, even if they have a right to work temporarily.

Therefore, when I say there are only three methods of legal immigration, I am saying that while there are many ways that you can enter, live, and even work in a country temporarily, there are only three ways to do so permanently. This post is to overview these three ways.

#Types of Immigrant Visas

By “winning the lottery,” I mean that you could 1) receive citizenship due to circumstances of your birth/adoption, 2) receive permanent residency due to your spouse, or 3) receive refugee status due to your undeniably personally dangerous circumstances. Though, I must admit that the last option is more like “losing the lottery.” You can remember these three opportunities as the “Hail, Nail, or Bail Lottery.”

When you try to “get sponsored to work,” your options are to seek sponsorship from 1) the government directly, 2) public businesses, or 3) private businesses. Long-term work sponsorship arrangements often issue immigrant visas, while transient or seasonal arrangements often issue nonimmigrant visas.

“Buying a golden visa” needs no explanation. If you have the money, normally meaning hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, you can sometimes just buy your way into a country.

#How to Approach the Hail, Nail, or Bail Lottery

These are the three main methods of legal immigration. A wise strategy would be to triple check you have not won the Hail, Nail, or Bail Lottery without knowing before continuing to the other two options. If you’re a refugee, you do this by thinking back to the last time you considered walking to Libya. If you’re not a refugee, you do this by mapping out your and your spouse’s entire genealogy. No, DNA tests don’t mean anything. You need to know who was born where and when, back to your great-grandparents at minimum. Both where and when are important, because passport inheritance laws often specify the time period for which they are valid, most countries’ borders have changed since 1900 so your babushka might have actually been a citizen of what was then Poland, and some but not all countries offer citizenship to children born within their borders. And you should know back to your great-grandparents at minimum, because most countries only care who your parents are, some countries care who your grandparents are, and a few countries care who your great-grandparents are, but very few countries care any further back than that. If it sounds too hard to trace your genealogy a mere three generations, then you better have enough money to buy a golden visa, because you won’t make it as an immigrant by working. The good news is that you may have an eccentric uncle who has already done this for you. It is recommended that you do this even if your ancestry does not come from your target country, because your new country may have an agreement that makes immigration to your target country easier. For example, if you are a citizen of an EU country, then you can live and work visa-free in the other EU countries, and if you are a citizen of a NAFTA country, then you can apply for a TN visa in the other NAFTA countries.

If you’re absolutely certain that nobody from which you or your spouse descended ever lived outside of your current country, then you may skip checking whether or not you have won the Hail, Nail, or Bail Lottery. After you have considered your family tree, you should consider golden visas. Not because I expect many people reading this to buy a golden visa, but rather, because answering the question of whether you even have the money takes five seconds.

A few golden visas are surprisingly affordable for the upper class, the cheapest being less than the value of one actual gold ingot. Three different Caribbean countries are tied for the cheapest in the world at $100,000: St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua &amp; Barbuda. The EU country which offers the cheapest golden visa is Greece at €250,000, and that is for a real-estate investment. In other words, all you must do is buy a house there, and actually live in that house for seven years if you want Greek citizenship. If you’re in the middle of your career and you already have some wealth accumulated in your house or an investment account, or if you’re at the end of your career and you’re looking to retire someplace cheap and sunny, these are real options. By the way, governments normally call these “investor” visas.

#How to Approach Getting Work Sponsorship

If you’re not in a financial situation where you can just buy a house in another country and likely nosedive your income for several years, then you will have only one option left for immigration: get sponsored to work. 

You can get sponsored to work from the government directly, public businesses, or private businesses. Governments sometimes offer non-immigrant visas like working holiday visas directly, but the only non-familial immigrant visas directly offered by the government are normally golden visas and business creation visas. Business creation visas are generally for people with large amounts of capital or established businesses opening branch offices, similar in spirit to a golden visa.

The government prefers to offer visas through public businesses. These public businesses may include universities, which would normally recruit professors with immigrant visas, or English teaching programs, which would normally recruit native English speakers with nonimmigrant visas. Private businesses do offer both immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, but the vast majority of immigrant visas in the “get sponsored to work” category come from private businesses.

Private businesses will source internationally for labor when they can prove that no native is available. This is normally a daunting and expensive administrative task for the business designed to favor the internal labor market at the expense of the potential immigrant (and even the economy). Naturally, this process favors people with rare skills, and most countries publish skill shortage lists advertising to the world what kinds of potential immigrants are likely to receive immigrant visas sponsored by businesses. Engineers, computer scientists, and medical specialists are on every shortage list in the world. Certain scientists, IT professionals, teachers, nurses, managers, and trades workers can sometimes be found on the skills shortage lists. While they are not often on any skills shortage list, religious workers sponsored by a place of worship may also receive immigrant visas.

If you have an advanced degree, sufficient experience, and your profession is listed on an occupation shortage list, you can just start applying for jobs in that country in the normal way you would apply for jobs. If you have no degree and/or lack experience and/or your profession is not listed on an occupation shortage list, it’s less likely that you will get sponsored to work.

#Interesting Exceptions

That summarizes the main methods of securing an immigrant visa. Yet, there are a few specific exceptions that may interest you. The US has a literal immigrant visa lottery for which citizens of most countries can apply. You will have a very low chance of winning this lottery (between 0.01% and about 2.00% depending on your country of origin), but it’s free and you can reapply every year. As of writing, two countries have robust ""points-based immigration systems,"" those being Canada and Australia. The idea is that if you get above a certain threshold of points, you will be allowed to immigrate there. You get points for all the things you would normally need to immigrate -- education, work experience, language ability, a skills-shortage profession, a job offer, etc. -- but due to the points system, you do not necessarily need *all* of these things, just most of them. Both the US and France have militaries that recruit non-citizens, though for the American military you must already be on an immigrant visa. That said, joining the French Foreign Legion is really not recommended unless you’re a bad enough dude. Israel offers a “right of return” for Jews, so if you are Jewish or you practice Judaism, then you can get Israeli citizenship. Ghana offers a “right of abode” to the African diaspora, though after some research I could not find much information on how this program actually works. Svalbard, an arctic archipelago administered by Norway, allows literally anyone to live and work there without a visa, though this does not count towards residency in Norway, so it’s only for people who think they could permanently live on the northernmost human settlement on the planet. That’s it. No, you cannot just move somewhere because you have an American passport, that’s called illegal immigration.

#How to Approach Nonimmigrant Visas

If you intend to immigrate to a country and you start with a nonimmigrant visa, you must have a plan to switch to an immigrant visa. Maybe you’re getting a university degree in a country in order to network and improve your odds of finding an employer to sponsor you, maybe you’re hopping from visa to visa and bar to bar all throughout your 20s in hopes of winning the Nail lottery, or maybe you’ve inherited €498,000 and you plan on saving that extra €2,000 needed for a Spanish golden visa by working twelve hours a week as an Auxilaire de Conversación (English teacher). If you want to legally immigrate to a country, I strongly advise that you know when and how you will get an immigrant visa before you begin.

#Types of Nonimmigrant Visas

Here’s a quick rundown of the different types of nonimmigrant visas that are typically available:

Au pair visas – If you ever wanted to be a family’s personal live-in nanny, you may want to be an au pair. You trade your labor in housework and childcare for room and board, a truly small stipend, and sometimes amenities like a public transportation pass or tuition to a language course. You’re not supposed to work very much, in theory. These arrangements are sometimes reserved for only young people. The large majority of au pairs are women.

Jobseeker visas – You may be eligible for a jobseeker visa if you just graduated from a university in the country or if you have a high degree of education, like a master’s or a PhD, plus a few years of working experience. That said, jobseeker visas do not guarantee that you will actually find an employer willing to do the paperwork and bear the costs of hiring a foreigner.

Remote worker visas – If you have a job that can be done entirely remotely, certain countries will allow you to stay in them while you’re doing your work. The number of countries offering such a visa has exploded after COVID, though note that international tax situations are tricky, and many employers do not want you telecommuting from Costa Rica.

Student visas – Studying at a university is the most common foot-in-the-door and will normally allow you to work part-time. Student visas are very good for becoming fluent in the local language, and many countries offer benefits to foreign students who graduated from their universities such as jobseeker visas or reducing the residency requirement for citizenship applications. If you’re coming from an Anglophone country, studying outside of the Anglophone countries is a good way to save money, as well. Furthermore, many countries, even those in which English is not widely spoken, offer degree programs in English, most commonly at the master’s and PhD levels.

Temporary/seasonal/working holiday visas – These are broadly for low paid, unskilled, dead-end jobs. If you don’t like picking berries or waiting tables in your own country, you can pick berries or wait tables in another country for a summer to a few years. Most countries have reciprocal arrangements for working holidays with at least a few other countries. College-educated Americans are eligible for working-holiday visas in five countries: Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Teaching English abroad is the dead-end job of choice for many people who have no employable qualifications beyond being a native English-speaker. These arrangements are also sometimes reserved for only young people.

Tourist visas – Such visas are only for people with the means to spend a long amount of time in a country without working or studying. At most, you may be able to volunteer. Definitely think very hard about whether this is how you want to begin an immigration attempt. Though, I will take this opportunity to encourage you to visit a country before you immigrate to it.

It goes without saying that not everything discussed here applies to every country or every person. With 195 countries, it’s not possible to go over every case. But this general process is always the same, no matter who you are or where you’re going. First, check if you won the Hail, Nail, Bail Lottery, and if so, congratulations. Second, check if you can buy a golden visa, and if you can, think about whether you want to plunk down the money. Third, check if your occupation is on the skills shortage list of the country you wish to immigrate to, and if so, just start applying to jobs. Fourth, check if you qualify for any nonimmigrant visas, and if so, you can just go once you get one, but before leaving, have a plan for how you will transition to an immigrant visa. Let’s see this process in action by doing a quick Q&amp;A.

#Common Cases and What to Do

Q. “I’m a programmer with a degree and five years of experience. How can I immigrate?”

A. Hail, Nail, Bail Lottery. Golden visa. Apply for jobs. Nonimmigrant visa with a plan to do one of the first three things eventually.

Q. “I’m a musician and a high school dropout with three kids. How can I immigrate?”

A. Hail, Nail, Bail Lottery. Golden visa. Apply for jobs. Nonimmigrant visa with a plan to do one of the first three things eventually.

Q. “I’m a sixteen-year-old who dreams of living abroad one day. How can I immigrate?”

A. Hail, Nail, Bail Lottery. Golden visa. Apply for jobs. Nonimmigrant visa with a plan to do one of the first three things eventually.

It is literally always the exact same process. You are responsible for answering how you are going to immigrate. The fine posters of r/IWantOut, God bless them, may take the time out of their day to give you some real, helpful information. Or they may just tell you to YOLO teach English in Cambodia. But, ultimately, immigration is a process that takes hundreds or thousands of hours of work over many years, and nobody will do that for you but you.

#Conclusion

After reading all of this dense information, you may ask yourself, “How does anyone ever immigrate?” Indeed, it is always a minority of people who immigrate. It’s estimated that there are about 244 million immigrants in the world, or about 3% of the world’s population. Even in the country with the highest rate of immigrants, the US, only 14% of the population is foreign. As you can plainly see, it’s a process that favors the wealthy, the educated, the experienced, the skilled, and the lucky. So, frankly, all you have to do is become wealthy, educated, experienced, skilled, and/or lucky. Preferably a combination. But no matter what, you will have to be dedicated. Good luck.

Between Amazon and Google, I'd probably rather do Google but I don't want to reject a great secure offer over a potential offer from Google. Is it a goog idea to ask for a deadline extension?"

Heyo! I'm back again with a fresh perspective after visiting Canisius this weekend and wanted to type everything up before I forgot it so :) without further ado...

To start with, my tour guide was actually somebody who graduated from my high school which is WILD because I've been looking at my Naviance stats and wondering who that singular person is and uhhh I met them! Because of this, I definitely got a different perspective and was able to talk about my current classes/ecs and have them recognize teachers/places/etc. They were also able to talk about which things were similar to our hometown (think: ""If you want coffee like from xyz you can go here and order blah blah blah"")

1. They have an app for laundry. Like deadass it will tell you which machines are open/when your load is done/if its been interrupted 
2. They've been all in person so far -- and not like holed-up-in-their-rooms in person, actually in person and doing things after school in person. They've had a few cases but have extensive contact tracing and a smaller population so they are doing just fine
   1. They've had food trucks! Part of the reason why they can contact trace so well is that they have you swipe your key card for everything -- to get into the dorm/buildings/locker rooms/buy food/etc.
      1. To expand on food - outside restaurants (Tim Horton's, etc) are part of the meal plan
   2. Speaking of locker rooms - each sport has their own locker room that you have to have the right key card to get into - like we couldn't see inside the swim locker room because our guide didn't have a key card with access
3. The freshmen dorm room walls are corkboard - no worrying about trying to cover up holes when you move out! As a side note, the freshie dorms don't have air conditioning but you're in Buffalo so you won't really need air conditioning for that long anyways
4. Crazy scholarships
   1. Like fr you're eligible for $16k per year if you have a 1300 SAT (27 ACT I think?) OR meet the GPA requirement if you haven't been able to take either this year
   2. There's also an honors college with different opportunities - average SAT for this is 1340 for reference
5. please note that it IS a jesuit school but you aren't required to be religious or anything
   1. there ARE mandatory religion classes but they dont have to be catholic - an example they gave was that you could take ""animal religion"" or buddhism classes
6. its a VERY small school - less than 3k undergrads - with a cap of 30 people per class for EVERY CLASS. there will be NO big lecture halls where you blend into the background, apparently the teachers will invite you over to their house for dinner/study etc
7. speaking of which!! there are NO TAs! NONE. ZERO. every single class is taught by a professor 
8. competitive esports
   1. go okay nerd all you want but like they have two gaming rooms and theyre both hella fire
9. paid internship opportunities as freshmen
10. animal science/behavior majors get to train kittens/adopt them 
   1. one of my guide's freshmen floormates apparently hid a kitten in their dorm how fire is that i would like a dorm kitten
11. the tunnels are NOT sketch i can confirm - they're more like hallways

uh that's all i can think of right now please lmk if you have any other questions"

jur7ie,2,2020-11-15,25 M / 3.6 GPA / 690 GMAT / Gaming,wannabegamefounder,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/jur7ie/25_m_36_gpa_690_gmat_gaming/,"Hi everyone. I’m a software engineer at a gaming company looking to start my own gaming company with a close friend who will potentially be my cofounder. He is more competitive than I am for MBA programs and will likely go to an M7 school. He would take the lead on the business/finance side of things and I would take the lead on the tech/game design side. I’m aware that there are ways to do this without getting an MBA, but that’s why I’m here.

One thing to note is that I am currently compensated similarly to engineers at FAANG companies, and I know that doing an MBA would be leaving a lot of money on the table. I’ve been thinking about this for years now, and I’m very sure that I care more about running my own game studio than having more money. It’s been a dream of mine since I was a child, and I feel increasingly passionate about it as I get older. While success would bring money, I feel more motivated by finding ways to lead a game studio that fosters a diverse, inclusive, and sustainable workplace. If you’re familiar with the gaming industry at all, you have probably heard about these issues, and I would really like to tackle them. I’ve been exposed to some of this firsthand at my job, and I feel that I have the experience to understand the nuances of these problems.

Any insight or feedback would be appreciated. From what I’ve researched, I feel that my odds for my target schools are fairly good (assuming I hit my GMAT target score), but I would like to know if any of you disagree with that as well. If you take the time to read this and reply, thank you so much!

**MBA Info**

* Why I want an MBA: I feel that I’m lacking the skills and network to get funding and build a team. In addition to that, once I’ve built that team, I think I could use some education on how to most effectively manage and run that team, specifically on the people management side of things.
* Why I want one now: I’ve spent the past three years working at a large gaming company, involving myself in a wide variety of tech. I have specifically been involving myself in projects to prepare myself for leading a game studio. I feel that I have a solid enough foundation to technically lead a small team. Considering my goal, I am thinking that an MBA may be the most efficient way to move forward. I have a decent network within the gaming industry, but I have no network in the startup world at all. Also, considering that I’m fairly young, I think it will be hard to get more senior management roles (to learn more people management skills) in the near future.
   * Something else that I’m keeping in mind is that, in the event that my startup fails and I don’t want to continue down that path, I think my background as a senior engineer + startup founder + MBA will allow me to get an engineering manager position at a large tech company. I see that as my fallback option in the future, especially if I end up wanting something more stable and less stressful once I have kids.
* Target schools:
   * Anderson, Marshall, possibly Haas (location is important to me)

**Background**

* Work experience: 3 years at a large gaming company, started as an associate software engineer and have been promoted twice. I have been both a tech lead and an IC, and my current title is senior software engineer. I also have several internships if that helps at all.
* Extracurriculars and other experience:
   * I’m lacking here, does college experience matter? I did quite a lot of undergrad research, in particular in journalism and HCI. I was also involved in a hip hop student club. Since I’ve started working, I’ve been just enjoying my free time doing stuff like traveling, spending time with my gf and friends, playing video games, etc. I definitely don’t regret it at all, but I’m not sure if that’s going to hold me back.
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science from a top 15 university (according to US News)
* Race/nationality: Asian
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: *690 Q43 V41 IR8 (practice)*
   * I took my first practice test blind (didn’t even know the format before taking it) yesterday to find out how doable this is. I did very poorly in quant, but I fully expect to be able to improve that significantly with a few months of studying. I also ran into some issues with time that I am confident I can improve with more practice. Targeting 740+. From my research, this seems like a realistic goal.
   * Not sure if I formatted it right, but I took the official mba.com practice test:

Honours (called K classes at my school): Pathophysiology K, Economics K (72. Will ask my teacher for a retest on one of the tests I’ve scored low on), Pre-Calculus K, might substitute AP/DC Bio for another K class called World Area Studies for next semester (if I am able to, but if not it will be an on-level class called History Through Film)

I want my PC to be able to handle anything I throw at it whether that's training a machine learning model or rendering my horse's balls in RDR2 in buttery smooth 1440p. 

Below is a list of stuff I put together. Any tips/pointers/advice on what I have so far? I don't have a 3080 nor do I know where to get one but I suppose I'll wait and see when it's back in stock. I would really like to get this build completed before Christmas tho.

I’ve never done one before so don’t have any prior experience, because of that I’m not as preferably as other students and i understand that and i know it’s good practise to include projects on my CV. 

My questions were 
- how significant does a build have to be for it to count as a project, like can it be a small application i made in a few hours or do they have to be large projects done over a few weeks or whatever. 

- how important are they on a CV - is it feasible to get an internship without any. 

- does any have any suggestions for projects for data science internships?"

juwvx6,1,2020-11-15,"My dream job is starting to feel out of reach, does anyone have any real world objective advice that you think might be helpful for someone in my position?",QuantumSpecter,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/juwvx6/my_dream_job_is_starting_to_feel_out_of_reach/,"Hi guys, so just like everyone else, I would love to work at a FAANG, big tech or whatever you'd like to call it. I was also interested in working at a big banks/firms because I loved reading about the markets, still am actually, and was really interested in algotrading but both of these dreams are starting to feel out of reach.

I'm a junior at an average college in nyc and I still am pursuing these dreams. It's just that I feel like this semester I really fell off and I'm worried about how this might impact my GPA, which is a 3.2. I've been hesitant to apply for internships because I don't have a lot going for me. I do have a job, I'm a computer tech that fixes small, hardware, software and networking issues at various big banks. Luckily, I've actually made some reasonable connections at JPM. But otherwise, I really need to start looking into actual internships. In the mean time, I've been trying to develop some of my own personal projects.

I'm not looking for sympathy or pity, I'm not here to complain or whine. There's a possibility I fucked up in some of my classes this semester. I'm sure I can come back with decent grades, B's and maybe an A. But I'm not the most optimistic person. This worries me because it impacts my chances of getting an internship and also impacts the chance of me getting into a masters program at a more reputable school , I was planning to get my masters in statistics or maybe a narrower field of CS.

**MY QUESTIONS:**

Does anyone have any real world objective advice for me? Am I being unrealistic by expecting myself to have my dream job right out of college? Is my GPA that important? Are there any recommendations you'd offer in regards to getting accepted to a good masters program and getting an internship? Should I stall my graduation to fit more internships in?

Also fuck anyone who tells me I should switch majors or that I should give up. I see that too often on the internet."

I want to drop out before accumulating anymore debt, but I’m lost as to what I should do next.

Obviously I would pick up a job or internship to replace my schooling. I’m just lost as to where I’d go after that. I don’t want to live at home forever, but from everything I’ve heard college is the only way to living a comfortable life (by that I mean a nice stable income, house, etc.) I have no interests so far and feel lost.

I don't expect to rely on the curriculum for my actual learning, that would be mostly self study for certs and on the job experience.  I'm 24 and I am panicked. I have no official work experience. My plan with this would be to land internships and entry level jobs as I complete this rather easy degree while also accumulating certs.

My current plan is to finish a Comp Sci degree, I am just probing for a valid contingency here.

I just want to earn my bachelors degree and start working and move out once I found work and a place. It’s just I’m really dependent on them I felt really bad because I appreciate all they done for me and I wanted to be independent by starting off with little things like learning how to be financially better still a working progress, cook for myself which still a bit bad, but basics and etc. Jobs though I have no work experience because I thought I could do it but then I second doubt and my parent either say it’s bad or stuff so I listen because there older, but I really have general anxiety that I’m trying to overcome and I’m trying to find internship for my first work experience in the summer related to my career interests to see if it works out. Here the main problem living with my parents my dad he is a good dad and understanding he live in America and try his best to provide us always us before him, but my mom I just can’t stand her she is completely bipolar nice and then throwing temper tantrum next. Mostly my parents argue with each other so much and it affect all of us in my family and we’re all scared of her because she’ll just throw a hissy fit which is the worst especially that I’m in college they help me pay for my college which one day I’ll pay them back with paying off my loan. Recently, I wanted to experience another major IST because I really thought to myself during this pandemic because I thought of going in HDFS or rehabilitation physical therapy, but I thought would I be able to handle people for almost 8 hours everyday when I can’t even handle myself where ISt yes you might work in team, but you can work alone depending and I’m a bit of a beginner computer so yea. But making that decision with the help of my aunt is that this is good to try to know instead of keep going any further. My main fear if I did change it is the money and what my parents think. I hate myself for trying to get their approval especially my mom. Dad he said I’m old enough to make my decision, but my mom I’m terrified. She constantly put me down compare me with someone else especially my cousin and I can’t take it. If I did went to therapy I don’t think they would understand even if I explain. I have that my mentality that I can handle it on my own and my feeling doesn’t matter. I cry to myself at night in front of my little sister which I felt so bad. With all the stress that I think my hair is falling out more. Especially if my mom said you’ll take care of me in future right I always say yes so she leave me alone and won’t talk about it. I’ll probably post another about this in specific detail. I just don’t know what to do.I still love them I want to be there for my dad and siblings, but once I graduated and move out I hope I’ll be better on my own.
I’m sorry if this so long but I just need to vent."
jv01vr,2,2020-11-15,Calling all CS applicants and A2C members!,BigBaggyBouncyBeans,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jv01vr/calling_all_cs_applicants_and_a2c_members/,"Hey everyone, just needed some advice. I am a junior at a competitive high school planning to apply Computer Science. To strengthen my application/develop a spike, so far I have done these things in preparation

* USACO/Competitive Programming
* Hackathons and other Computer Science contests
* Congressional App Challenge
* Daily coding on side projects in my spare time, and publishing some to GitHub (like a quizbowl trainer I made)
* Internship this summer at a financial tech startup
* Learning a variety of languages

While these things are good and all, I was wondering if there were things/contests that I can do to strengthen this application. Aside from that, if you have any good CS side projects I can work on (advanced), I would love it! I hope that this post helps other CS people on this sub too! Once again, thanks for your reply!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The list is the things that I have done/am doing right now - as far as test scores go I am doing good (36 ACT so far) and same with GPA (4.62/5 W 3.96/4 UW with 2 sems of junior year to go). Looking for more advice on how to strengthen my app since I have seen many people have very good apps and get rejected."
jv09fc,0,2020-11-15,45k in midwest LCOL. New job or wait?,Heisenbourbon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jv09fc/45k_in_midwest_lcol_new_job_or_wait/,"As title says, I'm at 45k + basic health benefits in a low cost of living area. I have 1.5 years of professional experience, 1 year of that was as an SDET writing automation scripts + improving QA infrastructure. I had some unofficial leadership experience working with offshore teams in that job. Before that I had a summer internship. I am in school online currently, at about half-time credits. I have about 1 year until I graduate with a BS in software dev. I mostly use Python now, and that's what I have the most experience in. Have used C# professionally, some experience in Linux, several classes in C++. I am moderately adaptable and can pick up what I need to adequately, my performance reviews have always been positive. I don't want to be unrealistic, I'm not expecting  FAANG-level pay, but the difference between 45k and 60k would be huge and make my life easier, mostly by helping me pay off some debt and have some savings. But I am living fine currently, and am thankful for my job considering the pandemic.

My question is: should I try to find a better paying job now, or wait until I finish my degree? My city isn't that big, a different job would probably have to be remote. Is this feasible, or recommended? What would you do in my position? Any feedback is greatly appreciated."
jv0yn8,5,2020-11-16,Friend Needs Career Direction,Ihateporn2020,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/jv0yn8/friend_needs_career_direction/,"I need some advice regarding a friend who is sort of stuck in life. He's a homebody type who was very academically strong but lacks practical life experience and never really left his home town (college town). He graduated 7 years ago from a large state university (top 20 engineering) where he maintained a near-4.0 GPA  in Electrical Engineering. He had an internship with IBM that left a bad taste, and wound up going to grad school for a semester before dropping out due to lack of motivation to work at a local company at a low-level QA position that really doesn't utilize his advance degree (nor does it really necessitate a degree, period). He's 30 now, and is struggling with decision paralysis- he hasn't made any career traction and has tossed around the idea of returning to grad school- with no real idea of how he would utilize a grad degree. There's no clear avenue and motivation levels are low. 

He's expressed that he does enjoy programming and wished that he had been able to build it into his degree plan more. He's not found many ways to build upon his skill level and education and so I just wanted to reach out for any general insight on how to build and feed this interest. He's someone who needs goals and some structure- so I really think that work experience outside of his bubble would be amazing for him.  Given his advanced degree background, would there be a more expedient way to build on that to get him experience? He's also considered a coding bootcamp.

He's clearly wishy washy about this along with his grad school considerations- I just want him to get some hands on experience."
jv1f52,395,2020-11-16,"I'm stuck in an elevator, we're telling stories to pass the time.",GraayLady,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jv1f52/im_stuck_in_an_elevator_were_telling_stories_to/,"I knew it was a bad idea to be the last person in the office at midnight, but being the new intern, all of the mindless busy work was left to me. I had a massive pile of Excel sheets to fill out and endless reports to write, all due at the end of the week. And it was Thursday night. Of course I stayed late, in reality I had no choice. That didn’t make me feel any better as I sat at a desk all alone in an open-floor office, half the lights turned off and the only other sign of life being the theatrically lit fish tank by the door. Yes, I was a little nervous, as any young woman alone in a dark place would be. Of course we shouldn’t, but those opinions would be better discussed at another time. It was 12:30 when I put the finishing touches on my last spreadsheet and finally closed my laptop.

I felt the urge to hurry as I packed up my things and put on my jacket, and found that the clicking of my heels had a slightly faster cadence than usual as I made my way to the elevator. I could have taken the stairs considering I’m on the fourth floor, but I was tired. And it’s an elevator. And don't try to tell me you wouldn’t take it too. When the doors opened I was met by the faces of four fellow late-night workers on their way home to collapse in bed. I stepped in and turned to face the doors as they closed again, cursing myself for not putting in my headphones lest one of them try to start a conversation. That thought was cut short by a sudden jerk that almost threw me off balance, and the sound of screeching gears like banshees in the elevator shaft. We all stood still for a minute, waiting for the now motionless elevator to budge again, but there was no such luck.

“Is it...stuck?” Asked a middle aged, professional looking woman in the back of the car.

“Looks like it.”

“Is there anything you can do about it?” Asked a man toward the back of the elevator, tapping the man next to me on the shoulder.

“No, I don’t have any of my tools or even my keys with me. I was on the way out too.” He responded, I noticed he was about my age and wearing a custodial uniform.

While this conversation was being held, I opened my phone to call the front desk. We were told to contact the front desk in case of mishaps like this. No service.

“Hey,” I said eyes still locked on my phone, “does anyone have a connection? I’m trying to contact the front desk but it’s not going through.”

There was a brief silence as everyone looked at their phones, shaking their heads and looking at one another.

“What about the emergency phone?” Asked the older man to my other side. He was a manager that I’ve seen on one of my trips to the upper floors. “Elevators usually have phones directly connected to the building’s landline, we should be able to get in contact with the fire department.”

The custodian, whose name tag said “Walker” crouched down to open the phone panel. “Got it.” He said, sending an almost palpable wave of relief through the elevator. He stood back up with the phone to his ear as he pressed the button to connect with the lobby, but his look quickly turned to one of confusion. “It’s just giving me a busy tone.” He said, “Wait, let me just try dialing 911.” He punched in the numbers and waited for a minute, as the look on his face deepened. He simply held out the phone, which was still emitting a busy tone.

“Could it be something with the phone?” Asked the woman, who later introduced herself as Anmarie, an executive of one of the larger companies in the building.

“Maybe,” Walker said, a flat tone settling into his voice, fear faintly visible on his face.

I began to feel the first inkling of panic setting in. “I can’t be here all night.” I thought to myself, worried about the preparations I had to make for work the next day. Before I fell into complete despair Clark, the older man, spoke up.

“You know, we should consider ourselves lucky! There are much stranger situations we could be in right now. Especially in this old building.”

“What’s supposed to mean?” I asked.

“Well maybe I could tell...no. I don’t wanna spook you kids.”

Anmarie had an irritated look on her face, “You can’t just say that and drop it, tell us what’s on your mind.”

“All right, all right, I’ll tell the story - but don’t you go blaming me when you find yourself spooked. You see, this is an old city. And this here is one old building. One of the first skyscrapers, built way back in the early 20th century. Lotta history in these walls. I’ve been here long enough to experience some of it - you see, when a structure stands as long as this, it develops a mind of its own. It doesn’t come to life but...imitates it in a way. It's like -”

He was interrupted by a strange, joyless chuckle from Walker. He was now sitting on the floor, staring at the ground in seeming disbelief.

“Very funny. Look, I don’t have to tell this story, son. We can all sit here in silence and wait for some internet connection if you don’t like what I have to say. You got anything better to do?” Walker remained silent, truly never having spoken in the first place. “Now, what was I talking about? Oh, right. This place, this building, it’s got a mind, a spirit you might say. I think that all the years and the people have left their energy here to coagulate, and sometimes that energy can have an effect on the physical world. When I was a lot younger...eh...maybe in the sixties or seventies, I was working my first job out of college here. Stock broker. I had a habit of staying late, sometimes into the early hours of the morning. Course, it caused a lot of problems with the wife. Heh, one time, I came home at four o’clock in the morning to find her-”

“You’re getting a bit off-track, Clark.” I said.

“Ah, fine. You kids know nothing about good conversation. Well, one of those nights I was the last man in the office. I doubt there was anyone else on the whole floor. Hell, maybe the security guard was the only other soul in the whole building. Well, I’m sifting through a stack of papers left by my secretary. Whole buncha memos and letters that I let pile up, the thing had to have been sitting on my desk for the last week. So I’m going through these papers, praying to the good lord that I can finish with enough time for a couple winks before going back in the next day, and I find this envelope in the middle of the pile. It’s blank, but obviously has something in it. I’m wondering why Linda would put this in my pile - it’s clearly spam of some kind - but in that moment I felt a compulsion I thank god every day I haven’t felt since. I will still in control of my body but I felt something, something like strings tuggin’ at my fingers. Tuggin’em toward my letter opener. It was so strange, like a dream. It felt so alien and at the same time...so natural. Like it was just a part of my routine. I was shifting between panic and embarrassment at my own irrationality, all the while opening this blank envelope like I would any other. Eventually, my mind turned from the fear and panic toward curiosity as I opened the letter within.

‘To Mr. Winston J. Hall,’

It said (which isn’t my name, by the way),

‘This letter is to formally notify you that several complaints have been filed against you by various employees and two clients. These complaints have been filed in regards to several instances including, but not limited to:

* Inappropriate lines of questioning to a coworker surrounding her recently deceased mother.
* Following a coworker home after work hours.
* Requesting explicit information from a client during a business call.

We find the reported behavior extremely concerning, and request that you cease it before more punitive measures are taken.

\-H.R.’

There was no date or indication of who wrote the letter, and I’d never heard of a Winston Hall working at my firm - or anywhere else on the floor for that matter. I was wondering why this letter was on my desk in the first place? How did Linda get this? Who gave it to her? I sat there for a good long while pondering when I noticed a feeling I hadn’t felt earlier. It was a feeling of...I don't know...heaviness? You know how the air is different when you’re in a crowded room than an empty one? Well it felt like that - like in the time it took me to read the letter and think on it, twenty invisible packed into my little office without me noticing. ‘Course I got nervous. Not quite scared yet though. I rationalized that someone had dropped the letter into the wrong basket and Linda didn’t see it, and the heaviness was my own sleep deprived brain malfunctioning. There was still an itch in the back of my mind though. Something primal in my brain knew that was wrong. I got up to grab my coat and hat in more of a hurry than I would have admitted at the moment, but the second I turned my back to the door across from my desk I heard a *bang bang bang* on the frosted glass. It was a like knock, but just more forceful. Now I damn near jumped out of my skin when I heard that and immediately turned to see who was there - but there was nobody at the door. I went up to the window next to the door - which had a clear look at the main floor - and looked to see if I’d been mistaken and wasn’t the only man left. Nobody. It was unsettling to say the least, but as I closed the blinds and thought it out I started with the rationalizations again.

‘Maybe it was the security guard checking to see if I’m still here. Yeah, that’s gotta be it. I’ll stop by his desk on the way out and thank him for-’ Boom.

All my thoughts stopped, all my logic went out the window, when I noticed what had been slid under the door when I had been looking out the window. It was a blank envelope. This was the point where I knew I was scared, and not the kind of adrenaline high “scare” that you get at a haunted house or you feel when you drive a fast car. No. This was deeper, more insidious. It’s the fear you feel in a dark room and notice a shadow in the corner that shouldn’t be there. It lurks in the pit of your stomach, weighs down your limbs, rends any hope or denial from your mind. I felt that force from earlier. It wasn’t any stronger - more that the fear had made me so weak I couldn’t resist its pull. It drew me to that letter. Made me pick it up. Made me take it to my desk and open it the same way I had the last one. Made me read it.

‘To Mr. Winston J. Hall,

We are writing to inform you that as of the thirteenth of November, 1956, your employment will be terminated. This termination comes only after multiple letters of warning informing you of complaints and multiple reprimands.

We pride ourselves on a safe and comfortable work environment, which would no longer be possible should your employment continue.

The entire time I read that letter I felt that heaviness get heavier. More tangible, more real. Eventually I realized I could hear it too. Faint thuds coming from the other side of the door. Footsteps - big ones - coming from down the hallway to the right of my door. I couldn’t rationalize those, cause it sure as hell wasn’t the security guard. Sal was a small guy, not nearly heavy enough to make footsteps like the ones I was hearing. I jumped out of my chair and locked that door right before the footsteps got to it, and I managed to take a few steps back before whoever it was got to the door.

I was right. He was big. Hell, if his head was where it was supposed to be it probably would have been partially out of view of the window. But it wasn’t. His neck was broken - bad. It may as well have been sittin’ on his left shoulder. Thank god for the frosted glass, cause if I could have seen his face...I think I would have truly and permanently lost my mind. I started stumblin’ back as I watched his hand lift to the glass and give it three firm knocks. I’m not ashamed to say in that moment I started blubbering like a baby, and my old man raised me tough - that’s what got me through school, let me rise to a new station in life. Let me fight a system stacked against me since birth. But that figure...that neck...the way he just stood there...stock still...knocking. I’ll never forget that. I’ll never forget that fear.

I spent the night curled behind my desk, staring out at him. I had it in my head that if I looked away at all, he’d come in. He never did, though. I must’ve blacked out from the shock at some point ‘cause my boss found me the next day, still curled up and peeking out at the door. He said I was muttering about a Mr. Hall. I was unresponsive so they called an ambulance and I woke up in the hospital. I knew the story was gonna get me put in an asylum, so when they asked what happened I just told them I had overworked myself, had a really intense nightmare or something. My boss gave me the next couple weeks off with pay - he was a good guy - and told me to take care of myself, get some time off to spend with my wife. I’ve told people more humorous versions of the story at bars and parties over the years, always blaming it on a several day stint of no sleep. I know that wasn’t it though. I’d been too scared to check the records or ask the veteran brokers about Mr. Hall, but I’ve seen pictures of the building’s foyer from before the mid fifties. It used to be a couple stories tall, with a big balcony overlooking the entrance. That balcony’s not there anymore. Like I said, I’m not gonna go asking, but I’d bet big money that balcony was removed after someone went diving off it with a rope around their neck. I don’t know what I saw that night, but I’ve made it a point since then to leave right at quittin’ time. ‘Cept for tonight...of course.”

We all sat in silence for a couple of minutes after that, I could tell that reliving that story wasn’t something that Clark did regularly - even after all these years. That feeling of dread was a little more noticeable now, but I just tried not to think about it. “You just heard something truly terrifying,” I told myself over and over again, “of course you’re a bit scared.” I knew that if I didn’t do something to distract myself I would have a nervous breakdown, so I looked at the others and asked “Does anyone’s phone have a connection?” Everyone checked their phones and shook their heads one by one.

“I’m gonna try the door again,” Walker said as he rose to his feet, “wanna give me a hand?”

He looked at the professional young man, who still had yet to introduce himself. He simply nodded his head and rose to his feet as well. They pulled at the door on the count of three, and for a little while it seemed like they wouldn’t get anywhere - until a snap came from somewhere in the doors and they were able to pry it open, only to expose drab, gray concrete on the other side. “Damn it,” Walker heaved, winded from the fight with the doors, “we must be between floors.”

“You’re a custodian, aren’t you?” I asked, an idea forming itself in my head, “Is there a way into the elevator shaft? Any panels we can lift?”

“Not in these ones,” He said, looking up and shaking his head, “we’re not allowed to touch the elevators, anyway - only the company that installed it can do that. Not sure why, but either way I don’t have the tools or know-how to get out of the car, let alone fix this hunk of trash.” He let out a huff as he sat back in his spot on the floor, leaving us in yet another oppressive silence. After a while, Anmarie started, fidgeting a bit.

""Well if we're going to be telling stories I may as well share mine...""

Sounds pretty stupid, but I'm here on a full scholarship and I've been trying as hard as I can to coast to graduation without having to think about what ""real"" life is going to be like. Kind of hoping someone can give me a kind of wake-up call.

I've had one job in the past - working part-time making sandwiches at Panera Bread. It was about six hours a week, next to no customer interaction, dreaded it anyway. Family and this scholarship have kind of enabled me to be a useless shut-in with an overwhelming fear of even the concept of a ""job."" My family's best advice is just to grind away this degree and not worry about my career, but I don't think that's how things work anymore.

At this stage I feel like I'm just incapable of actual work. I start basically every assignment the night it's due, no matter how big it is. I don't drive anywhere. I don't get my own groceries. I hardly do the laundry. I haven't been applying for jobs or internships. Basically still at the level of a 14-year-old, and the one family member I still talk to (my mom) just enables that.

Anyone have advice on how to become a responsible adult as fast as possible? Either I keep working at my Computer Science degree (there's a good chance I lose my scholarship) or I ditch and try my hand at video game development, which I've also barely done. The original plan was to get the most boring, low-maintenance, low-interaction CS job I could find and coast through life alone. But it seems like that isn't feasible for me. I need something that can get me to care about my future before I end up being the 5th unemployed person living at my grandparents' place."

jv572f,4,2020-11-16,[IWantOut] 23M Tunisia -&gt; Canada/Germany/Somewhere good,AwfulDog,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/jv572f/iwantout_23m_tunisia_canadagermanysomewhere_good/,"I am a tunisian national who is currently living and studying in Germany under a temporary student permit and i am starting to think about moving to somewhere else later on. Germany was never my first choice but rather a cheap and good alternative for a 3rd world middle class citizen like me who was willing to study abroad under a limited budget. I will finish my bachelor's in mechanical engineering soon enough and after that i plan to do a master's in Robotics (IT would be much preferable but as with an ME background my chances of admission to a Mechatronics or Automation program are much higher). Canada seems to be a good anglophone environment to move in to. I am thinking about doing my master's degree there and then figure things out from there on. Plus, they are much more immigrant friendly than Germany (and maybe even all of europe combined). I prefer countries within the anglosphere and i have been considering Australia for a while too, but i don't think it is as good as it used to be years ago.

**Some things about me**:

* Tunisian
* currently undergrad in mechanical engineering in Germany
* mid 20s by the time i apply for master's -can speak arabic, french, english and german quite fluently, however the latter is my weakest
* have been here for about 4 years as a student (first year was spent learning the language through a language course)

**My pros and cons here in Germany:**

\-Pros:

* settled in well currently and i can say my current rental situation is a dream for any student looking for a place to stay here (even for the natives themselves) but i had to go through a painful 1-2 years of search to get there
* I have "" distant"" relatives in Bavaria who can be quite helpful during tough times but they can only do much
* I have a great deal of experience about living in Germany in general and i am used to it
* Financial situation is stable atm
* I rely on public transit a lot and it is also very good here but not as good as the Netherlands (it is much more expensive there too). Riding a bike is much cheaper than owning a car and i do not plan on investing in some long term things like owning a car because i did not actually plan to stay here for long in the first place

\-Cons:

* language is still a problem even after all these years
* Xenophobia: I always feel like an outsider no matter how hard i try to integrate and this comes from the people here themselves, not just me throwing shade at them, however i have met some people that can be an exception to this but they are so rare that it makes their presence insignificant in order to generalize their character. I personally find germans having some sort of innate problem of feeling superior to any race or anybody who is not german. I also hate when they try to teach me how to do things or how to live my life here even after telling them that i literally have relatives here.
* the laws can pigeonhole you very easily if you do not understand them. They don't use a points-based system here too.
* taxes are quite high and salaries can be cut dramatically due to this. Being a student makes so many things cheaper and accessible (for now)
* it takes ages to finish an engineering degree and my performance in my studies has been halved ever seen i had to study in german. In fact, my efficiency level, in whatever activity, is always half as much compared to if i had to use english or french

**What i am looking for:**

* a decent immigrant-friendly country, preferably in the anglosphere/western world. Asia, middle east and eastern europe have always been a mystery to me so i can't even consider them for now
* a good work-life-balance with good job opportunities in my field (obviously germany is the perfect place here but i want to try my chances in other places)
* possibility of obtaining citizenship or at least PR status. My tunisian passport is worthless and the country is not getting better anytime soon or as you can see it's evolving... but backwards

*My solution is:*

stay here in Germany, finish education here too then apply for PR once i fulfill the requirements while venturing to my target destinations from time to time, wheter it be for research purposes, internships or even vacations. My current student status only allows me to stay outside the country for a short and specific amount of time so short term visits are my best bet. Otherwise move to Canada once i finish my current degree.

I want to keep Germany as my ""safe haven"" for the time being, therefore i do not want to risk moving out somewhere else and realise that i messed up. Also i want to experience living in those places first then make a critical decision. Life there might be very similar to here and I might regret it or it might not be as good as my current situation here so going on short trips from time to time is my best choice. What do yall think?

Besides that, since i have mentioned having distant relatives here, can i get citizenship through them? Laws that involve relatives can get complicated, plus we share the same last name except that the one who does is considered a cousin by law. From what i remember, it is not possible."

Best way to approach?,luciano_d,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jv76zi/process_optimization_and_automation_challenge_for/,"Hello Engineers! I am trying for an internship at a Bank and in the final phase of the selection process the candidates have to provide a solution to a typical problem a Bank may run into.

I've never had any experience with Banks (ME here), and very little experience with databases and automation with programming. I was hoping you could help me out and give me some pointers, show me where to look, or brainstorm some out-of-the-box ideas!

This is the challenge:

There is a system where all the documental pendencies of clients are registered, but we don't have a structured database with each client's contact information.

1. How can we automate this process, so that we send daily notifications to clients who have pendencies?

2. How can we capture messages the clients send, automatically download the right attachments and add them to the system?

Thank you guys in advance!"

For a intern project im trying to add a layer of the average annual rainfall (worldclim) to my website with leaflet map. As mentioned before, I'm doing this trough geoserver where i publish this GeoTiff as a WMS 

Everything is working fine, except that the loading time of the layer on the website is (too) long. Especially when zooming in and out. The GeoTiff itself is quite large, but not extreme (446mb). 

I have tried to use GeoWebCache to improve performance, but it seems to have very little effect. 

after doing some research i found out other methods like: building a Image Pyramid, ImageMosaic, using Overviews and converting my dataset to a Cloud Optimized Geotiff.

As a newbie on this matter, i would like to know if some of you can recommend me a method and/or know where to find usefull information/tutorials on this specific problem?

I got an offer for a Software Developer Intern position at a fintech company in 2021. The salary is 45k (in Australia) and the position is full time (38 hrs a week) for 12 months. A quick stalk on past interns on linkedin and the tech stack seems standard for the industry (no boomer shit)  


I'm reluctant to take this offer because I'll basically not be studying during the year if I take the offer (I reckon I can only work myself to take 1 subject a semester) and will have to extend my degree.  


I have no internship experience and if I don't extend my degree I'll be graduating in 2021.  


Was hoping for some advice on if I should take the offer. I understand that during covid19 getting job experience is extremely valuable, but considering the pay and how the company isn't top tier, I'm not sure if its worth it, and maybe I should just try harder in interviews in 2021 to land a grad role at a better company?"
jv8e5p,0,2020-11-16,How to build things in the beginning,Gothem-saved-me,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jv8e5p/how_to_build_things_in_the_beginning/,"I have been involved in CP for 3 months now and I have managed to reach a rating of 1650 on Codechef. However, I very well know that I want to learn coding because deep down I want to build stuff. I am always full of ideas but have not been able to take off on even one of them due to this very reason (not knowing how to build). 
Now, a bit background of me. I study in one of the top engineering colleges of my country however majoring in an entirely unrelated field related to coding. I recently pivoted my career trajectory from non-tech to tech. 
That being said, if people here could tell me about their journeys (specifically for people who have pivoted at some point in their career to tech), how did you guys start to build stuff, keep yourself motivated and at the same time build your resume at the same time?
My short term aim is to secure a job in 1 year from now (doing internships midway) and eventually build stuff. 
PS- Should I full time involve myself in applying for GSoc (btw, I only have 1 year left of my college) or just keep doing CP? 
Your response could potentially change my life. 
Love, 
Fellow human."

**Background:** 

Junior CS major, interned at Google last summer on an open source project (no internal access). I really don't know how I managed to get these offers and I definitely got really lucky, I'm just looking for some advice from people already in the industry.

**Questions:**

1. Should I try out a different company to experience something new, since this is my last internship, instead of returning to Google? On the other hand, I didn't have much internal access at Google last summer so I feel like I didn't get the full experience.
2. I'm interested in living in Seattle and would prefer not to do another virtual internship. Both Amazon and Microsoft seem like they're trying to get interns into the office atleast sometime in the late summer (but who really knows?). Google has already decided to go all virtual. 
3. I've heard that Amazon is a stressful place to work full time and if so, I probably wouldn't want to convert to FT next year. Is this a reason to not intern there or should it not matter?

I don't know what projects I would be on for any of the companies and probably won't get much of a choice. If anyone has any other points you think I should consider please let me know."

The advisory grades put me one point below a C+ and my HW is near 100 and my quizzes are high up as well. Realistically I think I can get a C+ and be done with the class but I wanted to know if this would hurt my chances at getting an internship for next summer? Since everything is online and there are less chances to do things (I’m in FSAE virtually) I feel like employers would analyze grades and weight that strongly when looking at potential interns.

TLDR: is a C in Calc 2 gonna kill my internship chances during Corona?"
jva59z,13,2020-11-16,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (11/16/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/jva59z/weekly_job_qa_thread_11162020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirty-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Undergraduate top 100 engineering school for mechanical engineering. 
- GPA: 3.51 (with a marked improvement in Junior and Senior year) 
- Internship at Northrop Grumman and return employment offer. 
- 1 year research experience at national lab with a poster, peer reviewed paper, and coauthor of IEEE conference presentation. 
- treasurer and active member of university robotics team for large budget 
- none of the programs i want need a GRE this cycle because of covid so I didn’t take it. 

I doubt I have a chance of getting into the top 5 schools and am applying:
In the top 10 for my reach schools: Georgia Tech and UIUC. 
In the top 25 for reasonable shot schools: Texas A&amp;M, Northwestern. 
And top 40 for safety schools: So far University of North Carolina but might look for more. 

Are these unreasonable? My imposter’s syndrome is really kicking right now and I don’t have much of a gauge for where I stand. I really enjoy research but I want to be realistic. Should I change this list? 

Thank you."
jvbldi,1,2020-11-16,Group Project Hell,Mads_is_rad,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jvbldi/group_project_hell/,"I was lucky to get into a special program where I get 6 months of free college and a 6 month internship. This is my fist time I have been able to go to college, I’m 25 years old. My main issue with this program is their ways of “holding accountability”. 

This program is made for young professionals who are kickstarting their career. So, while in class we are expected to uphold professional etiquette and work ethics. I love this expectation... except the people in the program don’t enforce all of the rules, only some. 

I could deal with this. My problem is, I’m stuck in a bad group for one of my classes. They expect me to treat it like work. I’ve been trying to, but there’s only so much I can do to encourage grown adults to get things done by deadlines. For the first phase of our group project I took on a heavy workload. I was creating my part of the project, plus acting as a project manager, plus fixing other’s parts. I burned out HARD. So, I decided I would stand back more on the next phase of the project. 

Well, bad decision. I still made the outline, still did my part early, and still they were down to the wire with their parts. One of them said they’d turn it in. I trusted them to do so, and had a busy night anyways. Minutes before the cut off to send in, I realized I hadn’t heard anyone say they turned it in. So I rushed to my computer to do it myself. I got the spinning wheel of death and it didn’t go through on time. I asked the person who said they’d send it if they had. Nope. They didn’t because I “hadn’t said to go ahead”, though their message about sending it in wasn’t a question, it was “if no one else wants to send it, I will.” Now I will get a missing/late assignment infraction which takes away my ability to win “professional of the week” this week and money from my stipend. Infractions influence their choice on what internship I will get in March. 

For the infraction my plan is to see if the program director will hear me out. That only solves part of the problem, as I’m still stuck with the group. In the beginning the year her made it explicit that no one can change groups. We have the final phase to complete now. I am losing my mind. I want things to get done on time. I want to be able to trust my group. These aren’t huge things to ask for. 

I’ve already gone the route of laying down the facts with them. I tried reminding them of our goals, too. I even tried stroking their egos. And, as you know, I tried stepping back and believing in them. Nothing has worked.  So... any ideas on what I can do to avoid more damage?

(Summary: Trapped in a bad group that’s affecting my grades, stipend, and internship opportunity. Paragraph directly above describes what I’ve already tried.)"
jvby2h,0,2020-11-16,How much do I need to know to start applying?,DaemonDanton,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jvby2h/how_much_do_i_need_to_know_to_start_applying/,"I did a fair bit of (Java) programming in high school and college, and am coming more and more to regret not pursuing it as a career. I'd like to do some training in my free time so that I can make the jump into a full-time CS position.

It's challenging, though, because ""free time"" isn't something I have a lot of, and I don't have a ton of energy to apply to training at the end of the day. There's also so much out there to learn, but I don't know how much is necessary to get a job and how much I can grow into later. I feel that growing as a programmer will be much easier when I'm in that environment, instead ofbalancing it against my current job. 

I'm willing to start from the bottom. I have bills to pay, so an internship is probably not an option, but generally I'm in a position where I can take a pay cut if needed. Java seems like the obvious path, since I do have some experience there, but I'm open to other things.

What goals/skills would you recommend as a minimum before applying to programming jobs? What are the minimum skills expected for an entry level position? Is there a short list of topics that I could dive into that would make me reasonably marketable? I don't expect it to be quick or easy, but I think the answer also isn't ""learn everything on every conceivable topic"""

jvf6ba,76,2020-11-16,Don’t live your life like it stops on May 1,SATcrier,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jvf6ba/dont_live_your_life_like_it_stops_on_may_1/,"Don’t live your life in high school to get into a T20, it’ll the worst decision you’ll make in high school. Hear me out:

Colleges can sniff out that BS. Most of the time they can tell if you do a certain activity to look good for college applications. So doing activities for college apps doesn’t even work most of the time.

But let’s say it does work and you do get in. It still sucks for two reasons:

1. If you spent high school **only** trying to get in, and not exploring your true passions and interests, **you’re likely not an interesting, passionate person.** In a T20, you’ll be surrounded by incredible, smart, passionate people. You will feel like shit if you know that you aren’t actually passionate about something. You won’t be able to talk about interesting stuff with peers, you’ll feel imposter syndrome, you’ll be less desirable in the weird social-professional hierarchy that exists at T20s. (I still feel all this stuff occasionally even though I am genuinely passionate about my thing).
2. **You’re (more) directionless in life.** And lemme tell you something: that’s a common, overwhelming, and stressful feeling when you’re in college. It’s even worse if you don’t have any passion from high school to start from; you’re way behind everyone else in finding your life direction. This directionless affects your path/choices/assuredness for what classes you take, what you do over the summer, internships, majors, job searches, grad school apps, extracurriculars, research, networking,,, everything. Being directionless at a T20 also makes you worried about “wasting Harvard/Yale/Stanford”. It all feels so stressful when you’re behind everyone else in finding your passion and life direction, so spend high school starting to find that direction (not trying to just get in to college).

So yeah, even if you do get lucky and get in, it still feels shit knowing you’re so far behind your peers in having a direction and being an interesting, passionate person.

On the flip side, if you spend high school finding your passion and direction but still get rejected from a T20, you’ll be ok because you have a life direction! You’d be miles ahead of aimless people even at Harvard because you’re already doing the things to be successful in your area post-college (internships, networking, classes, clubs). You know yourself and your future, and that’s hella valuable. **In the end, those are the people who are gonna be the most successful when we grow up, regardless of what school they go to.** Be that person.

Also I think this goes without saying: You probably had a miserable high school experience if you just spent it doing things you don’t really like doing only to get into college. What a depressing 4 years.

\[Note: I’m fine, don’t worry. I actually know my direction pretty well for an 18yo (I think). These are just observations and thoughts I’ve had as I’m taking a gap year after HS before college. Also, I think I made not knowing your life direction seem worse than it is: most 18-20yo’s don’t know their life direction and that’s so totally okay. But at T20’s, it at least feels like everyone does and that can feel sucky.\]

I've been doing an Android Developer internship with a company in Amsterdam lately, and should get my software engineering degree in the following months (not from a Dutch university). The company might offer me a contract to continue working with them, and since this would be my first time discussing a job contract, I have no idea what to expect, especially that I'm not from the Netherlands.

Can you please let me know what salary should I expect for such a position? Is it normal to ask for a salary that let me fully benefit from the 30% ruling? Do I fall into the category of ""Young employee with master"" for the 30% ruling (I'm younger then 30)? Is there any other tax allowances I should be aware of besides the 30% ruling?

Any other contract discussion tips or guidance are highly appreciated.

Thanks all."

It blows my mind that companies are willing to shell out massive salaries for software devs and engineers, but are apparently too cheap to invest in their well-being, especially considering that [there are several benefits for doing so](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.orega.com/blog/industry-insight/the-5-benefits-of-a-workplace-with-a-gym%3fhs_amp=true), and also that [most employees would appreciate it](https://www.hrdive.com/news/a-majority-of-employees-would-exercise-at-work-if-their-employer-had-a-gym/445687/) if their office let them blow off some steam. 

It just seems like a logical move for a company that wants to have a competitive, productive, and happy team.

I'm more than certain that I got a job with this MSP nearby but since I vacationed out of state, I need to quarantine for 2 weeks before I can go forward with anything. However, I just got an email from the president of the company asking if he could send me some PCs and help them get set up with what's needed for a client before sending them off. I have not on boarded with the company yet or even been given a salary. They want me to help them with this in my isolation time and then talk bigger things when I can meet in person. So, this feels like a micro internship to just kind of feel for what's needed in the meantime. My question is, if they would rather this work be some sort of subcontract thing before I become an official employee, what should I expect to be paid for this kind of work? Looks like I would just be getting rid of any bloatware and adding their anti-virus and such. What do you think?"

Hi everyone- 

I could really use some encouragement. 2020 has been hellish for me, and this week has been the tipping point. If anyone has any words of encouragement, it’d be much appreciated. Because we all know venting to strangers on the internet is easier than talking about it in real life:) 

My 2020:

\-An immediate family member passed away 

\-A grandparent passed away, and I found out while out of town on a recruiting trip, alone… worst week ever. 

\-My dog passed away from cancer… (I was working out of state didn’t get to say goodbye)

\- 2 of my kitties were killed by a neighbor’s dog

\-I was cheated on 

\-My college commencement was cancelled (getting this degree was very symbolic for me)

\-Despite trying my absolute hardest and doing well in college, I still feel I am one of the lowest performers on my new work team… I have been working 11-12 hours days and asking for help/clarification but my work never seems to be good enough. Plus there are a few EXTREMELY competitive people at my site and I feel like I just can’t measure up.  

\-My company just announced over 11,000 jobs will be cut… and lowest ranked performers go first

\-My “best friend” dropped off the face of the earth, and only texts me when she needs help to recruiting to companies I’ve interned with (this has happened 2x now). If you are wondering if I have reached out, I have. I have even reached out to the point of baking her cookies from scratch and making her a handmade watercolor card, and driving over an hour to hand-deliver them. Nothing. However, when she has an urgent internship application deadline coming up, all she wants to do is talk to me. 

\-Social distancing has been hard on me during this already emotionally intense period

\-Oh, and there’s an unprecedented global pandemic :)

Anyways, if anyone can please offer words of encouragement, I could really use them. Thanks &lt;3"
jvle8b,0,2020-11-16,Don’t even know what to title this,whattheheckll,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jvle8b/dont_even_know_what_to_title_this/,"I don’t know what to do, I’m so confused and feel worthless or like I’m going crazy. 

I am a 21 yo female who just moved out with her boyfriend, we agreed that we would pay according to our incomes so I’d pay 30% and my bf would pay 70%. Then, I found out that if I paid only 30% I’d have to cook, clean and basically do everything for him (like a house wife/maid) so I told him I’d do 50% then. 

I have so many problems with paying 50% because I have internalized hate towards my boyfriend since I feel he’s super miserable by making me pay 50% of everything (because literally I have to use all my income to be able to live with him since I have an internship that pays me minimum wage and I go to school full time while he works a job that pays him 6X what I make in a fricking year) 

I’ve been feeling hate towards him for a few days now because I feel expect too much and I feel like I’m not getting what I deserve (I hate having a gold digger mentality but I can’t help it, I just don’t manifest it to him), a few months ago when he was trynna get me back (because he cheated so we broke up for a month or so) he used to give me gifts, take me shopping, we even went away for a few days, he would send me food deliveries, etc. And then I got back with him. 
Now that we’re living together, he literally makes me pay for half of everything and I can barely afford this, I’ve spent over 60% of my monthly salary on a week and a half. 

I literally don’t know what to do because if I ask him for help financially (just to pay a little more than he already does) he will make me his slave and I believe that’s too inconsiderate. 

My options: 
I wanted to open an only fans account because I look decent (8-9/10) and he said no, then I told him I’d dance to make extra money (I usually send money to my family in another country every month and I won’t be able to do if I keep paying for half of everything and not working another job) so I just want to become a stripper and make money but he cannot find out because he would hate me and probably kick me out and I feel like there’s no other option for me, like I already work 40+ hours a week + college full time. 


The effects his stinginess has on me: 
I can’t even kiss him or anything because I feel like he does not appreciate me because he’s so miserable and cheap with me. 

Should I become a stripper? I feel like I have no other choice because I can’t go back to my family’s house."

Through much luck I never had to work while in college, instead I had internships, did research, a leadership position, and other volunteer work. I graduated Dec 2018 but wasn’t able to start looking for a job because my grandmother (essentially like my mother) became sick and needed help. I Was initially only supposed to be her main help for a few months but that turned into almost a year and a half. This past August my father was able to take over that role and now I’m trying to find a job. The issue is I haven’t heard a single thing back other than a couple rejections. I’m extremely disheartened because I feel so far behind everyone else. I can’t even seem to hear back from retail stores hiring for the holidays. My anxiety has gotten worse over this and I’m freaking out that once 2021 gets here my resume gap will be too large for anyone to take a chance with. All I can think to do is take free courses online and maybe do a certificate to help me freshen up what I learned in college, but I don’t really have the money for that. 

I just feel completely behind and like I’m not employable especially given the job market at the moment in the US. 

If anyone has had large gaps or been in a situation like this in the past I could really just use some comfort or to know that there is a way out of this hole. Just very lost and scared and have no where else to go for advice or understanding."

I spent the next 2 months scrambling to find some kind of work for the summer. I was pretty desperate because 1. I had never done an internship and 2. I didn't want to spend the summer jobless. 

I accepted a job as a content developer at a small company in my college town. It didn't pay super well and the tasks were pretty basic. Just some basic HTML/XML and very little room for creativity or trying different things. The job was kind of like doing the company's busy work for them. But I'm glad I got to do it and can at least say I have some professional experience. The main thing I guess interviewers have been asking me about it is the Agile team so I guess that's a plus. 

Honestly, I've been really bummed out about it though. The past summer kind of sucked because I had such a negative view of the job. It didn't help that my parents said ""I didn't work hard enough"" and ""you should be doing better"". It hurt because it was true. I wish I had secured a better internship last year. One that wouldn't get cancelled and would easily move to WFH. I know I shouldn't be this hard on myself because no one could have predicted this happening, but man it just sucks because so many of my peers' internships didn't get cancelled and got to work remotely at awesome companies.

I just feel like I've been behind in college all of my time here. Every year has been a struggle and I feel like I'm not getting better. My brother did cpe too at the same school and pointed out that I am always nervous about getting something and said ""when are you gonna start getting what you want?"" Freshman yr I didn't get to choose my first choice major bc I had sub 3.0. Then going with cpe and struggling in this major kinda gave me depression. I'm at my fourth year and will be doing a fifth too. I'm enjoying my major now and I'm doing better, but still, all my shortcomings are adding up and its taking such a big toll on my confidence in this field. 

It just sucks that I had such huge aspirations in high school and freshman year (and all of my childhood) and was never insecure academically. I was good at everything and loved learning. Now its like I lost all of that passion and hope and I find it hard to believe the same brain was capable of all that. 

Anyways, I'm just depressed about all this. It's really consuming me everyday and I just want to start succeeding in what I do. I hate feeling behind and disappointing myself and my family. I know they say they don't care where I am and just to do my best and all that, but its hurting me still. As someone whose always been the best at everything, its like, I just can't bear to be less than the best. I am doing better academically, though, so at least there's that. But my average gpa along with a sub-goodenough internship, I'm feeling really hopeless and unconfident about finding a great internship this summer. It's probably affecting the way I perform in interviews as well because I realize I'm not speaking about my internship in the most positive way. Please does anyone have any advice for me to change my mindset? Or at least give me some practical advice on how I should move forward? I just don't want to keep disappointing myself."

I took my first programming class my first semester of college, I kinda hated it, and by the end of it I liked it and did well. 

Then I had to take an intro Data Structures and Algorithms class. This class was brutal and literally made me depressed. I was an actual zombie because of those assignments, and my professor only ever cared about proving her mastery of the subject and my being a moron if I ever asked her for help. And, I wasn’t that great at it... I came out with a C. I couldn’t get into the major, and had to retake any other class except that one to barely crawl in.

Now I’m here taking my first Software Practice class, and I am KILLIN it. Seriously. It’s challenging at times, but in a fun way. It’s so exciting to code and learn so many new things, not to mention that fact that I’m doing very well on my coding projects and assignments for the most part. This stuff is second nature now and I can’t see myself doing anything else for a living.

It is now internship time and I’m finding myself in a bind. I don’t know all this textbook information about complexities of different sorts and memorizing all these fancy names of search algorithms and whatnot off the top of my head anymore. Partially because I didn’t do well in that course, but also because you tend to forget this stuff after such a long time (it’s been a year and half since I took the class) anyway.

I took a practice HackerRank for one of the place I applied to and I passed the coding questions within a couple of minutes each, but the multiple choice one asked me “which of the following sort algorithms have the best asymptotic efficiency”, and I was just stumped.

Sorry for the essay. Here are the questions.

-Am I screwed if I want a summer 2021 position?
-Assuming you get here and I’m not screwed, what do I do? Obviously the only real thing to do is study up, but is there an efficient way to do this that anyone would specifically recommend? I have classes at school and many other responsibilities, too, so I need something doable yet effective.

Thanks for listening to my rant, and I look forward to getting some advice."

I had a phone screen with a recruiter recently and that went very well. They forwarded my application to their hiring managers at several locations and I'm in the process of waiting to hear back about 2 different positions I applied for

Aced the coding challenges and my recruiter was very happy with my answers to their questions.

How long does it usually take for potential interns to initially hear from hiring managers? What happens after that?

**Accepted**: 1

My background is in administration, teaching, and management, primarily in arts and entertainment. I applied heavily from late July 2020 to September 2020. At that point, I stopped actively applying because my old job called me back. Two jobs reached out to me in October, and I ended up taking one of them.

---

**Resume** - I basically used [this template](https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/), except I put education at the top. I had 8 slightly differing versions of my resume for the different kinds of jobs I was applying for.

**Cover Letter** - I wish I could find the original author of the template I started with, but this ended up being my basic cover letter:

*Dear Hiring Manager,*

*I'm enthusiastically writing regarding the [POSITION] at [PLACE], which I discovered on [WEBSITE]. I have over [NUMBER] years of related experience and am excited to bring my creativity and energy to [PLACE].*

*The job description mentioned that you were looking for [QUALITY, QUALITY, and QUALITY].*

*As you can see from my resume, I’ve [DESCRIPTION OF JOB DUTIES THAT SHOWS I CAN DO QUALITY, QUALITY, and QUALITY]. I [DUTY, DUTY, ACCOMPLISHMENT].* 

*This multifaceted role has made me a [QUALITY, QUALITY], capable of [TASK].*

*I’m confident that I have the skills and ability to be an asset to [PLACE]. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.*

*Sincerely,*

*[YOUR NAME]*

**Interview** - I obsessively honed my pitch and practiced with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMPrvEWxo).

**Websites** - I was looking primarily on Indeed and [NYFA](https://www.nyfa.org/jobs/), but sometimes Craigslist and LinkedIn, too.

---

**Closing Thoughts**

* *Personalize, personalize, personalize* - I really started getting somewhere when I started personalizing my resume for each job. Eventually, I had 8 slightly different versions of my resume ready to go, which I would personalize even more for each job.

* *Including interests on your resume* - Yes, I started including interests on most of my resumes, and I started getting more interest. I kept it very brief and specific. My resume for the job I ultimately accepted, however, did not have any interests on it.

As we all know, this is an incredibly tedious process. I certainly felt depressed and worthless at times. I just kept telling myself: this is a numbers game, and I just have to stay in the game to win. I saw every application as increasing my chances of winning the numbers game, even if only slightly. Additionally, I was very inspired by the folks on here who racked up 300 applications in the same time I had done 130.

To everyone still applying: you got this!

**EDIT 11/18/2020 11:00 AM EST - Thank you all for your kind well-wishes! I thought I'd compile my answers to the most frequently asked questions here:** 

**Are you entry level? How many jobs did you apply to per day and per week, on average?** - *tltr4560 (Thank you!)*

Not entry level. I’m 28 with 4 years of experience in management. I applied to 5-7 jobs a day max, but sometimes I only managed to do 1 job a day. I was very slow because I was researching the companies, personalizing my resume and cover letter a lot, etc.

**What kind of position did you end up in?** *- RogueMimzy (Thank you!)*

I took an administrative position at a well-known organization, but not directly in my field.

**What did you do to improve your interview skills?** *- kbflower (Thank you!)*

The best interview advice I got was: peg your answers to your accomplishments, i.e., figure out what the most impressive things are about you and connect every interview answer to one or more of those. I really worked on this because I'm naturally not someone who brags about themselves.

So, for example, if someone says, ""Tell me about yourself,"" old me would have said, ""I'm [NAME], I'm from Colorado and I teach painting.""

New me had a spiel: ""I'm an artist, teacher, and manager. I started my interest in [FIELD] at [SCHOOL]. In my current position, I'm the manager at [PLACE], where I directly supervise 10 people. The studio makes an average revenue of $800,000 a year, and I've brought that up from $500,000 in 2017. I oversee all hiring, onboarding, and operational initiatives, while also teaching painting at [PLACE] to groups of up to 50 adults at a time."" etc. 

Obviously those details are a little fudged but you get the idea. I practiced with my friends and with [the video I linked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMPrvEWxo) until it was second nature. You don't want to memorize word for word, of course, but you want to know what points you're going to bring up every time.

**Do you have any suggestions for the final rounds of interviews?** - *sassylilmidge (Thank you!)*

I really can't call myself an expert on final rounds since I've only done it 5 times. These are my general thoughts, though:

* **Anticipating common interview questions** - At the lower levels (where I am), there are only so many interview questions that get asked (even in the second and third rounds). I found [this free Balance Careers website](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/job-interview-questions-and-answers-2061204) very helpful for all of that. They have lists of common interview questions and suggestions for how to answer. I came up with my answers for pretty much all common interview questions and practiced them obsessively.

* **Peg your answers to your accomplishments** - I wrote a little about that above. Basically, figure out what the most impressive things are about you and connect every interview answer to one or more of those. So if someone asked the classic, ""How do you handle stress and pressure?"" I had a semi-memorized answer ready to go that connected back to a striking, memorable accomplishment. E.g.: ""In my current position, I run a lot of high-pressure, high-stress events. I remember one time, I was overseeing an event for the entire cast of the Lion King on Broadway and everything needed to be perfect. It turns out they needed a red carpet and a photo backdrop, but it seems like there was a miscommunication and the information didn't make it to us. So, my coworker and I sprang into action... [DETAILS] and, in the end, the night went off perfectly. No one even noticed a thing. I deal with challenging situations by leaping into action and doing everything I can in the here and now."" I would be brief, but make the example as funny and vivid as possible. 

* **Get your most successful friend to critique your interviewing skills** (multiple times if possible) - This was painful, but helpful. I picked the most successful person I know and asked them to do several mock interviews with me. Most people will be flattered to be asked. **1) You want to practice until it's automatic.** In the first practice round, I would fall apart during basic questions out of nervousness (and because the situation was so weird). By the later rounds, I had a smooth, but natural (I hope) patter down. **2) Their feedback will be really important.** They might tell you you need to brag more, or say that one of your anecdotes is particularly interesting and you need to find a way to work it in earlier. **3) If possible, get them to practice with you the night/morning before interviews so you're not walking in completely cold.** Eventually I stopped relying on this, but I found it helpful for my first few 2+ round interviews.

**Did you include personal hobby type interests or professional goals/interests?** - *Packynin (Thank you!)*

Personal interests only. My exact line (when I included it) was: ""**Interests** – Camping, hiking, bicycling, drawing, mycology.""

As a side note - I'm Asian, and we are sometimes stereotyped as being all the same, boring robot drones, etc. I felt like adding the interests might have humanized me to hiring managers.

I didn't put any professional goals. I used to do some hiring and never found those sections that interesting. But it's probably different for other industries.

**Would the template apply to a college student with no work or internship experience? All feedback I've gotten so far is that my experience is not relevant. Do my extracurriculars and projects hold any merit for anyone...?** *- beetles_juiced (Thank you!)*

I'd need more details to give you good advice, but there's usually a way to spin your accomplishments in the best possible light. I interviewed for a lot of positions where I had no direct experience in that specific field.

I usually read the job description, isolated the tasks that were most similar to things I had done, and then rewrote a few bullet points in my resume to directly address those tasks.

So for example, if I saw a job description like this:

*REQUIREMENTS:
• Experience with social media, notably Instagram (all aspects: writing posts, promotion, documenting engagement with followers)
• Proficiency in Microsoft Office and web research; and with Adobe Creative Suite is a plus. 
• Strong organizational, verbal, writing and problem-solving skills. 
• BA degree in Fine Art, Art History, or experience in a related field.*

I would think to myself, okay: I don't have experience with Instagram, and web research isn't a huge part of my job. But I could spin my resume in the best possible light with something truthful and relevant, like this:

* *Created original content for company social media accounts.*

* *Researched market trends to support and develop new operational initiatives. Assisted senior management with status follow-ups and progress reports.*

Maybe not the best example, but you get the idea. 

**Are you the white lady with curly hair in the image header?**

No, that is a still from [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMPrvEWxo) I linked! I used that video to practice interviewing."

I figured this was the place to post this as I am aiming to enter/re-enter the field.

Hey all. In May 2020 I graduated college with a BS in CS. I had interned at the same small comp sci firm over every summer. When I left in 2019 to go back to school they had tole me ""Cant wait to see you when you graduate, you've been doing great work!"" Well, I graduated, and their company was unable to hire me because of COVID related reasons. Since that fell through, I went back to serving at a restaurant that I had worked at over the weekends during the same summers.

Recently I had a real wake up call as I picked up $2.50 in change off the ground. I need to get back into the industry. BAD. But as I make my Linkdin and look at my GitHub I feel like I have nothing to show for my time at school. The projects that I did in the early years are bad. Some in the late years are good but most of the code was implemented by teachers where the students were left to implement individual methods. I did good work senior year with a financial company as a senior capstone but that code is not for public eyes. Nor can I show my summer internship code. I need to show employers that my skills are still sharp.

I'm looking for advice, whether it be **fun projects** to code over a weekend to pack my GitHub, **job placement** **services** that you've used to great success, **wise anecdotes** from seasoned professionals, or even **examples** of your pristine GitHubs. Honestly just trying to reassure myself that I am capable and didn't go through engineering school for nothing.

Thanks so much in advance."

I am currently in my senior year of my MIS bachelor’s degree. I started with very simple IT experience and worked full-time during school in an opposite career.

I got turned down by a bunch of internships and jobs, I even looked for volunteer experience and couldn’t find anything especially during the pandemic.

With luck, ~ 5TH zoom interview at a company that randomly reached out, I finally accepted a full-time offer for a technical support administrator (Help desk).

I practiced interviewing, researched resumes, keywords, etc. This is ultimately what landed me the role seeing I had 0 professional experience in IT.

I work remotely full-time while finishing up school online. I am fortunate that they bought me whatever equipment I needed (~ $1000 worth of equipment).

My manager wants everyone to move forward and have a linear career in IT, starting in helpdesk himself, he knows what it’s like to feel stuck. He wants to make sure we don’t feel stuck and not stay at my current company, not because it’s bad, but we can have more potential to move elsewhere.

So, I am Definity not trying to brag, but think I was lucky to have found a unicorn company to start with.

**Where am I going with this?:**
My company is expanding its WFH footprint. along with this, they are changing over their infrastructure to move into the cloud, O365, AWS, and some other cloud-based technology.

The great thing is that my manager and the CIO want everyone to take whatever cert we can and learn especially, with hands-on labs, especially for AWS.

They are willing to pay for whatever cert or learning materials we need.

**Interests:**
So, I am new to IT, and not sure where I want my career to go.

I am interested in development but not really into working as an SWE. I have also been looking into DevOps, Cloud (AWS), or technical project management.  

With my MIS degree, I have grown to enjoy management and thinking about possibly getting in management especially CIO, CTO, or director.

I have been self-learning some front-end coding on my own, I put the A+ cert on the backstep seeing that a large majority in the A+ curriculum, I have already been tasked with.

**Question:**
What is the best way to maximize the opportunity I have at this company in what certs to get for “free” and what is the best way to figure out what part of IT I want to get into?"

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you and your families are safe and well during these trying times.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a junior studying mechanical engineering and am in the process of deciding between two internship offers: 

1. An engineering internship at a Fortune 500 aerospace company 

2. A technology consulting internship at a Fortune 500 technology and professional services company 

Consulting is something that truly excites me and is a field that I've grown to enjoy, but I know that long-term, technical engineering work is something that I will always feel drawn to do and will pursue once I feel that I've learned as much as I wanted to within consulting. 

I've done internships and side projects in both, and I've found that consulting is a role that really excites me, but engineering is a field that will make me feel the most fulfilled. I also found the exit opportunities to be greater at the aerospace company: it would fast-track my engineering career and grant me more flexibility in transitioning, more so than the consulting company could (obviously). 

Although it shouldn't be a huge factor in my decision, I still find it to be important in deciding where I'd want to go. I was wondering what an entry-level salary is for an engineer at an aerospace company? I've seen huge ranges from 70k-100k and I'd like to know what your experience has been. I want to be as informed as possible in the event that I would need to negotiate any offered salary.

Also, what are your thoughts on an engineer with only professional consulting experience? Could that experience make me more well-rounded and a more attractive candidate when applying for engineering positions? I plan on also taking the F.E exam before I graduate as a means to compensate for the lack of professional experience if I'd want to go into consulting first and then transition into engineering, is that the correct thinking to have?

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what your thoughts/opinions are and what your professional experience has been like. Anything at all will go a long way.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you and have a great day!"
jw3clf,1,2020-11-17,When should I leave my current 'good' job which I don't like for something else (what job I don't know yet)?,mattatoe17,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jw3clf/when_should_i_leave_my_current_good_job_which_i/,"Hi,

Early summer I graduated and started a job in Taxation (which starts with a one-year internship) fairly quick. However, I was blinded by the above average pay and good benefits.  My current job is very boring to me, has basically nothing to do with my degree and there seems to be no improvements for this in the future here.

But my problem is that I don't know what kind of job suits me and don't know how to figure this out. My master economics studies were very general and broad. The past weeks I have been reading multiple books related to different fields in trying to figure what fits me, but have not been able to decide yet.

This furthermore leads to not making the decision to leave my current job. Due to the good pay, there first seemed to be no stress to changes jobs, but now my boss is enrolling me in the next level of courses with exams (which will take at least 6 months) while I have no motivation.

Now my first question is, how to I decide what kind of job suits me? In my free time I have also started studying finance by myself, which I really like so far. But I mostly miss the data analysis and economic development parts from university. My grades were very good and I was offered a Phd, but the subject (and basically every Phd subject) is just so specific.

Secondly, when do I start applying for a different job? Should I still try to finish my internship? But if I decide to do something completly else, it won't help me and maybe I won't be considered as a young graduate anymore (which seems important for Finance). Furthermore, I don't want to spend 6 months studying tax laws while I could spend the same amount of time in studying something useful for another job (f.e. data management, more finance, ...) or start a traineeship.  Should I bullshit my way through the courses, spend my time on something else while getting paid and quit just before the exam (kinda seems like a dick move)?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I'm in the interview process for one company (lets call it company 2) right now. I just received an email from another requesting availability for an interview (company 3)

I have an offer deadline with company 1 for next Monday (11/23), which I first received November 11. My school says students should get 2 weeks to decide on job offers. 

Should I ask company 1 for an offer deadline extension? Am I right to be worried about giving the wrong first impression for company 1, in asking for an extension?  Or should I ask company 2 and 3 for an expedited interview process?

Or do I do both?

If so, do the following emails look good?

Here's what I was thinking for company 3:

&gt;Hi (recruiter),  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for the invite! I'd love for a chance to chat with you and learn more about the opportunity at (company) as someone who is particularly passionate about (blahblah)! I have selected my availabilities on the calendar you sent.  
&gt;  
&gt;That being said, I do have a competing offer deadline due Monday, November 23. So, I would really appreciate it if we could get through the interview process as soon as possible!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you, 

Here's what I'm thinking for company 1:

&gt;Dear \[internship coordinator\],  
&gt;  
&gt;I am so thrilled to receive an offer for the Software Developer Intern position. I am especially intrigued by how \[company does something\], and loved talking to my interviewers about \[so and so\].  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that the offer deadline is November 23, 2020. I’m currently interviewing with another company, so I'd really appreciate an offer extension.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, according to the policies set by \[my school\], all students should be given 2 weeks to accept or decline an offer. I believe the offer deadline policy is in place partly to benefit employers by having interns accept a job offer because they think it is the best fit, not because they feel rushed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, I am asking you to kindly extend the offer deadline to \[uh idk next Friday maybe? or later?\]. I look forward to learning more about \[company name\] in the coming \[days/weeks\] as I consider this offer!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you very much,"

I am majoring in data science/analytics, but been looking into UX design field as well.

Due to the pandemic, all the internship that i wanted to do this year has been canceled. While I'm continuing to look for internships in 2021, most of them are looking for students who are graduating between December 2021-June 2022. And I am graduating in march 2021.

And despite building a rather well-received portfolio, just because I'm graduating before those dates I've been getting nothing but rejections. I thought about postponing my graduation time, but I figured these companies are looking for ACTIVE students, meaning it will look like I dropped out or just taking a break.

I am seriously concerned post-undergrad program because I heard it's hard to find a job with an internship, and it's harder without. If I didn't find an internship, at least I have myself to blame. But due to something that's outside of my control, it feels seriously unfair that I might end of penniless and homeless in a very near future"

jw741x,1,2020-11-17,Which Bootcamp is best?,Tobydog30,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jw741x/which_bootcamp_is_best/,"TLDR at bottom 

Hello, I have been researching boot camps in search of the right fit. I have been teaching myself how to code for about a year now, focusing mostly on front end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

But for the last month or so I’ve hit a wall and when applying for jobs I still see many technologies that i’ve never even heard of. So I‘ve decided to apply to boot camps so that I can round out my education. 

I am working towards becoming a front end developer. Front end development is where the coding magic happens for me and I enjoy watching a website come to life piece by piece. 

I am blessed and priviledged that the cost of the bootcamp is not a very big barrier when it comes to deciding between bootcamps. 

I have narrowed down my choices to three options: 

1. Alchemy code lab full javascript stack bootcamp

2. Epicodus full stack bootcamp 

3. University of Oregon - Web development full stack bootcamp. This is my backup bootcamp if I’m not accepted into the other two. My friend is in this bootcamp currently and has good things to say. But due to the camp being only about a year old, there aren’t very many reviews online for it. Unlike alchemy code lab and epicodus 

Alchemy code lab is a rigorous full time bootcamp and costs $24,000. The camp is 23 weeks long. 

They focus on Javascript. They teach JS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React/Redux, SQL, Git/GitHub, API development and more. 

They provide some career help as well with mock interviews, resume/cover letter help and some more. They also occasionally hire their own graduates. 

Epicodus is also a rigorous full time bootcamp but costs $8900, so about a third of the cost for alchemy. Once again the cost is not a big factor for me, but saving $14,000 is definetley a bonus. The camp is about 7 months long. 

They have two pathways that are available where they teach Javascript, AngularJS, EmberJS and React/Redux. Then you have a choice of C#/.NET or Ruby/Rails, in this section they teach about databases but don’t specify what technology they focus on. This is the only deviation between the two pathways. 

The biggest difference with Epicodus is that they provide you a 1.5 month internship after you’ve completed your coursework. This provides interview experience, as well as on hands work experience. This is the biggest reason why I’m considering Epicodus. 

TLDR: my predicament with choosing is that at first glance, Alchemy code lab fits my career path and interests more by focusing on front end development and frameworks, with some back end education as well. But doesn’t provide very substantial career help. 

Epicodus doesn’t match my career path and interests as well as alchemy, but provides a valuable internship to finish off the course. 

My ultimate end goal for the bootcamp is to work hard and find a job to begin my career after completion.

I certainly want to stay in the US/Canada for as long as possible and I don't want to go back, since home is a very toxic and dark place for me. I'm torn between keep applying to jobs and start prepping for grad school, and I don't want to waste my time with something that doesn't give results, because that might risk my whole life. Here are my reasons:

\- At this point, I have accepted that I probably won't get a summer internship. Please let me know if I'm being overly pessimistic, but I think I'm only being realistic. Most big companies are now done with recruiting, and the others often don't hire international students. I don't think I'm incompetent for an internship at all, it's just that I'm not outstanding enough to get an offer from FAANG, and I can't afford to just ""get something to do"" over the summer, for the reason I mentioned above. Should I keep applying to jobs and hoping that I get the offer at a company that sponsors visa?

\- About grad school, I'm actually pretty open to this option. It's not that ""oh I can't get a job I have to go to grad school now"" kind of thing, it's more like ""I have the opportunity to go to grad school and learn more now"". My GPA is pretty good (\~3.9 atm), I don't have much research experience, but I think given enough time, I'll be able to do well. I feel like I'm the type who would do good in school, and I'm looking at some top CS schools in the US/Canada for grad school. I think if I go to a bigger name for grad school, my chance of getting a job might increase, is that true?

I studied Computer Science (B.sc) at a top 10 ranked TU in CS. My grades were: CS Major (2.4), Econ Minor (1.6). I specialized in AI, Efficient Algorithm and Human-Machine interaction. I wrote 180 applications in the last 12 months. I had 10+ telefon interviews/video calls, one time I got to the second round, but in the other cases I received a refusal. I had no internship, but at the university we had a software praktikum where we developed 2 software projects in Java/Eclipse. My Bachelor thesis was in Java/Eclipse. In my spare time, I developed an android app with Java/Android Studio/AWS. And I developed a computer vision project with Python/OpenCV. I can speak 3 languages fluently (German/English/Turkish). When they ask me questions about Java, I answer most of them correctly, at Zalando, they sent me a programming test (3 programming questions in Java, that I should solve in 130 minutes, I got full points 100%, still got a refusal, without they ever seeing me. They said, that they already found someone...) I already had a job interview coaching, she said, that I present myself good. And I only apply to Junior positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me further? I dont know, what I should do"

Something is not right with me and I cannot seem to figure out what it is. Ever since a few years i've been extremely anxious about a lot of things. Example: asking a grocery store worker where to find certain things is almost impossible for me. I also have problems with going to physical stores that I have not been too before, same with restaurants. Not too sure where issues like these come from but i've really been struggling with this, especially now that i'm doing an internship at a school and I start to feel physically anxious when I need to correct or be harsh to students. It's like feeling afraid without knowing what I am really even afraid off. 

I've also been experiencing mood swings. I'll feel happy and excited to move forward one day, but then another day I shut down and get stuck in my own thoughts. By far the most amazing thing in my life right now is my girlfriend and i'm really afraid these patterns of behavior that i've been finding myself in will impact this relationship.

I also have no idea how to start and finish projects anymore. I get stuck in many wonderful ideas but i can never really seem to put them into practice. All i've been doing for the past year is just smoke weed and get through the day chilling with my girlfriend, watching movies and most of all: Browsing Reddit. Now that i'm finally being productive again by doing an important internship for my study I cannot even feel motivated for this anymore because every lesson is dreading to me since I always feel so anxious. 

I've also gotten into the habit of buying expensive clothes. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but one of the most fun things for me to do is sign up for raffles and limited brand drops to buy clothes. It brings me enjoyment and i don't even know why.

I just feel fucked up and I don't know where to go with this. Thanks for reading"
jwhsnv,0,2020-11-18,Leaving Implementation Job for a SWE job,swedreams123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jwhsnv/leaving_implementation_job_for_a_swe_job/,"I graduated last year with a degree in CS and took a job at a big name tech company doing implementation. Pretty much people buy our product and I help them set it up and teach them to use it. I have given it 11 months and I really don't enjoy it, and sort of see it as a dead end. I think I didn't realize how much I enjoyed being a SWE (I had SWE internships) until I wasn't one anymore.

I think I would rather be a SWE again than keep doing my job. It has been ruining my mental health. I just received a SWE offer from General Motors. I am not super excited about GM but I think it would be easier to get a different SWE role from a SWE role at GM than to try to keep making the hope from my 0% dev implementation position. I don't want to take it out of desperation, but I dread every day in my current job. Has anyone had a similar experience to this and could offer me some perspective? Thanks in advance"

jwj7hz,1,2020-11-18,I am currently a Pharmacist....by some miracle I graduated from Pharmacy School with horrible marks. I am now getting rejections for post-graduate studies. What do I do?,PharmaHelpMe,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jwj7hz/i_am_currently_a_pharmacistby_some_miracle_i/,"Just for reference, I am not based in the USA.

I will try to keep this short.

I was a bright student in High School. I got into University and everything went downhill. I ended up heavily depressed, isolated from everyone, I turned to weed to cope and a bad relationship ended up with me almost being kicked out of University. I appealed and by some miracle I was successful. It took me 6 years to complete a four-year degree.

I honestly do not know how I obtained that degree with the marks I graduated with. 

I have passed my board exams, internship and completed all the necessary requirements to register as  Pharmacist in my country. I have also been able to secure a job as a full-time hospital pharmacist. I also get paid fairly well. Everyone knows me as a hard worker and the smart guy. I just feel that it's not enough. I feel like a fraud and I want to redeem myself.

Pharmacy as we know it is dying in my country. I am trying to improve on my qualifications which will hopefully put on a better career path (ideally within Pharmacy) in the future.

Unfortunately, I have been rejected many times trying to pursue post-graduate studies. The response is always ""I do not meet the minimum requirements required""

I really don't know what to do. 

It feels like I'm going to be stuck as a basic Pharmacist for the rest of my life. I could climb the ladder with work experience but at some point, I feel a Pharmacy qualification is going to become a basic qualification. What will set me apart?

The sad thing is, I honestly feel that given the chance I'd be able to do well and excel in a postgraduate qualification.

What do I do? I have thought about doing short courses and diplomas to pass time and hopefully land on something good or go back and take some pre-requisites and pursue a whole different degree.

My academic performance back in Uni really kills my self-esteem when I think back on it.

Any advice would be highly appreciated."

I've recently graduated college with a Bachelors in 2019, and I am currently working in an office gig that I went to school for (IT related). I'm extremely grateful to be working during the pandemic, but if I'm being honest with myself, I haven't looked forward to working in my field since midway through my degree. I toughed it out and just told myself that it'd get better over time and with more experience. 

Fast forward two years after a couple internships and office gigs later and I do not see my future relating to the field that I'm working in. That said it's helping me pay off some debt that will hopefully be finished up by sometime mid next year.

I feel like I'm in the dark on what I want to do after my time with this job is up. I don't have much of a desire to work in an office setting anymore (at least not for the usual 8 hour shift) and I don't mind switching fields entirely. 

I've taken tests that focus on my personality, skills, and interests. i've also spoken to a career counselor. While it was nice to have those discussions and evaluations, I don't feel much farther in regards to planning out what's next. 

So I ask you, what have you done to better understand yourself and your path?"
jwknks,1,2020-11-18,Should I move back home with my parents?,fullback133,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jwknks/should_i_move_back_home_with_my_parents/,"After college, I was given a job offer with a company I had an internship with about 2,000 miles from my hometown.  I was hesitant at first because I wanted to stay in my hometown with my family and friends, but I decided I should try something new and break out of my comfort zone.  


It has been 2 years since I have moved and I am at a low point in my life and totally depressed.  I tried for awhile to make friends and I found people to hangout with, but I have always been a small group of close friends sort of person, so I have not found many relationships out here to be genuine and make me happy. And now a couple months ago, the only single person I sorta enjoyed seeing moved to a different state so I have felt totally alone for months during this pandemic. 

I still play video games with friends from back home daily, but I hear about to the plans they make for weekends and trips and it makes me so sad I can't join in with them.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest hesitation moving home is job security.  Obviously right now the job market is miserable and it would be quite risky to drop a guaranteed, well paying and forward moving job to move back home.  However this entire past year has been miserable for me and my physical and mental health continue to dive with no end in sights.  I have tried many times to help myself but I keep falling back into the same rut.

I have some money saved up and my prospective plan would be to move back home with parents for a couple months while I hardcore search for a job, and then to move out to my own place in the same city when I am a bit more stable.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the move would be amazing for my mental health, it would help me find a job I actually enjoy and I would be able to see my friends and family again finally.  I have a really good relationship with my family and it breaks my heart to be unable to see them regularly.   


Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? I really need some push to make the move because I know it would be best for me, but I have some mental block telling me this is a bad idea.   


Thanks all, this has been weighing on my mind for a long time now."

I am at a crossroads at this point and I busy evaluating my options. I can't graduate early even though I have the credits because I have a field session that can only be done during the summer. It is typically done between you junior and senior year but most students kick it back to the end of their senior year so there usually isn't enough room for actual juniors. Anyways but that is a bit of a side tangent.

So I am choosing right now between two minors or taking my spring semester off in 2022 and doing a co-op and coming back in the summer and finishing. I do have a few questions about co-ops before I take that route however.

1. Would it be ideal for someone in my position to take a co-op? I would be basically done with my degree but I would have to come back in the summer anyways.
2. Do I have to have a high GPA to get most co-ops? I have a 2.8 and most companies want a 3 for internships but I have previous work experience.
3. Would a co-op be more valuable than a minor for potential employers?

jwofa9,135,2020-11-18,Landed My First Internship!,MickleG314,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jwofa9/landed_my_first_internship/,"Holy shit! Super grateful for the opportunity and I am extremely relieved. For anyone curious, the position is with Medtronic Surgical Robotics as an engineering intern.

As far as for anyone looking for advice, I'm not gonna say the usual shit of ""oh just apply everywhere"" or ""oh do some side projects"" bc that is obvious. What I am going to say is prioritize school less. Seriously. I've noticed too many people on here are losing their passion for engineering because they had to retake a class a couple of times, or their GPA is no longer a 4.0. It will be impossible to land an engineering job if you cannot convey passion over the interview, and even if you do somehow land the job, you will be in the mindset of hating the field.

Of course, that doesn't mean deprioritizing school to an extreme to the point where you lose essential scholarship money or drop out, but to a reasonable extent, the grade really doesn't matter that much for your professional career.

Good luck guys, I genuinely hope all of your applications/interviews come back with great results too :)"

I am not well equipped when it comes to things of computer science but wouldn’t mind taking several classes that can help men later on as well as fill the rest of my credits up for my degree.

However, I’ve heard from a lot of people that getting an internship as a freshman is really tough. I have a couple things on my resume that somewhat help me stand out, and I was wondering about how much they actually boost my chances. 

So the first thing is that I had an internship in my junior year of high school where I personally made some decently impressive automations in Ansible (which I put on my resume). The second thing is that I’m almost guaranteed to graduate in 3 years, so I’ll be able to join a company earlier than other freshman. I’m not too sure how these affect my chances so I’m asking you guys what u think. Thanks for the help!

Also I didn’t know what to put for the flair so I just put COVID 19. My bad if that’s not right."
jwp77d,15,2020-11-18,Feeling like shit after being rejected from two internships,InsectFootJoint,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jwp77d/feeling_like_shit_after_being_rejected_from_two/,"About a month ago now, I interviewed for a data analyst internship for a well-known tech company, and another internship for an insurance company. I was officially denied from both last week, and am feeling pretty terrible in general.

For the tech company, the first interview went fine. It was over the phone. The interviewer seemed engaged and I had answers for all of his questions, both technical and behavioral. He also seemed to like and be engaged with my answers. However, the interview was 15 minutes shorter than was planned, which worried me. Despite that, within a couple of days, the company reached out to schedule another interview with another person.

This second interview is where everything went wrong. This interview was also over the phone, but my interviewer called me about 15 minutes late and didn't really seem very engaged. She would yawn while I was speaking and never asked any follow-up questions. I also didn't have nearly as good responses to her questions either. When it got to the technical part of the interview, I screwed up by mentioning that my experience in SQL was only academic experience. This resulted in us skipping over the SQL questions and ending the interview then and there.

I already felt like I was no longer under consideration by the time we hung up, but I was officially rejected last week.

On the other hand, my interviews for the insurance company went spectacularly. The phone screening was great; the interviewer seemed engaged. My second interview was behavioral with two interviewers and went similarly well; they also seemed engaged and responded well to my answers. The technical interview went well too because my interviewer said I had great and thorough answers. Every interview went well. I'm sure of it, because the recruiter said she called me several times, but received no answer. She then emailed me to inform me that they'll be moving on with other candidates because I never responded. The thing is, I never received the calls or emails. I checked all my call logs from now to before the interview, and I never missed any calls. I also searched my inbox and spam box, and couldn't find any email from that company either. So I'm not sure what I could have done.

The tech position didn't go well, and I already knew I lost that position before the interview was even over. But I felt like I nailed the insurance position. I met all the qualifications. I did well in the phone screening, the behavioral interview, and technical interviews. I felt like I did everything right, but somehow, I still screwed up and lost the position.

I'm especially worried because I'm in my third year, so this summer's internship is the one that'll most likely lead to a full-time post-grad position.

I'm currently working one part-time internship with a non-profit, so I'm going to try to get on some projects that are more analysis-related and SQL-related so I could improve my confidence in SQL. I'm also working a very part-time research internship (I'm talking about one or two hours a week) that is analysis/data science-related. I'm nearing the end of that position, but I might try to stick with it for a while longer

I'm in the interview stage for one other internship, but that's it. I could extend my non-profit internship over the summer, but it's not really analysis or data science-related. I'll continue applying to more internships, but right now, that's all I got.

What do I do now? Am I worrying too much? I'd love any advice you can give me"

Been applying to apprenticeships, internships, and junior software developer positions in the southeast Michigan area and Research Triangle area in North Carolina.  Not exactly Silicon Valley, but not tech deserts either.

I'm a career changer coming from a background in pharmacy (BS + professional doctorate degree), and my last position was as director of pharmacy.  Wasn't terminated, but the business was sold and my position was gone.  Happened in February of this year.... which yea... great timing.  Decided to make the change because I've always loved tech, and writing code has been an extremely rewarding and fun experience ever since I started doing it in April of this year when I started feeling like it was going to be a while before the economy came back and my unemployment dragged on.  Began with a Codecademy subscription to myself as a sort of a happy 30th birthday to myself in quarantine-land. 

I haven't had a single interview or follow-up out of the 80+ applications I have sent.

My question is:  With all the talk about software developer shortages and an emphasis on diverse thought from non-traditional backgrounds, has COVID really hit the junior developer roles with a sledgehammer?  And if so, what are your opinions on the timeline for recovery?"

The general consensus is that I need professional help for my mental health. I’m going to try to make it available to me at the earliest. 

And lastly, I feel much better. I’m still anxious and fearful, but also feeling better. So thank you for that.

Now before everyone starts judging me please know I wasn't always this obsessed about astrology. In fact I'm one of those people who keep logic and critical thinking at the forefront. However circumstances in life have made me so vulnerable and hopeless, that I'm spiraling down a rabbit-hole of astrology. 

My family, especially my mother and her side of the family have always been believers of vedic astrology and kundli horoscopes. In fact they used to consult someone who ended up predicting almost everything accurately in their lives and as a result their belief and trust in him grew. Since I was a kid I have always distanced myself from astrologers and their predictions. 

I remember whenever my parents would come back after taking me and my brother's kundlis for consultation, I would always just go sit in another room (when they'd discuss/tell us about it) because I didn't want to hear what the guy said. Firstly, because almost always it was something negative, and secondly, I felt it just ruined the mood and pushed you to make choices that you might not have considered before... turning the predictions into a sort of self fulfilling prophecy.

Now before I get into the astrology-bs I'm in, some back story:

I've had depression and anxiety as a teen. I've been to therapists a couple of times but it hasn't helped that much. 

I graduated from engineering in 2017 and even though I was a better student and scored fairly well, things didn't work out so well. Due to an unfortunate circumstance I lost the on-campus placement I had secured. People who were less smart than me now have better careers and lives. I was unemployed for 8 months until I found an unpaid internship with a great MNC. I tried hard but it never turned into a full on paid role. Somehow I managed to get an interview at a company thanks to a reference from my cousin and got placed there as a software trainee. Even the job and role in itself had no growth or learning, I was happy to be finally employed. That year itself I met and started dating my first ever boyfriend. 

So trouble began last year. The job was pathetic, my manager didn't treat me like a normal human and wouldn't even look me in the eye when he talked to me. He used to think trainees were useless and beneath him and ended up delegating someone else in the team the task to help me learn the ropes and get tasks done. I was so unhappy that I would often come home with an intention to put my papers the next day. But I kept on getting up every morning and dealing with it. 

I was never expecting that on a fine Monday morning when I'm called for a meeting with my manager it'd be because I was being laid off. It was out of the blue and it was shocking. I felt like a rug had been pulled from underneath me. My relationship with my boyfriend was a bit tumultuous before but from here shit started to hit the fan. From the last year we've been in an on/off relationship. There have been massive fights and he's broken my heart by telling me he doesn't love me and thinks that he might never be able to. When I broke up with him over that, he backtracked and said he could love me with time and that he doesn't want to lose me. The emotional fool I am, I took his manipulative bait. He's been toxic and emotionally abusive and immature but patient and sweet at the same time. It's been a hellish roller coaster. 

So when I lost my job again and got depressed my mother got worried. My cousin used to consult an astrology service at that time. Its a telecom company's calling astro service wherein astrologers speak to you on the phone and make predictions at Rs9/min. My cousin swore by this one specific astrologer she used to speak to at this service and naturally my mother decided to consult him(given the cool Rs9/min deal as well). 

He would predict overall good things, about my future and my relationship. Some of his predictions were accurate. With just the name of my bf he was able to tell what he looks like and the exact spot he has a mole on his face on as well as many of his characteristics. When I gave him my bf's birthdate, he always told me that my bf is a good guy by nature and he loves me but isn't able to express it. He used to tell me he'd never misguide me and that me and my bf actually do have a happy stable future together. I love my bf and obviously this gave me lots of hope so I kept enduring and overlooking things in the relationship. 

At the career front I applied to multiple jobs and would rarely get a call back. Whenever I did get a callback, I'd clear interview after interview till they'd reject me in the last round. I would call up the astrologer disheartened and he swore by the fact that I have an amazing career ahead of me and that ""mera guarantee hai apka iss mahine job lag jaega. Mai apko kabhi galat guide kar sakta hoon kya?"". He was telling me exactly what I needed to hear, both on the career and love front and I kept on believing him. But things never turned out quite like he said. I never got a job, my love life was bad and then covid hit. So when asked about his guarantee he used the excuse ""Ye toh parmata ka kaam hai. Parmata se bada koi nahi. Aur Covid toh sabke sath hi problems create kar raha hai, sirf aapke sath nahi"". 

As you can tell by now I had already built a dependency on it. Every time shit got bad mentally (and more often than not it was due to relationship issues), I'd call him up. I used to trust this astrologer because after talking to him I felt positive (because he was lying as I later find out). Whenever me and my bf would have a fight, I'd be really upset and unable to eat or sleep but the astrologer would predict the exact date after which my bf would contact me again and say sorry and it always came true. A few weeks ago he left that consultancy service and I started talking to someone else who was even more positive and I guess this is where I realised he was overselling it. My life wasn't as good as he kept saying. 

So on a random day I talked to a random guy from the service and not my ""regular"". He laid things out to me brutally honest. Apparently my kundli has a negative conjunction in the 7th house(the house of marriage and relationships). He said my kundli shows that I value relationships and bonds but unfortunately no matter who I'm with, my current bf or someone else, my relationships are bound to be rocky and always on the brink of breaking off. I will never get the amount of love I give back. There will always be problems. He said even my married life wouldn't be happy.  I also have Shani and Jupiter that'd delay my marriage and any career related ventures. 

In order to test his knowledge I asked him to tell me about my life so far. I gave him specific years to talk about and  99% of his words were accurate. He spoke about my past romantic likings and how even they never worked out well. How I've always had to struggle harder compared to my peers at school/college to get where they are and even then get unsuccessful results. How I was unemployed and struggled for a while before catching a break. Whatever he told me had happened to me, year by year, month by month. He predicted when I started my relationship, when I lost my job, and when my relationship started turning worse. I felt like he was playing a reel of my life just using my birthdate and time. He told me my life has been full of struggles from an early age and will continue to be so because it's in my kundli. 

Obviously this made my anxiety skyrocket. No one wants to hear their life isn't happy.. then what's the point of living (and believe me my depression makes me ask this question a lot). When he realised how low hearing all this made me feel, he gave me a lot of ""upaaye"" to strengthen my planets.  

I asked him philosophically if this is my destiny just because it's in my kundli and I was born at the wrong place or wrong time. I asked him if i can change things. He told me ""karm se sab kuch badal sakta hai"" which feels like such an oxymoron to all of it.

Needless to say, the break up happened with my bf to the point where he doesn't even want to talk about it or meet me. He's disrespectful, cold, and indifferent. We haven't met since Covid lockdown, it's been 9 months and he's showed no interest to talk things out or even make an effort to come meet me. I'm still unemployed. I have exhausted all my references, sent hundreds of applications and reached out to so many people but there is no hope in sight. I feel like my life is falling apart.

The astrologer even predicted the next 5-6 years of my life, and 2021 in a lot of detail. Things don't look good for me and it's giving me so much anxiety and worry. I don't know what to do and I'm scared. 

I am so dependent and obsessed with astrology now that I keep calling just to see if someone would say something else, something positive and interpret my kundli in some other way. I've wasted thousands of rupees making hour long calls. I can correlate a lot of the things this new astrologer said about my life and my personality to the reality that now I feel like I'm doomed. I feel helpless like no matter what I do, it's just not in my control. What's written is going to happen. I value relationships a lot, and I tried really fucking hard to make it work with my bf. I was supportive, loving, loyal without ans stayed by him without even getting half of the intensity back. If my karm and my efforts couldn't even change my destiny then what's the point. Same was with my efforts at the career front. Multiple references, multiple calls, multiple applications. Nothing works.

I'm just 25 but I'm really depressed, vulnerable, and helpless right now. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore and it just isn't worth continuing if I can't change things or have what I want even with hard work. I've become so desperate to be accepted and loved back, it's ruined my self esteem. I'd like to believe I'm a good person and I don't deserve any of this.

I've read about the [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect) but I don't think it'd apply here as when you're on a call, the other person isn't getting all the visual and behavioral cues. I can't seem to accept that this is just cognitive bias since his ""past predictions"" were specific and spot on. 

I really need help. I've gone through below mentioned articles and multiple Quora posts about astrology and if its real. 

[Scientists said this](http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume34/GOT034263.html)

[and this but I can't seem to think logically anymore. I used to be a smart woman :( Help](https://bogardiner.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/a-professional-astrologist-realizes-astrology-isnt-real/)

Nothing seems to take this crushing doomed feeling away (the astrologer said I have ketu over me right now and things should get better in a month -\_-) but I'm just tired of wasting money and hours and my energy obsessing over this. It's ruling my life right now and I fell like I have no control anymore.

I don't know how to get out of this mindset. I wish I had never got into astrology. My self confidence has been completely ruined. My life feels like it's in shambles. 

What have everyone else's experiences with astrology been like, especially when you've been to one who actually knew what he was talking about? How do I get out of this shit-hole and change my perspective? Please convince me all this is actual bullshit.

I want to believe I can create a life I think I deserve and not my what my stars think I should get.

I need hope."

(I doubt it)


Hey guys, I'm planning on going for my graduate degree in Fall 2020. I haven't applied yet, but the deadline is in March and acceptance  letters don't come out until April for 2/3 schools I'm thinking about attending. One of the 3 schools accept students on a semester basis instead unlike the other 2 that accept students only once a year during fall. 

I'm graduating with my undergrad (CS major SWE emphasis) this December 2020. I pretty much have a little less than a year until I can go back to school. Do I find a SWE job now that'll let me transition to a full-time student later on in the year (I highly doubt that happens, but im not sure). Or do I apply to other jobs, maybe even just regular IT stuff or retail jobs, for the time being and then quit when I go back to school?

I've been thinking about applying to an internship before entering graduate school, but most that I've seen are requiring students to be currently enrolled in school. 

What do you guys suggest?"

jx468d,0,2020-11-19,Currently applying for colleges -- good colleges for someone who wants to work with programming in the game industry?,b0nelessmelon,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/jx468d/currently_applying_for_colleges_good_colleges_for/,"I'm a senior in high school. Yes, I know what the game industry is like, and I know it's more than just ""playing games"", and I know the pay tends to be less than other CS fields. Despite all of that, I am dead set on going into the game industry.

In college, I plan to pursue a CS degree instead of a game design degree. If game development doesn't work out, having the CS degree will at least let me work in web design or something else. Also, I am aware that a portfolio is more important than any degree I get, but that's why I'm having trouble choosing schools to apply to.

I really, REALLY want to go to USC for their CS Games program, but it's a competitive school and I know I need to look at things realistically. The thing is, I don't really know where else to apply? I'm applying to RIT and GMU as my safety schools, but I don't have match or reach schools that I want to go to that isn't USC.

I'm applying to some of your typical ""amazing for CS"" colleges, like UW, but I'm honestly at a lost for where else to apply. I had planned to apply for a few schools like UCSC and UCLA, but I'm starting to reconsider it after I heard that their game design programs are almost non-existent or just downright not good.

That's where I'm having trouble. A good CS education will obviously come in handy when it comes to game development, but I don't know the balance between CS and game development. USC's CS Games program is great because I get basically everything I want; I can get a CS degree, I can take game design courses, and I'll have internship opportunities as well as school projects that can become a part of my portfolio. With schools like MIT, UCLA, or UCSC, their CS courses may be amazing, but the lack of game development classes + the rigor of the classes would mean I'd have less free time to work on my portfolio and learn specifics about game development.

Basically, it boils down to this in terms of my college options:

* BEST OPTION: Colleges like USC that offer a BSCS degree, but with focus in game development (but it wouldn't be viewed different from a pure CS degree by employers, unlike GMU's ACS Game Design)
* Colleges that offer plenty of game design courses (usually colleges that offer game design majors/minors) that I can take as electives or as my minor/double major (such as CMU, GMU, etc.)
* Colleges that are moderate in coursework so that, even if they only offer pure CS coursework, I have time outside of school to take on internships, projects, etc. (but I'd still be getting a good CS education)
* Colleges that are high ranked for CS (MIT, UC's, etc.); would be great for getting jobs in CS fields (+ good education), but the rigor would mean that I probably wouldn't come out of college with some sort of portfolio.

The plan right now is to apply for USC, UVA, UoU, RIT, VTech, MIT, CMU, Stanford, and (maybe) CalPoly. I've already applied for UW and GMU. Neither of my parents went to college (or at least, not American college), and I'm living in Japan, so I don't have a lot of exposure to American colleges. If anyone has suggestions for colleges to apply to, that would be amazing.

TL;DR I'd love to go to USC for their CS Games degree but I know I need to apply to other colleges, so as someone who plans to major in CS and possibly minor in game design, please give me suggestions about where else to apply to.

EDIT: I'm hearing that Northeastern and UC Irvine are schools worth looking into. I'll take a look at it later."

Try to find relevant experience in a PM role (perhaps another internship?) and then turn that into a FT role.

OR
Take any software related role such as QA or SWE. Work for 2-3 years and to do my MBA and THEN become a PM.

Now my question is which one sounds like a better plan? (Asking the fellow PMs or people who know PMs) and secondly I’m scared of taking a QA role because I believe it will hurt my chances of becoming a PM in the future. Thanks

Wanted to get general idea about the way admissions committee members review profiles.

My degree grades are not in the top 1% (but are in the top 15%, and from the top university in my country, for my degree)

My degree is BSc in computer science and not a business degree.

English is not my mother's language, therefore I doubt I will score around 730~ on GMAT, although I got 759 on similar test (in my native language, similar score ranges and distributions).
I believe I will get around the 700s.

And I am pretty much aiming exclusively for Stanford (because it's a very good mba program but also due to personal reasons).

Therefore I want distinct myself as an applicant (although everyone wants to do that...).

So I wanted to ask how would admissions committee members view the following - 
1. Applicants who served in the army. 
Personally I started as a soldier then sergeant and later on an officer (being selected for ""promotion"" each time), total service of 4 years, all in a infantry division.
Note that this service was not in one of the USA's armies (USA's ally country).

2. Relocation for work. After an internship in a FAANG company, I have gotten an offer for a relocation to the UK and I was wondering how does something like that's is viewed.
A little context, the internship was in my home country and is meant for getting a job in the company's offices in my home country, so this relocation offer is not something usual (certainly not for a entry level).
Is it kind off normal/considered irrelevant or not?
(i.e. should this be something I will highlight even applying)

I am aware that the way such things are looked at vary 

I am aware that it has a lot to do with who the committee members will be, but I'm asking in general how do you think such things will be looked at"

I can't say whether any of this is the ""best advice"" or anything, but I can share my experiences in hopes that others can learn from it.

**Background**

I'm a sophomore at a \~top 20 CS school. I interned at an F500 (non-tech) last summer as a SWE intern and had an impactful project there. Decent GPA and personal projects. I had some minor research experience too, but no papers or anything.

**Preparation**

I started last summer preparing for 30 mins to an hour each day because I really wanted to have the best chance possible as a sophomore the next year.

For the technical interviews, I worked through EPI (Python) and Leetcode (75 easy / 145 medium / 20 hard) with an emphasis on understanding and being able to explain what I was doing.

For behavioral interviews, I just sketched up a quick list of experiences that I wanted to talk about and then committed those to memory. I think if you're a generally affable person, these aren't too hard. The hardest part is calming down your nerves during the interview.

**The applications**

Applied: 120

OAs: 13

Phone screens: 8

Final rounds: 6 (although I stopped interviewing after receiving the first offer)

Offers: 3 (unicorn, FAAMG / Big N, and another big tech company but not Big N)

**Analysis**

* It gets easier. I remember applying to 220+ internships my freshman year only to get ghosted by 98% of companies and then finally getting an offer in February, only to have it cancelled by COVID. Then I began the whole process again and got very lucky with a company willing to take a chance on me. This year, I had a much better response rate. I'm not sure if this is because I'm a sophomore now or because I have experience now (or both). I suspect it will be even easier next year.
* There's definitely diminishing returns as far as Leetcode goes. I think you learn the most with your first \~100 problems, get a better feel for things over the next 50-100, and then anything beyond that doesn't seem to help as much (at at least for internships).
* There is a high degree of luck/randomness in the process. I got final interviews with Big N companies and unicorns but resume rejected/ghosted by some non-tech companies. I had a final interview that I thought went really well but was rejected from the next day. I had a final interview that I thought I bombed and yet received an offer the next week.

**Advice**

* Everyone has different priorities and circumstances. There's definitely people that care more or less about getting the ""best"" possible internship for next year, and there's no right or wrong answer there. However, if this is something that's really important to you, here's some tips:
* Apply early and often. There's a lot of randomness, but the best thing you can do is maximize your chances by applying to many places. You just need one company to take a chance on you with a phone interview.
* Prepare early. Before school starts if possible, so that you can focus on school and doing the actual interviews during the fall. This will put you in the best position to succeed when a company does give you a chance.
* Keep your head up. There's a lot of things you can't control, so focus on the things you can control.
* It's okay to ask for a tip or say you're stuck during an interview. Usually the interviewer is on your side and wants to help you succeed. Also, they may value the honesty and collaboration.

Hope this helps and good luck everyone! Let me know if you have any questions. You guys have got this."

jx9ifr,1,2020-11-19,Which job should I accept?,rickytheranaldo,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/jx9ifr/which_job_should_i_accept/,"Need help ASAP- One and a half offers

Hi!

I’m graduating in December, so I’ve been applying to jobs like crazy and I have a couple different prospects and I was hoping for some different perspectives on what I should do. I need to decide if I accept offer 1 in 7 hours from nowX 

Offer 1: An internship for a government regional planning agency. I would be in charge of re writing and updating a general plan for a small town. The position lasts about six months and is part time. 
Pros:
I wouldn’t have to move yet. I’d be close to my friends and boyfriend (we’ve been together 1.5 years). I’d like the work. It’s a good experience for what I want to do ( city planner). I liked the team and supervisor. I would feel like I’m making a greater contribution to society. 
Cons:
It’s $13.50 (less than I make now). I would need to get another part time position. It’s only 6 months, but there will be different options 6 months from now (so I’d get a better paying job in 6 months)

Offer 2: this company hasn’t made a formal offer yet but said they would. I would be an assistant project manager for a developing firm. 
Pros: pays $18-$20. Full time and benefits. Good experience and a career starter. Liked the company culture (but a little less than offer 1). Close to my family. 
Cons: the company only builds luxury home amd apartments (don’t we have enough of that). I’d have to move an hour away or commute really far everyday (BF and I were planning on moving in together at new year but he still has 2 years at our university, longish distance). It’s not a certain offer so I’d potentially have to find another job and end up with one I don’t like. 


Basically they would both be great opportunities for my career and I would like them both. What are your thoughts?"

I'm not qualified for most software engineering gigs, so I was wondering if there are specific types of MechE jobs that generally involve project-based coding work.

But my question still stands)

I’ve been really upset lately by both the stress of school and my own self doubt—I feel like I’m not learning the material fast enough, not doing all the studying on top of the assignments, and I feel like a lot of my hobbies (art, writing, etc) are a million times more enjoyable. Like, sometimes I will find joy in solving an engineering problem, but I’m so tired at this point.

It doesn’t help that all my professors over zoom sound like the adults in the peanuts cartoon that just go “wah wah wah wah wah” (I wish I could use like a filter or whatever to remove all the static!!!!) and its so hard to listen to lecture and I find myself on my phone more often than I find myself paying attention. In office hours I’ll ask a question and the prof will say something along the lines of “this was in lecture” and I’ll feel so bad because that totally went over my head.

And between being all online and having a class of only like EE and CE 30 combined, I feel so alone. most of my classmates just blend together, so I only know like 3 or 4 of them well enough to ask for help. (One being my absolute life line and study buddy).

And I wish everything I needed to know wasn’t spread out over hours of recorded zoom lectures. I wish I could just read a textbook or go through a module and it have all the information I need. All in one place.

I am in a pretty good spot though. I’m a junior, I have had an summer internship these past two summers at a lab, but mostly doing stuff in Microsoft office and not really design or lab work—soft skill sort of stuff.  Like, a thousand emails.

I’ve had scholarships (ones that are for engineering) and good grades; so, I am doing all I can do right. I’m just concerned that I am on the wrong train, and all that keeps me on it are external pressures. 

Like, I don’t really feel like an engineer at heart, but that might just be because I don’t fit the stereotypes I see at a glance. And maybe I don’t know what’s it is like. And maybe it’s not all that important to make electrical engineering such a crucial part of my identity—it’s just one part of the whole.

Tbh, if I were to tell myself where to go major wise when I started freshman year, I would recommend comp sci with a possible concentration in art, or applied mathematics. I kind of chose EE arbitrarily because I wasn’t sure what to do. Then I stuck with it.

My current plan though is to go into power engineering.

I feel like relatively, I am doing very well. But I’m so tired all the time... 

Ultimately, classes are really rough right now, and I would love some reassurance or advice pertaining to what my career in electrical engineering will be like compared to it.

Also, bonus: how many hours per week did you spend in total on class time, schoolwork, clubs, and part time jobs? I’m keeping track of it in excel, like a time card, and I’m getting around an average of 45 hours, but with a range from 25+ to 60+ hours (this does include organizational stuff like registration and checking emails or filling out a planner, and like, part time job is like 5 hours at most but more like 2-3 hours)

Edit: thank you all so much. Thank you for your understanding. Thank you for your advice and experiences. Thank you 😊"

I also have final interviews coming up with Okta and Amazon both of which I would pick over these two, but I have to make a decision soon and am willing to renege. If internships are not remote, Walmart would be in Sunnyvale and Expedia in Seattle. I prefer Sunnyvale, but location is more of a tiebreaker and not a primary concern. I could be wrong, but I don't think either one is significantly more prestigious than the other. Expedia is more of a tech company, but also has way less stability due to COVID. Which one would you guys pick?

I also recently passed the CISSP exam and going through the endorsement process. 

I’m moving across the country (if restrictions are lifted) to pursue an internship at Tesla starting January, which admittedly is a risky career move. However, since my analyst role is less technical than I’d prefer, this internship is more suitable for my career path.

That said, where can I find more cybersecurity internships? Do they usually open closer to the summer? Since an extension isn’t guaranteed, I’d like to ensure that I have a backup plan in place. I’m specifically looking for jobs in the Bay Area, though branching out a bit and also looking for jobs around my current location.

I’ve applied to 4 internship roles per day on average since I signed the offer letter, but I can’t seem to find much more. Software engineer intern/new grad roles seem to abundant (which isn’t surprising). Because I have almost a year’s worth of experience in information security plus the internship, should I just wait til I’m nearing the end of the internship and just apply to full-time roles then, assuming I don’t get a return offer or do they not open til early 2021? I’m only attending school part-time so 40 hrs/week isn’t a problem.

I gotta say, I have not had the best experience with the startup culture, just seems like my luck. 

1. Free Labor Internship: I have internet at a small startup where the development team was the brains behind most of the platform. The manager/founder has vague in stating what he wanted. When he was washed by his colleague for more details about the how’s, what’s, and why’s about the platform, he couldn’t answer any of the questions. All of us had to design, build, and explain the validation behind why we even wanted this platform to exist. 

2. Lack of Respect: I really love how a lot of startups have a really chill and relaxed culture, but sometimes I think that this goes too far. At another internship, I was told to create and present a feature for one of their more important products, but while I was presenting to the CEO and my manager, they began drinking beer and began to “get comfortable with each other”. My manager has a boyfriend and the CEO is married. This has happened on more than one occasion.

3. Stereotyping and Stigma: (Note: I’m a female coder, and I’m usually not the type to use the “diversity card” in my favor since I want to be notified for my talents rather than my knowledge. I also know that I don’t know everything). I intervened at another startup with two other guys, who were both in their first year of studying CS, and I was in my first year as well. One of the guys can easily be stereotyped as a “good tech guy” because of his race and ethnicity, and he acted like one too. However, this guy was not as skilled as he claimed to be. He didn’t know how to use the basics of GitHub, certain frameworks, and such. Personally, I have no problem with someone who doesn’t know how certain things work because I have been in their shoes too, but he insisted that he knows how to do everything when he didn’t and deleted all of our progress on that project. I talked with the other developer guy, and he was understanding of these issues, so we decided to talk to our manager. “He’s from ___, so he knows a lot about computers and programming, just be patient.” And patient we were, but he kept on messing up the project.

Saw some other people post, and decided to share some results as well. This is my first recruiting season where I went all out, so I don't really have a good frame of reference as to how covid affected everything.

About me:

* Junior, male, top 5 CS school
* 1 prior internship, 1 personal project (but I put slightly expanded upon school projects on resume), no research/clubs

Results (diagram [https://imgur.com/a/ImZzCBB](https://imgur.com/a/ImZzCBB)):

* Started applying mid-August. Most phone interviews in late Sept-early Oct. Final round hell week in mid-late Oct. Signed last week :)
* 61 applications (mix of big N, financial firms, unicorn/startups). I had a return offer so I could afford to not apply to too many places.
* 22 coding challenges, 11 phone screens, 10 final rounds, 3 offers
* I skipped around 3 final rounds and 2 phone screens after I got the first offer

Some reflections:

* I'm a big clout-chaser. I'm happy with my offers and am lucky to have them, but part of me wishes I had done better. (I got big N, but not the ""s tier"" companies so to speak). I was so close to some of the places I really wanted to work at, but got rejected at the final round. Yes, I know this is shallow. I also tell myself that I have a whole career to get where I want, but I can't help but want it straight out of college too.
* None of my referrals helped: I got insta-rejected by G/F and still getting ghosted by the rest. These were my top 2 choices, since I really really want to go to NYC post-grad, and G/F are two of the larger tech employers in the city, but without interning with them, it's near impossible to get placed there as a new grad. I had applied to a couple of NYC positions, but got rejected after final rounds.
* I was pretty lousy with my first phone interviews, but I started practicing a couple hr of LC for the half-week leading up to them, and started getting pretty high pass rates (\~70%). But for final rounds, my offer rate was just less than 50% (could have done better, didn't feel like I failed any of them, but competition is tough at that stage)
* I stacked all but one of my final rounds across 2 weeks. I made sure to schedule the ones I didn't care for first as practice, in preparation for my important ones, which I always scheduled for thurs/fri. At night between interviews, I would do a couple hours LC. This was pretty good practice, but it doesn't work for everyone.
* I was at home this semester, so I was hyper-focused on school + recruiting. I don't think I would have done it differently because it seemed to work out, but I still had mad fomo. Next semester I'm not worry about professional stuff and going to hang out with friends instead
* Overall, not a bad recruiting season. I'm happy, but not satisfied, but that's for next fall. In the mean time, I'm going to relax"

I'm a CS Student currently in my junior year and will be graduating in 2021. I currently have zero experience in the field. I have a GPA of 3.95 which I believe won't become a factor rather than just glamorizing my resume!

I have always been revolving around tutorial hell! I have never had a project done complete. I learnt Python, Java and took classes in CS Architecture, System design and big data. I recently signed up for codecademy to learn full stack. I have few projects in mind, which are very basic not 'WOW' kind.

When applying for intern, I am only used to getting rejection emails maybe because of not having experience.

I'm genuinely looking for a career advice. I go to a normal (not so fancy) and cheap university in DE. And I want to break into tech! I recently got into a mentorship program from JPMorgan but that focuses around data analyst/data science.

Plus I work at a pizza shop to sustain myself and pay for my education (60 hrs a week) and have problem managing time. Most of my learnings are on my off days and late nights!

But I've recently found out I like coding a lot.,AndersonKalista,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jxgkcm/i_have_a_bachelor_in_natural_sciences_and_im/,"There is a program where you learn programming (java; javascript) on a intensive 3 months program. It's free but in return, you have to be available for them if they give you a job offer as Junior Stack Developer. It's basically a bootcamp that it's funded by the government to graduate and form Junior Developers. These programmers then proceed to get selected and offered a job contract at a company.  

I would very much would like to join it but I'm also thinking about taking a Masters (NATURE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION). It's starts on September and I need some money to pay for university fees.  

I would like to learn coding but I have to work this year (I have a internship with decent salary available) to afford taking a masters on the next lective year.  

My biggest advice and probably the best was: ""I think you should take the masters now, so your study rhythm doesn't affect you. You can take online coding classes and get a certfication online. You can do it as part-time"".  

I think my question is: Is the Masters worth it and should I just drop it all and go for Coding and join the bootcamp... I have a friend there right now and a graduated friend who is working for about 2 years.  

**Also**, is it possible in real life to mix Coding/Programming and my Degree IRL?"
jxhfu9,0,2020-11-19,Degrees and Certifications in IT. Which is better?,Sky576,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jxhfu9/degrees_and_certifications_in_it_which_is_better/,"I am currently slowly making my way through a CSIT associate degree at my community college which I am almost done with the second term and plan on going into cyber security after completing it. Over time I've started to question whether or not I should continue as I've fallen a bit behind and should be on my first term of the second year. I've talked to some friends and family who are in IT, and some have suggested doing certification programs and finding a job after that.

About a month ago I started the CompTIA A+ cert program and have been focusing on that lately, and have taken a term off. After working on the program, I started to question whether or not a degree is worth the time and money, so the past week I've been talking to those same people and some others and some of my own research as well.

From what I've been told and have researched, there's pros and cons to both if going for 1. Ideally it would be best to do both, which isn't too out of the question for me but at the point I am now, I'm more interested in actuality learning what I need to know rather than general classes which I understand is part of getting a degree and all that. If I do go with the certification route, I do still plan on going back and finishing the degree. However, if I'm able to get a job after completing some certifications I can at least have some of that experience and really be able to focus on the more general classes as I continue.

In terms of jobs, having either doesn't necessarily guarantee a job as majority of the time you need experience as well as a degree and/or certification. I also know that a lot of work to actually getting a job is through networking and have talked to my dad and a few others I know about potentially asking around for some internships or part time work after completing either. Obviously having either one shows different things and gets to different places after completing. I've read a lot about how getting a certification is potentially more valuable in the short term as it's an easier way to get into entry level jobs due to the more hands on and being updated to the changing times. But I've also heard the opposite and the same for a degree. 

I get that it's not exactly a straightforward answer and all, but I'd like to get some more thoughts from people actually in the field/working towards getting in and possibly getting some new information that might help me out.


Edit: The program is for System Administration and Network Security"

I'm confident that I do have some kind of mental illness due to the frequency and intensity of my emotional breakdowns. 

I didn't have any problems at least in the past year, but this semester, I had too much shit going on with every aspect of my life, and it overwhelmed me. I had to drop 3 courses and even still it's a bit hard to manage.

I haven't gone and diagnose myself yet, because I'm dumb and think that if I don't get diagnosed I don't mental illness ;(

My question is: 

I have internships aligned for next summer, if I do get diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder now, will it affect my ability to intern? For FAANG companies specifically. It was a return offer, I didn't expect my mental health to crash so badly this semester. 

Another question is, if I happen to delay my graduation by a semester or two, how will this affect the return offer for full time? (I have 3 semesters left). 

Too afraid to ask the recruiter right now so I thought that I would ask on here, any advice would be appreciated! 

Thanks a lot!"

I realised that I've become really insecure and over-anxious. I know that I shouldn't worry about how I did in the papers since it would just affect my mood for the remaining papers, so my brain just conveniently decided to pick another topic to stress about smh

At my school's urging, I applied for quite a few internships, which said they'll contact shortlisted applicants from Nov onwards. I haven't heard from any of them and my stupid brain is going all ""Omg why is there no news? Did you fill in the wrong email? Did you screw up the application write-up? Your prelim grades weren't good enough, so you're being passed up"" &amp; so on. Initially I wasn't even intending to apply for an internship, but my school kept reinforcing that we should make productive use of our time and attend internships, or attend online courses to boost our portfolio &amp; give us an advantage in uni applications. That made me feel bad about wanting to slack off after As, since it sounds like everyone's going to accomplish so much and you'll be losing out etc. Heck, I'm so tired and burnt out from studying and worrying about grades. I was looking forward to doing absolutely nothing and just relaxing after As but now I can't even enjoy that because once I flop on my bed, a voice will whisper in my ear, ""you're losing out""

I never thought I was a competitive person, but now I feel the intense pressure to achieve, to be busy and to not lose out to others. I know that comparison is the thief of joy, but I still fall into the trap of pitting myself against others and being too aware of what other ppl are doing, how they are surging past and surpassing me. I hate how I need to depend on external validation and being 'useful' to feel good about myself. I hate how that voice keeps taunting me, ""you can't slow down, you're not good enough, you have to keep up or you'll really never be good enough"". I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but even though As are ending soon, I don't think I can ever escape that endless cycle of anxiety and insecurity."

Without going into to too many details this is the bones of the case:
I left the country leaving some belongings
Landlord rented the room,
Tenant left, and he started charging me without my knowledge or consent. 5 months goes by, he doesn't say a word. Then he drops an eviction notice claiming I owe 5 months back-rent.
I freak out, I had been living abroad for almost 11 months, they told me it was fine if I came back to live there when I returned before this, I'm an immigrant, no idea about the laws, then I start receive a threat from his son's girlfriend(living there, proof she's acting with his permission as an agent contacting me).
Threatening me with professional humiliation and approaching a man that had offered me an internship at a law office if I don't pay. Which I can hardly afford. 
I fly back, sleep and live out of my car in order to be able to afford to pay him, his son( my former roommate) accuses me of lying and deceitfulness publicly to all of my( our) friends, and i was essentially blackballed and the resulting financial upheaval led to 2 years homelessness, bankruptcy, and PTSD.

I reached out to both the landlord and his son about this issue several times, of course they didn't want to hear any of it, accused it of being all my fault and cut all communication.
Of course I had no other choice except to file suit, which I have.
They showed up, the judge invited us discuss and settle and present each other our evidence. I had a mountain of evidence... they had almost nothing.
They attempted to settle for a ridiculously low sum which I refused, we proceeded in front of the judge... who suggested mediation.
I said.... "" frankly I'd like to get this over with, but if they agree to mediation, then I'll agree to mediation. 


So now  its going to mediation which I have a loose understanding of.... these people ruined my life....
I don't know what or how I should ask for in mediation... where do I start? Do I ask for money, or an apology or.... I don't know i think whatever friendship i had with them has most likely run it's course...."

I haven't posted one of these before, but this is (probably) going to be my last internship, so I figure I may as well.

I'm a 3rd year CS major  with a decently high GPA at a top 5 Canadian university. I've had 3 previous internships, all at small Canadian companies, some TA experience, and one summer spent as a research assistant.

[Sankey Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/BgzqZvI.png)

I applied to two fintech companies (think Jane Street, HRT, Citadel, 2Sigma, Akuna, etc.) around the end of August. One of them rejected me within 24 hours ( D: ), but I ended up getting an offer from the other. I was originally going to do research again this summer, only applying to these two companies because I was curious about what their interviews were like. But the offer ended up being high enough that I'd be out of my mind turning it down, so I took it.

Additional info:

* I have gotten very lucky to be in the position I am. I'm not a CS genius by any stretch of the imagination, but I have been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time on numerous occasions. 
* My main two interests are math and competitive programming. IMO these do not correlate very well with software engineering skill but it does allow me to perform well on technical interviews. 
* I never did leetcode prior to this year, but I did a few of those practice interview problemsets on there prior to my final round. The problems were fun but not very helpful.
* I fully intend to go directly into grad school after finishing my undergrad, with the ultimate goal of becoming a professor. My interests do not align very well with what I will be doing this summer (I am mostly interested in theoretical computing science), but the money made will (hopefully) allow me to  get a PhD without accruing any debt. (Keep in mind university is much cheaper in Canada than in the US)."

jxvdm9,2,2020-11-20,Looking for advice choosing between two offers,Localsquatch32,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jxvdm9/looking_for_advice_choosing_between_two_offers/,"This is a bit of a ramble, but Im struggling with making a decision and appreciate any advice.

Just a little bit of background - I graduated with an environmental science degree last December and have not had much luck finding work and have moved back home with my parents to save money. I recently interviewed for a job as a utility forester with a utility consulting firm (they extended a job offer),  and also for an internship with a wetland conservation agency with a town.

Although the wetland internship doesn't pay very well and is only 2 days a week, it is only for six months and I know that I would enjoy it more and that it would also benefit me in the long run (connections, experience). It would be an easy choice however, living at my parents house has been pretty rough. I only have one friend here and he is out of town most of the time for work. It's hard to make new friends because of the pandemic and I have noticed a pretty severe decline in my mental health.

The utility job is not exactly what I want to be doing, however, it would still be relevant to what I am interested in and I would be gaining some skills and experiences that would benefit me down the road. I also might end up liking it more than I think. For this job I would be moving back to where I went to school where I still have many friends. One of my friends has a house there and has offered a great deal on rent if I end up moving there.

I feel like I am struggling because my values have started to shift over the last few months. Ive been questioning whether friendships are as important as I once thought and I'm worried that the isolation has made me feel this way. Im stressed out about making the ""wrong"" choice here and regretting it in the future.

So I guess the question I keep asking myself that I hope someone can help me with is do I take a less desirable full time job so that I can be around friends  (improving the quality of my life) or do I tough it out at home for six months (lower quality of life) so that I can potentially get a better job when it is over?"

Give me a second to explain my situation before I address the title.

&amp;#x200B;

I am from Sweden, living in England, and I want to go to College in USA. I want to major in computer science and I have some ECs relating to my field planned such as working with my mum who is a software tester, programming competitions, courses and lots and lots of reading. I want to fit some other extracurriculars in too that aren't too linked to my academics. I was thinking something like starting a sport, doing some local volunteering and joining a club perhaps, although club culture seems to be nothing like in US highschools sadly. They are limited to after school electives which are things like football, table tennis, extra maths and such. 

I am studying Physics, Maths, Computer Science and Electronics at A-Level (Advanced Level, considered more difficult that APs I believe) I believe these subjects compliment eachother very well. In Physics I am also the ""class leader"", which means I go to weekly meetings about improving the quality of teaching and I am meant to be available to students to ask questions. I thought that would give me some leadership points. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right. To the point.

Have I massively underestimated what it takes to get into a fairly respectable university? I am not talking ivies, UCLA or Duke either: I am interested in schools such as UNC Chapel Hill and Purdue University. Good universities from what I've heard but not elite at all. It seems every other post is about someone who has won statewide programming competitions, worked as an intern for 2 years and founded a tech startup with xyz in sales... 

Well. To the point. Does it seem like I have a fair chance at Colleges alike the ones I mentioned while the prodigies that flood this subreddit might be aiming a bit higher or have I misunderstood the requirements completely? 

Thank you in advance from a confused aspiring international student."

jxw6ti,1,2020-11-20,2 Offers: Which to pick?,cilantro-and-onions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jxw6ti/2_offers_which_to_pick/,"Hey all, first time poster with a bit of a dilemma. I'm a December 2019 CS graduate looking for his first (real) position. I've been open to most opportunities in tech as I'm not married to doing software development. I (after many many applications) now have two offers on the table and I'm not sure which I'd be wiser to take.

The first position is an entry level QA Engineer, making $29k. I am aware this is well below the standard for a CS position out of college, but I have no professional experience (only side projects/no internships), am trying to prioritize growth, my expenses are low, and the company culture seems great.  I'd be doing automation testing in C# which I don't know well but would be excited to learn, and I feel like I'd gain valuable professional coding experience. Biggest cons are that I am probably leaving the area in 7 months and I don't think I'll be able to work remotely so I'd have to quit in that amount of time, and obviously the pay.

Second position is SQL Conversion Dev making $65k. Obviously the pay is way way better, but I don't get as good of a feeling about the work I'd be doing or the culture. I'd be writing raw T-SQL in MSSQL server to redesign and migrate client company data (in various formats) into their new solution stack.  I like SQL, I like data, but I can't help but think doing this full time might burn me out. Luckily this position is fully remote so assuming I can keep up I wouldn't have to quit upon my move in 7 months. And obviously, the pay is so much better. My (perhaps irrational) fear is that this position might close the door to doing SWE down the line (or at least wouldn't help me get a SWE/D position).

Writing it out now, I'm leaning toward the SQL job. I don't like the idea of leaving my first tech job in 7 months and having to go through the entire job search process again. I also feel like the SQL job could lend itself to other career pathways (Data Analytics/Science) while still leaving the door to a SWE role open if I decide that's where I want to go.

Sorry for the long post, but what would you recommend?"

I have a few options on how I can spend the next 2 years and I'm really not sure how to proceed, and I also don't have many people in my life who have enough experience to give me solid advice, so any advice would really be appreciated! Anyways, here are my options:

**Option 1: Graduate a year early (May 2021) and go full time at the Bezos company**

I'm gonna be completely honest here, I'm not sure if this is even a viable option. I got a return intern offer (which I accepted), and I'm not sure if I would be allowed to turn that into a full time offer. I'm just putting it here just in case.

Pros

* More money
* Being a year ahead in my career
* I know the reputation of the company isn't great, but I actually really liked my team, they were nice people and the work was technically challenging

Cons

* Lose a year of college experience
* Might pass up the opportunity to apply to better companies for full time 2022?

**Option 2: Take an internship in spring and graduate in December 2021**

Pros

* Make some money in the spring (probably around $15k)
* Will get to start my career slightly earlier
* Get some extra time in college
* Opportunity to apply to different FT jobs

Cons

* The internship is at my school's research institute, I'm not sure if it will make a difference at all on my resume
* I'm not sure how interesting the work would be, but it's a job

**Option 3: Do an accelerated BS/MS program, graduate in 2022 with my master's in CS**

I'm most confused about the pros and cons of this option to be honest. I'm not sure how valuable an MSCS would be, especially in an accelerated program and from the same school as my BS.

Pros

* Masters degree will be on my resume for life
* Get to stay in college all 4 years
* Potential earnings increase?
* No tuition if I become a GTA
* Opportunity to do research

Cons

* Start my career later than any of the other options, high opportunity cost
* Not certain if a master's degree will give me any benefits (I go to GT if that shines any light on the issue, not sure how much value a masters would add when I already will have a BS from here)

If you took the time to read this, thanks a lot! As I said earlier, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

For reference, the online payment portal says :

""**ACH** \- Only payable in USD to a Bank Account with a valid ABA within the Continental United States of America

**DOMESTIC WIRE** \- Only payable in USD to a Bank Account with a valid ABA within the Continental United States of America

**INTERNATIONAL WIRE** – Payable in any currency to any Bank with an Active SWIFT Code in Countries other than the United States of America"".

Which account type should I select?

In addition, the payment portal requires that I fill out a ""transit and Bank Code (8 digits)"". Would I fill in my transit number, followed by my bank code? Or the other way around? (i.e. XXXXXYYY or YYYXXXXX if XXXXX was my transit number and YYY was my bank code)

So, long story short (or as short as I can make it): I finished high school, took a year off to prepare for the very competitive entry exams for public universities in my country (Brazil), and decided to pursue a dual major in English/Portuguese - Language and Literature. I took that chance to explore as much as I could within the fields my future degrees would offer me: translation, editing and a lot of teaching (regular and language schools).

I wasn't bad at what I did, intellectually speaking, but the problem is that my ADHD was undiagnosed at the time and my life started to fall apart without proper structure, treatment and tools to deal with it. I barely managed to pass my classes because I couldn't keep up with any work done outside of the class, and all of the working and internships I did at the time relied heavily on me being able to be very organized, which I couldn't be for the life of me. In comes depression, crippling anxiety and a plethora of health problems, until I eventually couldn't do it anymore and decided to drop out by the end of my 5th year (the work program lasts around that, if you don't do any internships, don't work, and are a VERY diligent student, but most people finished it around 6 years).

I moved back to live with my parents, started to treat myself with different doctors and get better. Needless to say, I was pretty lost when it came to what to do with my future.

Until I decided to do some classes as a bartender for fun, because food and beverages had always been a passion of mine and something clicked. So I decided to explore the field of gastronomy and hospitality, and managed to get a qualification as Commis Chef (lots of fun, baking and confection are my favorites, but I discovered I wouldn't want to work with it) and as a beer sommelier/Cicerone (which was one of the best experiences I've ever had - I'm not into drinking more than anyone else, but I am passionate about everything related to wine, beer and spirits, from sourcing the best ingredients to how to best present it to a costumer). 

I despise the idea of pursuing a major again simply because the academic format just doesn't work with me, and after ADHD was diagnosed, I had an explanation of why I blossomed in areas and courses that are a lot different structurally, and have been looking forward to pursuing higher education in a trade school.

Now, there's a small problem: the only trade here that have a bare minimum (and covers even less than what I have already studied in previous, specialized courses), is Gastronomy. There are nothing more specific than that, and if I wanted to work in an industrial setting as a brewer, I would need to be a food enginner.

My long-term goal (dream? Aim? I want to get there some day, have wanted to for a very long time, and I'm okay with putting plans on hold in order to get the best shot I can) is to immigrate to Europe - for many reasons that I won't get into detail here because this is already big and I type too much :p

So recently I bumped into Duale Ausbildung (please correct me if I'm using it in the wrong way), and that seemed like the perfect thing in the world!

I started searching and looking into as much info about it as I could, and while I did find out how things are working nowadays regarding non-EU citizens applying for it, I found very little in terms of people talking about foreigners that where able to be placed in a position that is not on the whitelist (which is the case for all 5 that I've looked into and have gotten really interested) or older people switching careers (it would be too much to ask for both at the same time, I'm aware).

Language wouldn't be (too much of) a problem. I'm a quick learner and I'm starting German classes in January, and I'll go as far as needed, be it B2 or C1. I'm aware of my learning style and German won't be first foreign language, so while it is a bit intimidating because you guys have sounds that I still have absolutely no idea on how to articulate, I'm eager to explore it!

Also, as a side question, does having ADHD affect my chances in any way? I'm unaware of what's the position of Germany regarding it, as my country doesn't view it as a disability at all and there's zero support/accommodation for it, so legally we don't even have to disclose the diagnosis to our employer. Is it different there?

I just opened up the homework problem that they gave me, and it says that they expect it should take 4-8 hours to complete.    


I recently completed a homework project for a different company after an initial phone interview.  It took me about 4 hours to complete, and I think I did a really good job.  I sent it to them and have not heard a word back.  I tried following up, and nothing.  I think this is very unethical behavior, to waste someone's time like this. 

I'm wondering what you guys think the norm is for interviewing, and how much time is acceptable to expect an applicant to spend?  I get it, the companies need to see that you can do the work that they are hiring you to do.  But is this much time necessary?   


I want to work for the company, but I'm still working full time (&gt; 40 hours/week) as a full-stack engineer, and I run 2 side businesses (not coding related) in the evenings and weekends, so I don't really have a full day to give to them to try to land this new position.

I've got some prior experience already, even as a high schooler, because of some unique opportunities that allowed me to intern for my school's IT department (unpaid unfortunately) and do the kinds of things they do, I even got to watch a UPS blow up once, not such a fun time but a good learning experience...

jy1xh3,7,2020-11-20,Advice for Applying to Grad School with a Low GPA (2.1),[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/jy1xh3/advice_for_applying_to_grad_school_with_a_low_gpa/,"Hello, I'm looking to apply for graduate school (MPP) in the next year or so, but I'm concerned my incredibly pathetic GPA will be a major hindrance. To plan properly, I wanted to ask what are some things that I can do to boost my incredibly slim chances.

**Here is some background about myself.**

\- I received a degree in Environmental Studies

\- Worked as a Research Assistant during my sophomore year of college

\- Worked as a Teaching Assistant during my senior year

\- Have Intern experience on Capitol Hill

\- Worked as a Policy Intern for a firm working on data and privacy policy

\- Worked as Campaign Fellow for a local official

\- Recently completed a Policy Associate Fellowship program

\- Have worked in the engineering field as

\- Served on a school committee

\- Was a member of SGA

&amp;#x200B;

**My flaws**

\- I was overly involved on campus

\- I became too involved in social life when I should have set a foundation for myself

\- I was immature and never seriously managed my time which led to me having laughable study habits

\-  My professors actually liked me and worked with me, and tried to give me many opportunities, but I stupidly squandered them because I failed to see their longterm plans for me.

I'm currently in the process of studying for the GRE so I can get the highest possible score I can, and I intend to reach out to professors from programs I'm interested in to talk about their research, my work, and what I can do to get into their programs.

I understand this will be difficult, and to be honest, I understand that you all might be tired of hearing from slackers like me. Still, I have always had a genuine interest in research in public policy and will fight to have the opportunity to learn more about my field at the highest possible level.

So if you can please provide me insight, information, or just all-around advice on how I should approach, that would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for your help!"

I am thinking about taking an extra semester due to Spring being online at my school (I can graduate in May 2021). I already applied to Amazon new grad position and now wondering whether I should apply for their internship application too. If I go through with taking another semester, having a summer internship will help a lot. However, if I can get a new grad position, it might be best for me to just graduate in time.

Will having both new grad and a new internship application make things weird for me with Amazon?

jy4vkj,1,2020-11-20,Dated a guy who just lovvvvedddd game streaming more than me,Shining_star369,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/jy4vkj/dated_a_guy_who_just_lovvvvedddd_game_streaming/,"So I (22f) dated a guy (25m) for two years, we met on a dating app and though i wasn't keen on being in a relationship when i joined it, when i met him i just connected now he was from different state and we still came into a relationship. It was all good in the starting, we talked everyday, messaged constantly and it was all nice. At first he was working in a company but due to pressure and some things he quit and went back home to focus on his further studies. It happened 10 months after we started our relationship, he worked in a different state than his parents house so he moved back in with them for the time being. Where we live, relationships are not something most parents approve of so he was talking took a certain schedule like at night 10 pm after only and it was not a big issue for me. Then came summer of 2019 when i shifted to his City for an internship specifically that city because of him sacrificing the time i could have spent with my parents as i was also studying in a different state than my parents. So during those 2 months he developed this habit of gaming on caffeine and twitch and i was happy for him as he has been unemployed since a long time and needed something to take his mind off negative thoughts, but i was also scared as he had this habit of making me the last thing on his mind when he is occupied with something, in my insecurity I took a promise from him that he won't give my time to someone else or in this case his game streaming. He promised me our time will be the same. But guess what it did change he started streaming at our time because of Audience being available at that time. We shifted our talking to 6pm but the thing is i was also busy with my assignments and everything as it was placement period and i also had my dissertation to complete. I was basically sleeping 3-4 hrs a night only and i talked to him about it and he said we'll figure something out but nothing happened, he forgot about it. I still made time for him at 6 because it was the only time we could facetime. He started make that time lesser and lesser 1hr to 5mins. In his full schedule of 24 hrs i got only 5 mins. And mind you he was not working at that time so all he did whole day was stream. I still let it go thinking things will change after sometime. They got worse i started asking him what the issue was, was i that unimportant for him did i even exist for him, why was he not making an effort, all he would reply baby it isn't like that and blah blah. I was frustrated. During this time whenever he was low because of things like not earning and being a burden to his parents i always tried to cheer him up he would ask me what should he do i would say he needs to work and do something he can't be like all day streaming, he wasn't earning from streaming and he would make it an issue that i have a problem with his streaming and tbh i did, if it made him happy i would've never said anything but it was giving him more stress the negative comments on his weight made him go workout for a larger time and exert himself he started turning his camera off while streaming.  It wasn't healthy. Now this continued to December we had our anniversary on 1st. Prior to this in august i had a fall out with my best friend and i was in a bad mental state which i tried not to effect him like by being extra cheerful always smiling. But oneday after a few comments from her i broke down and he was there for me for 10 minutes because his stream was starting, mind you when he had low episodes i bunked my classes so he had someone to talk to. I didn't mind that either i was hopelessly in love building a future in my mind that never existed. On 22 nd December night i told my parents about him they were hoping to meet him on 23rd morning he texted me he wanted to talk after gym which was weird as we never talked before 5-6pm. I said okay he can call me he said no texting is fine. He basically said he feels he hasn't been giving me the time i deserved because of his streaming and i thought finally he will give me time but he said we should take a break. I texted him for how much time he's been feeling like this he said a few months since august i was like wow and when i said anything about it he used to say stop nagging me. After that were all his reasons for taking a break the reasons we could have easily worked on found a way to solve. I saw red and asked him what does he want from me he said time off to think i got so angry that i said i am fed up with this behaviour and he can take all the time he wants as now I won't waste time on him as I'm never going to be a priority or important for him. Now it's been almost a year and i have healed emotionally after going through depression and anxiety because of him, my best friend and this lockdown and corona. He messaged me few days back to wish me on an occasion and we talked i got to know he stopped streaming because of studies and now he barely does that. Only thing since then in my mind is he made the decision for his studies but couldn't try to find one hour for me in a whole day. I'm not saying I'm more important than studies no career and studies are the uppermost priority but come on you claim to love someone and you also claim to know the problem but you don't want to find a solution. I freaking wasted 2 years on this guy. I'm just so stupid."

But nothing compares to a recent gig I had as a private eye. 

I was hired by an employee for a local crisis center to look into a possible illicit relationship between two managers. Basically he was sure more than dirty money was going on under the table, and he paid in advance so I figured what the hell why not. 

I’ve had to deal with bad bosses before but these two were literally the worst. I got a job with the first suspect, dude with a buzzed head named Jeffrey and it took less than fifteen minutes for him and his lover, a doctor from the nearby rehab; to start making out right in front of me. 

I was disgusted but in the back of my mind I was thinking just how easy this was going to be. I would have all the evidence I needed to shut them down by the end of the day I thought as Jeffrey showed me my desk. 

I was placed alongside another my client, Ryan something or other; and started to pretend to work. I pretended we didn’t know each other and it worked. 

I have to admit I had some admiration for what they were doing here at the crisis center. Saving lives. It reminded me of my old partner and how he often insisted we follow every lead to the bitter end. 

Those bad memories however made it difficult for me to focus and before I knew what to expect, my superior pulled me into his office to give me a good thrashing. 

“Do you believe that we pay you simply to sit around and stare blankly at a screen, Dale?” Mister Matthews asked. 

I made a dopey excuse, expecting him to give me a warning. Instead to my surprise he actually told me that I was going to have to be reassigned to procurement and work under two new managers until I straightened up my act. 

This threw a wrench into my plans to spy on Jeffrey and the doctor, but I didn’t lose sight of the goal. 

I decided to keep my head down and glean as much information as possible, and boy did I. 

Trent, that’s one of the new managers; was always a chatterbox at break. He would talk about all the latest gossip from the call center and tell me who was and wasn’t getting a promotion. 

Often Ryan’s name would come up. 

I didn’t really get to know the kid that well, but it seemed like a lot of the upper corporate staff respected his zeal for the job. 

I had no idea just what they were planning to do with him yet.

Instead I decided to focus on finding out more about the rehab program that Jeff’s lover was in charge of. 

“Sekhmet is a shady place bro, Doctor Fortuna is definitely a bad bitch.” 

At last I had a name to match that witchy smile. Doctor Fortuna. What were her and Jeffrey up to? 

The next day I was told that I would be helping with delivery to the rehab, so I rode shotgun with a counselor named Carl Locke and tried to get some information from him. 

“How long have you worked here?” I asked. 

It made me nervous that he was driving when he only had one good eye but he seemed to be handling the task quite well. 

“Long enough to be tired of the place like the rest of us. Have you been to the spa resort yet, Dale?” he asked casually. 

“No, been too busy,” I admitted. 

“Good. It’s just a trap to make you feel comfy and Cozy in this place. Besides which I think it’s gonna shut down soon,” he told me as we arrived at our destination. 

“Hey I would prefer comfy to this shit we put up with,” I joked as we entered the back part of the rehab. 

“You might say that, but truthfully that would be like taking your choice away. You would be blissfully controlled by them, and I’m not talking about a few days. I mean forever,” Locke said as he signed the release forms. The way he was talking to me was bizarre but something to me that he wasn’t lying. 

“That sounds… dangerous,” I admitted as we helped to unload the trucks, including our own. 

“Doesn’t it seem a little sketchy to you that we are the ONLY crisis center within a three hundred mile radius. Like they snuffed out any opposition? Well the truth is they did. And they want to expand that iron grip of control to every person that they can.” 

“That sounds shady as fuck,” I agreed wondering why he was telling me all fo this. Was it a test or did he truthfully think I was his ally? I just couldn’t risk wasting time to hope for that though. 

Short time later he got a call and was just rambling nonsense as we kept working. I didn’t understand one bit of what he was saying but I memorized every bit of it. 

Apparently someone that he was close to had traveled all the way from Egypt to see their father who was at the rehab to bring him something. Locke was talking about how two individuals from some plane had requested that it be given to Doctor Fortuna and that was when I paid especially close attention. 

“You’re certain that’s what Jack said? Yes I know they showed you what happened to your mom, I just don’t want any mistakes about this, gimme a sec,” Locke said. 

Then he paused and I swear to you it looked like he took out his eyeball. And no, it wasn’t a glass eye. This looked like he was moving the eyeball in between his fingers and mumbling. It was quite disturbing. 

Then I realized that while he was distracted I had the chance to tap the phones at the rehab. So I put down my boxes and went off to do that. 

I slipped into one of the security rooms and got to work, placing the listening device under one of the main speakers and then activating it remotely as I got back to the dock. Locke was already finished and gave me the stink eye. 

“Did you have to go to the restroom in the middle of our shift?” he growled irritably. 

I didn’t dare ask what the deal was with his eye and instead said we should get back to the call center. 

That night, I got the chance to listen to a conversation between Jeff and Doctor Fortuna. While I didn’t understand everything they said, I was starting to suspect this was more than just a routine case of cheating. 

“So this thing is written in the language of the angels damn it. What are we supposed to do with this shit?” Fortuna asked. 

“I’ve made arrangements with Mister Barkley to secure two of his assets for later this week. They will be in a seance which Tiamat will use to bring the angels back to our realm. Once they do, the language of the Record will be revealed and then we can finally ascend,” Jeff answered. 

“Then make it happen… and see to it Ryan is there,” the doctor said with a chuckle. 

Something about the way she talked told me that Ryan might be in trouble. I tried to call him, but couldn’t get an answer. It made me worried. 

What if they knew that he was on to them? 

But I had no idea just what they were planning to do. 

The next day, the manager that Fortuna mentioned had me handling a team meeting on the fourth floor. Apparently the board was meeting and I needed to keep some interns occupied while they discussed big business. And apparently according to chatty Trent, Ryan was going to be there too. 

My inner red flags were flying. I had to go be sure he was fine. So at the last minute I asked one of the interns to watch the slideshow without me and slipped toward the elevator. 
As I rode up I could feel my heart beating faster. Somehow, I knew something terrible was happening to him. 

Outside the sky seemed darker than usual. As if a storm was brewing but not any regular weather though. It was almost supernatural and it made me get a chill. 

What was I about to walk into? 

That chill suddenly transformed into some kind of heat wave as I rode the elevator further up. I loosened my tie and started to sweat. It felt like there was a sauna or some sort of volcanic activity going on. 

Then the door opened and I found myself engulfed in darkness. Given the strange light that was glowing over the call center a second before it was disorientating and I found myself not even able to see where I was going or what I was doing. 

I stumbled into a room right behind what looked like the board meeting. There were at least six of them sitting around a table. It looked like there was some kind of sigil that was on the table. It was made of pure glass and they were chanting. It wasn’t a language I understood but I knew this couldn’t possibly be a normal meeting. 

Then the head of the table spoke. 

“At last, the roots of Yggdrasil reveal themselves. We can become part of the tree once more, let the world be ours.” I realized it was Mister Matthews. He didn’t look the same though. His eyes were jade now and his skin as white as porcelain. And the others also seemed different. Not even Human any longer. 

Perhaps they were made of silver? Or some other fine jewels. The twin managers spoke next, gesturing toward the body in the center of the room. My heart dropped. It was Ryan. 

“Since we have no further need for the vessel, cast him back to Tartarus,” one said. 

“That won’t be happening I’m afraid,” Doctor Locke declared. 

Then he made a strange movement with his hand. And Ryan started to float. The others seemed shocked by this and I watched as they tried to stop the good doctor. Was he trying to hurt Ryan or help him though? I couldn’t be sure. 

“Stop him! We did not sacrifice Osiris and Tiamat for this!” Doctor Fortuna chanted. 

My heart felt like it might beat right out of its chest. I had to act now. There was some strange movement above Ryan. Like a portal opening. I made a split second decision and pulled out my concealed firearm. 

“Dale? No. You don’t understand,” Doctor Locke began. But I didn’t let him get any further. I shot him in his good eye and grabbed Ryan by the hand. 

The others tried to stop me as I ran out of the room, but suddenly Mordecai seemed to have command. 

“You fools! This is the exact design I hoped for!” 

The room shook and it felt like the entire building was about to collapse. 

And then it did. 

The earthquake caused Ryan and I to fall through the floor as I heard the strange board members scream and I grabbed ahold of him, saying one final prayer to hope that we made it. 

Somehow, we did. But we weren’t in the call center anymore. It was some garden of light. 

I swear to you I saw two angels standing there, guiding us. 

“You’ve done well Raguel. You can go back now,” the first said to me. 

For some reason I understood the name but didn’t know what I had done. Then I felt a power leave my body. And Ryan and I were outside the rubble of the crisis center. 

Emergency teams were responding as quickly as possible, and the sky was still a torrent of strange colors. I had no doubts now. The gods themselves were angry, and I could sense it. 

I took Ryan aside and got him patched up, trying to bring him back to life. 

Finally he gasped for air and I drew a sigh of relief. 

“Are you all right?” I asked, trying to get him to look at me. 

His eyes shot up and he looked around confused. He hardly looked the same as he had before, the strange cultish rituals altering his age and appearance. 

“I’m sorry, I can’t even explain what you just went through. But you’re safe now,” I told him. 

“Who… who are you?” he asked weakly as he tried to stand. 

“Get some air. It’s all right. It’s me, Dale Malevich, the private eye you hired,” I responded. 

He didn’t seem to understand. 

“Hired? What are you talking about?” 

Then he saw the destroyed call center. 

“What happened? Where is Brighter Futures?” 

I scratched my head. “What? No, I think you’re confused Ryan.” 

He gave me the look that made me question everything. 

“My name isn’t Ryan,” he muttered. 

“Of course it is. You hired me, don’t you remember. Enough of this nonsense.”

He pulled away from me and I felt confused and mortified. What *had* they done to him up there?

“I don’t know you,” he insisted. 

“All right. I’ll play along. Who do you say you are?” I asked. 

He composed himself, still looking at the destruction of the call center and responded, “My name is Danny… Danny Albright. I think I used to work here.”

“Thirty minutes ago your name was Ryan.” 

“I have no memory of that.” 

“Okay… what’s the last memory you do have?” I asked, still skeptical. 

What he said next floored me. 

“I… I think I was dead.” 

I thought of the angels. Had it been real. I shuddered. 

“What year is it?” he whispered. 

“2020…” I barely knew my own voice. He seemed paler than a ghost now. Maybe he was a ghost. 

“I’ve been dead for over 10 years…” 

I gulped down some air, realizing he was serious about all of this. I didn’t know what to make of it. But one final dreaded fact dawned on me. 

“Guess this means I’m not getting paid.”

[first post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jo4awb/i_feel_physically_sick_about_this_upcoming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

This is an update for the few who asked.

tl:dr at the bottom 

So I took a lot of your advice and prepped for a few days. Did research on the company, crafted responses for each part of my resume, I used STAR, watched a lot of videos etc...

I want to give a shout-out to u/mhr554 for sending me a DM with great advice. She’s a professor and sent me her lectures about speaking and interviewing anxiety. Her teaching style is very organized, thorough, and captivating. 

The day of:

While driving there I kept telling myself that I’m interviewing them to see if I wanted to work there. I reminded myself of the pros of getting the job AND the pros of getting rejected. 

It was a medium sized company and I was interviewed by 3 of their senior engineers. They were knowledgeable and the clearly had a passion for their work. I led the conversation sometimes and asked good questions (they spoke a lot lol). When I was done I had I feeling I got the position because the hiring manger gave me a tour before I left and told me things like “don’t worry” “you’ll hear back” etc...  it took HR a 8-9 days to get back to me. I thought I didn’t get it and they were just ignoring my emails (this happened frequently in my job search). Like hell, just tell me so I won’t stress over it. 

Anyway, I got an email and an offer. I was so happy. I want to learn a lot so I can land a full time position next year. The future is bright.

If you’ve read this far, I have one last question. This is a first for
me, how/when do you negotiate salary? The offer they sent me had the salary on the email and I said “I accept” is it too late to negotiate? I didn’t sign anything yet. I was thinking when I go in my first day to do some paper work that would be a good time to negotiate. The pay is lower than the average for interns. The pay isn’t a big deal to me (I live with parents) however, a little extra money during this pandemic doesn’t hurt. I just want experience for now. BUT they mentioned they like to get their interns to work as if they are full time hires (red flag?). Idk. I also have a degree and this is an internship. I want to push for more pay but I’m afraid they might rescind the offer.

I was thinking of saying something like this - “Hey, is there room to negotiate on the salary? I know it’s an internship but I do have a degree and I know this position will require the work of a full time employee.”

What do you think about this approach? What would you do?


Tl;dr got an offer! Thankful for the help I received from this sub. One more question, how do I negotiate salary properly?"
jylaj0,2,2020-11-21,SOS running stepper motor in 0.5 degree steps,LoomZoomBroom,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jylaj0/sos_running_stepper_motor_in_05_degree_steps/,"Hi all,

I just realized I'm in big trouble. Working on my graduation internship and I only have 1.5 month left until it needs to be finished. However today i realized i messed up my choice of motor for the application.

The application is a 450 mm long arm which rotates in steps of 0.5 degrees from 0 to 90 degrees. (Directly coupled to stepper motor by using a shaft). The arm takes a step of 0.5 degrees, then stops for a few seconds and goed to the next 0.5 degrees. 

All this time, I thought it was possible by using microstepping, but today I realized the torque decreases when using microstepping. I don't think i can use geared stepper motors, as they have backlash and my application is a measuring setup which needs to be reliable and accurate.

So basically, one of you genius engineers has to help me find a way to rotate a stepper motor in 0.5 degree steps accurately

Id highlyyy appreciate your help!"

So I joined this sub not too long ago. Often times I see people mentioning so many intelligent things they do, make, etc. I'm not too exposed and I'll be leaving for college hopefully next year. My question is, how do you know these things? What resources do you have that give you access to these things? I'm talking in respect of internships, research, building programs/coding, running a business, starting a nonprofit, writing a book etc. How do you get the initiative/inspiration to carry out these activities? How do you balance all these activities plus school work and possibly family responsibilities. I'll appreciate detailed answers because I want to maximise my college experience and resources. Thank you."

jypcbo,32,2020-11-21,[Junior College] TJC Temasek JC,cheapfoolscap,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jypcbo/junior_college_tjc_temasek_jc/,"hello! i was scrolling through reddit and i saw multiple questions/concerns regarding TJC! here's my personal input, and of course it does not generalise the entire cohort so just use it as a reference!

bg: i am a j1 this year and i entered tjc through jae. 

[EDIT: tj will moving to tampines jc campus in 2022 iinw]

WHY TJ:

1. hawker center opposite. yes, you may have heard from other tjcians that they rarely eat canteen food. i find the canteen food quite okay? not like they're really really good, but they're not that bad too. anyway, most students just go opposite because you have a lot of options to choose from, and many people go there for mala too! you can even go there with your friends after pdp (cca) ends, but in groups of 5 of course (due to covid). if not most people just dabao them back and eat together in school.

2. cafe. there's a cafe in tj, and it's called good news cafe (gnc). many people gather there because of the environment i guess? but the aunties there are really nice and friendly! also if i'm not wrong, if you do well in exams, you will be offered gnc vouchers. so people just go there and buy drinks, pastries, snacks, sandwiches etc. during our pw intensive this year, the pw department gave us weekly gnc vouchers tagged with encouraging quotes. so everyone was offered one voucher per week, and we would go there to exchange for food and drinks. small things like these really mean a lot!

3. air con. some of my friends from other jcs said they do not have air con in most classrooms? but not the case in tjc. the j1s every year will be having most of their lessons in the container block, and ngl it can be super cold sometimes because there are 3 air cons in very small rooms. so if they on all of them and you happen to sit right under the air con then god bless you. of course, because of covid, they do not on the air con everyday. but i heard from my seniors that they do on them regularly during pre-covid times. 

4. events and opportunities. i didn’t actually expect tjc to have SO many events/opportunities for all students. so many career-related events to guide everyone in the post tertiary edu HAHA. then there will be opportunities such as chemistry olympiad, australian math competition and many more. besides, there are also events such as DEFY, TOOP, cheer and TIP (temasek internship programme). if you are in the talent development programme, you will be exposed to even more opportunities! 

5. tutors. once again, this does not represent the whole cohort because every class has different tutors! but personally, all my tutors are extremely nice and patient 😭🤎 and they're all so so so willing to go the extra mile to help you. extra classes and consultations are mostly available, so don't be afraid to seek help! 

6. friends. people here are nice and friendly. i was afraid of the ip-jae gap (like most secondary 4s have) but i don’t really see it here. i mean, ip kids know more people but just befriend everyone and go in with an open heart 😌 i'm sure many ip kids are willing to make friends with you! :-) 

7. large/wide campus. tj is an old school, so we do not have very tall classroom blocks (except admin?) unlike other schools where most, if not all blocks are 4-5 stories high. so we have a wider campus, and it can be really confusing especially when you first enter tj.

8. library. our library is relatively big, with level 1, 1.5 and level 2. you can even look out and enjoy the ""scenery"" while u study so that u can rest your eyes.

feel free to check out @thisistemasek and @temasekjc on instagram to know more!

however, there are some concerns:

1. competition? inserted a question mark here because it does not apply to everyone. people in my class are quite chill and not very competitive, but i have heard of relatively competitive classes (especially the smarter classes) there are some scholars here in tj, and of course they would perform so much better than average students. but you know your own standards, and you don't have to compare yourselves with them! anyway, like i said, just go in with an open mind, and you can even learn from smarter students, i'm sure they're all willing to help. [EDIT: also because tjc is an ip school, some jae kids will feel ""less smart"" but pls try not to have this mindset hahaha just do your best and and work hard together with your friends! some jae kids are really smart too]

2. strict attire&amp;attendance? yea, MC over parents letters! attire wise, just follow the school rules tbh. actually it's not like teachers are SUPER strict with it based on my personal exp? just wear your attire properly hahahaha but again other people might have encountered stricter teachers.

3. old facilities. i mean, what can you expect from such an old school hahaha tjc is really old, and i'm sure many of your parents know of tjc because it already existed when they were younger. but don't worry, tj is gonna move to another campus in a few years time!

4. pests? i was quite shookt because it didn't come across as a concern for me. but don’t worry, i don’t think it will be such a huge problem!

5. 7.30am classes? most students have morning lessons, which start at 7.30am. however, if you're lucky enough to be placed in a class where all/most students have the exact same combi, you will have less morning lessons and your timetables will be ""neater"". classes where the combi kind of differs will start quite early at 7.30am on most days, and end later. this is because some students will have breaks while the other students from the same class have their lessons. so ye it kind of depends on luck i guess. (edit: most peeps with 7.30am classes are those taking h1 chinese! but there are other subjects with 7.30am lessons too)

if u have any questions or inputs, just leave it down here so that more students will be well informed! :) i do enjoy my time in tjc. honestly, go in with an open heart, because each jc has their pros and cons, you can’t really escape from them unless you just enjoy the times while they last! 

sorry for such a long post 🤓"

The Tech manager there understands I have limited experience and gave me a problem statement to solve, and said that I'd be gauged on my learning ability (time to submit the solution is EOD Tuesday - IST). I'm feeling nervous and sincerely seek your advice and help to bag this role. 

The problem statement is as follows.

One method for identifying individuals who enter a plant is to have them carry identification markers. One such identification marker is an aruco marker.

* Implement a code to uniquely identify 10 different people (i.e. 10 different markers) through aruco codes printed on an A4 sheet. Take images from a height (someone else can have a stretched out hand while you of yourself carrying an aruco marker)
* Constraints:
   * Each aruco code cannot exceed 7cm x 7cm (A4 sheet is 21cm x 29.7cm for reference)
   * The identification should happen when the camera is at least 50cm away from the marker
   * Establish a maximum and minimum limit for this identification

I'm new to OpenCv and would like some direction to approach this problem. 

I've done some basic research on aruco markers, and this is what I've learned thus far.

* They're used for camera pose estimation
* Each marker is unique and has an ID 
* It's encoded with parity and data bits 

What I learned from the question is the printed aruco markers should be detected only from 50cms and I should have a maximum limit (for eg 75cm). I should decode the ID value from the markers and display the result if the markers are between the max and min limits.

Thanks in advance for all your help, and I'll be active to respond to any of your queries.

I’m 19F.

My teeth have not been in the greatest condition. When I was 2, my two front teeth were shoved into my gums by me falling into my grandma’s coffee table, ruining nerves in my gums. I was sickly as a child too. Then, when I was 7, my mother decided to put me in braces. The place was run by student interns and they didn’t clean my braces as they should. My parents never got on to me about brushing my teeth as a kid. And I was a kid, I hated hygiene. My fault honestly. My teeth were ruined. I had holes in my teeth at 11 and they didn’t get filled until I was 14 because my parents were neglectful with it. Those fillings fell out and I got them filled again when I was 16 again. They’re bad again at 19. I can’t afford to get them fixed and I’m looking at insurance now. I obviously hate my teeth to the point I don’t smile. Whenever I do smile, I just think about how people can see how bad my teeth are. 

I brush them twice/three times daily. I have a permanent retainer that prevents me from flossing on my bottom teeth. And my teeth are stained yellow and brown in some places, yet my gums and everything seem to be in great condition. I use mouthwash. 

I’m starting to have trouble enjoying eating anything without thinking about the sugar intake. I have to look at the sugar contents before eating or buying anything. If it has too much, even if I enjoy the food, I don’t drink or eat it. If I do drink or eat it, I’m always thinking about how the sugar is sticking to my teeth and I have to immediately brush them afterwards. If I can’t brush my teeth, I’m in a constant state of panicking about it. I’ve even went as far to just not eat anything to help with my teeth, or even just eating foods that contain no sugar whatsoever. This has obviously ended in weight loss but not enough to worry about or notice unless you’re me, obviously.

I know this is most likely for a therapist, and a dentist, but I figured I’d ask first. Thank you if you read this and reply."

I recently started working in the video game industry as a project coordinator (basically producer but really really junior). I have an engineering degree in aerospace in one of the best European school and I decided after three 6-months internships and a first job in consulting in the aerospace industry, I decided to quit my job (in February) and apply to jobs in the video games industry. I landed a job in a big studio in Europe, I like the job but it just feels like the video game industry is becoming more about business and making money than creativity and entertaining. I know I was naive.

So I am asking advices because I am constantly stressed and worried about my career and my future. I don’t know what I want to do after.

I thought I would continue on my job for at least a year and a half so I would have 2 years of experience and then speak with my managers about future evolutions.
Moreover, the best jobs and studios are not in the country I live, in general it’s Canada or the US and my gf of 7 years is clearly not willing to go live in Canada, which I would like to.. I think this is adding stress to my situation.

Also, I am taking courses on Game development, Game design, Arts and Programming to get into game producing later and to know better my industry.

Thank you in advance for your advices.

If you need any precision do not hesitate
Cheers"

My previous plan was to finish my engineering degree this year and study a CS masters next year, hence I applied for a summer internship. However, I have since found out that both interns and new grads go through the exact same interviewing process for this company and I'm now keen to switch over to the new grad programme, negating the need for the MSc.

Has anyone ever tried doing this before? I'm worried that it might harm my chances of an offer if I ask before my final interview. Would I be better off waiting to see if I get offered the internship before asking to change over? Or is this a bad idea and I shouldn't say anything?

Would very much appreciate any advice."
jyw60j,167,2020-11-22,What I've learned from re-applying to Ph.D. programs,yahtree,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/jyw60j/what_ive_learned_from_reapplying_to_phd_programs/,"About two weeks ago, I submitted my applications to 9 universities for Ph.D. study. The process this time felt like Deja-vu, considering that I had applied around this time last year.

This year has been a total train-wreck, most notably due to the rejections that I had received from my applications for the Fall 2020 term. It took a pretty big toll on me (I guess I'm a person who doesn't handle rejection well, but still working on that!), but fortunately I was encouraged to re-apply, given that my colleagues believe that I have potential to obtain a Ph.D.

*""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.""* Recalling this, I knew I had to do something different.

What not to do:

* Choose universities and professors solely based on name and prestige. While it sounds nice on paper, there's more to the expectations and demands that are required.
* Make the statement of purpose the personal statement. What I've learned is that the admissions committee doesn't care about your whole backstory, unless certain parts of it directly tie to the research impact you have made. Otherwise, it's all fluff and no substance.
* Choose 4 recommenders and realize halfway that some universities only allow 3 LOR's max. This became a pretty big problem and very negligent on my part, as I wrote in my SOP about my summer internship, yet didn't have that advisor send out a LOR to those universities.
* Writing the SOP two weeks before the deadline. This was a recipe for disaster, and while I made a huge jump from my first draft to my second draft, it was still pretty weak.
* Tailoring the SOP to only one school. I wrote my SOP to my dream school, but didn't take into account the various formatting requirements for other schools. I copy and pasted certain chunks, for instance, to get under a 500 word limit, but then the SOP became very incoherent.
* Applying the day before. I basically panicked and rushed everything and in the process, had made multiple errors and typos within the application that I could not submit. This reflects pretty badly on me, as it showed that I was not careful with how I filled out the application.

What I have done this time:

* Choose universities and professors that are ideal locations for living, and also have research that genuinely interests me. It's important that myself comes first, as I'll be dedicating my next 4-6 years in a Ph.D. program.
* I took a step further and emailed professors. While I only heard back from a handful, it was still very insightful to have a conversation with them and learn more about their expectations and their research. It's also a good idea to figure out if they're accepting students or not and have funding.
* Staying consistent with 3 recommenders. That way, there are no nuances between LORs and what's written in the SOP.
* Writing the SOP as an actual SOP. The best way to think about the SOP is as if it were a cover letter. The most common advice: **Show, don't tell.** Be succinct as possible. Also, try to get as much revisions as possible, and from people who have a clear idea of how SOPs should be written (such as your advisors and graduate students). I went through several drafts before I had a SOP that I was very content with and was also stronger.
* Tailoring the SOP to multiple schools. Fortunately, I compiled the SOP guidelines and formatting for every school and most followed the same format. This made it much easier to write a more general SOP and also tailor it appropriately to each individual school.
* Applying in advance. As I mentioned, I applied 3-4 weeks before the deadlines of my universities. Regardless of this helps with admissions or not, it's great to get this out of the way to reduce the anxiety of stress that you already endure from applications.

What's interesting from this, is that despite being more diligent and mature with the application process, I still have no idea of the outcomes. What I've learned is that admissions/rejections aren't in your control. The only thing you can really do is put out your best application. If you gave it your 100%, then there's nothing to regret. This was not the case last year, where I knew I didn't put out my best application, and believed that 0/9 acceptances could be a reality, and unfortunately, that came to fruition. This time, I can at least say I'm more realistic, but also optimistic of these results.

As people have said, all you need is one. Hope my advice helps."

 I will just give a brief about my past experiences: I'm 23 years old, I started my career at age 18 as a network engineer. So currently I have 4 years of experience as a network engineer and now I'm in a devops student position (intern position during my college). I have the following knowledge and certificates: CCNA , CCNA Security, CCNP R&amp;S, AWS cloud practitioner, VMware cert and LPI Linux essentials cert. 

Here is my knowledge up until now:

\- Networking (CCNP level).

\- Linux system administration (dealing with a lot of servers).

\- VMware

\- Docker

\- Ansible

\- Python

\- AWS (mainly just knowledge, not a lot of hands-on experience)

\- Network security (Check point firewalls)

I have started a degree in computer science and I don't really like it... a lot of math and I wanted to consult here if it is worth to continue with this. I thought about continue with my job as full time and learn for COMPTIA Linux+ (want to validate more my Linux skills). What you folks think ? should I quit the degree ? or continue with it ? what should I focus in order to make a devops career? 

Just to give a big picture, my job right now includes a lot of Linux system administration while administrating docker containers and also produce automation with python and ansible to the entire infrastructure. 

I'm not sure if my job has enough knowledge (I guess not enough) , or it isn't and I need to focus on a degree. My focus is becoming devops and not a software developer

Hope you can give me some tips and thanks to everyone on this forum"
jyyo0i,1,2020-11-22,ML career as a uni graduate,relickus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jyyo0i/ml_career_as_a_uni_graduate/,"Hi guys, I would like to know your opinions or advice on the following situation I currently find myself in. 

Im 27 yo, based in central Europe, I just graduated from one of the top universities in the country. I studied AI in a masters programme, it was quite tough, not many people finish it. I also struggled quite a lot, I'd say I was maybe slightly under average as a student. The knowledge we gained is somewhat broad but quite shallow. It is best described as the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" kind of knowledge in my opinion. It was very theoretical and I understand that but we rarely came across anything used in practice today. I took some elective classes for data manipulation and specialized in deep learning to counterweight that a little.

Anyway the studies were extremely time consuming, we had multiple difficult homeworks every week and I never really had time or energy to do a part-time job or even an internship, so as a result my CV is pretty boring as you might imagine. 

Im currently trying to find a junior-level job as ML/Data science engineer or anything related in local AI startups or SW companies, but was disappointed by the fact, that the employers dont seem to care that much about the degree. Apparently my lack of work experience is a huge disadvantage and the shallow theoretical knowledge is not helping. I  realized the school completely neglected modern technologies and principles which are used *literally everywhere* like Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms, CI/CD, DevOps, etc. 

Im 100% ready to learn whatever technologies/languages/whatever I am supposed to learn, but I really need to get hired in order to do it, since each company uses a different stack and I cant learn everything, but I am a little depressed by the fact that I spent 3 years struggling for a degree which is apparently not that valuable.  

Was someone in a similar situation? Or do you have any advice on how to proceed now?

I would also like to know your take on the following:

\- the ML/AI career is certainly attractive, but is it really worth the struggle for a person like me? I expect that it would take another years for me to gain experience and work on something interesting.  
\- I imagine the ML carreer is pretty tough mentally in a sense that one must really think hard the entire day is that correct?   
\- Do you know what a typical job for a person like me is in an AI startup or a larger company? I assume it is data cleaning and a routine stuff like that.  


Thanks for your advice, I will clarify anything if needed."

I am preparing my application for Fall 2021 and wanted to know what my chances of getting in were given I am an Electrical Engineering graduate. I moved to software development after graduation and have experience in full-stack web development for over 3 years now. I am planning to apply for the Computing Systems specialization.

To improve my profile, I am taking a few online courses, but I'm doubtful if I should complete a few more before applying, or apply in Spring. My background which relates to CS:  


* Bachelors in Electrical Engineering CGPA 7.63/10. Relevant coursework: Intro to Programming course in C, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Microprocessors, Digital Circuits &amp; Logic
* Internship at an IoT/Embedded Systems company (worked in C)
* Final year thesis project in a topic involving ML &amp; Electrical Engineering (in MATLAB).
* 3 years of experience as a full-stack web engineer (1 year Java, 2 years JS)
* MOOCs: Nand2Tetris, Stanford's Algorithms Specialization (ongoing), Intro to Math for CS (ongoing) (both expected to complete by January)

I have been reading posts about people from non-CS background getting in which has kept me hopeful. As an international applicant, accredited coursework is either difficult to find or really expensive, hence trying to accomplish online courses.

What is my chance of getting in? Should I spend some more time to complete a few other courses (OS, Java OOP) and apply in Spring rather than Fall, or if you have some other suggestions? I'm enjoying completing these courses and the entire learning process."

I’m currently looking into moving abroad hopefully sometime in the next 3 years, and I thought I’d come here for a bit of advice. 

I graduated last spring with a degree in computer science, and I’m currently working in Web Development in the Midwest. Part of the reason I pursued this degree was because it’s always been a goal of mine to move abroad, and tech seemed to open up a lot of opportunities for that. Sometime in the next few years I’d like to move overseas, and my top choices of places to go would be the UK, Norway, or Germany, however I’m open to other suggestions as well. 

I’ve been taking Norwegian classes for a couple years, and I would say that I’m currently at an A2 level with a goal to be at a B2 level in the next couple of years. I don’t have German experience, but I’ve been looking into German classes as well. I’ve visited both Oslo and Berlin, and loved them both, but I know visiting is much different than living somewhere. I did study abroad for 6 months in Manchester, and really enjoyed living there as well. 

Currently, my plan is to stay at my job here for another year/year and a half before I start applying overseas, which will give me 2 years of professional experience plus an additional 6 months from an internship I had during school. So I’m wondering, is this a reasonable timeline? Are there other things I should be doing outside of learning languages to help myself prepare? Would getting a masters degree help me significantly, or would I be okay without one?

I'm graduating in Spring 2021 with a BS in electrical engineering. I have been working at an aerospace company as an intern/co-op for what will be 2 years by the time I graduate, in their software and electrical engineering departments.

They recently offered me a full time job for after I graduate, with a salary in the range of 65-75k (I don't want to be too specific) in a L/M COL city. I have accepted the offer.

I got a 4.0 GPA for the first two years of college, at a community college, then transferred to a 4 year university where I'm finishing my degree. I have a 3.92 GPA across the past year and a half because I got a few A-'s. I would anticipate that my GPA will be somewhere between 3.8-3.9 by the time I graduate. The company for which I work/will be working is aware that my GPA is around a 3.9. They require a 3.0 minimum upon my graduation for me to start working there full time.

My mom, who knows about my offer, is telling me that I should go back to the head of the 4 year college and ask them if I can do extra work on past classes to move my grades from A- to A so I can graduate with a 4.0. Her reasoning is:

* a 4.0 is just better than any lower GPA. You will be seen as elite and as a stronger candidate if you have a 4.0 GPA. I had a 4.0 when I was first hired by this company as an intern and she says they might not have hired me if I didn't have a 4.0.
* I might want to go to grad school later and less than a 4.0 could hurt my chances of getting in.
* She says if she were an employer, and saw that I was so close to a 4.0 but didn't get it, she might think badly of me because I got so close to the highest grade but didn't do the little bit of extra work needed for it, so maybe I wouldn't do my highest effort on the job.
* Much fewer people get a 4.0 than a 3.8-3.99, so overall, it's just much better.

Could anyone who has worked in hiring or who has experience getting hired in the field tell me how valid her points are? Could graduating with a 3.8-3.9 hurt me down the road, vs. making up my work in a bunch of classes to raise A-'s to A's? I know you shouldn't neglect your GPA but it seems like it just needs to be high enough?

Thank you in advance!"

I know most people in this field, even experienced software engineers feel like they aren't good enough at times. And there's an overwhelming amount of things to learn too in this field and it's constantly evolving. You can't know everything. That's impossible. Also computer science can be f\*cking hard lol.

The whole ""rat race"" mentality is bad long term imo. And I struggle with this. I think it might the most common reason for stress. But one of the hardest to avoid. The approach of trying to working so hard for getting something external in the future: getting the industry position you want, getting an internship, getting good grades, money, etc. And these are good things....and hard work is great too...it's just the psychology behind all of this. It also ruins the fun/passion too.

And there's also 'not comparing yourself with others', 'you don't have to LOVE coding all the time', and just valuing self care."

And I'm panicking over the business line's pressure on me.

Hi, I'm a junior software engineer at a company in the financial tech/services industry. I've been at this company for a little over a year. This is my first corporate job out of college, no internship experience or anything. 

I just recently had my first big project that I was spearheading. I found myself doing everything, even business oriented tasks. So, to say that I was overwhelmed is an understatement. I found myself working late and on weekends more often than not for the past 2 months.

Due to privacy reasons, i can't really talk about the details of the project, but it was basically upgrading a hiring process between two cloud systems from a java program to a cloud connector process. So it is a fairly high visibility process.

The project was already rushed since it was held up a bit in development. But the business line insisted on committing to the release date. The testing only went on for two weeks. This testing was done manually and required a lot of cross role cooperation due to our testing processes. So we only ran about 8 full tests of the integration. Granted all of those tests passed except for a few small issues which were addressed and retested.

I did my due diligence in getting approvals from the business line and related managers, all approved with no issues and seemed satisfied with the testing done.

Now, after the go-live date, some issues are appearing. The issues don't seem to be related to my program, it seems like its related to how the data is being entered and transferred. Furthermore, these issues are minimal. Only 6 issues have arisen in the past 8 runs out of ~90 cases. However, the business line is blaming the new integration. These issues weren't caught in testing at all, so its the first time I'm seeing them as well. Whether it's because the testing was so sparse, or just blind luck that they didn't occur, i couldn't say, probably both. The business line and related managers are pressing me for why it wasn't found in testing, but I dont know what I dont know.

Now I'm dreading going back to work on Tuesday because I know it will be a barrage of emails from pissed off business people who haven't even acknowledged the fact that this integration blows the other one away in all aspects. Or the fact that it has resolved all of the issues of the old integration.

I suppose I'm just looking for how others handle this pressure from the business line when it may or may not be your fault. Or other perspectives that might assist me in handling this situation."

- Made a tutoring organization with my friend for summer tutoring via Zoom for kids struggling with academics due to COVID19. The hours we tutored kids was around 120. (11-12 grade)

- Internship at a software consulting company. (11-12 grade) [Software Development]

- Internship at a knowledge management solutions company (12 grade) [Natural Language Processing and AI]

- Taekwondo (9-10 grade)

- Business Professionals of America (11-12 grade)

- Distributive Education Clubs of America (11-12 grade)

**Essay:** I would give it a 7-8/10. Wrote about how learning improvisation on the guitar led me to become more of a creative and free thinker, rather than following everything to the dot, which is what I used to live my life like. Supplements were great as well, 8-9/10.

**LOR:** Probably good, one is from my AP chemistry teacher and I worked pretty hard in that class, 97/100 final grade. I talked with my counselor about the tutoring organization and she loved it and helped get kids sign up for it, so that's probably good too. Extra letter from my 11-12 grade intern manager, he likes me I get my work done on time so it’s going to be good.

**Schools:** Penn State, TAMU, UT Austin, UW, Virginia Tech(EA), UT Dallas(EA), University of Utah(EA).

Good luck to everyone applying this year."

jz8ziu,0,2020-11-22,Should I even bother applying to backend jobs?,aoakjsjd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jz8ziu/should_i_even_bother_applying_to_backend_jobs/,"I’ll be graduating next year and I’m a bit confused about what kind of jobs I should apply to. Although I technically got a “full stack” position for an internship, I mostly did front end work with a little bit of backend - mainly just editing APIs, adding endpoints I require for the front end functionality. Does this even count as backend experience? I’m good with Java, and decent with sql/databases (I can make queries but that’s about it). Idk if this is imposter syndrome or if I’m legit not qualified for backend/full stack positions... what should I do? Should I apply?"

Eldia left her nephew’s quarters with her ‘assistant’ in tow. She waited until they got back to their shared quarters and had shut the door before she spoke. “So, it looks like I am not the only woman who made up her mind about a man tonight.”

‘Vashna’ didn’t even bother to try to hide her hands as they blushed. She gave a sardonic smile and then spoke, “Yet, you told your nephew that you haven’t decided yet. Why would you hold that from him?”

“Oh, no you don’t. You aren’t going to dodge the subject by turning it back on me.”

Her ‘student’ shook her head and tried to give a severe look, but it came out with too much humor. “You seem awfully sure of your assumption that I have made up my mind about anything. Why is that I wonder? Could it be because **you** are trying to deflect?”

Eldia laughed, got them both a glass of water, sat herself down, and motioned for Vashna to join her. “Hardly. Ok, fine, I will go first: I didn’t tell Enibal because I didn’t want to get his hopes up, for one. The boy…  Ah, ha! Caught you! That micro-expression of defensiveness when I called him boy, and the fact that you were ready to come at me when I put that stroke across his face, and you want to sit there and tell me you don’t have my nephew in your crosshairs like a hunter on prey?

“And, yes, before you ask, getting your reaction was part of the reason I slapped him. Of course, I likely would have done it anyway. Enibal is one of my favorite people in this universe, has been since he was a boy. He can get a little ahead of himself, though, sometimes. He means well, he always does, but he can sometimes forge ahead faster than he should, and has to be pushed back on his heels a bit.

“So, back to my reasons: I don’t want him to get his hopes up and then have things fall through for some reason. I am not sure how well Henry and I might work. Hell, I’m not sure if either of us is relationship material at all. The other reason is the same one I slapped him for: he can get a little over-eager sometimes, in his personal life anyway, and he might become a little too ‘helpful’ if he finds out that his little stunt worked.

Vashna nodded and took a drink before she responded, “Ok, I can see that, and those things make sense. I have to admit that the man is frustrating me a little. I batted my eyes at him until I was afraid my eyelashes would fall off, but made no progress with him at all. In fact, I think it may have lost ground with him.

“Even more perplexing is that the only times he has shown real interest in me – as a woman – are when I start ‘acting my intelligence’, as mother likes to call it, which is what usually sends my suitors running for the hills… or at least gives them second thoughts badly enough that I can *see* them trying to decide if they are willing to put up with this ‘flaw’ in me.

“Most infuriating, however, is that the moment I see that interest spark in his eyes, something else comes in and smothers it, hard, and I can’t tell what it is or from where.”

Eldia tried to hold back a sly smile, without success, then tried to cover it up by taking a drink. She saw frustration flash in her charge’s eyes, however, and realized she’d failed in covering up anything. *With her training, and natural talent to boot, I should know better.*

“My dear, I do not mock you, though you are right in that I find a certain amusement at the situation: mostly because your upbringing and the kind of men you have been around have warped your perceptions in this one unique way that you are blind to what you are seeing.

“First, though, I will give you credit for not falling for any of the men who were intimidated by you, and for being unwilling to reduce yourself to appeal to that sort of man. I guess it helps that you have your uncle and his wives as examples; you know there are men out there of higher caliber than that. Come to think of it, you have your father as well, but that’s another story.

“Second off, I can tell you what is coming in and snuffing that interest that you see lighting up in him, but I warn you two things: First, it is going to make you mad – mostly because you are young and inexperienced and will not properly understand. Second – and this is most important – is that the very thing putting a damper on that spark is one of the things that you find so attractive about him, though you probably don’t realize it.”

Vashna quirked an eyebrow at her and tilted her chin down slightly in a look that was nothing short of a challenge. “Ok, if you insist. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

“The thing that is snuffing out his interest is his inherent nobility: he believes he is too old for you, and that to pursue the interest that you are displaying in him would be unethical.”

Vashna shot up out of her seat, fury in her eyes. “Oh, the little Ambassador thinks he is out of my league, does he?”

The girl drew a breath to start in on a proper rant, so Eldia spoke quickly into the pause. “See, I told you that you would get angry and fail to understand what I told you.”

Those words had the desired effect of drawing the girl up short, but also earned her an angry glare as the anger was re-directed, “So you are calling me young and stupid, then?”

“No, I am calling you inexperienced in dealing with men, and with dealing with your own feelings about certain things.”

“Oh, really… and this from the woman who just told me that his determination that he is so superior to me that he would tamp down feelings for me is something I find endearing about him? So you are suggesting that I want him because I can’t have him?”

She shook her head, and gave the girl her best disarming smile, “The last sentence you just said has some basis in reality, and is certainly a component of your attraction to him that you need to understand and come to terms with, but everything you said before that is a complete mangling of what I told you.”

“No, dear, stop. My turn to speak now.

“No, don’t you try to loom over me, girl, and don’t even *try* what is in your head now, or I will bundle you up and send you back to your mother so fast your head will spin. Don’t think I won’t, and don’t think I can’t.

“Good. Now, ready to listen? Good. I didn’t say he thinks he is out of your league, or even that he thinks he is better than you. I said he thinks he is too old for you. And, he is right. Or, he would be right, if not for the fact that you are – largely because of who you are and how you were raised – advanced far beyond your years.

“Something else you don’t understand about all those older men who kept trying to win your hand: they were also too old for you, and they didn’t understand what you are, and were trying to manipulate you into falling for them. It is a very, very unethical thing that some older men – and women – sometimes do with younger people.

“Enibal, though? He wouldn’t even consider it. He knows you are young – that you are a girl who is still of college age while he is a man who is old enough to have achieved great success in his career – and that acting on any attraction you may have for him would be taking advantage.

“And that, my dear, is why the very thing that is stopping your advances is one of the things most attractive to you: it is his nobility. He wouldn’t DREAM of taking advantage of a young intern who is so incredibly flattered by attention from *The Voice Of The Entire Bloody Empire* that she has become attracted to him.""

She’d watched the girl slowly shrink down under her torrent of words, but then a light of mischief came into her eyes at the end. “Oh, thinks I’m too young and innocent then? Hmmm. That has… delicious possibilities.”

*Oh, no. That just won’t do.* Eldia sat bolt upright and slapped her drink on the table with enough force to cause her student to twitch in surprise, “Oh, no you don’t girl. You will not toy with my nephew. He is a good man, and I will not have you hurt him.”

“Oh, don’t worry, I don’t intend to cause the man any *permanent* harm…”

“No, but you are not allowed to toy with him either! Don’t give me that rebellious look, girl! I am not saying that if you decide to pursue him you have to keep him  –  Sahna knows it would do the boy some good to have a girl who will treat him right and kick his legs out from under him for a bit, I know for a fact that it has been too long – I am saying that if you DO manage to make real headway with him, then you WILL make it very clear to him whether you are playing for fun or playing for keeps.

“Or else.

“I already told you: the boy is one of my favorite people in this world, and I will not have him toyed with.” Vashna stood there and raised an imperious eyebrow at her, with an expression that said she was considering trying to pull rank. She stood and matched the girl stare for stare. “I mean it, Young Lady, and not just because of the beating you will get from me if you do. And, don’t look at me like that: remember that your mother put you under my charge, and she *fully* explained to me what that means.

“Furthermore, if you won’t listen to me, you will listen to her: She said to tell you that you are \*not\* allowed to break one of the Empire’s best tools for your amusement, and you know damned good and well how important he is and will be. Do you understand?”

Vashna’s chin had risen slowly at the invocation of her mother, and it remained a little too high in the air as she nodded.

She rolled her eyes at the girl. “Say it with me.” They intoned, together, “Service to the Diadem. First, Foremost, and Always.”

Vashna then began to laugh, and Eldia felt her blood boil for a moment, “You were toying with *me* this entire time, weren’t you!?”

The girl nodded and she felt real fury build in her, then the girl burst out laughing, shook her head, held up her hands, and spoke, “No, I wasn’t toying with you the whole time, just for that last little bit. Most of that was me trying to buy myself time to process everything you just threw at me… and I will admit I wasn’t as mature about it as maybe I should have been, but you have to admit you threw a lot at me at once!”

She felt the fire in her throat die and began to laugh a bit herself. “Ok, you got me. Guess we both pushed a little too hard tonight.” She gave the girl a sharp look, “I still want your solemn promise…”

Vashna waved her hand and cut her off, “You have it. Whatever I decide to do with your beloved nephew, I promise not to mistreat him… However, it appears that – if I am going to do anything with him at all – I am going to need some help.

“For that matter, I think if you are going to catch the particular rabbit you are chasing, you could use some help as well.”

The two of them looked at one another and matching, sly grins slowly spread across their faces.

Intended major: Computer Science 

SAT: I am scheduled to give SAT in December. In 3 official practice tests that I have given, I scored 1400, 1420 and 1520. So I think I would at least get a score of 1450 in SAT. 

Sat II: Maths level 2-790

high school grades: 
My school doesn't rank or have a gpa. Only final exam scores are used to calculate percentage. 

9th: 73%

10th: 92%

11th: 63% (due to covid our final exams were cancelled so marks were calculated based on previous assignments and tests. As I was absent for one of the unit tests due to visa appointment, I was marked absent and zero marks were considered by my school while calculating overall percentage. If finals were were conducted or if I would've been present for that unit test then I would have definitely scored at least 80%. I am going to mention this in the additional comments section in uc application) 

12th predicted score: 85% (ig this is not useful for uc applications) 

AP: Calc BC(5), comp sci A(4), 
APs are not offered in my school so I registered and studied on my own. 

Extracurriculars:
1. Internship at umass amherst for a website development project. Duration was about a month. My job was to fix bugs and add new features to the website. 

2. I am an indie game dev and I am currently working on a puzzle game to be published on google play store. 

3. Was selected in a 3-week training program in CS and IT by one of the leading IT companies in India: infosys limited. 

4. Created an efficient watering system for house plants to reduce water wastage with the help of my father. We also supply our product to 2-3 sellers. It's like a small businesses.

5. Student council: I was the captain of my house for two years. (It's sort of like a vice-president) 

5. Volunteered for a year at a ngo: Read-a-Story. There I taught English to village kids over phone because they did not have internet connection. Approximately 100hrs.

6. I started a soccer team in my school. I was the coach as well as the captain.

7. I have played soccer at state level through a renowned football club in my city. 

8. I have received silver and gold medals in NEF enduro. NEF enduro is an internationally recognised biathlon race. 

9. I also participate in cleanliness and tree plantation drives from time to time. 

Essays/LORs: I think my essays are pretty good. My brother and a friend(both college graduates) and my father reviewed them and thought they were good. But idk how to judge my own essays so I would say they are above avg. 
I think LORs should be good as I have good relations with both my teachers who are going to recommend me. In one of my letters my teacher is going to mention the reason for the slump in grades in 11th grade. 

Schools: UIUC, Umass amherst, University of Wisconsin-Madison, UCB, UCI, University of Washington-Seattle, Purdue, Penn State, University of Minnesota-Twin cities, Umich

Please suggest me some more unis in which I have a decent to good chance."

jzdj4w,99,2020-11-23,Is it even worth it to major in finance if not from a target school? Will I really just most likely be selling insurance?,priince_julian,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jzdj4w/is_it_even_worth_it_to_major_in_finance_if_not/,"This will be a long post with a lot of questions so I’m sorry if it seems unorganized I just wanna get all my thoughts out for some finance-related people to see. I think it’s important to note that I’m living in Texas and would prefer to stay here.

Right now I’m in my first semester of community college in Texas. Halfway through my senior year of high school I was pretty confident majoring in business, and I still pretty much am. I definitely think that a career in finance would be the best and most fulfilling major to pick out of all the businesses majors. I did quite a few of my core curriculum classes in high school via dual credit and AP so right now I’m just taking macro and micro, some core science electives, and some business math classes (this semester MATH 1324, and I can’t do 1325 next semester cause I need to take college algebra apparently). The thing is though, I’m having doubts about choosing finance because all I see on Reddit is people bashing finance and recommending accounting instead, and that unless you’re from a target school on the track to investment banking, you’ll struggle to find a true finance oriented job and probably end up in a sleazy sales position. 

So here’s question 1: Will I probably end up doing fine majoring in finance and finding a good job out college besides sales positions? (Given proper networking and internships)

Then I go into my next worries. When going to a non-target school, does it matter that much which school that is? In my situation I’ve picked out three potential transfer schools: Texas A&amp;M (my “dream” choice, top 3 business school in Texas, very challenging to transfer into, only takes 100 transfers a year), UT Dallas (my “comfortable” choice, slightly less prestigious Texas business school but easier to transfer into), and University of Houston (my “safety” choice). 

Question 2: Is Mays Business at A&amp;M really much better than the other two? Or should I not stress about it and still feel fine about potentially not getting in? 

Question 3: Transferring into A&amp;M would be much easier majoring in Economics, so should I just go to A&amp;M and major in Economics and minor in Business? Is that combination more beneficial than just majoring in Finance at UT Dallas or University of Houston?

Thanks for the help in advance, I really just feel anxious about my career path and don’t wanna get too deep and end up regretting it."

I'm a senior that will be graduating in 2021.  

I changed majors from Electrical Engineering to CS late in my degree, and while I have a number of internships as an EE, I don't believe I will be able to secure a SWE internship before I graduate. My GPA is around 3.9, but as I understand it GPA largely doesn't matter to hiring managers past some automatic rejection threshold.  

I'm quite involved with some very compelling research right now, so I have that going for me, and I'm working on a few solo projects to teach myself full stack development (both to add to my resume and because I genuinely enjoy the technologies) . Full stack web development is the field I'd really like to work in.   

My question is this: Does it make sense to pursue a master's degree to give myself the opportunity to find an internship before graduation? Will a lack of internship experience so negatively impact my job search that it will be hopeless? Kind of stressing out over this, so any advice would be appreciated."

I am an EU citizen, moving to Switzerland at the start of the next year for an internship. I like Switzerland but I am primarily trying to move there permanently because well, I have a Swiss boyfriend. I will graduate next year with a degree in Informatik and by the time I graduate my experience will be: 5 months of research in my home country, 5 months of internship (developer) in Austria and 6 months of internship (in the field of Informatik) in Switzerland. My university is nothing special, my grade will be around 8.5/10. I speak my native language, English and German, fluent.

I was trying to gather information about possible job searches in r/askswitzerland where most told me that without a master's degree it will be hard to find a permanent job there. 

Does anyone have any personal experience regarding this? Is a Master's Degree really so important?

I would like to do a Master's in Switzerland but I'm scared I won't be able to save up enough money to enroll next year. Does anyone have any experience looking for part time jobs in the CS field in Switzerland?

jzglkl,2,2020-11-23,Should I put this in my Personal History Statement?,anon23-23,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/jzglkl/should_i_put_this_in_my_personal_history_statement/,"So basically early on in my childhood, I had quite some trouble with developing language skills. Almost had to repeat kindergarten and could communicate only when I was 4. Due to next to no psychological help, I had very low self esteem which did impact my education. But in my last two years of school, I found myself in a very competitive environment and I did extremely, extremely well. Undergrad followed, did very good internships, got a good GPA and here I am applying to non-terminal masters to top schools looking forward to then do PhD in computational linguistics. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only hesitation I do have is that some people have greater obstacles to attain education and I had no financial or other problems to attain it. My obstacle doesn't seem as big as many others do face. Is all this worth describing in my PHS?"

jzhe7r,1,2020-11-23,Web/Mobile Developer Internship Rant,BakaPotatoLord,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/jzhe7r/webmobile_developer_internship_rant/,"So yeah, it is basically a rant. I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student and I am 5 months away from graduation. Mostly focused on web and mobile app development at the moment so I figured I would apply for a few internships and hope to get into a paid one. 

I have been trying out this website called Internshala (I live in India) and they have internships with stipends ranging from Unpaid to 12000 INR a month. But the thing is, so many of those have too many requirements to be already fulfilled. 

Like if I am applying for a Mobile App Development internship, they expect me to know Java, Kotlin, Swift and what not right away. Isn't internship for guiding me with my career? Why do they expect so much from an intern?"
jzl0a1,2,2020-11-23,LeetHub - Automatically sync your code b/w Leetcode &amp; GitHub,bci-hacker,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jzl0a1/leethub_automatically_sync_your_code_bw_leetcode/,"Hey guys,

TL;DR: [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) is a free chrome extension that automatically pushes your code to GitHub when solving any Leetcode problem! This can be great for learning CS fundamentals, developing your developer portfolio, and being an active contributor to the open-source community.

I just wanted to share a chrome extension I built in the past 2 days that legit could've been SOO helpful this recruiting season. As someone who's received multiple Fortune 100 SWE internship offers, having a good developer portfolio is vital for getting that interview. Recruiters \*actually\* check out your GitHub profile.

But instead of building random side-projects that may or may not help you prepare for your coding interviews, why not just practice on your algorithms &amp; data structures, whilst at the same time improve your dev portfolio?

This is what led me to LeetHub to enable students to just focus on improving their algorithms skills &amp; let this extension take care of improving your portfolio!

If you find it useful (or not), I'd appreciate some feedback on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/leethub).

It has been open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) (a  ⭐️ can go a long way to help me continue working on this :D)

Chrome extension [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi)

Would appreciate some ❤️!"
jzlkze,2,2020-11-23,Trying to decide which job offer to take to improve my chances to become a financial analyst,moishr,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jzlkze/trying_to_decide_which_job_offer_to_take_to/,"Background: Master in Finance, currently taking FMVA certification course from CFI, no experience thus far as a financial analyst, working for 1.5 years in the risk department of a European national bank.

From weeks of searching through listings, I realize that to get a position as a junior analyst, I will need relevant experience, either M&amp;A/private-equity/VC internship or some other junior position that holds relevant tasks (financial modeling etc.)

For that end, **I have two job offers on the table:**

1. Working for a quite-successful Fintech startup as a financial all-rounder (officially ""finance manager""), doing everything - internal accounting, bookkeeping, financial modeling, and working with institutional customers (mainly large banks).
2. Working for a year at the national bank of one of Europe's financial centers as a risk analyst. This position is not related to FP&amp;A (it's in risk prevention), but the pay is very high and it would help me quite a lot to earn such money for a year.

In your opinion, considering I have only these two possibilities, which of these positions will help me more in getting a job as a financial analyst one year from now? or, are they equally relevant/irrelevant? And if there is no difference in the increase of my value for employers between the two - which would you take?"

The problem is that all of the software companies in my country don't have enough projects to hire interns.

Are there any job boards for internships from US or EU-based companies that hire from other countries? Also, are there any disadvantages for the company if the interns are foreign? I'd think that they might have more paperwork to do, but I'm really just interested in learning and it doesn't have to be a paid internship."

As the title says, curious to know if anyone has coupled their OSU education with something like a Udacity nano-degree and if you think it's worth it?.

Specifically, I am targeting the embedded/robotics field of software and am contemplating the Udacity Robotics Software Engineering 4-month course in addition to my OSU studies. The course covers C++, ROS, mapping and SLAM, and Path navigation. My reasons for doing this:

1. I am super interested in the field
2. It allows me to grow towards the subfield I am interested in
3. I have no access to an on-campus robotics/aerospace club to gain experience (Even tried reaching out to OSU clubs to see if they have software projects I could contribute to remote)
4. Might provide projects useful in internship applications (to targeted companies)
5. Might provide useful knowledge if I go on to do a masters

Any thoughts or insights would be helpful."
jzncnp,2,2020-11-23,How to get the best out of a virtual internship?,ched41,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jzncnp/how_to_get_the_best_out_of_a_virtual_internship/,"MSFT announced that their 2021 summer internships will be virtual. I am considering 2 offers MSFT (firmware engineer intern, XBox ) and Qualcomm (embedded software engineer intern, Wireless R&amp;D). 

I am worried that I will not be able to perform well or impress my managers in a virtual internship with MSFT, leading to decreased chances of return offer. Qualcomm on the other hand is still leaving the door open to in-person internships. 

How can one get the best out of a virtual internship?

Does anyone have experience with the XBox team at MSFT or Wireless R&amp;D software team at Qualcomm?

Which option has better TC for full-time roles?

Which option is better for an international graduate student (H1B in mind)?

Thank you very much."
jzo0lb,0,2020-11-23,"Fear, Failure, and and Finances",caleboratemedia,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jzo0lb/fear_failure_and_and_finances/,"Is asking for help in such a direct way allowed here? I'm not entirely sure, but I guess we will find out. If nothing else, I'm sure a lot of people on this thread can relate to this and might be in the same exact predicament I'm in.

The stated predicament is as follows; I am inherently lost. Ever since I was a kid, all I wanted was to be a business man. Corner office, secretary, the way they glorified it in all the movies. Now, obviously, as I got older, my definition changed. But the fact still remained; I wanted to run a business. The 9-5 petrified me. I was born with a disability, which limits me physically and completely dictates what jobs I can and can't do. Not to mention I loathed the idea of working under someone who makes maybe three dollars more than I do for a billion dollar company that really didn't value me or made a difference in the world. To be fair, I fought it for a long time, not getting a job at all until I absolutely had to. And by that point, I doubled up, working at my local movie theater and obtaining an incredible internship for my college. Ironically, I fell in love with both places besides the terrible pay, but Covid laid me off from both of those. Here I am now, starting over again, in a new city at a new school, wondering how to approach the new year.

As I stated, I've always wanted to be a entrepreneur. The only issue is, I suck at it. I can't count on two fingers how many business ideas I've pursued and poured money and time into only to have it fall completely on its tail. I've read just about every book on the subject, taken courses, watched videos. But, I think we all know none of that is what makes a business successful. Then again, what would I know on that subject? To preface, the closest I got to success was my photography business. I was making decent money (or so I thought) at the time, but it's one of the most cut-throat industries out there. It's just other photographers saying they'll do a better job for cheaper until everyone's devalued down to nothing. That was my issue; I knew my photography was incredible and unique, yet I was being viewed as just another photographer. 

The decision to abandon capitalizing on my photography sent me spiraling into other things; website design, videography, event live streaming, even an online course taking website. None of which panned out. At this point, I am desperate. I've almost completed my Bachelors in Media &amp; Communications, specializing in Marketing with a Minor in Writing. I've published a self-help book with a genuine Wall Street publisher. But, I'm just lost. I'm only 22 years old, so I'm aware that I have a lot to learn and a lot more to face. There are few things I am certain of. When Covid was at its peak, I lost my apartment, both jobs, had to rehome my dog, move to a new state, all while also battling a new epilepsy diagnosis. So, as far as things I **am certain of** is that I'd very much like to have a life again; a place to call home, a dog to call a friend, and an income enough for me to pay for neurologists, stop eating McNuggets, and pay my bills. I just want to make the world a better place and make a living doing so. I know in this day and age, that's a whole lot to ask. But, we're shifting, I feel like. Advertising is becoming meaningful marketing, small-business is making a comeback. I want to be apart of that change. How does one proceed from being lost?"

jzouu6,6,2020-11-23,Do I have any hope after this major internship blunder?,pennstatestudent333,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/jzouu6/do_i_have_any_hope_after_this_major_internship/,"Hey guys. Any advice or words of wisdom would be much appreciated. PLEASE help I’ve listed the questions at the end. Please please please! I can’t waste any more time!

So, I am in my junior year in college and as you all know this is a critical summer! 

Since my freshman year, I have had my eye set on this one specific internship that you can only apply for junior year+. The goal was also that it  would hopefully pave the way to a job offer. This is literally my dream company and applying to this internship is a culmination of everything I have worked for these last few years. I know that there was no assurance that I could have even got it, but I felt like I had a good shot. 

Anyways, I knew when the application opened and closed from the very first day that it was posted as I had just been waiting. I have truly never spent more time working on something, as I did this cover letter and the additional application materials (which I know is stupid and naive at the rate and depth that cover letters are actually read). I should have submitted it wins ago but I was literally tweaking it for months and until 2 minutes before the application was due. 

You probably know what happens next. If you guessed that my computer started operating in slow motion, and my materials didn’t upload, and then I was locked out of the application because the deadline passed and it closed, you are correct. 

My first question is: 
am I incredibly self destructive or is this something else, because I have had similar instances on numerous occasions.

Secondly:
this company actively recruits at my school because my major’s program is ranked #1, so an information session was held for the 20 students that went through a preliminary screening and had the qualifications to even apply. Thus, the information session was very thorough and those involved in it were hiring managers and also some very high ranking executives. 

One of the said high ranking executives (I believe inadvertently) had their email instead of their name on the zoom info session. I had an intuition to write it down, and I am debating whether I should send an email to him?

My concern is that I am talking to the VP who most definitely does not publicize his personal email. Will he think I’m creepy or will he consider it as a positive thing? 

If you guys thing I should email him, can you give me some guidance on what to say? I feel like If I don’t at least try, than this was all a giant waste. I know that this blunder is totally on me and will probably be seen as something to automatically disqualify me, but maybe a really powerful email might help ? 

Thank you for reading, any responses will be deeply appreciated."
jzouvm,2,2020-11-23,Does anybody have advice for applying for internships?,cas47,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jzouvm/does_anybody_have_advice_for_applying_for/,"My university requires students to have some kind of semester away, typically in the form of an internship, and I'm supposed to have mine this spring. I've been applying since May and I haven't gotten anything.  I have reached out to every contact that I have and am applying for every engineering internship at every company that I can find, but I keep hitting dead ends. 

I have a good GPA, leadership experience in managing engineering projects, plenty of extracurriculars, and a resume that has been reviewed by my university's career development center. I also looked at what buzzwords algorithms look for while filtering out resumes and found good ways to organically incorporate them into my resume. 

Still, I haven't gotten so much as a call back from any company yet. I'm starting to get really worried about this and I have no clue what it is that I'm missing. All I can think of is that most of my peers have already had an engineering internship by now, and the fact that I haven't might be holding me back. I'm not sure though.

Does anybody have any advice?"
jzp5ri,2,2020-11-23,Large vs Small Prop Firm Internships,daartofstorytellin3k,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jzp5ri/large_vs_small_prop_firm_internships/,"I've received offers for an summer 2021 internship from two prop firms. One is for a DevOps role at a large prop trading firm and market maker (one of Optiver/IMC/Jane Street) and the other is a software developer role in the automated trading division of a small prop firm.

I'm having trouble deciding what the better experience would be for me. My ultimate goal is to end up as a software engineer at a trading firm, preferably a larger one. I've broken the pros/cons for each as I see it as follows:

Large Firm Pros:

* Extremely high compensation
* Option for fully remote OR free housing in a US major metropolitan area
* Get my foot in the door at a prestigious firm
* Strong team, would have good opportunities for mentorship

Large Firm Cons:

* Role is DevOps, would maybe make it harder to get a SWE role in the future?
* Not as interesting work (to me)

----------------------------------

Small Firm Pros:

* Opportunity for autonomy (small team, manager indicated that I'd be able to take lead on some projects)
* Build experience that's more applicable to my ultimate career goals
* Fully remote (now and after graduation for a full time role, this is desirable to me)
* Team is growing rapidly, could get in at the ground floor


Small Firm Cons:

* Company has no real name recognition
* Less developed tech due to youth of team (I would have as much software experience as my manager)
* Lesser compensation, not super competitive

Which internship would put me in a better position to get a SWE role after graduation (this is my final internship before graduating)? I think that both would be good experiences for the summer, but I'm trying to look for the best choice in the longer term."
jzp6di,18,2020-11-23,"Unsure of where to start, I'm a jack of all trades that can't seem to stand out. Can you help me?",wingsfan64,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jzp6di/unsure_of_where_to_start_im_a_jack_of_all_trades/,"Hi all,

I'm here looking for advice on how to start my career. Every time I take a career aptitude quiz, I get results that just aren't helpful for my current status, ie: CEO, Creative Director, Consultant and other higher up/managerial/experience required positions. I know that I would have to work my way up to those jobs (if I even wanted one of them) but I really just want to find something that's good now (decent salary, decent prestige, not an intern, not a manager)

I have a fairly wide range of tech skills, but I don't particularly shine in any one area, especially compared to single skill specialists. I'm assuming this is the reason I don't get many responses to applications, because my university GPA was pretty good (3.8)

If it helps, here's some of my results from the career explorer thing I did:

&gt; You are a Maverick

&gt; Your strongest trait is Enterprising, and your second strongest is Artistic, which makes you a Maverick.

&gt; Mavericks are natural influencers and love to express their artistic selves. They like to use their intuition when developing new ideas and generally have a competitive nature. They are willing to take risks and like environments where they are not tied down to any constraints.


&gt; Your Archetype is powered by the traits that make up your broad interests.

&gt; - Enterprising:
An enterprising person is someone who makes an excellent leader. They are excellent problem solvers and enjoy sales and management roles. This type of person is extroverted, and while they may seem restless or irresponsible, their energy and ability to take risks is the reason many projects get started and stay successful.

&gt; - Artistic: An artistic person is someone who likes to be involved with forms, patterns, and designs in life. They like to use their minds and hands to create things. An artistic person enjoys unusual people, sights, sounds, and textures. They have a lot of spirit and enthusiasm. They enjoy their own creativity and imagination.

&gt;Skills You Can Focus On:

&gt;Mavericks are confident, persuasive, and charismatic. They see themselves as original and they tend to enjoy creative activities like writing, art, and drama. They are quite expressive and usually feel comfortable in front of a crowd. They tend to do well in roles where they can be in charge of the artistic direction of a project, make decisions, and lead a group of people to carry out their vision.

&gt;Tendencies To Be Careful Of:

&gt;Because Mavericks tend to be very creative people that enjoy directing the overall vision for a group of people, they can sometimes run into trouble when they have to work by themselves on only a part of a project. They know that every piece is crucial to the final execution of a project, but they can feel insignificant when they can't influence the whole thing. They also tend to value variety over routine and can lose interest if circumstances stay the same for too long.


Anyway, sorry for the long post, just trying to help you help me. I'm happy to answer any questions! Thank you."

Here is the thirty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

Are there any job boards for internships from US or EU-based companies that hire from other countries? Also, are there any disadvantages for the company if the interns are foreign?

As the title indicates, I'm a recent college grad who no idea what the fuck to do and I'd really appreciate some input on possible career paths. I have a BS in Resource Conservation (really interesting combo of science and politics) from a public uni in the Rocky Mountain region of the US and am still stuck in my delightful college town with a bit of the post-grad blues. 

For a splattering of background, my college years were marred by mental health issues (a shocking attribute for a redditor, I know) and family health emergencies that caused my academic studies to be cordoned off in coach while the more prescient issues were given first-class service in the 747 of my heart.  I'm very proud to have graduated in December of 2019, but now that the seat-backs and tray tables are in their upright and locked position, I have no idea where the fuck I'm going. My mental health has improved quite a bit since I work full-time now at a retail store and have access to somewhat affordable mental health treatment. When I was in college I was very, very suicidal and sort of assumed I wouldn't have made it to 25 anyway. Two thankfully failed attempts later and I now have a will to live, but still no plan for a career. 

I have some experience in undergraduate research internships in ornithology and plant surveying, but my inability to ever keep my GPA above a 3.0 swiftly shortened those opportunities to under a year with no advancement. With my head barely above water for all of undergrad I also have no academic references since I rarely interacted with professors at all outside of class -- if you're currently a student please don't do this.  Outside of that I have ample experience with both customer service (don't we all?) and political canvassing. I had a senior role in one of the many outdoor recreation groups on campus, but my severe asthma and bouts of extremely low-energy depressive slumps keep me from pursuing outdoor careers in fields like wildland fire fighting or outdoor rec. Despite being secretly depressed, I'm a very outgoing person when necessary and am extremely personable. I work well in teams, I'm great at making people laugh in ""serious"" presentations, I was in a short-lived yet exhilarating hardcore band during community college, and I've had a surprisingly active romantic life for someone of my uh..... appearance. During undergrad I really gravitated toward my philosophy and more technical classes like GIS, so something that involves computers is definitely on the table. I'm absolutely not having kids, so money isn't too much of a concern, but I still need to pay off my college debt. Incurring more debt is not an option, and getting into grad school with a 2.6 undergrad GPA may very well be impossible, so postgrad enrollment is likely off the table. 

If anyone has any ideas, feel free to bounce em off of me. I've been doing some research on possible career paths, but I'm sort of at a loss and I'd appreciate any input at all. I love where I live, but I'm itching for novelty, so if it's something that requires relocation I'm very interested. No pressure at all, I'd just love for new career paths to research myself. Thanks!"

I source the clients and communicate to our developers to make the websites, its similar to Upworks in that sense, but I feel we are much more focused to helping the clients grow their business.

My question is, as I'm starting to scale, I'm thinking I want to hire a marketing or UX intern. The UX intern will help the clients visualize the designs, gather information with what they need, then perhaps create a mock-up or ideas to our developers. The marketing Intern will simply get a budget to advertise and to find more clients.

Yes, it's just cheap labor, however we don't make much money ourselves and if we begin to scale, I can then hire more fulltime staff.

I'm asking this because when I was in college, I begged for an internship, and worked for free, so I thought this would be a great opportunity for a student to put something on their resume.

Some advice please!"

An example of this is my weight lose. this year I lost around 35 IBS. I don't see that as a big task anymore despite going past my previous limit and I still am upset at myself for not being able to lose 2IBS in 2 months.(My guess for this is online school took a lot of my free time to workout and it got way too cold for me to run like a normally do.) Also for the longest time I wanted an internship in CS and as a freshman in college I finally got one. but its unpaid. I took it anyways for the experience however despite this being one of my long term goals I don't really feel anything is particular.  I find it strange to think I am good at things because that seems like a trait a self absorbed person would have(I'm not calling people who think they are good at things self absorbed but by complimenting myself I feel strange and almost makes myself seem like a self absorbed person to me.) So how is it that I can become proud of my accomplishments and less hard on myself when Im not doing so good. I think because of this mindset I feel like a failure inside and I want to change this.

(Work is in a suburb of a big city btw)

a) use my moms car to drive at least an hour through heavy traffic and my mom has to carpool to work

b) I rent an apartment near work and still have to bus 30-45 minutes to get to work

c) I rent an apartment in the big city and take the train an hour and a half to get to work

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of Each option 

a) Save a lot of money, will be able to pay school and living expenses for two semesters and then some

b) Closest option to work

c) Live in the big city (which I've always to do, I grew up on the outskirts). Take the train to work which is pretty stress free. Live close to friends and family and everything else

&amp;#x200B;

Cons of each option

a) Have to be stuck in traffic at least 2 hours each day, huge hassle for my mom

b) Only living options there are pretty sketchy (and still pretty expensive) and still live kinda far from work. Would be hard to live there without a car, especially in the winter because I use my bike for everything

c) Expensive. Would only be able to afford school and living expenses for one semester. Maybe living expenses for two. 1.5 hour commute is also pretty long (although it is by train)

jzvhe1,2,2020-11-23,Had a final interview for entry marketing level job,Stunning-Reason2464,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jzvhe1/had_a_final_interview_for_entry_marketing_level/,"Hey guys so today I finally had my sixth round of interviews with the CMO of a 1200 person tech company in the B2B area. 

I know you’re thinking six rounds is probably excessive and yeah it definitely is the company is by no means broken but they’re hiring Round needs to be fixed.

My recruiter was super transparent with me we got on very well on a personal level he even dropped a few curse words yes there was a high professionalism despite thought and he told me that it was between me and one other candidate who I was neck and neck with a team had nothing but good things to say about me despite my pressing for any sort of Constructive criticism. I was pretty pleased to hear this but I also know recruiters are nice people and won’t tell you something terrible he tells me I’m meeting with her on Monday and that I might have an offer letter as soon as Wednesday or next Monday and that he wishes me the best of luck to maintain my level of enthusiasm.

Days prior had spoken with another director who had only let me talk for 10 minutes before moving onto questions with him I couldn’t tell if this was because he thought I was incompetent/humor me or because he was trying to do a hard sell.

Advanced and met with CMO 8:30 AM today who was a very brisk woman, cut to the chase no bullshit type of person, everything you’d expect from a CMO. Few behavioral questions like why I was interested, tell me about what you studied in college, what drives me crazy - I told her about how i valued transparency and communication between team mates to stay on track and gave an example of a time I had made a mistake there, how I was lucky to have had a supervisor that was super transparent with me and how that’s shaped me to take a hands on approach in dealing with issues around transparency - STAR), tell me about your internships. Interview concluded right at 30 minutes as she said she had a hard stop (I believe her on this one tbh)

Apart from that I talked about how I liked that this company had such a high emphasis on giving back and how this demonstrated that they practiced what they preached, how it tied into company values, and reflected well on leadership. Spoke about how sales role in addition to marketing has been beneficial bc it’s shown me what communication and effective lead nurturing looks like at a B2B company. Also about how I’ve got a good experience across marketing ranging from campaigns, event and how that exposed me to working with various stakeholders understanding what it’s like to set up standards of success. 

I don’t think this last round went exceedingly well although I am prone to negative thinking. I included only one STAR anecdote about past experience and it felt more a conversation than a star type interview if that makes sense? Couldn’t figure out how to answer “tell me about the courses you took in college” with a STAR lol. 

Overall I’m feeling pretty anxious and exhausted, six rounds is a lot! I’m worried I didn’t come across as charismatic enough as her personality was far more brisk than the other directors and intimidated me. Usually I can be adapt my charisma based on the other person but she definitely threw me off a bit.

My other rounds of interviews went over by a bit but I wasn’t able to get my recruiter to tell me if there was something they’d wished I’d discussed more.. 

If anyone’s got any thoughts I’d love to hear them, especially as a recent graduate and somewhat new to the interview process :) Thanks!"

For context, I’m a freshman cornell CS major in the U.S. I’m already involved in a student led startup at my university, but I’d like to have an opportunity for mentorship from someone more experienced in the field. 

So far I haven’t heard back from larger/more established internship programs at bigger companies (not surprised if I was ghosted lol) but I have received some interview offers from start ups (mainly off angel list). Many of them don’t offer pay, but equity instead (which probably isn’t worth much). 

I’m already involved in a lot of things, so I would most likely have to give up my role in the student led startup to accept an internship position during the academic year. Would this be worthwhile? Or should I stick with the student start up? I do really enjoy working with the people there. 

Also, how do I differentiate between start ups that are just looking for free labor vs experiences that would be worth adding on to my resume?"

k02i3k,6,2020-11-24,Help,dalkuh,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k02i3k/help/,"I am a 3rd year student from Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and this answer is to shed some light on how stupid our college’s administration is!!
During this corona period when everyone should be inside their homes and maintain social distancing so that we can keep the Covid numbers down, we the students of PEC are basically being forced to come on campus and give offline examinations.
Now some may wonder what is the problem? right?! But we live in hostels and our hostels are nothing less than cheap ass roadside motels with shared washrooms and mess.
Our hostels washroom are in worse condition than public washrooms. Now imagine this we are coming to hostels to give examinations ,there’s a chance we’ll be asked to change our hostel rooms ( again leading to greater chance of catching Covid ) , sharing the same mess with around 200 students , sharing washrooms with 15–20 students + travelling.
Now as far as safety measures are concerned our college isn’t even conducting a Covid test or quarantining the students who are arriving from red zones , though there is a fine imposed for not wearing masks.
There is another problem our dumb college is conducting online exams for all the students residing outside India .
My main problem is a college which has technology in its name doesn’t have enough faith in technology to conduct online examination all they need is a headline in news paper with a smiling photograph of our “Beloved ” director Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi that he “successfully” conducted offline examinations.
Though our college might argue we have a option to skip these examinations and we’ll be given “I” grade and our examinations would be conducted when situation becomes normal again.
Now there is a serious flaw in it, I am currently in 5th semester and I have bagged and internship for 6th semester(intern semester for our college students) and there is a high chance that some companies may not allow WFH(work from home) and may call students as far as bangalore , now our “Intelligent” college administration has decided that if situation permits we can be called to give exams during the intern period. How stupid does one need to be to take such decisions ?!
The company is paying you to do their work , we are expected to work and learn new things instead we’ll be there studying for these stupid examinations and travelling to chandigarh on weekends that prove to be nothing but useless. And let’s consider a case the situation doesn’t turn back to normal before July, we’ll be in our 7th semester and have our placement interviews now the college’s placement cell doesn’t even guarantee if we’ll be allowed to sit in all companies or not. So what our college is basically trying to do is to force us to come to college give our exams and they don’t even take responsibility if someone catches covid because they basically forced us to fill the consent form.
Now my question is what is more important a person’s life or a headline in the newspaper, well as per the current circumstances it clearly reflects our college doesn’t care about students life.
If there is anyone who can help us fight these stupid guys your help would be appreciated. Any media coverage that sheds light onto such thoughtless decisions would prove to be beneficial for us maybe this could save our lives.
I am being very serious about this situation because I recently lost one of my family member due to covid and it doesn’t seem like our college understands the deadliness of this virus. Well Ig that’s all I wanted to get off my chest and yeah if someone’s wondering why this is answered anonymously it’s because I frankly don’t trust my college faculty and they may take a biased decision against me and I don’t want such trouble just for bringing out the truth.
Once again I am asking you all if someone out there reading this answer has any possible way of helping us please do lend us your helping hand!! Thank You.."

Now I'm willing to take one step back so I can move forward again.I'd be down to land an unpaid Internship (if this means the requirements to get it are lower) or even pay for a valid study course that can give me enough knowledge to land a paid Internship or even a Junior-level job.

My requirements are the following:

* I'm looking for an intensive course/internship that ideally lasts no more than 3-6 months (if unpaid or that I have to pay from my wallet)
* Better if NOT online: having suffered from depression, I feel that studying in an environment with people is what I need to regain focus and motivation.(Or better yet: Now after having been cured from the worse symptoms of depression, I feel better... but I' still feel that the right environment plays a fundamental role and I know that keeping to live in my hometown doesn't do my mental health any favors, since I've nothing left here I care about)

I live in Europe btw

I am preparing for interview right now. I have got around 6-7 months left in college.

University has taught nothing except giving a degree.

  
Few days back I applied to a lot of companies through college campus recruitment process.   
I gave a Aptitude test (a logical reasoning,vocabulary test) which is common for the interview process in my country and  if we clear that,then we can go to next interview process.   
PS:I am not even prepared fully to clear the next rounds,will take around 4-5 months.

But then I thought giving these interviews would help me prepare for the interview for my dream job.  


I applied for 'Associate analyst' in 'company A' and i did a little digging and found out that it is not related to the job role a software developer. If you know anything about that specific job role please let me know what you have to do there. 

Now, i have cleared 'company A' first round.

  
1)Should i continue with the interview process of company A after finding out its not related to developer role? -&gt; I could find out by actually giving the interview.

2) Prepare for company B with the right job role? I mean where we actually build something.

3) Skip all the companies for now and focus on preparing and doing project and apply after a few months?

4)Find a internship at a startup close to me and make my resume strong.

I fear that I would loose the opportunity in the recruitment process and it would be hard to find a job later. I don't know what i to do. I am open to all suggestions."
k07oj0,1,2020-11-24,Staying true to being yourself vs changing yourself to become more social because it’s affecting your life,lmao_nah,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/k07oj0/staying_true_to_being_yourself_vs_changing/,"I’m an introvert that can get wild and have extrovert tendencies occasionally but at the end of the day I thoroughly enjoy some quiet time by myself to recharge.

I think I might even have borderline social anxiety (not diagnosed though so maybe I’m just dramatic lmao) because I’ll genuinely get stressed when I need to chat with people I just met for an extended period of time, including both group activities and (especially) one-on-one conversations. I am scared of awkward silence that I spend the whole time stressing about what to talk about. I’ve gotten way better than before at (pretending) to not be stressed about it but I’m still not 100% comfortable deep down and whenever people leave I always get a sigh of relief. On days or at nighttime when I’m usually really tired, I’ll just not want to talk at all. 

I think I always will be an introvert at heart but as many of you in this group can probably relate, it has adversely affected my life in so many ways and it’s something that frustrates me so much. Since it has affected my social, career, love life, I know I need to step out of my comfort zone and make changes, and I have. This year I’ve (kind of forced) myself to meet more people and genuinely try to have a conversation with them and get to know them. 

But it’s tiring.

And for the most part I’ve gotten by with my occasional extrovert tendencies (like I’ll socialise for a day or two then recharge at home for the rest of the week) but now I realise that’s not enough for my new schedule anymore. Pretty much every day I inescapably need to talk to new people (at school, at my internship, when I walk my dog etc.) and it’s getting really tiring. 

My point is, I hate how my introverted personality has affected my life and I know I need to change for the better, but at the same time trying to make myself extroverted and socialise for so many hours is so draining to me.

Any advice?"

I was an intern at a Big N company and now I'm a software engineer at another fairly big and well known tech company but I'm trying to remain anonymous so I won't say where.


I haven't had a long career at all, but I noticed a ton of architects are elitist and/or are workaholics. Has anyone else noticed this or is it just me ? Sometimes I get offended. One of my architects snidely said one time ""have you had experience in python before ?"" when a bug appeared and even though I fixed it and showed him why it was appearing, hopefully he realized it was rude to assume I'm an idiot that doesn't know python (my internship was all python and my project in my internship worked correctly from my code).


Every architect I've worked with is sort of like this, but at the same time I respect them because they are really smart and a great asset to the companies they work for. Is this common behavior ? Have you all worked with architects like this ? I'm not complaining really, I'm just curious..."

Let me get right into my question - how long are you supposed to keep your Curriculum Vitae/Resumes for graduate school? In undergraduate, I've been using a 2-page resume for every job or internship. However, my Curriculum Vitae runs to just about 3 pages. For context, I'm applying to Computer Science MS programs.

Now, a few graduate students were of the opinion that I should trim it down to 2 pages at the max, while a few told me that 3 would be acceptable. Does anyone here have a second opinion for me to take? I made a website for myself which basically acts as an in-depth electronic CV, but I'm not sure if the committee will look at that very carefully, and am very unsure if it makes sense to take the risk of shortening my CV and removing something that potentially might make a strong impact on the committee.

I've been searching and I have seen that there is the PySB module which could be useful.

Next sem, my 3 core mods will be ACC1701, MKT1705 and BSP1702. I have yet to take GER1k so I would assume I would also be taking that next sem.

I heard from a couple of seniors that I should try to bid for DAO python in Y1S2 since some of the prior knowledge learnt in DAO1704 would be required and it would still be fresh in my knowledge compared to if I were to take it in Y2. 

Just wondering:

- is it even a feasible idea? i.e. is there even a legitmate chance a Y1 student could land a spot in a 2k biz core mod which obviously seniors would be given priority towards

- If it is, is it recommended? It will be a tough semester I’m sure; especially since I will be juggling ACC and DAO2k (I won’t be doing any GEs in that case other than the mandatory GER). This is also keeping in mind that DAO Python cannot be SUed

For context, I found DAO1704 not exactly a breeze but one that coincided with my personal interest in analytics and hence did not find much difficulty to go the extra mile for. I hope to double spec in FIN &amp; BA eventually as of now but of course I’m not 100% sure yet. 

I also have some prior knowledge (though not too indepth) using Python via Jupyter for data analytics in a prior internship so it might not be as difficult for me to get a grasp on some of the initial programming concepts. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

————————

Mark was on patrol in his trusty old Land Rover, in the public part of his job as constable for Symonds Yat, which meant driving around the narrow roads and waiting for the next incident to be called in. Actually, seeing as it was midday on a Sunday, the end of his shift might well come first.

It was then that his radio chirped, reporting an arson over at a sawmill in the Forest. “Mark here, why do they need me over there, its a bit out of my patch”

“They need you here because they think there’s weirdness going on”

“Oh right, they want me for that part of my job, huh? Well, I’ll be right over.”

Flipping on his light, he drove over as fast as he could, the speed of the land rover was the one disadvantage it had. 
                                                                                                                                                                                      
When he got there it was immediately obvious why he had been called, the sawmill hadn’t just been set fire to, it had been completely destroyed, with bits of wall stuck 20 up into the trees on the other side of the road. The fire brigade was still there pulling in their hoses when he arrived but the fire was out, so it was safe for him to enter. The two constables by the remains of the of the entrance started to stop him, then drew back he showed them his other badge, the one that read “Inspector for the Supernatural”, while he carried on in to get a first look around before coming back for his kit.

The centre of the blast was in a clear space between two warehouses, with nothing obvious to account for it. Quickly he jogged back out to his car, and started grabbing the kit he needed, his regular grab bag plus a couple of other tools. As he reentered  the site he passed a couple of members of the fire brigade carrying their own kit in, escorted by a Sergeant to check for normal causes for the fire, but not expecting much.

“Not sure why their bothering with us, they need to get the Royal Engineers out from Monmouth, they’re the only guys around here who could cause such a blast.”

He overheard the muttering from the men as they walked past, quietly agreeing with them as, although he hadn’t had a proper look at scene a blast that big would almost certainly have left some residue he could detect with just his training. Maybe he should he get one of those fob radia counters that some of his fellows had, would give him an even better idea when he first arrived? Anywho, he’d arrived and had to get a good look at the scene before the fire guys  messed it up. Quickly check the radia counter, about 2 counts a second, perfectly normal, same with his true particle counter, and of anything weird had happened that would almost certainly be showing the evidence for weeks afterward, let alone a couple of hours. The first hint of weirdness was when he checked the residual energy levels in the area, a tool he rarely took with him as it was heavy and rarely useful, with advances in other techniques. The weird thing was it was reading around 500 DNS, 20 times what he’d expect anywhere outside of a specialist magic facility, which there was no evidence of here, and besides, an explosion this big would drain any residual energy, not boost it like this, so that didn’t exactly get him any closer to fixing it. Looking over, the fire guys were having no better luck, and were struggling to decide what to pack up and take for further testing, seeing as there wasn’t ant obvious ash or anything similar to denote an obvious trigger point they could take samples.

Once he’d packed his stuff into the Landy he walked over to talk with the sergeant in charge of the scene, and caught him up on the results, or lack off.

“Yeah, the fire guys have nothing, they’re taking samples back to headquarters but they’re not hopeful.”

“Right, I’ll get one of our vans out here tomorrow, see if that sheds any light on the scene.” 

“See you tomorrow then.”


—————————

The next morning he was up at the scene straight after breakfast, just in time to see the 2 Bedfords of a police mobile magical investigation team pull through the remains of the gate, and the men jump out and start setting up equipment to hunt down any magical evidence, and a decent of bit of non magical as well, only to carry on drawing the same negative, confusing and sometimes downright contradictory results as he’d managed, just more of them. It wasn’t until some overeager intern decided to run a small scrap of metal they’d found with no apparent source through a celestial resonator, a little used piece of kit that could tell what star produced the majority of the light that shone onto a material. Although they weren’t terribly accurate, owing to a very small sample to size to test on, they were good at identifying if something wasn’t from earth, like this piece of metal for instance.

The next breakthrough came when they called the fire research office to send them the sample, only to find they had a similar piece which they had already tested and found faint evidence of rocket propellant residue on.  While they agreed to do a sample swap, some of the more excitable members of the teams where already beginning to mutter about aliens.

As he was driving home he was flagged down by some motorists, and lead to the remains of lycanthrope, one of the few monsters well integrated into society  surrounded by his blood and what appeared to be green blood, along with a weird looking weapon? under the body. He taped the scene off and called for back up, then radioed to the team in charge of the sawmill scene that the alien explanation had become a lot more plausible suddenly.

I’m a current intern at NWM (yes I know all the shitty aspects of NWM from both browsing this Reddit and first hand experience) and I have learned I do enjoy the field of planning. I’m graduating in the May with a finance and financing planning dual major degree that allows me to sit for the CFP right away without going through the education requirements for it. 

I would love to hear from planners in the industry what their advice is to start out in the industry. I have heard it is trending towards small RIAs, but I am debating staying on with Northwestern Mutual for a couple reasons. 

1. In talking to senior advisors here who I actually do respect (they don’t push insurance on people who don’t need it, have CFPs along with other designations, and made it in the business without being given business through rich family), they talk about how they have structured their practices with the Managing Director here to allow them to focus on investments with very little insurance sales. (Their sales reports do support this so they aren’t blowing smoke up my ass)

2. In talking with the MD, they will sponsor me to take the SIE, Series 7, and Series 63 as soon as I want to take them. (Currently signing up to take the SIE)

With the end of school approaching, it became a little harder for me to keep making changes but I still did my best within my timeframe. My managers had told me that the project was due on X date, but then during one of our weekly meetings, said that they needed it done by that Friday (about 2-3 weeks before original due date). This was impossible for me to do so they emailed me to “stay out of the code” and finished it themselves. They’ve since presented it to other members of the company. I wasn’t asked to attend the meeting and honestly this rubbed me the wrong way because it was my project and my code. Is this type of situation common in industry and what I have to look forward to?

k0dllf,1,2020-11-24,First job - WWYD?,PertinentPenguin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k0dllf/first_job_wwyd/,"Hi all, first, I want to say I consider myself to be in a very fortunate position. I currently have two offers, both permanently remote, with startups doing SWE work. Both are in startup accelerator programs and beginning to grow. How do I decide between the two? I'm curious especially on your insight if you're an experienced developer who had to make similar decisions early on in their career. 

&amp;#x200B;

Startup 1:

* Currently interning there until I graduate this May, will be bumped up \~20-30/hr PT - I would probably forfeit this role if I accepted Startup 2 as this is ramping me up for FT. Would likely have a similar offer with Startup 2 if I accepted their offer with 15-20/hr PT
* 30-50% of role will involve web scraping duties (this makes me feel inferior as a developer, although I know this is because I am good at it - it's just very menial work) - I prefer to spend my time doing SWE work 
* Horrible communication - I've asked my higher ups for info I NEED to complete my work for days and still nothing - this is incredibly common and frustrating 
* MUCH better revenue model - my salary will always have the potential to be higher with this company - their idea is more interesting than Startup 2
* Tech stack is a bit newer - MERN
* only have a web app + website 
* Small dev team  - myself + 1 other, soon to be 1-2 more
* Pay is \~60-65k

Startup 2:

* Currently doing contract work for them - very limited contact but they're a bit friendlier and much more responsive 
* 100% SWE work, have choice to do mobile development, frontend work, etc. 
* have a mobile app for both andriod/ios, web app, website (IMO lower quality, though)
* Much more established workflow - JIRA, push changes to dev server before merging to master
* Would have daily meetings to discuss code, a senior mentor who used to run the internship program at their last position 
* Pay is \~55-60k
* Stack is React, React Native for mobile, lots of plain ol javascript 
* dev team of 5-10

I have not done any salary negotiation at this point, although I'm aware that I can't ask much, if any at all, beyond 60 for Startup 2.  

If you're later in your career, I'd love to hear what you'd do in a scenario like this. Salary is somewhat important given that my fiancée will be in law school for a few years. However, I don't have an intention at staying at either company for terribly long, as I could likely make more money if I weren't remote. Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks for sticking through this long post!"

So my 4 months are ending, will be 8 months total in December. I met the conditions however because of covid the runway is very tight and they can’t offer me a full time position.

ANYONE!,mryan7609,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k0epl8/employment_conundrum_advice_please_help_anyone/,"So this may be a bit of a long one but please bear with me. I would love to hear from multiple people about what they think.

I graduated law school back in the Spring of 2018 and for a few months I just kind of sat around. For those not aware, most law grads apply to take the bar exam in July after they graduate (approximately 2 months later). I did not. I took a break and managed to find employment as a court clerk the following October. It was great; wonderful people, working in the area of law I was interested in, State benefits, public interest loan forgiveness for a massive amount of student loan debt, and a 9-5 schedule. Plus, my boss allowed me to go on partial hours when I studied for and eventually took and passed the bar exam the following February. The cons though were pretty glaring, horrible pay, a 40-minute commute both ways, and the work was all clerical, not actual practice. 

Fast forward to August 2020. I had been interviewing with a private firm who was going to take me on as an associate attorney for $52k/year doing work in my practice area. He told me he would be active in training me, be available to answer any and all questions, and would ease me into the job. The last point was a big point for me. Lots of attorneys when they start get inundated with work and are basically left to sink or swim. I did not want that. I wanted to learn how to do this job with someone willing to invest time into me; not just use me as an extra body. I put my two weeks in at the court and eventually started at the firm. 

Within a day I learned that everything the firm promised me was a total lie. They dropped a long list of their clients on me, one-third of which were set for trial within TWO months and zero work had been done on their files. No witness lists, evidence lists, caselaw references. Nothing. Additionally, when I asked where I should start, the supervising attorney said, ""read the file."" No additional clarification at all apparently. These were not run of the mill defense cases, these were complex legal issues at play that rested on things like hearsay. Finally, when I tried to call him, he shut his phone off for the day and I only got a hold of him by contacting the office manager. He called me back 4 hours later. Only two days had gone by and I realized if he couldn't keep his promises two days in then I couldn't trust him going forward. So before even signing the W4 I told him I would not be working for him. He simply hung up the phone on me after saying drop your laptop off at the office.

Immediately after quitting I called the Chief Clerk of the district to ask if I could have my job back. He told me he would put his neck out for me to get my job back but he needed to know I really was serious about coming back. I said I was and he said he'll call me back. The next day I found out that HR would not authorize me to be rehired because of a shortage of funds as a result of COVID. I was stuck. I applied to approximately 50 jobs for a month and a half for positions mainly as a lawyer to other administrative jobs. I only received one response during that time and it was a rejection.

Then in October I got a call back from my job saying if I wanted to come back I could but I would have to agree to work for 9 months. I asked for some time to think, and they gave me 36 hours to decide between trying to look around or get paid again. I reluctantly agreed because my savings were getting eaten into and I was disheartened. At the moment I'm back where I was and I truly hate my job. Love the people but just hate the work.

Finally, this past Wednesday I got a call from an old employer I used to intern for. I interned for my hometown's legal department for two summers and it was fine, nothing too crazy. I applied as a paralegal while I was unemployed and they finally got back to me. I told him I was not interested in working as a paralegal but instead I had a creative solution: promote me to an additional attorney in the office for the same pay and benefits, doing the same paralegal responsibilities while also taking on some additional responsibilities in the capacity of an attorney. He was intrigued and would run it by HR and our mayor. It really seems like it is going to happen and the job is set hours, one client, $65k/year, benefits, sick and vacation time (which I did not get at the court), student loan forgiveness, and a clear path to promotion where I could make close to or over six-figures. My problem is I've only worked two months. My boss would be furious no doubt and in fact told me when I started that if I left early then I would be destroying my legal reputation but I am skeptical.

So please, anyone, give me your two-cents, kind or mean, idc. Just tell me what you think.

Thank you!"

i went to college and graduated with a decent gpa in may. i've done several internships. i had a temporary job making calls to voters up until election day (trying to get out the vote). i moved out of the apartment i shared with my ex. 


then he broke in to the new apartment. he stabbed my new partner. we convinced him to leave. my ex committed suicide.  


new partner is taking time off work and school to recover. i moved in with my brother to get away from everything that happened. i feel like i was so close to happiness and independence, and now it's all so far away.


brother is trying to get me into a routine and healthy lifestyle. i've been on antidepressants for years and was trying to get off of them. he and my father both pressure me, saying that antidepressants should not be a long term solution and i shouldn't rely on them and i need to be wary of any ""side effects."" i hate being guilted for this. 


so, to try to work on my mental health, i've seen therapists and psychiatrists. i was inpatient at a behavioral healthcare center in the past. i have taken different medications. last week, brother and i started exercising together - at least an hour each morning of calisthenics, yoga, running, hiking, or whatever combination thereof. i've been going to bed around 9-11pm and waking up at 6:45am each morning. 


we are eating nutritious food. i'm trying to drink more water. i'm still tired and miserable. i feel like i don't have enough time or energy to do anything. it all feels impossible. platitudes like ""one thing at a time"" don't help either.


by the generosity of my parents, i have the funds to find somewhere else to stay on my own, but my brother is also trying to teach me financial management (being frugal). i've also been calling my parents daily, another necessary evil made more stressful by their incessant advice (how to exercise properly and get a job). i can't get away from my family. i know they mean well but i feel like i'm suffocating, and if i say anything then i'm a stupid, ungrateful child. 


finding jobs feel hopeless, and therefore so does everything else. i want a job so they can get off my back. i want to move out and buy nice things, like reusable produce bags and a laundry basket. my dad promised that when i get a job and new place to live, he will ship my car and desktop computer over to me. i am very grateful for this, but stressed and feel like a future job is a pipe dream. 


i performed really well at my past job. they promoted me. but now that the election is over, so is their election-based funding. and they hinted at the possibility for a full-time position, but that has been postponed to ""maybe january or february."" now, all i'm getting are emails saying that positions have ""closed temporarily"" or that i'm not moving on to the next round. 


nothing works. i don't have enough time or energy. i just want to cry, sleep, disappear. "

So to provide a bit of background, I received a return offer from the company I interned at this past summer as well as an offer to work for them full time after I graduate. They will be sponsoring me for a Top Secret clearance. I will be filling out the clearance paper in the next couple of days. The big problem is that I am worried I will be denied as I have an extensive history of drug use and have smoked cannabis as recently as four months ago. I talked to the company’s FSO (security clearance person) and she said I should be fine and to go ahead and fill out the paperwork. 

Well today, I received another internship offer from another government contractor that seems to do some cool stuff and who I really enjoyed interviewing with. They have actually sent a pre-screen for the security clearance process to see if I’d even be eligible, but I don’t believe they require Top Secret and I know the lower level clearances are a bit less strict on past drug use. 

My question is this: if I accept the second offer just as a backup plan in case my top secret clearance gets denied, will that acceptance show up during the investigation for my top secret clearance? Also, I’d love just some general advice on the best way to handle this situation.

Thanks!"

I also found a good SWE internship for the summer which Ive worked so hard for to get this  opportunity, but now after I achieved my goal I'm starting to question what I truly enjoy.

I am currently a senior here at UMD that has gotten some internship offers from reputable tech companies like Snap and Uber. To me, this feels like success and it's something that I've worked hard to do, and as a result I feel that I want to give back to the community where I've grown as a young professional. As a result I wanted to post here and say that I'm willing to mentor (no fees, completely free, no strings attached) 2 CS students at UMD that are interested in working as Software Engineers, and want to get internships at reputable tech companies next year.

If you are interested in this send me a DM with the following info.

1. What year are you and when you are graduating
2. Email
3. What CS classes have you taken
4. Tell me a bit about your background (The reason why I ask for this is because I'd much rather help someone that comes from a less favored background that maybe can't afford things like Leetcode Premium or AlgoExpert, and has had a more difficult path to get to where he/she is now. Please keep it relatively short).

I'll be responding to DM's and keep track of this until December 1st. Ideally, I'd like to work with you during winter break and help sharpen those interviewing and algorithm skills that helped me get the offers I got. We would also work on these during next semester and during summer as well.

Clarification: I am not guaranteeing that you will get an internship, but I'll surely try my best to help you pass these interviews"
k0k9hr,1,2020-11-24,"I will grow space plants, GORSH DARNIT!!!!",chemIStrym3,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k0k9hr/i_will_grow_space_plants_gorsh_darnit/,"  

Hey Reddit!!! 

Where to begin… Please hang in there with me, I could really use some tuition advise. 

My parents forced me to go to college right after high school. I did not feel like I was ready to go, but my parents said they would pay if I graduated. Well, I graduated with my bachelors in 2012 but they refuse to pay for any of it. Actually, they took student loans out in my name to keep for themselves. I came to terms with that and its fine. I am not here to talk about them. 

But… actually, it’s not fine anymore.

Little did I know, I had undiagnosed sever ADHD and dyslexia. School was incredibly hard for me because I couldn’t learn like everyone else and it made me feel very dumb. Because of that, I never felt I was very capable of much of anything. Not until this diagnosis changed everything. 

I bought a house and learned that I am a tinker-er. I am madly passionate about fixing/improving things and figuring out how to build stuff. I love thinking and imagining. Its hard to think outside of a box you were never in to begin with. My ideas got to the point where the things I wanted to make surpassed the knowledge I had to follow through. My brain was mega thirsty.  That’s when the insane idea of going back to school for engineering happened. 

My “family” was very against this. To this day, they still refuse to acknowledge that ADHD and dyslexia are real learning disabilities; let alone that their daughter is affected by them. My job laughed at me when I told them what I was going to do, too. None of it mattered though. The fire was already lit. 

I started this dream in August 2018 when I was finally diagnosed with sever dyslexia and ADHD and so many worlds opened. After getting my diagnosis, I was finally able to get accommodations from the university to help with my weird brain things. Nowadays, I am enrolled as a chemical engineering student!!! Next semester I will be interviewing for my very first internship as a chemical engineer!!!!AAHHH!!! I have never done so well in school in my entire life and I honestly couldn’t be prouder of myself!!!

However, this brings me to why I am posting on Reddit. 

Because I am a graduate, I do not qualify for any scholarships. The scholarships I have found require a GPA that I cannot attain due to my GPA from my previous degree. It’s not terrible. I learned a foreign language with undiagnosed sever dyslexia and ADHD. Give me a break. 

That was all fine because I concluded that if my parents put me into debt over a degree I didn’t want, I will go into infinity debt to get this degree just for myself. I will literally do anything to see this dream all the way through. I need to grow space plants!!!!

Everything was fine until I became ineligible for federal student loans. Apparently, I hit the maximum available.

\*\*Which, when I researched student loan maximums, I shouldn’t be anywhere near capping out. But, that’s what the man is telling me, man\*\*. 

So, I appealed for an extension of the maximum amount allowed and my appeal was approved! But of course, they are only going to give me 1,000$ a semester for an 8000$ tuition bill. 

Here is where I need help.

I quit my job about a year ago because school got too hard and I had to choose between a lifetime of retail or engineering. I thought going to school for engineering was crazy. Heh. Quitting my stable long term job, took the insane bacon prize home. It was cool though. I had everything planned out. This lack of federal student loans really threw me to the birds, and now I’m kind of stuck. 

I have applied for every private student loan company under the sun. SallieMae, Discover…, anyone/everyone I could get my hands on. I have been denied by every single one. …Oh wait, just kidding!! I am totes eligible with a ‘credit worthy co-signer!!’ …I can’t tell you how much it guts me when I see that. I wish I had a co-signer but I cannot have any sort of relationship with my family. They’re not very nice people. Not only that, I want to do this on my own. I owe it to myself. 

I tried to refinance my home. My property has nearly doubled in value, plus I’ve been paying into it for 5 years already. Everything would have been easily taken care of until I graduate if I could refinance. But! Oh! Did you know! You can’t refinance a mortgage if you’re unemployed? I mean, makes sense but ugh. Had I known; I would have refinanced last year before I quit. 

A friend of mine works for a mortgage company and said she would try to help me if I got a job. I totally applied for a job, totally got the job but was totally denied by the bank for refinancing. 

I kick myself every day for not refinancing but, I couldn’t foresee getting cut off like this. I even checked into this exact scenario and sources told me everything was ok.

My adult bill situation is taken care of for the time being. I have been living off savings and have enough to make it until I start my internship. Just not enough for living and covering 16k-ish of tuition =\[.  I can’t start my internship next fall if I don’t go to school this spring and summer. I am so close. So. So. Close.  

Whew. I am sorry. I know that was a lot. A big heartfelt thank you reading all the way through. It means a lot to me because this degree means the world to me. 

I need help thinking of solutions. 

I have folded my brain over and over trying to find a solution on how to pay for tuition. Any insight/ ideas/ handy-dandy hints you’d be willing to throw my way would be greatly appreciated!!!! I know things will work out; I’m just not sure how yet. 

Thank you!!!

I am currently a CS undergrad, seeking internships this next summer 2021. I’ve been going through the interview process and I have been preparing/ researching multiple coding/interview questions. 

One of the questions I am having a hard time with, is the question stated in the title. “If given more time, how would you improve your code?” This would be asked asked completing a coding question, and I guess I am unsure what the desired answer interviews are looking for?

For example, let’s say I’m given a leetcode (easy) question with few optimal ways of solving, how would I turn this question into a 2 minute response of improvement? Or rather, what is the interviewer looking for in my response? I’ve thought of expressing things like refactoring code, implementing different methods to improve runtime, but I’m not quite sure how to drag a response like that out for 2 minutes or more. If anyone would want to provide maybe a wider approach to this question, and what general methods of improvements could fit within any type of coding question like this, I would greatly appreciate it!"

I never heard of the company before applying, and their seems to be little word about the company online.

Any help would be very appreciated.  


Also in general, what makes an internship in IB good? In EE, a good internship would be a top tech company (any F500) which gives you a full-scale project which you can leverage creativity with so you can have a relevant section in your resume (I.E. as a computer vision focus student, I worked for Cisco on creating a next gen tele-communicating platform).

Im sorry if this is against rules or something but idk where else to ask this and it seems like ppl here would be able to help me out.

How does one actually get an internship?

I'm a 3rd year computer science major at a mid tier UC school, however I will probably graduate in December 2021,  and I've never had an internship before. I am getting pretty stressed because if I don't get an internship before graduating, I will definitely not be able to get a job. I have pretty good skills in my opinion, I have completed a few coding projects personally, and with other people as well, so I know common technologies used in the field so far.

Last year I applied pretty vigorously however I had 0 luck getting an interview or any follow up regarding a position.

This year I have applied to over 60 companies, and so far I have gotten 3 rejections and 2 follow ups for a coding challenge. Its been over a month since I applied to a lot of these places, how long does it usually take to get some sort of response? I really am scared to be waiting 3 months from now and I don't have even a single interview.

I really feel like I'm missing something, what can I do to improve my chances? It really puts me down to see other people getting multiple interviews and offers, and not to sound rash or disrespectful, as my classmates and friends, I can definitely say I could be much more qualified in a lot of cases, since I know them and have worked on them for school/projects.

Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

Becasue i was only able to find an adapter for MacBooks when i searched for ""NVMe m.2 to SATA m.2 adapter"". Is it worth buying the adapter or selling the SSD and getting a compatible one instead?"

k0rwju,8,2020-11-25,Dropped out of University because of depression/anxiety and now want to go back,uniDepression,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/k0rwju/dropped_out_of_university_because_of/,"Hello everyone.

I am 22 and studied CS for 2 years before I dropped out because I felt like shit. No one knows I dropped out because I told them I was looking for a internship but that was just a lie. Fast forward to this year I was suppose to enroll back on the course for my 3rd and final year.

But... I lied to my parents again. I'm currently living near the Uni and haven't enrolled back on the course because I'm scared that I will be rejected.

I know the 2 modules that I have to do (web design/api) this semester and the due in dates is on the 7th/11th Dec. I already have experience with frontend/backend which hopefully will allow me to get a 60 - 70% (A/First) in the little time I may have. This semester ends on the 17th Dec.

I just don't know what to do know. I'm currently in my room doing nothing and spending all my time on YT/Movies and really depressed thanks to the lockdown rules and thinking of all the people that have been laid off as a result. I cry on most days and think about suicide as an alternative way out of this mess.

I really want to finish this degree and then study masters (machine learning) next year but fear it's going to be too late.

Please help me."

After graduation I am planning on trying to find an entry level job in my area or possibly moving out of state (which isn’t a problem for me). I know many people who enter a GIS field start with becoming a technician (which I am learning is a lot of imputing data and less exciting stuff). It would be nice to start working as an analyst after college but I am not sure how realistic that would be, especially since the many GIS jobs require a lot of experience. 

I would have 6 months of experience from this internship as well as a Geospatial Information Science Major with a minor in Computer Science (which would help with things like learning programming tools like python or C+)."

So I got a degree and landed a new grad offer. It was also a personal life milestone of mine to finish some sort of degree.

But the longer I work, the more useless my degree seems to have been. The many years of intense studying have certainly changed me as a person and I can confidently say that I learn and solve problems faster because of it but ngl I feel jealous of others who skipped the degree entirely and landed the same position with under 1 year of prep.

There's no chance I could have landed my current offer nor my first internship without a degree but I sometimes wonder if I could have at least broke into the field without one had I searched longer."

I have been have no luck with internships that are labeled for engineering I was wondering what jobs/internships are similar to engineering in a way that would give me certain skills that overlap in engineering. 

Not sure if I’m making any sense but hopefully someone understands what I’m getting at.

I'm currently on an internship in my home country and I have 1.5 years before I graduate.

I've been applying through LinkedIn easy apply so mostly been getting generic rejections. The few that weren't generic, they stated lack of experience and being non-eu killed my chances.

However, I got an interview scheduled with a UK based company. I'm so excited yet nervous because I really don't know what to expect. The invite didn't state if it's going to be a technical interview.

This XLOOKUP should then be accessible as a macro (to apply it to a certain row) for time-saving purposes. Important here: This master excel file shall, after establishment, only be accessible to management and it won't be open. So the 30 people would need to access information of a closed file. clicking the macro.

How can I approach this problem? It would be great to find a solution using VBA and a solution using Python"

My other class is a semester-long group project recreating a server topology from some hacking event from 2019.

Did my internship as a web developer in 2018 before all this started and I've got a few job prospects post-graduation and I'm making decent money freelancing websites.   


Maybe IT is one of those majors that naturally convert to online courses easily since every professor is very computer savvy, but this semester has been pretty nice especially for the last semester where I'm beginning to grow tired of university.   


Anyone else enjoying this semester?"
k0u8hm,1,2020-11-25,How to narrow down CS specialization?,Akter8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k0u8hm/how_to_narrow_down_cs_specialization/,"As the post title suggests, I need help figuring out how to figure out what I would like to pursue my masters degree in.

I am CS undergrad  senior in a top university in India. I have a good GPA (3.85 on WES conversion to 4.0 scale). I have had two industry summer internships, one of which was at Amazon, where I even received a return full-time offer. I also have a 6 month research internship (at Bosch R&amp;D center where I will be working on NLP) lined up for my final semester starting in January '21.

I have a couple of projects in the field of AI and a few more in the field of Systems. I have completed a graduate level real-time systems course and pursued a project on mixed-criticality real-time systems which I kind of enjoyed. I am also currently working on my undergraduate thesis on optimization of sequence models.

As you can see from the previous paragraph, I have done a bit of each field that I am interested in - ML/AI and Systems. But I do not know which one I would like to continue with. I really like both and have thoroughly enjoyed my courses as well as projects in these fields.

I really want to pursue a master's degree and learn advanced concepts. I realise that a bachelor's degree is really just a small exposure to the research happening in the 21st century and would love to gain a solid understanding of advanced concepts in CS.

To some extent I am swayed by the hype that ML has, but I do realise that a lot of ML is overhyped. There is also the pressure from parents and family to take up ML as a specialization (read intro, I am from India lol) as they have been susceptible to this hype. 

To some degree, I want to pursue the MS in Systems as I understand that it's very competitive in the ML market, but at the same time I hear there are not many jobs in the first place. And, I do not know if I am ready to spend 80k+ USD on a master's degree in Systems that's just going to fetch me a SDE job, which I already have (comparing to ML, which opens up a new job track - Data science and ML engineering roles which also pay more.)


What should I do? People usually advice students to try out different fields with a couple of projects, and that should help narrow down interests. But, in my case, I have narrowed it down to two, but I am unable to narrow it down further.

1. Am I right in assuming that a Systems specialization mostly leads to a SDE role?
2. Should I spend some time working in the industry? Is that going to help me get a better picture and maybe help consolidate what I would like to pursue?
3. Is the ML job market too saturated? With all the flamboyant work going to seniors with PhDs while the juniors are left with crappy work?
4. It's common knowledge that ML seems to be the more open one of the two. Open in the sense that it's accessible to people from non-CS backgrounds and hence the higher competition. Is this something that I should keep in mind while choosing? Would the Systems MS provide enough of a niche to be an advantage over MS in ML?
5. Any other suggestions? Am I missing or overlooking anything? Or am I giving more weightage than required to anything I have stated?

Thank you for your time and patience."

k0ux9a,1,2020-11-25,Data Science in Telecommunications or SE in Consulting for an internship,TradeRepublicHR,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/k0ux9a/data_science_in_telecommunications_or_se_in/,"I'm currently deciding between these two internships. 

I can really see myself specializing in Data Science. But I'm not sure if a Telecomm company is the best fit right now. There was just a single person conducting the interview, it only lasted 30min and the tech questions were simple (eg. explain random forest, supervised vs. unsupervised learning). So I'm not sure how challenging the work there will be.

Then I got an offer from a large consulting firm as in software engineering. The interviewers seemed very professional and I fancy working on different projects/technologies with different clients. However I won't be able to dig deep into the science of computer science, since most projects are implementation of client ideas, sometimes even coding front ends.

What would you do as a young guy with a [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). in Computer Science, pursing a Masters in the future?

k0x6g8,34,2020-11-25,Landed first internship as a 4th year with 2.5 GPA,PandasBambooFez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k0x6g8/landed_first_internship_as_a_4th_year_with_25_gpa/,"Hey all, I’m a 4th year CS major at a well known, but not particularly prestigious, university in the United States. Given that I performed very poorly in school my first couple of years, my GPA is far below the typical threshold that companies require to even look at my resume. Last year I even interviewed at a family friend’s company and when they found out my GPA they said they simply couldn’t hire me, just on the basis that my GPA was so bad.

Well, last night this all changed when I got an offer email for the first time ever. The position is at a very well known company, although I don’t think I am going to share which one. 

I applied to hundreds of positions all over the country, and I’ve only ever been given the opportunity to interview with 3 of them. 

I guess the whole point of me sharing this is that if you have made mistakes in your college career, but you have some good personal projects and a decent resume, you can still have access to great opportunities.

Your GPA does not define you as a person, nor does it determine your worth as a human being. 

(Just as a sidenote: I’m able to get an internship as a 4th year because I don’t graduate until next December)

Thanks for taking the time to read, I’m really excited about the opportunity and I celebrated with my family last night :)

TLDR; 2.5 GPA, bad student first 2 years, finally get internship after hundreds of applications that never gave me a chance."

k0xdfd,817,2020-11-25,I'm a top executive at an international burger franchise. You don't want to know what you've been eating.,Jgrupe,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/k0xdfd/im_a_top_executive_at_an_international_burger/,"You probably know the burger franchise I work for.  You’ve likely eaten there before, as have most of the people you know.  We’re international, and these days much of our growth comes from franchises popping up in different countries around the world.  

I never knew why the burgers tasted so unique, but I’ll admit, I suspected there was something wrong.  Not for any one reason in particular, there were mostly just a lot of little things.  

The way our CEO smiled, for example, when he said in our board meetings that the hamburgers were 100% beef, no added fillers or other ingredients.  A few of the other executives shared knowing smiles with him and I couldn’t help but ponder to myself, how could that be possible at our prices? 

I didn’t want to look into it, I’ll admit that now.  

I have a sweet gig here, and a nice, comfortable life.  I’ve been with the company so long and I’ve been promoted so many times that I have developed a cabal of underlings and yes-men who do all of my work for me.  Assistants and secretaries, interns and protégés, they do whatever I tell them to, and thank me for the privilege.  I can literally sit in my office all day, watch Netflix while sitting in the most comfortable reclining desk chair imaginable, and make obscene amounts of money while doing it.  

But that can get boring after a while.  And I decided to get out of the office for a day.

I was in one particular plant, our largest, doing an impromptu walkabout.  It’s not something I’ve done in many years, but with my clearance level nobody was going to say anything.  I went through the motions, not really looking for anything in particular.  I was just trying to get out of my office for a little while, go back to my roots.  I had started off in a meat-processing plant very similar to that one, so going back there was bit nostalgic for me.  

The folks at the plant were astonished to see me there, since they recognized my name as one of the top executives.  That’s one of the perks of being upper management.  You don’t have to explain your presence to people.  You don’t have to phone ahead or make appointments.  You can just show up unannounced and they’ll be delighted to see you.    

When I asked to see the meat, what was going in before processing, the plant manager gave a skeptical look. 

“Meat?”  

“Yeah, you know.  One hundred percent beef, right?”  With our masks on it was impossible for him to read my expression.  He probably thought that I was giving him a knowing smile, like the ones worn by the few executives in the board meetings who knew the truth.  

He began to laugh hesitantly.  I followed suit, trying not to play my cards too soon.  I was curious to learn the truth, in retrospect.  He broke into a hearty laugh and I joined in.  

“A hundred percent beef!  Yeah, right.  That’s so classic.  Alright come on I’ll show you to the pit.”

He began to walk towards the other end of the plant and I followed.  There was an elevator that brought us down to a sub-basement ten floors below ground level.  We got off there and began to walk down a corridor that extended the length of several football fields.  It took me a while to realize that the walls were very subtly curved, as if we were walking around a massive circle, like a particle accelerator the size of a city.  

After walking for what felt like hours, we arrived at a locked door with a keypad.  He punched in a number which revealed another hidden access panel.  The man swiped his card, did a quick retina scan, and used his thumbprint to unlock the door, which opened with a hiss. 

We went inside and I was amazed and subsequently horrified at what I saw.  

There was a dark pit below us that was immense and stretched on for a great distance.  It was like a great canyon made of what appeared to be concrete, hidden beneath the earth.  

Inside the pit were innumerable dead bodies, in varying states of decomposition, as far as the eye could see. 

The smell was horrendous, like nothing I had experienced before – acrid and eye-watering in its awfulness.  There was a sound as well, a steady droning buzz.   

The man pulled down his facemask.  Below his nose, his face was not human.  I realized this was not a man standing before me.    

I saw that the top half of his face was just a well-constructed mask.  His real skin below that was like that of a lizard, scaly and green.  When he spoke, I saw that his teeth were small and numerous, sharp and pointed.  

“We’ve made pretty good progress this week.  You know how it is, though.  They’re pretty paranoid these days.  It’s getting harder and harder to lure them out.  They like to stay inside where it’s comfortable.  Our Tinder accounts still bring in a steady supply, but the UBER drivers are telling us they can’t get away with stuff like they used to with these new safety programs in effect.  Regardless, we’re still managing to skim a lot of net product.”

He then wanted to show me things down below, and I followed, trying to conceal my mounting horror.  We were being invaded.  And they were slowly killing off the population and feeding our own species’ dead to the rest of us.  Or so I thought. 

As we got down to the lower levels I came to realize what the burgers are really made of. 

“Perfect timing!” he said, and I watched through the viewing windows to our right as the floor holding all of the dead bodies rose up, revealing a grate beneath.  The entire thing began to shake back and forth, quickly.  

For a second, I thought to myself, *is it snowing in there?*  But then I realized what was falling from the steel grate above.  What was raining down from the massive pile of dead bodies.  Maggots.  Millions upon millions of maggots.  

They fell down and I realized suddenly what the subtle buzzing noise was that I had been hearing since we had entered the huge space.  It was flies.  A horde of them, innumerable.  The blood and guts and decomposing flesh of the people above leaked through the grate as well, raining down and colouring the maggots red where they writhed on the steel floor that extended for as far as the eye could see in every direction.  

“We’ll let this batch dry out under the heat lamps for a while, then it’ll go up for further refinement and seasoning.  You know, the usual.”  He started on with some small talk and I tried to maintain my composure and not vomit.  It was difficult.  The smell was becoming very overpowering.  The whole shaking a bunch of dead bodies and stirring them up, knocking their decomposing bits loose, really didn’t make matters any better.  

Eventually he led me out of the pit and back up to the entrance.  I was so grateful to get out of there I could have hugged him, had I not been so terrified of what he really was.  

I really wish I could tell you which burger chain I work for.  But if I do, I’m pretty sure they’ll figure out who I am.  I’m already getting nervous that they know I found out the truth.  

Yesterday in the board meeting, the CEO made one of his little jokes about the beef again, and a few more executives joined in with knowing laughter.  

I’m starting to think I might be one of the only ones left.  

Does anybody know any good vegetarian recipes?

k0ze86,163,2020-11-25,Highest Paying Tech Companies for New Grad,DroppingTheBigLoo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/k0ze86/highest_paying_tech_companies_for_new_grad/,"I go to a target school in Canada (you can probably guess) and have collected some information from my friends who got new grad offers at top tech companies this year. There's obviously much more to a company than just pay but since offers can be confusing, I hope this post helps.

**Primer about tech new grad offers** (skip to below to see the Top Companies)

Most tech offers have several components

* *Base Salary*: This is standard and non-negotiable for most companies. Based entirely on level.
* *Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)*: You are given shares in the company over a certain number of years (typically 4 years). # Stocks you get = Target Lump Sum / Stock Price. Say, target is $150k and stock price is $50, then you get 150k/50 = 3,000 shares in the company. Generally that's how it goes. What differs between companies is WHEN the company calculates the # shares you get. Some companies determine shares when you sign the offer. Some determine it right before you join. EARLIER THE BETTER because generally stock prices grow over time, so getting your # shares calculated based on earlier and lower stock prices is advantageous.
* *Signing Bonus*: This is a one time bonus paid generally in your first year of work.

Example of new grad offer quote: 120/160/30 = $120k base, $160k stock/4 years, $30k signing. In first year you get paid 120 base + 40k stock (assuming prices stay constant) + 30k signing = 190k.

Other pay considerations:

* *Performance Bonus*: This is usually a % of your Base Salary that you get based on your performance during the year. Usually it's only 10-15% of base so pretty negligible when comparing new grad offers. It's also not guaranteed components of offers.
* *Refreshers:* This is a HUGE component that is neglected to be compared between offers. Typically, each year you get additional RSUs based on performance. It incentivizes you to stay at the company. This is NOT factored into offer. Do your research into typical refreshers in companies.
* *Promotion/Growth:* The rate at which companies promote employees also important. For example, Microsoft new grad offers are high but growth is known to be really slow. Faster growth = base salary bumps and higher performance bonus + refreshers.
* *Future Stock Growth:* If the stock price grows, your RSUs are worth more. Unfortunately, no one knows what the future stock price of a company will exactly be. Though, you can roughly gauge the growth opportunity for a company. Established FAANGs will generally have lower growth than Unicorn and earlier stage companies.
* *Private vs Public Companies:* Public companies like Google, Apple, etc. allow you to sell shares on stock market as soon as you get your RSUs. This term is called *liquidity*. This is good because you can convert your shares to cash and spend it on whatever you want or invest it. It is hard to sell your shares in a private company like Robinhood, Airbnb and is actually often not allowed because of lockup policies that prevent you from selling until a mass secondary offering in the private market or IPO. So HOW DO PRIVATE COMPANIES DETERMINE THEIR SHARE PRICE? Usually, private companies will determine share price based on latest VC funding round. That means your share price is not always up to date. Hence, people call it ""paper money"" since share price is often hard to determine and you can't sell it right away. The stock growth and payout opportunity is higher though.

**Top Paying Tech Companies**

NOTE: The placings are only rough and NOT exact by any means for reasons I mentioned above (RSU price variations, bonus and refreshers are not accounted for, etc.)

1 . **Databricks** : 135k Base Salary, $400k Stock over 4 years ($100k/Year), 15k Signing

First Year TC: $250k Recurring TC: $235K

* Comments - $400k based on $10 billion company valuation or $73 per share based on latest offer on Teamblind.  5500 RSUs were given straight up in the offer (It's one of the few companies that do this). RSUs are high because # shares were calculated originally using 2019 valuation which was \~$45/Stock . The $10B is still a very unvalued number since Snowflake is valued at $90B currently post-IPO. Databricks will IPO soon.

2 . **Lyft :** 135k Base Salary, $260k Stock over 4 years ($65k/year), 45k Signing

First Year TC: $245k Recurring TC: $200K

* Comments - This is a return intern offer and I believe TC is quite a bit lower for non-interns. Compared to other top payers listed here (like Databricks, Stripe, Robinhood Roblox), Lyft has much lower stock growth opportunity. The stock has flopped since the IPO in 2019 but is recovering a bit.

3 . **Stripe :** 133k Base Salary, $270k Stock over 4 years ($ 67.5/year), 50k Signing

First Year TC: $250K Recurring TC: $200k

* Comments - This is a return intern offer (will be alot lower for non-interns). Stripe implemented a new RSU policy this year which stipulates that # of Shares you get is determined using current prices each year. Basically, you can think of the $270k Stock as just cash bonus. That means you miss out on any stock growth prior to receiving your stock compensation. Lyft does something similar. I placed Stripe and Lyft below Databricks which gives you # RSUs at time of offer. ""Earlier the better"". Stripe will IPO soon too.

4 . **Robinhood** : 135k Base Salary, 216k Stock over 4 years ($54k/year), 35k Signing

First Year TC: $224k Recurring TC: $189k

* Comments - IPO soon

5 . **Roblox :** 142k Base Salary, 200k Stock over 4 years ($50k/year), 30k Signing

First Year TC: $222k Recurring TC: $192k

* Comments - IPO soon. 8000 shares are offered up front valued at $25.

6 . **Facebook** : 118k Base Salary, $160K Stock over 4 Years ($40k/Year), 70k Signing

First Year TC: $227k Recurring TC: $158k

* Comments - Notice that recurring TC drops off due to one-time signing bonus. This is the ""meets expectation"" offer for returning interns. If ur not returning intern, expect lower signing bonus. If u exceeds expectations as an intern, expect more stock, up to \~$220K stock for rockstar/greatly exceeds expectations. Signing bonus also goes up to 100k if you negotiate hard or get rockstar. Also, # RSUs is determined 1 month prior to start date.

7 . **Asana :** 144k Base Salary, $192k Stock over 4 years ($48/Year), 20k Signing

First Year TC $212k Recurring TC: $192K

* Comments - NA

8 . **LinkedIn** : 135k Base Salary, $200k Stock over 4 years ($50k/Year), 15k Signing

First Year TC: $200k Recurring TC: $185k

* Comments - This was offer from while back. Not sure if up to date but it should be around same now.

9 . **Snapchat** : 125k Base Salary, $159K Stock over 3 years ($53K/Year), 20k Signing

First Year TC: $198k Recurring TC: 178K

* Comments - SNAP Stock has doubled since the summer of 2020 when offers were given. Unfortunately, the # of RSUs is determined 1 month prior to joining so gains are missed out and cannot be factored into the RSU valuation

10 . **DoorDash :** 135k Base Salary, $176k Stock over 4 years($44k/Year), 20k Signing

First Year TC: $199k Recurring TC: $179k

* Comments - IPO Soon

11 . **Pinterest** : 135k Base Salary, $160k Stock over 4 years ($40k/Year), 15k Signing

First Year TC: $190k Recurring TC: $175k

* Comments - this data point was relayed from a friend of a friend so not sure how correct but it's similar to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi). Generally Pinterest pays top as well.

12 . **Google :** 129k Base Salary,  $160K Stock over 4 years ($40k/Year), 15k Signing

First Year TC: $184K Recurring TC: $169K

* Comments - Google offers VARY WIDELY. This offer my friend got is above average I believe. Returning interns do not automatically get higher pay. Google often lowballs. Though, with competing offers you can negotiate and they will go as high as Facebook's rockstar intern offer.

**Others**: I probably missed few companies like **Airbnb** (which I don't know of anyone getting an offer from personally). Other top paying companies include: **Plaid** (\~190K TC first year), **Palantir** (\~185 TC first year) **Twitter**, **Dropbox,** **Coinbase** (RSUs are offered based on 2018 valuation), **Atlassian, Microsoft** (if you negotiate with an FB offer), **Quora.** Finally I'm sure there are small tech **startups** out there, that could potentially pay more than all of these companies because of the growth potential of the RSU/equity.

Online Resources:

* [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) Shows average compensation for companies at different levels. Great resource but unfortunately does not show details such as differences between RSU policies and other nuances that could make huge difference.
* [Teamblind.com](https://Teamblind.com) Best place/forum to see actual offer details. Bit of a toxic website but it's single best place to get in depth info."

k10h6h,310,2020-11-25,Addressing misconceptions: Whether should I SU,lwcyfr,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/k10h6h/addressing_misconceptions_whether_should_i_su/,"One very common view I've heard in my early undergraduate years when considering whether to SU or not was that ""SU makes your CAP very volatile since it reduces the base."" While I could see that in the short term, it can make your CAP fluctuate quite wildly - I was still not convinced so I [ran a bit of numbers shown here](https://imgur.com/vgTMIWD) (Note: the numbers refer to the final impact on your graduating GPA). So what I found was that **in the long run - SU don't matter to your overall grade - on average, if you used it right, it will pull up your graduation CAP about 0.005-0.02 per module SU'd.** Even in the best case scenario where you SU a single C+ when you are a 5.0 GPA student, it will only pull up your grades by 0.06. On the flip side, if you wrongly SU'd your module that could have pulled you up and your long run CAP is lower, it will only reduce your grades by average 0.005-0.015 per wrong decision when graduating. I'll be explaining how the GPA works for new/incoming students so feel free to skip if you are already familiar.

For incoming students / freshies, each letter grade (A+,A, A-, B+...) is given a point from 5.0 for A+,A and 4.5 for A-, 4.0 for B+ and so on. Every module you take has a MC (""Modular Credit"") given, usually 4 MC for typical modules in a semester. (Although there are special modules that may be shorter and give 2MC, or FYP/Internship modules that give 8MC etc.)

So to calculate your GPA =  \[Sum of all module's (Letter grade points \* MC for that module)\] ÷ (All graded MC taken; excluding CS/CU, SU'd modules). For example, if you scored A+ (5.0), A- (4.5), A- (4.5), B+ (4.0), B (3.5), each with 4MC, then your GPA will be \[ (5.0\*4) + (4.5\*4) + (4.5\*4) + (4\*4) + (3.5\*4) \] ÷ 20 = 4.3.

Let's say you are a freshman, with the above grades for Y1S2. Your Y1S1 GPA is 4.40 and you used no SU (So 20 MC taken in semester 1). Your current GPA will be \[ (Old GPA \* total graded MC in the past) + sum of this semester's (Letter grade points \* MC for that module) \] ÷ All graded MC taken.

Y1S2 GPA = \[ 4.40 \* 20 +  (5.0\*4) + (4.5\*4) + (4.5\*4) + (4\*4) + (3.5\*4) \] ÷ 40 = 4.35.

Right, the key question - when do I use my SU? The simple answer that everyone tells you if that if your grade &lt; expected grades etc., but of course, that's not a very satisfying answer because your expected grade is uncertain and you are only in your first year - how do you know what is your expected grade??

Instead, **ask yourself if there were any special circumstances that led you to do badly this semester?** Did you over extended and joined tad too many hall CCA, IFG trainings, part-time jobs, orientation week committee, overloaded, crazy module workload than average, poor mental well-being, incompetent professor, slack team mates that caused you to do worse than usual? Or did you put in effort without the above distractions and still got the same grades. If it's the former, I highly recommend using your SU because you are likely to do better in the future without these distraction (as long you learn not to over-reach again). If it's the latter, then you might have to consider how much do you think your effort will slip in the coming semesters. But worry not, even if you made the highly unrealistic wrong decision of SU-ing A- when you are a 3.8 GPA student, it will only drag down your grades by 0.018 by graduation. (Refer to above image to visualize the impact of SUing a particular grade for different expected grades)

Now that we have established that SU don't matter that much in the long run, now let's address the common argument that SU increases your volatility in the short term. Yes it does. But the question is - is volatility really that bad? **SU artificially inflates your GPA at the start** (Note that this is an objective statement, it's neither good nor bad - just a side effect if you SU your below average grades - you wouldn't SU a A- (4.5) if that pulls you down right). We know that the true impact of SU at graduation is about 0.01-ish per module. Yet when you SU in the first semester, you can pull up your grades maybe by 0.1 to 0.3 depending on how aggressive you decide to SU. Of course, this is all temporarily and your grades would converge back to the expected grade in the long run.

People who preach to avoid SU because it will make it more volatile, think that the **large fall in GPA** in the future is bad when **in reality, it will happen regardless if you SU or not.** Your grades will still converge to the expected GPA ± 0.05 depending on your SU strategy.

The short-term inflation of your GPA could actually be a good thing - You can make use of it to apply to internships, academic programs, apply for SEP etc. in your early years, before the eventual fall of your grades which would happen anyway. If you chose not to SU, you will just be realizing that expected grade sooner than later - so **why not make use of the temporarily inflation to open more window of opportunities early on?**

Once you secure that first internship, or a program, then you can use that internship experience to open up other opportunities. By the time your true GPA falls and converges to the long-run average, you would have a myriad of experience under your belt that your GPA don't matter anymore.

Tl;dr

* SU actually matter very little especially at graduation - Expect about 0.005-0.02 increase in graduation GPA per module SU'd.
* Strongly recommend SU if there were special circumstances that led you to do badly this semester.
* Short term volatility argument that many people preach is actually a good thing because it artificially inflates your GPA to open up more opportunities temporarily. Your GPA will eventually converge to your long-term average, so why not make use of the temp chance to secure an internship, or an academic program?
* To put things into perspective: If you SU'd a A- (4.5) by mistake in Y1S1 and your final grade was 4.2, don't be too upset; it's not the end of the world. Because if you hadn't SU that A-, your final GPA will be 4.208 or 4.21 after rounding; barely a dent.
* Heck, even if you SU'd 5 A- when your actual expected GPA turn out to be 4.2, and somehow reversed the 5 misjudged SU declarations, it will only increase your GPA to 4.2375 or 4.24 rounded. Same result even if you narrowed your base of total graded MC by going SEP/NOC (4.243 rounded to 4.24).
* And echoing what u/anotherjx said below on why there's no need to SU A- if you are aiming for FCH. Let's say if you have 4.49 and you SU'd 5 A- last time by mistake, if you reversed that 5 misjudged decisions, your new GPA will be 4.4912, basically still 4.49 rounded. SU-ing A- won't help you cross into FCH; you're better off saving and SU-ing other B+ if you are aiming for FCH classification.

Edit 1: Notice some confusion in the thread: Only graded MCs are included in the calculation, CS/CU, previously SU'd modules are excluded."

I need to ask her to help me, but I don’t know how.",bnickel-7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k11hub/roommate_never_cleans_the_apartment_we_share_i/,"My roommate (20F) and I (20F) have been close friends since 6th grade. I haven’t felt like we’ve been super close in years, and I guess she just feels more like a sister to me. We share a two bedroom, one and a half bath together in our college town. I have two dogs which I solely take care of all by myself. Zero help from her, which I expect cause they’re mine. 

I am a full-time student studying education and a photography business owner for over four years now. I am also involved in clubs, hobbies, my parents live far away, and I pay for ALL my bills including the rent here. 

She is also a full-time student who studies marketing, and she works an internship for her mom’s company sometimes part-time and sometimes full-time. She is involved with her business fraternity where she was just elected president. Her parents live in the next town over, and her mom pays for most of her bills including the rent for our apartment.

(I’m not trying to shame her by including that information, but she rubs it in my face in many ways so it irritates me.) 

I enjoy cleaning, so I usually do the cleaning around the apartment. I have generalized anxiety and I feel in control when the environment around me is clean, and she knows this cause we lived together in a dorm. 

The issue comes that I’ve done ALL of the cleaning since we’ve moved into our apartment in July. I always vacuum, dust, sweep, take the trash out, clean counters, and bathrooms. Sometimes she does her own dishes which is nice. I lost a friend in September due to cancer, and she didn’t bother cleaning for me, not once. I still took the trash out, did most of the dishes, and deep cleaned. It makes me anxious when things aren’t cleaned, and I want it to be clean so I don’t have to do the most when we move out and potentially lose our deposit. 

When I bring up anything she does wrong, she defaults the blame onto someone else, or just acts like she didn’t realize I felt a certain way (i.e. “I just thought you wanted to always clean the apartment.” is a rebuttal I could expect.) 

I need to tell her I need her help in cleaning this apartment, but it needs to be delicate and kind. I understand she’s busy, but I’m busy too and I don’t want all the responsibilities of cleaning up after her. I don’t want to make her angry, but it’s nearly inevitable. 

TDLR: My roommate and I are both pretty busy, but I’m the one always cleaning our apartment. I’m really angry and annoyed about it, and I need advice on how to tell her gently that I need help.

Edit to add: I go to therapy for my anxiety, and discuss her all the time. I need to find a better therapist cause I’m still anxious about it."

I recently applied to this Talent Acquisition Internship at a company that I would be really proud to work at(the values, culture, etc. -- everything aligns with what I strive for). After conducting the first phone screen, I was immediately sent to final rounds with 3 recruiters and the conversations went well! 

I should also preface this by saying this was my first final rounds after beginning my job search this past September(recent grad). 

Anyways, since it was my first round, I really tried to be personable but more importantly, not let my nerves impact me so maybe I did not come off as ""bubbly"" or ""excited"" for the internship, which I take full responsibility for. I ended not getting the internship and when asked for feedback, the recruiter said ""Honestly, we thought you were a great candidate, we just have some others that were more experienced and excited about the company"". After hearing that, I immediately reflected on my final rounds and thought maybe I didn't express that enough because I was so pre-occupied with maintaining composure.

After two weeks of interviewing at other companies and currently being in the midst of final rounds with some, I noticed a new posting for the exact internship and thought maybe I should reach out the recruiter to ask to if I could re-apply/be reconsidered. Even after interviewing at other places, I just feel so drawn to this company, even if it is an internship right now, and felt like I would do myself a disservice by not asking at least.

I came home from my boyfriend at 2am in the morning and accidentally woke Mum up. She started questioning me why I got home so late (told her I was at friends place or else the parents would literally go nuts) But then she saw the hickey on my neck and had a massive meltdown. She started lecturing me on how I’m ‘so easy’ for boys to have me and I don’t have ‘respect’ for myself. She continued to say how all boys only want one thing (sex) and nothing else. She tells me I shouldn’t be having sex before marriage. She’s the type of person that believes you should only date one guy for the rest of your life before getting married. I tried explaining to her I’m not ‘easy’ and I haven’t told her I’m sexually active because I’m so scared of her reaction :( If I do, she’ll continue to degrade me. My parents share the same beliefs and values and I don’t know how much longer I can take. They tell me they don’t trust me anymore, and from now on if I’m wanting to hang out with friends, one of them has to drop me off and pick me up. I’m 21 years old. I shouldn’t be feeling like this. I recently just finished my University degree so I’m applying for jobs and internships so I can save up and move out. I know it will take a long time before I do move out which just makes me really really fucking sad and useless. I honestly don’t know how much longer I can take. They’re just so strict. I feel as though I can’t do anything with my friends because they are always wanting to know in detail what, where, and who I’m going with. I always can’t go out either. If I go out on a Friday I wouldn’t be able to do anything the following week because I apparently ‘go out too much’. I’m really trying to survive but it’s hard. My mental health is just going downhill at this point. Thanks to whoever made it to the end. Sorry for the long post. I just don’t know what to do anymore."
k1hi5r,2,2020-11-26,Any kind stranger that can give my SOP a look? [ECE/CS],mamdouh97,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/k1hi5r/any_kind_stranger_that_can_give_my_sop_a_look/,"I need a new pair of eyes to look at my SOP. If you need me to look at your SOP please tell me. I would be happy to be of help.

SOP: 

  

My objective is to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. I graduated from King Saud University (KSU) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia last summer. I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. \[Private\] in the \[Private\] lab at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) as a research intern. My research interests are applied machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing.

I got interested in machine learning in my junior year by working on a project based on a collaboration between my university and KAUST. The project aims to build a classification model of wudu actions using depth camera and Autoencoder-based classifier. Wudu is the Islamic procedure for wiping parts of the body with water and is done in preparation for prayers. The project aims to help in recognizing which phase the performer of the wudu is currently at using a skeleton joint tracker and help to reduce the water wastage by controlling the water tap according to the movement. Initial results of 98% accuracy were achieved using an autoencoder to encode the skeleton joints’ coordinates and then using SVM to classify between the different movements. This summer, based on the initial results, we expanded the project by collecting more data and trying different approaches for real time classification. Our focus was to harness the power of deep learning, while having a responsive system. We tested several deep learning models such as CNN and LSTM. After testing, we decided to build a system based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The system will predict the future movement of the user and then classify the prediction using a GCN network. This solution was then tested on a real water tap and was proven to save more water than a regular IR sensor. We have filed for a patent for the solution to expand it to industrial valves control using this solution. We also participated in the national NEOM challenge for AI solutions in power consumption and were placed in the top 5 for this solution. 

Before my senior year, I spent the summer as an intern in the \[Private\] lab at KAUST. I worked on a posture correction device that was integrated into the national wear of Saudi Arabia. We built a device that helps the user correct his posture by alarming him whenever he is sitting in a bad position using a desktop and a mobile application. I worked on developing the desktop and mobile applications. The application was designed to fully automate the procedure of posture monitoring. The app will automatically send the user an alarm whenever he is in a bad posture or has been sitting for too long. In addition, the user can observe his pattern regarding his posture and overall activity. The project is still in progress and the goal is to scale the project to reach commercial use. 

During my senior year, I worked on designing a prosthetic hand controlled by surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as my graduation project. The work includes processing the detected sEMG signal in a way that makes it suitable for extracting representative features to overcome the challenges of dealing with the randomness of the raw signals. A machine learning algorithm based on SVM and LDA is then employed to classify the intended movement and after that, a signal is to be transmitted to the prosthetic hand to function accordingly. The main constraint we faced during the project were how many signals we will deal with continuously, i.e. how many electrodes we need to get satisfactory results without affecting the responsiveness of the system. Having a high number of electrodes will require high computational power. We were able to build a model that can classify several hand movements using only two electrodes and features extracted from the time domain representation of the signal alone. We were nominated for the best graduation project competition in the university.

I want to pursue a career in industrial research, and I believe the commitment Northeastern University has for research will help me start my journey right. I am interested in a variety of research in the areas of computer vision and signal processing. At Northeastern University there are a few professors whose work is especially interesting to me: \[Private\], \[Private\], \[Private\], and \[Private\]. After going through their work, I believe I can add positive value to their groups. I look forward to starting my journey as a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University."

k1jvz1,0,2020-11-26,Looking for advice going into final semester of college,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/k1jvz1/looking_for_advice_going_into_final_semester_of/,"Hello everyone and Happy Thanksgiving!

I am going into my final semester of college at the University at Buffalo pursuing a finance degree. I have been working hard this semester and while I do not ever want to rush anything in life, I am about ready to finish strong and get into the corporate world so that I can establish a career for myself.

Mainly what I am writing about today is regarding internships and any advice that you guys might have for me. Currently, I secured an internship for the spring with Northwestern Mutual. I have read many Reddit discussions regarding Northwestern and they have made my somewhat wary about joining Northwestern for this internship. Also, this is obviously a sales internship and to be honest, no disrespect to anyone in sales, but at least to start out my career, I did not go to college with the intention of joining a sales position upon graduation. Simply put, one of the only reasons I decided to pursue this is to simply have an internship with a company on my resume because I have not done anything so far.

This is where I was looking for advice. I honestly am inclined to rescind my offer of joining Northwestern to try to pursue one of three internships that I have applied for which are more financial analysis related with Tesla, Moog and Rich Products Corporation. If worst comes to worst, and I were not able to secure one of these, I was thinking of getting some sort of bank teller part time position at a bank near me for the spring semester not only to help make ends meet but also just because I feel like having something financial related on my resume would hopefully be beneficial in some sense.

This is where I am at right now in my thinking and just wanted to see if you all had any insight about what you would do if you were in my shoes.

One more thing about me. My GPA isn't the worst in the world but also not the greatest at about 3.1 right now. These next few weeks I am hitting the books hard to try to increase that a bit once this semester concludes. While it would be cool to someday work in IB, I do not know how realistic it would be in my situation and instead, I am thinking of pursuing employment with a bank such as Citi out in Boston because that is where I plan on going after graduation. Just wanted to add this in here.

Thanks guys and Thanksgiving again!"
k1l8vj,4,2020-11-26,How to land an internship as a college underclassman,FewRefrigerator5546,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k1l8vj/how_to_land_an_internship_as_a_college/,"As the title suggests, below are some tips that really helped me out during the internship hunt this year. A little about me: second-year CS student at a non-target school(ranked around top 75-100 nationwide US), 3.7 GPA, landed a software engineering internship at a top 10 tech company(just outside of FAANG). 

For younger students with little paid programming experience, the MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is land a role where your work(i.e. code/projects) are used for real-life purposes, and you’re held accountable to complete that work to a standard of quality. 

For me, this was a research project after freshman year, and a role working for my schools IT department developing features for Moodle(open-source education platform). 

Whether it’s research, work-study, or even volunteering to code up projects for a non-profit, this WILL help you stand out. 

Next, and this is very important, know your data structures and algorithms INSIDE AND OUT. Aim for depth for breadth(don’t just practice 1000 leetcode questions blindly). Try to understand every detail and trade-off you may have to work with. Even if you get a question wrong, demonstrating a deep knowledge of problem solving approaches and thinking in ambiguous situations will pay off. 

Lastly, and this may be unpopular advice, but don’t apply to every single internship you can find. Often many of the companies putting applications out on sites like LinkedIn don’t have complete and organized internship programs. Instead, using something like the S&amp;P 500, apply to companies with a developed intern program, such that you’ll be in an organized environment geared toward YOUR development, not just busy work(had a few friends who worked at no-name companies and barely spent time learning or coding). 

Don’t lose hope! It can and likely will feel like you’ll never land an internship if you haven’t been coding for 15 years and don’t go to a top 10 school, but your enthusiasm and skills matter more than pedigree in most cases. Best of luck!"

Intended major: Computer Science 

SAT: I am scheduled to give SAT in December. In 3 official practice tests that I have given, I scored 1400, 1420 and 1520. So I think I would at least get a score of 1450 in SAT. 

Sat II: Maths level 2-790

high school grades: 
My school doesn't rank or have a gpa. Only final exam scores are used to calculate percentage. 

9th: 73%

10th: 92%

11th: 63% (due to covid our final exams were cancelled so marks were calculated based on previous assignments and tests. As I was absent for one of the unit tests due to visa appointment, I was marked absent and zero marks were considered by my school while calculating overall percentage. If finals were were conducted or if I would've been present for that unit test then I would have definitely scored at least 80%. I am going to mention this in the additional comments section in uc application) 

12th predicted score: 85% (ig this is not useful for uc applications) 

AP: Calc BC(5), comp sci A(4), 
APs are not offered in my school so I registered and studied on my own. 

Extracurriculars:
1. Internship at umass amherst for a website development project. Duration was about a month. My job was to fix bugs and add new features to the website. 

2. I am an indie game dev and I am currently working on a puzzle game to be published on google play store. 

3. Was selected in a 3-week training program in CS and IT by one of the leading IT companies in India: infosys limited. 

4. Created an efficient watering system for house plants to reduce water wastage with the help of my father. We also supply our product to 2-3 sellers. It's like a small businesses.

5. Student council: I was the captain of my house for two years. (It's sort of like a vice-president) 

5. Volunteered for a year at a ngo: Read-a-Story. There I taught English to village kids over phone because they did not have internet connection. Approximately 100hrs.

6. I started a soccer team in my school. I was the coach as well as the captain.

7. I have played soccer at state level through a renowned football club in my city. 

8. I have received silver and gold medals in NEF enduro. NEF enduro is an internationally recognised biathlon race. 

9. I also participate in cleanliness and tree plantation drives from time to time. 

Essays/LORs: I think my essays are pretty good. My brother and a friend(both college graduates) and my father reviewed them and thought they were good. But idk how to judge my own essays so I would say they are above avg. 
I think LORs should be good as I have good relations with both my teachers who are going to recommend me. In one of my letters my teacher is going to mention the reason for the slump in grades in 11th grade. 

Schools: UIUC, Umass amherst, University of Wisconsin-Madison, UCB, UCI, University of Washington-Seattle, Purdue, Penn State, University of Minnesota-Twin cities, Umich

Please suggest me some more unis in which I have a decent to good chance."

I used to do everything in Excel, but recently I have transitioned to using programming. Now that I've developed scripts that can quickly read large datasets, I can generate reports in a fraction of the time it used to take. What used to take ~6 hours of Excel now takes me about 30 minutes.

The issue is that I'm paid hourly. So from a financial standpoint, I'm kind of incentivized to take longer on these projects, and the scripts that I've worked hard to develop are actually hurting my wallet. Is it appropriate to approach my boss about this? On the one hand, it feels unfair, but also I guess this is sort of the nature of being an hourly temp employee."

Recently, I applied for an internship and went in-office for an interview as this internship is supposed to be in-office. At first, I was unsure of working in-office position because of the pandemic and because I live with high risk family members, but I thought as long as they have measures in place and are taking precautions it should be okay; plus I'm no condition to complain as I'm getting pretty desperate for experience at this point. So I went to the interview and it went pretty great and the job sounds exactly like what I want to do. However, the problem is that this company doesn't seem to care about COVID and they don't have active measures in place for in-office employees. Even during the interview itself, the interviewer was wearing a very flimsy/overused mask that kept falling down which was very uncomfortable to see... I'm very conflicted because I really want the experience of this internship but don't want to be working at a place where I have the possibility of being exposed to COVID and transmitting it to other family members. What should I do? Should I just decline the offer and be safer than sorry?"

k1od3b,8,2020-11-26,Where Do I Go from Here - Art Degree Working in Fintech as an Applications Developer,lailaicarrot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k1od3b/where_do_i_go_from_here_art_degree_working_in/,"**TL;DR:** Math turned Art bachelor's degree grad been working in Fintech for a year, looking for the right turn for the next stage in my career (data science/SWE, timing, industry prejudice, etc.). 

I have kind of an odd mix of background and overall pretty new in software development. Currently I work at a small government finance organization as an applications developer for my first job out of college. Recently I built a middle office API and some other small proof-of-concept applications in a team of one for the company. They were not complicated applications but nobody else at the company had built any in-house apps before and through that process I learned to do full-stack without any help and realized that I might have the potential to do well in SWE.

**-- WARNING: BOOK INCOMING --**

**Kinda Odd College Education:** 

My first exposure to programming was learning SQL through Coursera when I started applying for internships in data analytics as a math major. While working at my first internship in data analytics realized that I didn't really need to study more math in an institution to do the job (while realizing that more advanced study in math is helpful is ML, statistical modeling, etc., I didn't want to follow the rest of curriculum defined by the university anymore and figured that I can learn more in the specific area on my own if needed). Also I kinda had a crisis realizing that I'm getting progressively neurotic being in STEM my whole life, and have serious anxiety communicating with people (like a ""normal"" human). So I dropped out, applied for an art program at a public university that's somewhere in the top 15 (I had 3.9 GPA as a math major but the school itself isn't really hard to get into if you're a resident). That's around the same time I applied for an internship at the financial institute I currently work at, and I applied as a math major as of my latest confirmed area of study, got the internship and worked there for a year.

**After Graduation:** 

While studying art didn't cure my neuroticism and social anxiety, I did learn a different form of critical thinking and eventually made peace with my introverted personality and managed to be able to communicate with people effectively on-demand. I realized that the pay in art related careers sucks and decided to leverage my experience in data analytics to get a job in the more corporate side of the world and do art on the side. I got a job offer as an applications developer at the finance institute I interned at and another one as an analyst doing SQL and analytics dashboards at a small SaaS company L. During the interviews I emphasized my education in math and business and didn't mention my degree was in art and nobody asked. When I took the job in fintech and turned down the L company, the hiring manager mentioned that they'll have more positions next year if I'm interested in a change. I felt super insecure at my current job in the beginning being around consultants that fly in from NY every week and the new hires of experienced people from the biggest names in finance, one of which is my current boss. When I talked to my friend who was finishing his last year of CS degree about my insecurity, he said something like I'm just a token female POC hire for the company's diversity initiative. Overtime as I learned more I realized that's not true and I am worthy of the opportunity despite my non-conventional degree.

**Fast Forward One Year - Now:** 

I started looking for a different job after learning the poor internal growth potential at my current company. I applied to 3 jobs to test the water without even knowing that is a binary tree - one SWE job at the L company, 2 other SWE jobs at a couple of tier 2 tech company in my city, and reached out to the contact on the analytics team at the L company. I was in shock and went into panic when I heard back just a couple of days later for an interview from the L company SWE position and another tech company T. The SWE position at the L company asked me to take a Triplebyte quiz and I chickened out and ghosted them (because I didn't think I was knowledgable enough to answer web dev multiple questions, and hadn't practiced enough to do a live coding interview for the next step of Triplebyte), however my contact in analytics at L company got back to me and I interviewed for an analyst position that they're creating for me (I think) - mostly analytics, visualization, data warehousing but they want this role to also bring ML and statistical modeling to improve the revenue. I emphasized that I want the title to have data science/engineer/developer to show the technical nature of the position during the interview. I will likely get an offer from them soon, but I'm not sure if I should take that just for more money and distract my SWE career. The other company T - I passed their first-round hiring manager interview (behavioral), and have my second-round technical interview next week. The hiring manager asked me to tell my story about my education (I only put bachelor of science on the resume, no major), and I told him about my education history and the thought process (and struggles and growth) involved in the dramatic change of major. I almost wanted to cry when he encouraged me to always tell my story, because it is what makes me who I am today, without showing any prejudice indicating that not I'm a ""real"" software engineer because of my college major. If I get this job (even though unlikely because I just started studying data structure and algorith a few weeks ago and not that good at leetcode yet), or any other SWE jobs at the company in the future, I'd be happy to work there. However for a tech company who also has an office in Silicon Valley, their pay is quite a bit lower.

Should I take the analyst job if offered (with some data science and dev aspect) to improve my salary in the immediate short-term, pursue the local tech company in the short-term, or stay at my current cushy government job and take the time to study/build beautiful projects and pursue a SWE position at a Big Tech company and relocate in the medium-long term? How much of an obstacle would my art degree be if I were to pursue a SWE job at a Big Tech company? 

I don't know many people that are in software engineering or data science in real life so I'd really appreciate it if anyone could give me any advice or guidance!"

k1qwqz,3,2020-11-26,Traineeship or Internship?,[deleted],askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/k1qwqz/traineeship_or_internship/,"Quite curious to know what are the thoughts on this.

What exactly are the differences between traineeship and internship, putting salary aside? Which would be beneficial &amp; what some perspectives to take into consideration given 0 working experiences prior to that. (graduated btw) 

My friend got offered for both traineeship and internship, in a dilemma to accept which role.  The salary is pretty drastic tbvh. From a practical standpoint, going traineeship sounds like a good deal. 

Traineeship @ Singtel, learn automation script, monitoring and what not. (sounds pretty boring) 

Whereas, 6-months internship in a ‘small-firm’, will get to experience software (SDLC) process, close to what she had learnt prior to that. 


Question is:

- To opt for a ‘branded’ company as a stepping stone? So it looks ‘nicer’ on resume. 

Or

- To opt for a relevant JD?"

I am currently in my second year of working through a computer science degree and I do alright. I just feel really bad about myself and how I've never been able to formally make money working a job before. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I apply but nobody ever calls back and even if they do, I have nothing to offer during the interview.

I still suck at programming and only learned basic C so far, so no idea how I would work on complex stuff on the little spare time I have. 

And what year should I look for internships? So far I've only seen some ads for a few companies looking for 3rd year students for unpaid internships, most of them around here are unpaid, and people have told me they're mostly irrelevant. Not sure how it would work with covid now either. 

I am somewhat worried about finishing the degree with nothing done on the sides, so looking for some input."

I am an IT Guy. Went on site to a relatively large, city owned, Cemetery to fix their front desk computer. It was a quick job, just stopped by to swap some equipment. As I am getting ready to leave, the lady says “Oh, there’s another computer that is acting up. Can you take a quick look?” Being a nice guy, I say sure.

I follow her down the hall, and down some stairs, ... and into the Crematorium. I see a steel wall with little doors, a gurney, a casket-sized cardboard box, and a happy-go-lucky guy sitting in his chair.

Already a little spooked, he tells me his computer will not turn on. Sure enough, I try and it blue screens immediately. I decide to open up the side of the case to make sure all of the components were plugged in, and to see if it was an easy fix. An Inch think layer of Grandmas ashes were inside, covering ever square inch of the inside of the machine. 

I turn around to tell the guy that we should probably replace this machine. Before I could get the words out, he opens a big metal door, about the size of an old dumbwaiter. All I could see was a nice orange glow. Remember the gurney and cardboard casket? Turns out, that was headed for the orange glowing hole in the wall as I watched. 

I took his desktop and told him someone would be back with a new one at some point. I should have just said “no, I don’t have time today”.

TL;DR - There was a computer I was sent on site to fix that was in a Cemetery’s Crematorium. I found an inch think layer of ash in the machine, and watched a body get cremated before I bolted."

k1tc14,34,2020-11-26,Superintelligence Released!,GTthrowaway010101,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/k1tc14/superintelligence_released/,"For those interested Superintelligence was released on HBO Max today (the Melissa McCarthy movie with parts filmed on campus). 

As you might expect it was a pretty mediocre film but still worth watching to recognize all the sights on campus and around Atlanta! Spoiler ahead (but not that important): There’s a scene where McCarthy gets lost in the Microsoft building (the CULC) and can’t find her way out which is pretty funny to watch when you know exactly where she is. 

In addition to just the buildings it was cool to spot a lot of campus furniture they used and rearranged/relocated (hey that building isn’t where that chair goes...). Again I’d recommend watching despite the low reviews and there’s still a few good laughs involved. 

This movie will also likely replace its predecessor as the selling point for potential incoming freshman: “Did you know this building was featured in the hit blockbuster comedy ~~The Internship~~ Superintelligence?!”"

k1u78x,0,2020-11-26,Should I take an unpaid internship with early startups?,Lumpy-Ad7790,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k1u78x/should_i_take_an_unpaid_internship_with_early/,"I was accepted for 2 internships with early startups but they're unpaid. Both of these startups are in the early stages meaning that they were just created about a week ago and they're still working on getting a team together. Also both of these startups are unpaid, but with the promise of a job or equity later on if you prove yourself. I'm not sure if I trust that though, but I need the experience. But it just sucks because I feel like I'm being used without pay so the incentive to put in effort to benefit the company is just not there.

I'm based in the bay area, just finished a coding bootcamp a month ago, have about 5 projects in my portfolio with 1 year experience coding, and a bachelors degree but not in CS. I'm kind of at a crossroads here because alot of my friends in the bay area with less coding experience than me have gotten paid internships/jobs in the field so I know it's definitely possible. It may just be the timing of things and the job market right now. I'm not sure what I should do though. Am I better off just working on my own projects than taking an unpaid internship? I would mainly just be taking this opportunity (if I do) so that I can tell a future recruiter that I had a software engineering internship with a company. However, I feel like I will be barely putting in any work with the internship."

So what all should I be knowing to get internships? I have a really bad resume and idk how to build on it. I am interested in becoming a TA or applying for work-study positions but I'm not sure that I'll get them as a firstyear with a bad resume. (btw how do you apply to be a TA).

k1yibp,643,2020-11-27,How You Can Befriend Anyone: Five Principles By Dale Carnegie,PinkOverlord,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/k1yibp/how_you_can_befriend_anyone_five_principles_by/,"Dale Carnegie’s wisdom has served as the stepping stone to greatness for several of the most successful people in the world. In the HBO documentary *Becoming Warren Buffett**,* the Berkshire Hattaway Chairman praises the Carnegie courses saying “If I wouldn’t have done that, my whole life would have been different” \[2\].

Buffett goes on to say that Carnegie’s course cured his stage fright and that, until this day, this public speaking course certificate hangs on his office wall. Other celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Chuck Norris also say they greatly benefitted from Carnegie’s teachings \[3\].

I compiled five of Carnegie’s most impactful principles that you can use to make friends and influence people, as well as how I benefited from these principles myself.

# 1) Don’t argue, you always lose

You read that correctly, you can never win an argument! To understand why this is the case, let me give you a real-life example.

A few months ago, I was arguing about the long-term effects of minimum wage floors with a colleague of mine. After we fervently hurled facts and numbers at each other’s heads for 40 minutes, it was clear that I had “won” the argument.

I returned home with a feeling of accomplishment, trusting that my colleague would appreciate that I showed him “the right way” to approach the issue. This scenario repeated itself a few times. But every time, I left the restaurant with that same feeling of accomplishment.

Can you guess what happened after that? My colleague started canceling our brunches more and more often until we stopped meeting for brunch altogether.

Because my colleague did not “win” any of our arguments, he started to feel resentment towards me. He did not like being told he was wrong and he certainly did not appreciate having to admit defeat every week. As his resentment grew, we started spending less time together.

The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, pause, and think for a second. What would have been the right approach to take?

Imagine that you and your supervisor are discussing whether the sky is blue. To your surprise, your supervisor tells you that the sky is, in fact, red. **Never say “you’re wrong”**. Instead, simply express that he made a really good point of which you were not aware, and that, while you previously thought the sky was blue, you will most certainly look into your supervisor’s argument.

You will allow your supervisor to experience a feeling of accomplishment. By avoiding the argument, the other person has grown to like you more.

**Principle one**: The only way to truly win an argument, is to avoid it. Gracefully accept the other parties' rebuttals and move on.

# 2) Talk in terms of the other person’s interest

I. According to Carnegie himself, I, is the most used word in the English language \[1\]. It’s everyone’s favorite word. You can use this to your advantage.

The first time I asked for feedback on one of my rejected job applications, I asked the recruiters a few questions: What did *I* do wrong? What can *I* do to improve so that *I* can do better next time? *I* wanted *my* next job application to be better. Sure enough, I never received a response.

Notice how, after the recruiter finished reading this email, he or she had absolutely no incentive to give me feedback. **What was in it for them?**

The second time I asked for feedback, I decided to keep this question in mind. I asked the lead recruiter: What can I do to better conform to *the company’s* values? What were *the recruiters* looking for in a candidate? How could I serve *the firm’s* needs better? Four days later, I received a response with detailed feedback.

&gt;*“If you want a person to help you, always ask yourself this question. What is in it for them” — Dale Carnegie, 1964*

**Principle two**: Just like you are trying to further your own interests, so are other people. Remember to emphasize how the other person will benefit.

# 3) Listen

Can you guess what everyone’s favorite topic is? No, it's neither politics nor astrology. According to Carnegie, everyone’s favorite topic is talking about themselves \[1\]!

You might have caught yourself waiting for your turn to speak, rather than listing when talking to someone. While the other person is telling you about his long-awaited city trip to Tokyo, you are mapping out the story of the time you were in New York in your head. As soon as the other person stops talking, you can finally blurt out your well-rehearsed response.

Except, the other person is likely much more interested in telling you about that Tokyo trip, rather than listening to you talk about *your* New York trip.

Last week, I met a Cyber Security consultant on the train. For 3 hours, he excitedly told me about all the responsibilities he had and how important his job was for the firm’s safety.

When we parted ways, he asked for my contact, emphasizing how much he enjoyed our conversation and how he would really like to do this again sometimes. Conversation? **I barely spoke a word.** Yet, the consultant was overjoyed!

The next time someone is talking to you about their interests, ask follow-up questions and express that you are excited to hear more. The next time, people will come to *you,* remembering what a superb conversationalist you are.

**Principle three**: The next time you are talking to someone, smile, and try to really listen.

# 4) Give people a reputation to live up to

We all know that someone’s current performance shapes other people’s expectations in the future. What if I tell you, that reputation can also shape performance.

When I was tutoring microeconomics, one of my students was having trouble understanding the concept of marginal cost. On top of that, this student was rather unmotivated to learn more about the world of microeconomics.

After struggling through the first class, I decided to take a different approach to the second class. I told her that, I had seen from our first meeting how smart she was. I told her I noticed her ability to work with numbers and how understanding the concept of marginal costs would be a breeze for her if she would just take another look at it.

&gt;“Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise” — Dale Carnegie, 1964

The next week, this girl did not only manage to understand marginal costs, but she read ahead in the book and acquainted herself with several more economics concepts.

Having liked the idea of being a smart girl with a keen sense for numbers, she decided to work hard to make fulfill this vision.

**Principle four**: If you want to motivate someone, give them a reputation to live up to.

# 5) Let other people think of your idea

Did someone ever reject your idea without a clear reason? It is important to keep in mind that, everyone’s favorite idea, is their own idea.

During one of my internships, I had to graph a certain economic trend. While my supervisor urged me to use Excel, I tried to explain to him why I believed it would be more efficient to use statistical software such as Stata.

I’m guessing you already know what happened. The supervisor disagreed, saying I should stick to the method he outlined for Excel.

Several weeks later, a similar issue arose. Rather than rushing to my boss and telling him why *my* idea of using Stata was still better, I took a different approach.

During lunch, I told my supervisor how much I liked his Excel template and how excited I was to use it. If only there was a way to add certain details to the graph. If only there was a program that could do that. Then, *his* template would have been perfect.

Can you guess what happened? The next day, my supervisor came to me, saying he came up with an idea. What if, he continued, we would use Stata to create more detailed graphs? A splendid idea indeed!

The supervisor was now completely convinced by my idea. Why? Because this time, it was *his* idea.

**Principle five**: The next time your idea being dismissed, nudge the other person to come up with the same idea themselves.

Try to actively use these rules for 2 months. While they will require practice, I am convinced you can use them to further your career goals and improve your personal life.

k21bag,2,2020-11-27,I have no control on my mind. I can never choose what I want to focus on. Can anyone help?,CoolJoey99,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k21bag/i_have_no_control_on_my_mind_i_can_never_choose/,"I squarely blame it for all my failures in my life so far. 

Ever since high school, I began complaining to my parents that I can't focus on the books, that I am compulsively getting away from it. They shrugged it away in typical Asian fashion but I have been struggling with it ever since. I'm about to finish college and the problem still haunts me every single day. I really don't know what is wrong with me. Any time I plan to do anything that has a certain weight, for example my academic work, I will compulsively open something else like YouTube or Netflix as if I'm running away. I will stay there till my mind is exhausted. Like for example, I plan to start studying early in the day, I will immediately jump to some distraction and keep myself distracted till late at night when I become so tired that I can't deal with the situation anymore. 

For example, I was doing a bootcamp on web development the past few months. At the time, it didn't have any consequences. I was only doing it because I was interested in it. Now that I finished it and am looking for internships etc, I CANNOT get myself to even look at the code in the monitor or my notes in the face. It's like I am terrified. I was a good student in high school and ever since I became like this, my grades went down the drain. 

The worst part is - I don't want to waste time watching Youtube but it has become a compulsive reflex. I hate myself because of this. I feel ashamed talking about it but it troubles me greatly. I scored really high on the avoidant trait in a test my therapist gave me. I talked about it during my therapy often but I never was really able to win over it.

It's like I am on autopilot, having no willpower or say in what I should do. The surprising part is I can read like huge books without a problem. Not always but on some days, I can like stick with a novel for hours. It's honestly crazy to me that I can't control my mind but yeah, rant over. I don't expect anything to come out of this but if anyone can help, I'd be grateful.

PS - I have been to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety like two years back. I still feel like it all comes back to my inattentiveness basically ruining my life. I tried talking about it in therapy but I didn't really get much out of therapy."

k21nf8,2,2020-11-27,How to prepare for my cloud engineering internship next summer?,horriblemangos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k21nf8/how_to_prepare_for_my_cloud_engineering/,"I recently landed an internship at a big e-discovery company, with the title “cloud engineering intern”. I’m going to be working with a lot of Docker and Kubernetes, as well as various Azure technologies, and the main role of the full time team i’m working with is reworking the cloud infrastructure of their main SaaS product. That’s my rudimentary understanding. 

I got ridiculously lucky landing this internship, and the imposter syndrome is already kicking in big time. I really want to get a full time offer from this company so I want to be somewhat competent during my time there next summer. 

Truly, I think cloud computing is a very interesting topic in software engineering, and I’ve been doing some research with Docker and Kubernetes. However I really want some effective hands-on practice with those technologies, because I feel like getting my hands dirty beforehand is the best way to prepare. I’m just clueless on how to go about that. Any thoughts?"

I’m sorry mods if this kinda post isn’t allowed. 

Let me explain with some background information: 

I have OCD, Depression, and Social Anxiety Disorder.

This January, I’ll be going abroad for grad school (masters program) at a good ranked uni (T15-25) for computer science. I have dreams about being a professor and teaching in a university.

I graduated from a bachelors in computer science from a university in a third world country (take a guess where all the scam callers are from. I know Reddit love bitching about us. I know I’m from a terrible third world country. What can I do?).

I’m interested in researching about Deep Learning and have published a paper in relatively smaller journal (publisher starts with E).

I have great test scores (GRE, TOEFL, and a GPA that is close to 4.0). But in terms of computer programming skills, I’m behind when I compare myself to peers. I’m only good at using machine learning and deep learning frameworks in Python. When I see them code elaborate projects, I get frightened by my own inadequacies. I feel that I can never reach their level.

No internships because I was scared to send my CV due to social anxiety and depression. I’m scared to try hard things. If I fail, isn’t it all for naught? 

I can’t imagine myself not doing something related to computer science. I prefer research but I also love software engineering.

Is there hope for me at 22 years old? Sounds ridiculous but my question is from a genuine place of concern. Can I become a good programmer in 2 years?"

So this really breaks down into multiple questions:

1. Is it possible for me to get an internship with no prior internship or even work experience, and very little side projects? I worry and don't think I would even get any interviews at all.


2. I am currently working on a side project, but it's in its early stages and it's time to start applying for internships. Can I put it on my resume and link the github repo with the disclaimer that it's in progress and talk about it in interviews?


3. Most of my programming has been in my classes, but I do really like those programming classes and I'm pretty good at them. Is what's taught in typical CS programming classes enough in terms of coding knowledge to be able to work an internship?


4. Hypothetically if I land an interview, how much would things like leetcode problems matter if it's not a top tech company? I have a cousin working in FAANG and he's told me to just do leetcode. I haven't taken DS and Algo yet, since that's a third year thing at my school. At the moment I can only really do some leetcode easy problems, so that has me worried also. I'm trying to learn DS &amp; Algo on my own though. Do all companies have this kind of programming/technical interview with leetcode-style DS &amp; algo questions for internships? I'm probably gonna be applying for a whole range of internships whether big or tiny company.

I think that's it for now, but the main idea is that I've got nothing but I want an internship lol."
k26bmv,8,2020-11-27,Needing career advice - what's the best way up from helpdesk? Which types of positions are most likely to offer WFH?,ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/k26bmv/needing_career_advice_whats_the_best_way_up_from/,"So I've got about 7 years of technical support experience now, mostly  windows but also some mobile phone support, printer and networking  support etc... Currently working as a call agent at an internal tier 2 helpdesk remotely troubleshooting and supporting technician's field devices, studied IT in college for 2 years before I took an internship  that turned into full time work, and decided to keep working instead of returning to school due to financial difficulties... With the idea in mind at first that I'd work for a bit to save up enough money to return  to school, but I struggled to do that as time passed and just ended up  building off of my work experience instead.  


I haven't done much to that end unfortunately though, as I've been struggling to figure out what direction I want to take my computer career in up from the basic support level. I've played with a few ideas like web and app development (I'm a creative type, have an idea for an app I'd love to develop that would occupy a niche I have a passion for but my coding knowledge is basic at best for the moment; pipe dream is to be a producer/DJ but I've realized that's not realistically feasible), going back to college and finishing the IT degree in CS instead, or just getting certifications and continuing up the current side of the IT ladder that I'm on in some  direction (systems / server administration maybe, or something leaning  more towards security or, maybe eventually working towards an end goal  of cloud architecture type work). I'm still having a hard time getting a sense of which of these specializations would fit me best, but for the moment my priorities have shifted more to the short-term;

I've been working from home at this position since March, and with vaccines likely to be available soon my job is going to make us return to the office before long. I really don't want to go back to the office though - aside from the many typical benefits of working from home, I have a needy pet parrot who I've come to realize shouldn't be left alone by himself all day 5 days a week. I've been seeing more permanent WFH positions popping up with positions near my level ever since the pandemic, but so far my job searching has been unsuccessful. My best guess is this is because of the high demand of jobs right now, and my disadvantages of not having a full degree or any certifications.

For the moment my tentative plan is to get the CompTIA Security+, since it seems I could get it pretty quickly, then get the Network+ after that or the MCSA Windows Server 2016, and move into some type of security or sys admin type role. Do these tend to offer WFH often though? What path up from where I'm at is most likely to get me a WFH position?

I could always just transfer my 80 credit hours somewhere and return to school FT to finish off a CS degree, maybe build my app idea in the meantime and move towards software development - but I'm hesitant to do this as I already have significant student loans that I haven't been making payments towards, and my living expenses aren't insignificant living in an apartment by myself (something I don't want to give up, after multiple tramautic experiences living with roommates). I also wonder if the stress of software development is for me, as it seems like there's usually less downtime with those positions and they're more stressful mentally. Downtime is the second most important factor for me behind WFH, as it allows me to study and get new certs, as well as pursue side projects like the app and maybe even pick music back up.

So perhaps I'm best off staying in IT and working on those things in the meantime, but yeah - I have no idea what the best direction to take my career in is towards the aforementioned goals. It's hard to know what the higher up roles are like without actually doing them, and I fear spending time and money towards getting certified in something only to find out that I hate it.

One last factor is that I want to move to Seattle as soon as feasible; I live in Texas and the heat, geography and general culture are making me miserable as someone from the west coast - each summer becomes increasingly unbearable, and I love everything about the Seattle area. The rent up there is higher though, so moving at my current level doesn't seem like a good idea - and there's lots of high paying tech opportunity in the area, but it tends to be reserved for the higher up, more valuable positions - especially on the development side of things.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far, and for any advice you might have for me."

I commit roughly 15 hours a week to debate aside from competitions themselves. Several associate projects.

Volunteer (340 hrs and intern at an Autism facility. Volunteering includes teaching communication skills to children and developing their motor skills in a latch-key situation. For a special project with them, I held like multiple mini-debate tournaments which they loved. The internship includes a lot of research studies with the facility, preparing material for conferences, and community reach-outs where we educate other school paras on new ways to interact with children on the spectrum in line with new research. I don't actually present at the conferences because it typically conflicts with debate tournaments, but I present at the local visits. (8-12 hrs a week during the school year, 16-24hrs during the summer)

Started an online summer school because of COVID for children with autism (25-30 kids, meet a couple of times a week and get interesting people to come present with to the children. I also come up with activities to help them build communication skills. Have several professionals I convinced to volunteer and professors to discuss their research - about 20 hrs a week)

Coordination at  an Autism Summer Camp - work with roughly 100 children daily 

Software Development start-up (it's just me right now, lol) that works to create free software for children with autism.

Quiz Bowl (varsity 4 years, state team, regional team, qualified to nationals, won city twice, and captain, science specialist)

Science Olympiad (6 years so far since middle school, multiple states and regionals awards, VP next year of the club)

And then there's other filler clubs and stuff like NHS, NSHS, etc. but they don't really matter.

Essays/LORS

I'm not in a position to say if my essays are good, but i definitely do they think they are unique to me. They're also gramatically correct. 

LORS - speech and debate teacher (we're tight and spent a lot of time with them) calc teacher (we're alright. I don't know if it will be out of the park like debate teachers). I have a really good one from my director at the internship, but I couldn't send it to hopkins :/

k26mf4,2,2020-11-27,Is This Normal? (Leaving a Job): Recently Left a Part Time Job and Am Being Asked to Attend Meetings After My Last Day?,kitkatnat21,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k26mf4/is_this_normal_leaving_a_job_recently_left_a_part/,"So I've never quit/resigned from a job and did that with a ""part time"" job I had recently.

Looking for advice to see if what I'm experiencing is normal and what to do about it.

I've had this particular job for the past 4 months and couldn't take it anymore so I sent in my resignation email. It feels shitty to say this since we're in a pandemic but the job was draining and I was at my wit's end so I emailed my resignation letter and told them my last day would be 10 days later.

There are many reasons why I quit this job:

* This position wasn't really in line with what I'd like to do career-wise.
* I dreaded waking up everyday to do this job (many times I'd be woken up at 6am via text by my boss about something related to this job).
* I was told this job was a part time position (minimum of 5 hours a week), but in actuality I would be working full time hours (including weekends) with a pay that wasn't **EVEN** close to minimum wage (*I'm embarrassed to say how much my monthly stipend was*).
   * The thing that was keeping me to this job was that the title looks nice on my resume but at this point, I don't really care about the title.
* The structure of the business was a **HUGE** mess so there was bad communication all around.
   * In the 4 months I was there, 7 interns dropped (or are in the process of dropping) their internships with this business.
      * I ended up having to talk an intern ""off the ledge"" so they would stay onboard, even though I was thinking about resigning/quitting myself. (They later ended up being one of the 7 who dropped.)
   * People (myself included) were doing random things as assigned by the supervisor that weren't part of their (our) job descriptions.
* I'd like to refocus my time on job searching (I've been doing that since before I took this position but because of this positions hours, haven't been able to devote that much time to that).
* I'm currently looking for full time work so I considered this position to be more of a temporary thing when I accepted it anyways.

In my resignation email, I wrote ""Please let me know if I can be of any assistance during this transition."" I had a meeting with my supervisor and the volunteer that's taking over my position after I leave and they're still asking me if I can attend meetings (""In case we have questions."") after the date I specified in my resignation letter. My supervisor said she was glad that ""I wasn't going to drop off the face of the Earth, in case we need help"".

TBH I don't want to attend these meetings nor do I feel that I should since I told them and was clear about when my last day was. Before my last day, I wrote and filled out some docs with information for the person who's going to takeover this position, so they know where I left off and put all the information in those docs so I'm not sure why I need to attend anymore meetings.

I just want to leave and never think about this position again because everything was such as mess. I've had different jobs before but this was by far, the worst job I've ever had. I know I mentioned being of assistance during this transition so I'm not sure if I basically asked for this.

Is this normal for an employer to ask if you do work-related tasks after you've specified a last day?"

&amp;nbsp;
RULES 1, 2 and 3: SUBMIT YOUR SELF TO MAMMA MARMOTH AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE ON THE STREETS. CROSS MAMMA MARMOTH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

&amp;nbsp;
I almost dropped the sign she handed me. I would have if I didn't have the irrational fear that she would crush my head like an egg if I did. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“I don't know M...what is involved in this...submission?”

&amp;nbsp;
	“A formality. So you know who is in charge of this operation. Everyone on the streets around here takes orders from me. You trust me, and I'll take good care of you. You cross me, I won't take so good care of you. So are you in, or are you gonna die tonight, Slick?” 

&amp;nbsp;
You can guess what my answer was when faced with those kind of choices. 

&amp;nbsp;
M gave me a “pocket”, what she called a street “home”. Mine was on the second floor of a small old mechanical building kept safe by a locked gate that only M and I had the code to. There was an active leaking water pipe and a bucket that provided enough to wash my face and rinse my mouth out. It was empty and quiet, and I slept for nearly six hours on a mattress made of scrap house insulation boards, warm and soft compared to the broken cardboard boxes. Best of all, nobody bothered m. I had survived my first night on the streets. 

&amp;nbsp;
M was true to her word, so had to be true to mine if I were to keep my pocket. I met her at her yurt two days later with a bone-thin man named Flake, another homeless man I thought I had passed somewhere on the streets before. Mamma said she had a way of “making some REAL money getting off these streets.” I'd be lying to say I wasn't tempted. 

&amp;nbsp;
The rundown was simple: M provided an address and directions to a ranch-style suburban house a few miles from the downtown area. According to M, the man that lived there had stolen millions of dollars worth of cut gems after he quit his jewelry import company. M seemed sure that the thief had stashed the gems on the top shelf of their kitchen pantry cabinet, inside two Quaker Oatmeal tubes before they were moved foreign safe deposit. Flake and I were to steal them and then give them to M.

&amp;nbsp;
Finding the house and opening the unlocked back door seemed too simple to be believed. I acted as lookout while Flake took the goods. About 30 seconds later, I heard shouting and a thudding struggle come from the kitchen, followed by the screams of a woman. 

&amp;nbsp;
I rushed into the kitchen to see a thousand glimmering gems on the linoleum floor as Flake wrestled with a fat balding man in boxers and an undershirt, whom I assumed to be the jewelry thief. They were rolling, punching and wrestling savagely on the ground for a handgun. I turned and ran away, not knowing what else to do. 

&amp;nbsp;
My body nearly crashed into a woman standing behind me, holding a large kitchen knife. My mind automatically assumed her to be the thief’s wife. There was bottled rage in her eyes that she wanted to rid herself of. She saw me and saw a legitimate way to stab away every wrongdoing she had ever faced away into me, and we both knew it. 

&amp;nbsp;
She slashed my forearm and made a glancing blow near my temple. My blood covered the diamonds and emeralds on the linoleum floor in seconds. Her second slash was faster, sharper than the first. Given enough slashes, I'm sure she would have cut me to strips if Flake had not stepped in. 

&amp;nbsp;
Flake was nearly six feet tall and no more than 100 pounds- still, he was strong. He turned the knife in her waxy fingers and plunged it deep into her own neck, holding it in as a mainline of blood broke and geysered. I looked back to see the temple of the thief’s head caved in; Flake had used the butt of the gun to kill him. We created two corpses in less than 90 seconds. 

&amp;nbsp;
We were in the process of gathering as much of the spilled loot as we could find under the cabinets and fridge and bodies when a knocking, then a voice, came from the front door. It sounded like a neighbor, calling out two names, asking if everything was alright. The knocker didn't wait long to run towards the back door to find us bolting out into the night with the oatmeal tubes. I couldn't run as fast as Flake because the wounds on my legs and ass split open again during the fight, leaving me to be spotted. 

&amp;nbsp;
My eyes met the good Samaritan that came to check on the noise; a bolt of panicked surprise lit up in both of our eyes when they met because we knew each other. He was a former co-worker. He knew me, said my name in an inquisitive voice. I knew he positively identified me fleeing a murder scene, but I ran anyways. 

&amp;nbsp;
I followed Flake back to M, where we emptied our haul. M was already hard at work along two other women armed with salvaged magnifying glasses and rusted tweezers to divide them and place the sorted stones in small yellow envelopes. 

&amp;nbsp;
M did not look at me as she spoke. Instead, she looked at a plain gold wedding band that she had taken from the haul and used it as a pinky ring, slipping it under the bandages. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Flake says you fucked up, Slick.” My throat dropped into my stomach. I swallowed to bring it back up.”

&amp;nbsp;
	“No, I was on lookout...and there was a fight...”

&amp;nbsp;
	“...and you got jumped by the wife. You would be as dead as Hilly Eight and Young if it weren't for Flake. And...you got spotted.” My throat dropped again so low I couldn't bring it back up again. M spoke again. “Murders...the cops take seriously, *actually* seriously. They already have a name and a face, and it will only be a matter of time before you take them here...to us. To *me*. That can't happen, Slick.”

&amp;nbsp;
	“I'll hide, I'll, I'll...” She lifted and opened her huge palm to shut me up. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Don't go to your pocket tonight. I *will* send the cops over there, if they grill me.”

&amp;nbsp;
	“Sure...OK. Where do I sleep then?” She didn't look up from her ring this time. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“You won't, tonight. You're going to go on the streets and earn a hundred dollars, and bring that back to me. If you don't, you're going to jail for the rest of your life, and trust me, homelessness is a million times better than sleeping in the same concrete cell, being a slave, until you die. So go, do what you gotta do, and get back here with the cash.” I left them to count my riches. 

&amp;nbsp;
A hundred dollars. M might has well asked for a trillion. I was equally as likely to get either tonight. 

&amp;nbsp;
I walked along the dark concrete sidewalks with my heart stopping at the sight of every red and blue light. I had no idea what to do, so I walked until until the scraping of the rocks stuck into the grooves my sneakers drove me to gingerly sit on the first short wall I came to.

&amp;nbsp;
It was then that I noticed that my right foot held a diamond masquerading as a piece of gravel stuck into my shoe. A smaller square emerald was also embedded above the diamond; a quick look at my other foot revealed three more smaller gems stuck inside the deep soft ridges of the sneakers. For the first time in long while, I felt the burning excitement of hope again. 


&amp;nbsp;
I walked all night to the largest pawnshop out of town, hoping to be away from both the cops and M. 

&amp;nbsp;
The owner's eyes almost fell out when he saw the round perfect brilliant diamond weighed nearly a gram on his scale, the largest gem I had on my shoe. He locked the doors and had to invite two appraisers over to confirm what he was looking at. After nearly six hours, he came back to me and offered $5,000 for all I had. 

&amp;nbsp;
I recalled a little of my former life. I told him that I once was married, and had the ability to buy a such a stone for my ex-wife. The prices for a 2 carat, nearly a half-gram stone, could go for $40,000. He countered with the fact that these stones were “hot”, an undeniable claim. 

&amp;nbsp;
In the end, I was able to extract $5,500 for every stone I had stuck on the bottom of my shoe, a remarkable feat for such a cheap man. 

&amp;nbsp;
It was enough to buy a bus ticket back to the East Coast, back to a town I used to work in as a youth. I didn't sleep during the six day trip for fear that a warrant was issued relating to the murder. 

&amp;nbsp;
The pawn money allowed for the first, last and deposit on the cheapest apartment I could find in the quiet town, $2700 in total. It was a dump, but it kept me alive to send out an average of 100 resumes and cover letters a day, every day. Even on a $40 a week budget of food, the bills were making me go broke again.  It seemed as everyone in this town was nearly in the same position as me; there simply were no jobs at all. None at the gas station, none at the grocery store, none at the restaurants, none in any of the shops. Despite being a town with no jobs, the rent was still $900 a month. 

&amp;nbsp;
In six months, I was flat broke, again, and facing eviction, again.

&amp;nbsp;
Through someone I met and talked to while waiting in line at the store, I managed to get an interview when I had exactly two days left to pay the backrent or face eviction and with $1.13 in my bank account. The pay was great for the area, and it was in a field I knew. They were opening a branch in this area, and I considered it a stroke of luck long overdue. 

&amp;nbsp;
The receptionist looked as professional as she acted. She already pre-filled out my paperwork and told me that the hiring manager was in conference room near the back of the office, through a maze of cubicles filled with hunched backs dressed in like accountants, their heads buried in their work or talking on phones. 

&amp;nbsp;
The conference room was empty. There was a thick manila folder on the far head of the table with my name on it. I sat there and opened the file. Inside was a cardboard sign. It read:

&amp;nbsp;
RULES 1, 2 and 3: SUBMIT YOUR SELF TO MAMMA MARMOTH AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE ON THE STREETS. CROSS MAMMA MARMOTH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

&amp;nbsp;
	“You forget one of the rules, Slick?” My head shot up and I saw Mamma Marmouth standing at the door I had entered, her massive frame draped in a contemporary black and white business suit. Her hands were still mummified in white and gray bandages.

&amp;nbsp;
 The two side doors of the conference room opened. The people that had been working in the cubicles  stepped in. It took me a second to recognize who they were with fresh, full faces filled with straight white teeth. The kids, perhaps interns, with throwback 1980's suspenders and round glasses, were the teens that tormented me. The three men in the bus station that told me that they would kill me now looked soft from years of easy family living. Flake was there, crew-cut, athletic and lean. Even the fat husband and psycho wife we stole the gems from was there, alive, unharmed, and dressed in like they were ready to give a presentation to investors. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Don't they look good, Slick?” I tried to speak, but my breath was afraid to leave my lungs. 
	
&amp;nbsp;
	“They're dead...I saw...” As soon as I spoke these words, I felt the reality of what I knew began to give under me. It felt like the entire world was in simultaneous free-fall with me as the others looked at me with an identical expressionless faces. M grinned and looked over to the people I saw killed. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Feelin' OK?” 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Better if we got this over with.” Said the wife. The husband agreed. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“How 'bout you?” M said to the teen with the glasses and suspenders, the same one that had his face caved in by M. He smiled and winked at her. M turned back to me. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“They're all fine, Slick. And you seen them die. That was the point. To see them die, and to see them return in perfect condition. Isn't it wonderful to know that you will never die, if you don't need to?”

&amp;nbsp;
	“I don't know. What I do know is that I don't want this job.” M's head turned like she had seen a puppy fall down. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“Darling, you signed up for this job months ago. You *tried* to cross me, but instead, you opened up a field office for us across the country. I consider that more than $100.”

&amp;nbsp;
	“I have a home now...”

&amp;nbsp;
	“Not for long. You're getting kicked out of your place in two days. You have no credit, and almost no cash. You are as good as mine- and before you cry and moan, know that you can cross me and leave the family. But your last days will not be pleasant in the streets. That, I can guarantee. Otherwise, I can guarantee a nice pocket for you and a meal a day. You just gotta run a few errands for Mama every now and then. They'll be dangerous errands, but not for you. You'll be fine, as long as you are near me.”

&amp;nbsp;
	“How?” Mamma spread her massive arms and gathered the people around her, the full-grown adults looking like children next to their parent. 

&amp;nbsp;
	“They call me 'Mamma' because I gave birth and re-birth to all these beautiful people. They are -in every natural way- my children. As long as a drop of blood or a single hair remains of my former child, I can take that into my body and re-birth him or her; in 9 days, they emerge, fully grown, and perfect.” M remained silent to allow me to process the ungodly mental picture. Mamma M continued. 


&amp;nbsp;
	“This is your only chance” M started, “but you still have a choice. We can let you go. You won't get far; if you'll recall, these are the people that tried to hurt you. They will try again once you are out...or you can do the right thing. I'll even give you an easy first task. I remember you saying that you liked to write, and I said you could again if you followed the rules. So write. Write what happened to you. Write about me. Tell them what they need to know to survive on the streets. I know you'll tell the truth. If you do, you will become part of us.”"

Also, from what hiring mangers told me, with LM there there is possibly opportunity to WFM (work from home as FT employee even after the pandemic over ) if the internship goes well and I get FT offer. L3Harris told me if I do get FT offer with them the position is originally on site so even if the pandemic over I would still have to come into the office unless upper management says otherwise, even though the team is currently WFM due to covid until further notice."

I've been actively searching for an internship since early October and have received countless rejection emails from companies and I'm really starting to think that there is just absolutely no hope of me getting a job.

I'm a Junior Finance student at a semi-target school with a 3.2 GPA, and I feel that I'm well qualified for at least an internship. I'm well-versed in VBA and Python and have experience in Tableau, R, SQL, and Access (I have these near the top of my resume). Ultimately I want to do data analytics or business analytics but I'm finding it very hard to get my foot in the door. I've constantly seen my peers posting they're accepted offers on LinkedIn for all of the companies that I can't even get a reply from and it's very demoralizing. I've had a couple pre-recorded video interviews which led to no response and some IQ assessments that I did very well on - but still went nowhere. 

I guess what I'm asking is... what now? I have had 2 internship offers which both seem like total scams or MLMs which is why I don't count them as anything. One is selling pest control D2D and the other is (from what I've read) selling life insurance policies but for a very large financial services company (I'm sure you can figure out who it is). Should I just give up on my search and accept one of these offers? Could I leverage the life insurance internship for another position within the company? Should I consider grad school? I know this sub gets a lot of these, but any advice I can get is very helpful. All responses or comments are appreciated!"
k285xl,2,2020-11-27,My new Anxiety Experience,SpeedbumpEntity,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k285xl/my_new_anxiety_experience/,"Hello, I am in the United States


I want to share a new experience that I've had, and see if anyone else has/is feeling the way I currently am. I am a senior in college pursing a degree which will place me into a high stress, high adrenaline, career path. For the past 20 years of my life, I've percieved myself to embody the passion and ability to be able to be able to work in these conditions, and with the experiences I've gained so far with an internship I've be able to he apart of, I continued to believe this was the case.

However, about three months ago everything changed. I decided to exercise (as quarantine has me sitting around) and found myself unable to bring my breathing, or heart rate, down to a resting level for the remainder of the day. Two ER visits over the next week left me with limited answers. I knew I didn't have covid, any serious emergency illnesses, or anything that was easily detectable.

Unfortunately, as the months have gone on I've noticed that these issues still persist. I am unable to any ""vigorous"" exercise without a sense of panic after the fact (during so is fine, its the afterwards that causes issues), low appetite (I never feel hungry and have lost LBs due to limited eating), along with random heart racing and the inability to feel like I can ""breath all the way"", especially when trying to sleep.

I've tried seeing a therapist, a counselor at my school, multiple doctors, and even some homeopathic remedies but these feelings and thoughts continue to persist. I do feel occasional relief, some days are good, some days are worse, but it always seems as if I have this constant ""entity"" watching over my shoulder ready to take me down at a moments notice.

I'm reaching out to anyone here to see if they've had an experience like me or some of the tips and tricks they've tried. I feel as my options are becoming more limited, like medicine, and due to my career field having a limited supportive view on mental health (especially medication), I want to try everything I can before that. However, I feel like I have, and just want these symptoms to subside and to go back to the person I was before all this happened.

Sorry for the wall of text, I've never posted on reddit before TL;DR: I used to be able to run into the fire before, but now I cant even bring myself to stand up."

k28vzn,5,2020-11-27,"[USA-IL] I've been dead for 6 years, just a ghost haunting those I knew.",Truth_hurts_forever,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k28vzn/usail_ive_been_dead_for_6_years_just_a_ghost/,"August 1st, 2014. My Master's Thesis was a disaster, I had to sit down in the middle of my presentation because I was so sick. I rushed to urgent care just after and found out I had gastritis, I'd burned away my stomach lining drinking too much. Then when I returned home, my girlfriend of 6 years told me she was leaving, for the other side of the country, in a few days. I had ruined my internship opportunity because of my extreme anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

March, 2016. I became incredibly suicidal and began taking shots and chasing them with my anxiety meds. Eventually I left the bar when I figured it was going to be a much more expensive way of dying than i imagined. Leaving the bar my psychiatrist called and asked me what was happening, I told him the truth, I wasn't going to hurt anyone but didnt want to live. Of course, a wellness check was called in and the police soon showed up. I saw the car and took off. I gave up halfway through a field, drunk and intoxicated, panting. When the officer got to me he immediately put me in an armbar and started walking me to the car. I pulled out my phone to call my dad, I've had very bad experiences with police and wanted help. As soon as he saw me calling, the officer lunged at me trying to grab my phone away. I recoiled and because of PTSD and an increased startle response, I tensed up. This action is what the officer used as context to take me down. In a snowy field, I had his knee on my neck smashing my face into the thick snow. I kept screaming, telling him I'm having a panic attack and cant breathe. His response ""you can talk you can breathe."" After some time of this, I was sure I was going to suffocate and tried to push my way out. I managed to get on my back, but this movement construed as resisting, rather than living, was met with a flurry of full force punches to my eye. I woke up hours later, they'd had to MRI my skull to make sure it wasn't broken. On an upside it was the last day I took a drink.

&amp;#x200B;

2020- Starts being in an institution, and released just a week before the pandemic became grave concern. This year is mired by everything. I went all the way to Mayo Clinic to get a definitive diagnosis and after an intern took 45 minutes, I was told I have:

PTSD

PDD

MDD

GAD

Obsessive thought patterns

BPD

Then I told my parents about how my brother had abused me, repeatedly, during my childhood and was met, with skepticism, then outright denial. I had to explain to them in gruesome detail the things that he had done to me in order to even be validated. And found out that they had known what had happened from the time I was 10 and had never talked to me about it or asked if I was okay. They even pretended to hear it for the first time when I was sent to a ""boarding school"".  Even after explaining everything, they never apologized, never asked how I was or condemned what he did to me. They even got upset at me for refusing to go to his wedding. I spent that night alone in a hotel. When I returned home, they were quick to tell me how great the wedding was, how much fun they had.

&amp;#x200B;

Then #breakingcodesilence came up. I was sent to one of the boarding schools as a child. Subjected to extreme isolation, rules that were meant to demean and humiliate. Staff harassed and insulted us, tackled and manhandled us, they did whatever they wanted with us. One occasion a teammate decided to make a ridiculously horrible comment about our female gym teacher, which was met with hours of sprinting until each one of us threw up. We couldn't look or speak to the opposite sex. They were doing gay conversion therapy on some of my teammates and would humiliate them based on their sexual preference (as teenagers). Having this start trending, brought a flood of memories I'd hidden back to the surface.

Next, my friend from the ""boarding school"" died of liver failure and internal bleeding. His girlfriend had been abusing him for some time and he self medicated with alcohol. The last thing I heard from him was a venmo, for $20 telling me to get myself something nice.

Then on Nov. 1, my birthday, my parents couldn't pretend to pay attention. My dad jumped out of his seat while I was opening my one present (I dont have friends, except my dog) and started screaming at the TV about the bears game. I was so upset that I couldnt have their attention for 5 minutes, on my birthday. Which was followed by the news that my grandpa died, of age and complications of covid.

Now my uncle is in the ICU on oxygen for covid. I still have no friends. I wake up every morning torn between high hopes of what I could achieve, and wishing its my last day here. I can't make any plans after everything fell apart in 2014. I realized that I've really no hope at functioning, at making friends, of being useful. I'm already a failure and don't think that will ever change. I look at the future as either an abject failure waiting to happen, or that I'll be some sort of monster, hurting others around me.

I've tried everything, meds, therapies, supplements, nutrition, exercise. But now I just cant get out of bed. If I get flustered or upset at anything my chest hurts so badly I end up clenching up or doubling over. My memory is shot, I used to be really intelligent (the only thing I'd had going for me) and now I can hardly remember words, or what I did last night. Everything, good and bad that has happened in my life, is so painful to remember that I must have started just eliminating memories all together.

With that, my parents move in 9 months. I have less than $500 to my name. I get so distracted and caught up in my thoughts that I have a really hard time at jobs. And now I have to suddenly function and get a job, build credit, get a place, take care of finances (including the $2-3000 in medical expenses in the past month alone). People tell me they're there for me, but no one talks to me unless they need me to do something for them. And I'm so lost and upset that I can't do things on my own. My poor dog only gets her walks when its dark out because I'm so tired of seeing all these happy people, with money, and homes, and friends and cars and things going for them. I'm so tired of all of this, and the saddest part is I'm too scared to just die. I'm too scared to do anything.

k2bfji,5,2020-11-27,Skipped over for promotion I was all but promised,aperfectopportunity,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k2bfji/skipped_over_for_promotion_i_was_all_but_promised/,"Hoping someone can help me work through this. I’ve worked for 6 years as an A/V coordinator in a media department. I started as a media intern running a camera for live production, and doing sound whenever I got the chance. I have a BS in audio production (which is my specialty), and have been with this company for close to 10 years now. I've done everything from soldering cables to installing/configuring sound consoles. I have a wide berth in other skills as well, ranging from mundane office tasks such as scheduling, to recording original music for podcasts and other productions.

At the beginning of the year, my boss’s boss had a talk with me that those in leadership were not happy with my direct supervisor’s performance.  I have no idea how my supervisor managed to get by for so long, as it was pretty much a known fact that he was incompetent and in way over his head. I inquired about what was going on, as numerous video productions were being outsourced to contractors instead of being done in-house. In this conversation, it was revealed to me that my direct supervisor was going to be fired, and I was asked if I would be willing to move into his position when the time came. I enthusiastically agreed, as I’ve been working towards this role for quite some time. We discussed hiring another videographer to fill the gap, which became more important as COVID-19 shifted our events to streaming rather than in-person.

Knowing I was going to be promoted, I worked even harder than before. I learned how to put on events using Zoom and our video switcher, and did some stellar work setting up hybrid events (in person and streaming simultaneously). I researched my ass off, and made notes of what could use improvement in the department. My skills jumped big time, and I only heard good things regarding my work. I received the news a couple weeks ago that my boss was retiring; I’m guessing he was given the option to gracefully leave instead of being fired. 

A few days ago, I was called into the office to have the conversation regarding my promotion. The meeting started with, “This is probably not going to be what you want to hear.” Not good.

It turns out they hired a videographer to start in January, but decided to make this guy (who has way less experience than me), the media director over the entire department. They offered me a 3K a year raise, and a new title of “Associate Media Director.”

If I was 25 instead of 35, I probably would have given them a one-finger salute and walked out. Instead, I kept my cool and asked questions. When I asked how they came to this decision, the response was pretty much they wanted some “new blood,” and someone more “creative” as the department head. Apparently, I’m seen more as a logical problem solver rather than the creative type. In reality, I’m both… just most of the time the job has required practical problem solving to keep it running smoothly.  I also pointed out how I’ve creatively solved problems during COVID-19, which was acknowledged, but somehow not the right type of creativity in their eyes.

What would you guys do? The promotion is still a step in the right direction for my career, but really feels like a big slap in the face. At this point, I didn’t accept it, nor turn it down. I asked for a bigger raise and am waiting to hear back. I don’t necessarily want to leave as the job has a lot of perks; I have a great crew, access to high-end equipment, work from home 2-3 days a week, and pretty much make my own schedule. I’ve been “unofficially” in charge of all the audio for quite some time, and this promotion makes that official. My pride is all kinds of hurt though, and I’ve lost all trust in those above me. Working under someone new, and possibly underqualified, will be very difficult for all those involved."

This is my first ever and I am not sure if what I am doing is right. I have no experience at all in any tech company related to software. This will be my first internship. I will be taking no classes because it is full time.

I've been thinking hard about where I'd like to take my career after graduation, and U of T's master of computer science program caught my eye. However, I'm well aware that U of T is in a league of its own when compared to other universities across the country and getting accepted is no joke. I'd like to make the most of the next two and a half years to have a real shot at getting in, so any advice at all is greatly appreciated.

Based on my research so far, these are the conclusions I've come to:

* A good GPA is important, but not everything
* An impressive resume with relevant experience is crucial
* Most applicants have prior research experience, publications, and strong letters of recommendation
* It's a good idea to network and get in touch with professors at U of T

Below is some background about me, so you have a better idea of where I currently stand and where there is room for improvement.

At the moment, my GPA when converted to U of T's 4.0 scale is 3.5, which I believe is on the lower end of the minimum requirements. I'm fairly confident I can get this to a 3.7 or above by the time graduation comes around.

My resume at the moment is pretty good (according to me of course). I spent my first and second years gaining experience as a web developer in various campus jobs, and I'm currently halfway through a 16-month software engineering internship with IBM. I've participated in a few hackathons and come out with some very cool projects, but I've yet to win one. I've also been heavily involved in various extracurricular activities since first year, where I've put my technical expertise to use and worked my way up to executive positions.

I have no research experience, which it seems is essential. I plan to reach out to some professors when I return to school in September to see if I can get involved in some research during my last 2 years at Ryerson. I'm not sure if U of T offers research positions for students at different institutions, but perhaps this is something someone here can shed some light on.

As for building relationships with U of T professors, I plan to cold-email and request zoom chats on LinkedIn for now. When this whole global pandemic thing comes to a close (which is hopefully soon), I'll try attending some networking events as well.

Is there anything essential that I'm missing, or would dramatically improve my chances in such a competitive environment? If you or someone you know is in the program, I would love to hear more about what a good applicant looks like."

My initial thought was that it was like an internship like we are used to. Go work for ""x"" amount of time for little to no pay, but for resume experience.

This doesn't seem to be the case. These Ambassador positions are long term, no pay, practically part time jobs, and in some cases... full time. 


I wondered if this was truly the case, so I ""applied"" to one in a STEM field I'm interested in , and is also a hobby of mine just to see what these were about.

The reply of ""welcome to the team"" came about a day later. They specifically noted that there would be no pay for this work, and benefits are in the works. 

The requirements they listed out:

-Attend weekly or monthly meetings as assigned. 
-Share on Social Media whatever the Business Manager tells you to share.
-Share the work you do at XYZ with family and friends.
-Accept jobs and duties as assigned.
-Manage XYZ's social media account one week at a time on a rotating schedule with other ambassadors

Etc etc. 

Lots of menial tasks and some bigger things they could be paying a social media manager for, or even an entry level business development specialist.

I drew the line with my volunteer position (let's call it what it is) when they asked me to develop a project and run a volunteer team of 30+  people as an ""ambassador."" They then tried to bribe me with a ""free"" membership to their organization (value $75 USD) to stay.

It seems to me that these companies are preying on young adults, and in most cases from what I've seen, older adults looking to make a career change... offering them work, but no pay. I wasn't one of these adults, but it made me sick to see so many of them hopeful that they will somehow with this experience leverage it into a good paying job in a field where more than a good understanding of the topics is required.


So... the big question here is:

Are Ambassador positions in companies the same as internships or something a bit more sinister? Or are they a blip on the radar of the career world and a passing fad?"

I'm currently a final year cybersecurity student at poly. I had been quite active participating in some hackathons and internship stuff. Learning new technology/concepts during free time. I find that I am quite strong in IT fundamentals, able to apply the tech and finish assignments.

However, there are times where I felt that I am not realizing my full potential, contribute less than I could be able to, and not work as well as some of my friends due to my poor communication skills. I feel that SMU benefits more by grooming me as a person and career-wise as compared to NUS where poor social skills may slow me down on improving myself.

SMU IS:

* Though not suit my more technical styles, the environment can force me to better improve comm and presentation skill. They also have a compulsory comm module
* Easier to find friends due to the smaller class size
* Close Connections to industry
* More towards business less technical

NUS CS

* Fits my geeky style, understand deeper concepts though my IT fundamentals are alr sufficient to work in a company
* Find similar people like me
* Prestige (less important)
* Cheaper fees (less important)

I intend to go for SMU with a scholarship (have a good GPA and CCA points), but scare that I had missed out on some important factors that I haven't consider. All insights and suggestions are appreciated! Thanks, guys."
k2j4rx,88,2020-11-28,Building your personal wealth,[deleted],uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/k2j4rx/building_your_personal_wealth/,"After reading that other thread where everyone was competing to see who was the most middle class, I wanted to share something my dad taught me that Michigan will never teach you unless you happen to be in Ross, Econ, or IOE.

For the record, my dad is a doctor.  We wouldn’t be considered middle class by any reasonable standard, but he came from an actual lower middle class household, worked his ass off in college and medical school, and continues to work his ass off for every dollar he earns.  He didn’t inherit anything, nor did he have any privileges besides two loving parents that encouraged him to succeed.  Now that he is where he is though, he gave me the advice that he follows and recommends that I follow, and I think other people could benefit from that advice.

[This philosophy is how the rich get and stay rich.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page)  It’s kind of a lot of material that you should read on your own, but the summary is that you, a Michigan student, can build up your own wealth by making smart choices.  If you’re financially able to, the most important thing you can do is open a Roth IRA.  There’s a lot of math that goes into it, but if you were to contribute $1,000 a year to a Roth IRA invested in S&amp;P 500 or broad market ETFs, you would have $200,000 when it’s time to retire.  By contrast, if you put that money in savings, you would only have $40,000.  According to data published by the university, the average salary of a CS student is $60,000 starting.  That means you’d be putting away less than 2% of your yearly income, assuming you never get a raise, promotion, or advance your career in any way.  

If you become even slightly more successfully, you can contribute up to $6,000 a year to a Roth IRA, which would be worth 1.2 million after 40 years, plus you can set up backdoor Roth accounts, 401ks, 529 accounts, HSAs, and all kinds of other accounts that will grow tax free.  Tax free growth at 6-8% a year (stock market average) will typically double your initial investment every ten years.  It may possible to make significantly more than that in the short run with options trading or penny stocks, but according to the efficient market hypothesis, no one can outperform the market in the long run, so it makes the most sense to follow the market.

You don’t have to already be wealthy to take advantage of this stuff.  You just have to budget judiciously and make smart career choices.  

There’s all kinds of other useful information on that website, covering asset protection, insurance, taxes, emergency fund planning, and living below your means.  For all the bullshit classes we’re required to take as Michigan students, one would think they’d have everyone learn about this kind of stuff, but since they don’t, the only way you’ll ever hear about it is if someone tells you about it.  I don’t know how many people on here already know about this, but if even one person learns something new, I’ll be happy.

On a final note, this isn’t a get rich quick scheme, nor are any outcomes ever guaranteed.  There are people who make all the right choices and still get screwed over, and there are assholes who happened to pick the right stock or bet on the right number or sports team.  With that said, this is the most optimal financial strategy.  The math and statistics don’t lie.

Edit: I’m a dumbass and can’t read a graph.  The $60,000 figure is for internships prorated to a year. The average starting salary in CS is actually $99,000. My point still stands though that this advice is applicable to people that are actually middle class, in the range of $60,000 a year."

The internship has now ended, and I have working/waiting for a few weeks now. We haven't signed any new contracts, as my manager seems to have a wait-and-see attitude in terms of offering me a full time job. 

To be fair, he's had conversations where he's told me that they're still working on it (the full-time offer), and has asked me if I wanted to wait-- to which I originally agreed to as I thought that it would be brief. It's been a couple of weeks with have been no updates, and now I no longer want to take up this possible full-time offer. 

How do I politely let them know that I have changed my mind, and start the handover/off-boarding process? I can't use the excuse of having another opportunity because I don't have one yet.

k2l1t2,2,2020-11-28,HELP! I need advice on how to deal with a crazy obsessive girl,WizardKixx4,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k2l1t2/help_i_need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_a_crazy/,"&amp;amp;#x200B;

TL: DR Girl with an unhealthy obsession with me is following me to my University and creating false rumors about me so she can steal my scholarship money. 

To understand this story, I need to first give you guys some background information. I've also changed all the names and locations for the sake of privacy. 

I've been going to this church for a while; I learned about it through a former crush (now very close friend) named Daisy. The first time I visited was years ago, and Daisy introduced me to her friend Jordan. Now Jordan isn't what we would call a ""looker"" by any means. She definitely isn't the prettiest girl out there, nor the thinnest. As a result, she has pretty bad body issues and has terrible mental health. Jordan is also mildly autistic, not so much that she cannot take care of herself but enough where she doesn't know how to read a room or properly express her emotions. She had started to develop feelings for me, and I did not reciprocate. She had her friend text me at some point, and I politely responded I was not interested. Jordan did not take it well and proceeded to blow up my phone and have a complete meltdown. I soon left that church not long after that for unrelated reasons.

Fast-forward a couple of years, I ended up going back to that church again through my friend Daisy and got to see Jordan again. I became friends with her little by little, not very close friends who go grab lunch, but not strangers either. As I mentioned earlier, she is mildly autistic and doesn't really understand how to convey emotions well. So I realized that she had a crush on me, at first. It was not a problem. I would just humor her by texting her back and just being a nice person overall. I knew many guys don't give her the time of day, and it didn't cost me anything to be nice. However, she took this to mean that I liked her, which was not valid. Over the last year, her feelings towards me have gone from a mild crush to a full-blown unhealthy obsession. She would text me 3 times a day, always bother me, and make me extremely uncomfortable. I tried to be cool about it and not let it get to me; however, it became increasingly harder. The last straw about 1 1/2 months ago when she texted me that her mom was ""forcing her"" to look at Christian Colleges out of state even though she was already dead set on the local college where we live. I had already been accepted to a very prestigious Christian College, named Liberty University, out of state. So I asked her which ones she had been looking at, and the only college she named, and it was Liberty University. However, I talked to her and said, ""Oh, they don't offer the major you're looking for,"" but she only responded, ""Oh, I changed my mind. I want to be a Graphic Designer now"" (Even though she had been dead set on being an engineer not even 2 weeks prior). However, I swept it under the rug and actively tried to not bring it up again. Until about a week and a half later, I talked to Daisy and said, ""Hey, you know Kaila already committed to Liberty University, right."" I absolutely blew my lid; how can someone be so dead against going to this school not even a week and a half ago and now be committing to going there. Apparently, Daisy had let it slip that I was going to Liberty, and now that was the only school on Jordan's radar. Daisy and I both independently concluded the main reason she wanted to go to Liberty was that I was going there. We later found out this was 100% true. 

From that point on, I dropped the Mr. Nice guy look, stopped responding to her texts, and actively tried to avoid her when I saw her in person. However, she only saw this as trying to play hard to get and texted me more than usual and came up to me more frequently. It was getting so bad that she could do anything, even something as harmless as saying ""hello,"" and It would just absolutely ruin my day. So one day, I confronted her and took her aside and said as gently as I could, ""Hey, I know you like me romantically, but you have to understand that I do not like you like that"" She took it surprisingly well, and I thought that was the end of it. Oh, boy, was I wrong. The month she was insulting and cold towards me, I don't care about her opinions, so didn't bother me at all. However, she did mention lies about me to our fellow students and to some church leaders. This part really bothered me because I also volunteer for the church and depend on my volunteering to receive Scholarship money. Money I won't get if I have a bad reputation. I heard she was spreading lies and was talking badly to others about me behind my back. 

For unrelated reasons, I wouldn't attend church for the next month (Had to tour my university and go help a friend). I talked to my Pastor and gave him an appropriate amount of heads up, and I also told my close friends and our student leaders that I had to go and they could not depend on me for a little while. I told them I was fine and would see them soon. I did not tell Jordan because 1) I would not consider her a friend by any means 2) I really like my privacy and don't think it's necessary to tell everyone unless it personally affects them (Ex: My pastor and our leaders). However, over the next couple of week, I keep getting texts from her always along the same lines, ""I know you probably don't want to talk to me, but I hope you're ok, you don't have to say what's wrong"" I barley responded to them, and even when I did, I stayed super vague. However, yesterday she sent me a whole essay over text, and I will share it with you now. 

""I've had a lot of time to think and wonder about what is going on with you. You're probably suffering with a lot rn. Pushing people away won't help tho. Myrtle advised me not to say this bc you'll shut down according to her, but it needs to be said. You going MIA for weeks is not cool. You have responsibilities and people depending on you. You've got Lily depending on you to be a co-captain. You've got Pastor Carl depending on you as his student intern. You've got me and Ted and Marshall and Barney because we depend on you as a part of the hospitality, worship, and recreational team. You want to be a pastor. If something goes wrong in your life and you do this, you will let so many people in the church down. Things like this need to be learned now. Through my thinking, I've also thought did you become a Christian because you realized your brokenness and was wanting to turn away, or was it to get Daisy? Were you really saved? I can think different outcomes, but that doesn't mean it's true. What I'm trying to say here is I'm so concerned and worried that I think about it a lot because I'm legit worried. I care for you so much as your friend, you don't even know or care to know. But you know what? Me caring about you doesn't seem to do anything anymore. Part of me wants to just throw in the towel and give up on you because it doesn't seem worth it anymore; however I don't want to give up. This is the last text I will give you until you come back or text me or give any sign that you're still alive or whatever. You'll get through this bc I know you are strong, but you're stronger through the Lord. Goodnight""

I haven't responded, and I don't think I will. A lot of the things she said in that text are also blatantly false. I spoke with Pastor Carl and Ted and Daisy that they could not count on me. All of the work I do for the church is completely unpaid, and I can leave anytime I want, and Pastor Carl has let me know that many times. It seems like she made many assumptions and made a big deal about something that was none of her business, to begin with. To me it also seems that she is using the mask that ""she cares so much about me"" to hide her true obsession.

I'm just really lost on what to do with her going forward. If I could, I would just be the bad guy and harshly cut her out of my life. However, she is very well connected with our church, and it seems like she's dead set on ruining my good reputation. I fear if I cut her out, she may only ruin my reputation more and spread more lies about me. She wants my scholarship money, and I wouldn't put it past her to tell lies to make me lose it, so they can give it to her. If I continue to put up with her, I feel like I'll only keep enabling her and indirectly telling her that her behavior is acceptable. In the past, I've talked to my pastor about her and how she makes me feel, but it was all over stupid stuff like she annoys me or she texts me too much. By the looks of it, it seems like I am probably going to have to deal with her all through university, which doesn't bother me cuz college is big. I'm just more worried about what she tells others and how she will continue to ruin my reputation and possibly cost me thousands of dollars in scholarships. What do I do?"

My gpa is slightly above 3.2, on my way to getting it up to a 3.3. I am experienced with programming, mainly in Python, but I learned Java as well. I had done a small project that involved publishing a Python package, and am currently doing a project on robotics programming also in Python. But besides these, I don’t have an internship (currently looking for it) nor job experience. 

My biggest concern is about the Java data structure class and the statistics classes that I had taken. While I could get A’s in data science classes, I got C+’s in my statistics and data structure class.  My problem was that I had gotten really high scores on my programming assignments, but I performed badly on the exams, which weighted a lot and brought my grades down. Those classes also had low class average gpa’s.

Does not having any job experience, and doing bad in a data structure class, lower my chances of getting in? Can I explain the reason for not doing well in the data structure class in my application? I am pretty worried and I would greatly appreciate any feedback from you. Thank you!"

I loved all of my classes, learning to write code was heavily enjoyable and I felt proud of accomplishing my schoolwork with high grades alongside part-time jobs. Those jobs included several positions in a restaurant (started at the bottom as a server, ended up a manager at the end), a shift manager at a retail store, and an intern at a cleaning products supplier(database related, so finally something close to what I went to school for). Now after graduating I work for a rather large company here in the US, RELX Inc, working alongside LexisNexis employees as another intern providing tech support. 

At first, I loved the job. Things were easy to understand with what they expected of me and how to work from home thanks to COVID-19. But as the months went on, I realized I am getting paid to be at home playing video games or working on schoolwork (*I decided to go back for a dual major, more tech degrees*). It bothers me as I feel like I am not going anywhere. I play games and offer assistance that is not often taken up, either because I have no knowledge of how to assist or I am just not acknowledged by my fellow workers. A lot of the things we (myself and the other 2 interns) would have been learning would have been in office to assist the other workers and be shadowing them for hands-on experience.

I feel like these months, from May until November, will amount to no experience to be gained on my part. I feel like someone who is kept on the payroll for no good reason and I have no clue what to do to fix this feeling inside myself. People tell me to ride it out as long as possible to keep the pay coming in (*I heavily enjoy the pay, the highest I have ever been paid before*) but I want to earn skills to improve myself, to feel like I am actually working and that I went to school for a reason, not to just waste money.

I send out emails that will eventually get put into a program script, but outside of that, it's just fighting for simple phone upgrade/new phone order tickets. 6 months of once a week emails and maybe one ticket a week. (*I ""work"" and get paid 40 hours a week, the actual work I do is less than 2 hours a week*) Any advice at all is appreciated, as I do not know what to do."

Beyond imposter syndrome?,hotdogcityleague,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k2pkpg/adhd_and_adderall_identity_problems_beyond/,"I have a question that has bothered me for a while now. I was dx with ADHD combined age 7, then again but inattentive type age 25. I have been on adderall since age 19, before starting undergrad. With some time off in between. 

I can’t help but feel like I have been successful because of the adderall. In high school I never tried. I passed and graduated by doing the bare minimum. Fast forward to college and me starting adderall and I start doing very well. Then I got sick and had to leave undergrad a year early (unrelated, I developed an eating disorder). 

However, I went back. Graduated. Found an internship my senior year—that led me to being awarded an NSF summer internship in 2018, then a post-bac job after, that prepared me for getting into a competitive phd program for clinical psychology. 

Well, after two years of working my ass off as a research coordinator at a university medical center—I finally got into a top choice phd program for clinical psych this February. It’s what I’ve always wanted. 

However, I don’t feel like I could have gotten where I have without the adderall and even worse I don’t know how I will ever stop taking it. I took two months off from taking it last year and my boss thought I was depressed. I couldn’t get any work done. No motivation. I just fear going off the adderall. I know it will take a year or more to be off of it and reach homeostasis again and I just don’t know if I have that kind of time? Especially not at least for 5-6 years after completing my PhD. 

Tl;dr: does anyone relate? Has anyone experienced this and come out the other side? 

Another side note is the adderall is starting to really hinder me. It makes my drinking worse. It’s like I jump from one stimulating addiction to the next. I used to be focused on my eating disorder, now that addiction is alcohol. I realize I have a psychological addiction to the adderall, but I don’t know what to do, because it does help me as well as hurt me."

The only issue is that I don’t have experience in IT (except for 4 month IT busi analyst internship from when I was in college) so I’m hoping this could help me get my foot in the door. 

What I am curious about is the job outlook, post-certification, and how well it equipped you for that role. Can anyone speak on that?"

I am set to complete 7 years of working after graduating out of college. I plan to travel the world for a year or so before diving back into adulting and all the responsibilities that entails. However I love science, and I wish to pursue a research or work closely with the ones who are doing research in the area of understanding genome for upto half of my world tour.

My profile is as follows

* 7 years of experience as data scientist. Mostly startups in the later half
* Have experience solving hard problems from business using ML + Stat techniques
* Extremely comfortable in python. Can understand node.js / java codebases. Have deployed multiple ML applications in production via AWS. Used Elasticsearch too
* A undergraduate degree from one of the best universities in our country (India)
* Have done multiple courses on bioinformatics. Understand algorithms for how next-gen sequencing works.

I am hoping my IT experience will come in handy. I am not arrogant enough to assume i will be able to good research within that short a time. My intentions are more to work closely with the people who are doing so and experience working on the forefront of science.

My question is how do I go about applying to top labs around the world (Europe/UK) for a short stint ? Is it even possible ?

TL;DR : Looking for &lt;6 month genomic research internship after 7 years of startup developer + ML experience.

Thanks in advance"

I changed my major to Computer Science since I enjoyed programming more and found that there are more lucrative and fulfilling careers in software over cyber security (at least for me). I've been programming since I was 10, and love it. I took a B.A. in CS over a B.S. because both didn't necessarily require higher math courses. With taking a B.A. I was able to graduate a full year ahead of schedule and will hopefully be finishing both my major and minor next semester. 

However, I haven't taken past Calc I which is ridiculous for a CS major, and I'm worried this may affect my future career. I talked to my professor and she said it should be fine if I'm not planning on working in a heavily math related area of the field (algorithm design, embedded systems, etc.) but I'm still worried. 

I'm considering not taking an internship this summer and just taking math courses at my local community college. I've done an internship ever year of college, and have two relevant ones. One as a cyber security analyst for a large fortune 50 company, and another as a backend developer for a small non-profit. I have a really great GPA (made dean's list) and excel in the CS courses at my college. My school is also pretty good, I trust all of my professors and the classes are rigorous, so I'm not super concerned with the quality of my CS courses. However, the lack of math is alarming considering how much it can be used in the field.

 I'm now looking at getting more competitive internships and setting my sights on landing a solid job after graduation (big banks, big tech companies, or the government) and I'm worried this lack of education may come back to bite in technical interviews or in the job itself. 

Does anyone have any input on this? Should I bother taking math courses externally?"

Hello --

I am 24 years old and roughly 1 year out of college. Throughout college, I did numerous IT Support internships and gained some great experience. I was able to accept a job right after college -- but my role was impacted by COVID.

 The company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity.

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects.

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off.

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. My drive for supporting end-users and putting out fires is fading. 

It hit me hard in the few months that I was unemployed, the only positions I was getting called about or leads for were low-level Help Desk jobs for a lot less pay than I was making. It was a real wakeup call that I landed a very lucky gig out of college... but on the job market... I am extremely low level. I took a ""Customer Support Specialist"" job in the meantime that will pay the bills while I can dedicate and focus on studying for certs. I am motivated to start skilling up.

So, where do I start? My first thought was to grab the Azure Administrator Associate AZ-103 certification. I did some of the training for the Fundamentals exam and found the Cloud super interesting. I really was thinking about going down the Cloud route. I passed the Comptia Cloud Essentials+ certification recently. 

I was also thinking about learning Linux as my Linux skills are very base level. I was looking at grabbing the LPI Linux Essentials to get the basics of Linux down and on my resume and move on to studying like the RHCSA or LFCS. 

I am so lost in my career and really need some suggestions or someone to talk to and get on a good path.

Here is my mock resume for a reference of my background. This is NOT what I apply to jobs with [MOCK RESUME](https://imgur.com/a/yN7UAE5)"

* Why I want an MBA: I enjoy the concept of being a software engineer for a few years, but I really don't see myself coding for more than 10-15 years. I'd like to have more flexibility and ability to move into management roles. I also may move back to my home country at some point, where graduate degrees are more valuable in upper-level positions than they are in the US. I've also audited some classes at my university's MBA program and enjoyed them a lot more than my undergrad coursework, which I've found to be overly theoretical.
* Why I want one now: I don't! I'm applying to deferred MBA programs. I'll be a software engineer for about four years first. 
* Target schools: Any deferred program. CBS, Sloan, Haas, Darden, IESE YTP, Booth, Kellogg, Wharton, Emory, HBS

**Background**

* Work experience: 
   * Software engineering internship at a small company sophomore summer
   * Software engineering internship at a somewhat young company (5-10 years) junior summer that's recently become more of a household name, where I'll be working full-time
* ECs and other experience:
   * CS-focused project that received media attention in some national newspapers
   * 2 student jobs as a CS TA (semester each), 1 CS-focused part time job (1 year), 2 random student jobs (each about 2 years)
   * 3 years of volunteering
   * CS department student advisor (working with professors/chairs)
   * Smaller clubs (not academics focused), was president of one for a year and team lead in another
   * Forté Foundation conferences
   * Several small outside scholarships
* Undergrad school/major: T10 Ivy, Computer Science
* Other education/coursework: 
   * Study abroad that wasn't counted toward my GPA, but had a 4.0 there
   * CS and math coursework at small local college, also 4.0 there
* Race/nationality: White, US and European citizenship
* Sex: F

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 710 mock (48Q, 40V)
   * I can definitely improve this. It was my first ever mock before any studying, and I only missed data sufficiency questions and sentence correction. I'll be studying all of winter break and I'll hopefully take the online GMAT in late January.
* Undergrad GPA: \~3.4
   * I was quite sick sophomore spring-junior fall, which did impact my grades and ECs. I know applications have space for explaining extenuating circumstances, but should I just write an explanation on my own or get some sort of doctor's explanation? 
   * Working also pulled away from my study time, but I don't think this is worth mentioning

**Other Q's**

If I don't get into a program now, what should I do to position myself better when I reapply, in 3-4 years? I've looked into maybe doing Tuck Business Bridge and HBS CORe in a year or two, Forté's MBA Launch before applying, and my future company has been growing rapidly and I may get a decent promotion in that time. I'll also probably volunteer with a focus on CS education. 

I'm also a first gen/low income background student, and I've noticed some programs, especially HBS 2+2, have preferences for STEM and students with a lower socio-economic background. Should I prioritize any of the schools I mentioned based on the profiles of students they accept?

Should I request fee waivers? If it wasn't clear already, I'm mildly broke until I start my job in July, but I'm kind of paranoid about it after I saw my undergrad admissions file and the first thing they wrote was ""requested fee waiver."""

I am a CS major but the majority can apply to other majors, main difference would be if you took more science courses which could make Revelle better or if you enjoy writing.

My main focus is to spend as less time on general education requirements as possible and not negatively affecting my grade (which I imagine aligns with most people’s view) so I researched and incorporated individual course difficulty.

I will complete full IGETC with only two science (biology, chemistry, physics) courses which are physics

1. [Sixth](https://sixth.ucsd.edu/academics/requirements/transfer-requirements.html#If-you-have-IGETC:) \- One writing course (CAT 125/CAT 125R&lt;online version&gt;) and one practicum which can be fulfilled by AIP 197 (internship program which can be P/NP).
2. [John Muir](https://muir.ucsd.edu/academics/degree_reqs.html#Transfer-Students-and-General-E) – One writing course (MCWP 125 or MCWP 50).
3. [Seventh](https://seventh.ucsd.edu/academics/degree-requirements/index.html#Intersegmental-General-Educatio) – One project-based course (SYN 100) letter grade only, and one high-impact course which can be fulfilled by AIP 197.
4. [Earl Warren](https://warren.ucsd.edu/academics/general-education/index.html#With-IGETC/UC-or-4-Year-Recipro) – one writing course (WCWP 100) and two upper division courses outside of your major discipline (Can be taken P/NP).
5. [Thurgood Marshall](https://marshall.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-advising/transfer-agreements.html#IGETC-or-Partial-IGETC-certific) – two Upper Division Disciplinary Breadth courses, one of which must include significant writing, one of which can be fulfilled by public service which includes AIP 197.
6. [Eleanor Roosevelt](https://roosevelt.ucsd.edu/academics/gen-ed/index.html#IGETC-or-Partial-IGETC-Certific) – two writing courses (MMW 121 &amp; MMW 122)
7. [Revelle](https://revelle.ucsd.edu/academics/new-students/igetc.html) \- 2 calculus courses, 1 each in bio, chem, physics, and 2 from any of the 3 science disciplines.

Some extra info:

1. Muir would be first for many people. I put Muir second because of the memes of your grade is completely determined by your TA, which can range from really chill to incredibly tedious, grade goes anywhere between C and A. Keep in mind that the excess amount of complaint could be because more people take the course. It is also more or less the same for other classes but for CAT 125/CAT 125R the comments make it sound easier.
2. MCWP 125 is upper div while MCWP 50 is lower div so it should be easier.
3. I don’t mind the work of AIP as much since I’m a CS major.
4. Seventh is a new college so there’s limited (actually none I could find online) information on difficulty of SYN 100.
5. Housing doesn’t matter since you’re a transfer.
6. Warren was praised for STEM majors (my #2 choice at first) but it seems to be worse for transfers.
7. Some sections that are fulfilled by AIP can be fulfilled through various ways, so do some extra research.

**Above information is subject to errors and please double-check to be sure.**

Corrections are welcome.

You can ask any additional questions and I will answer if I can.

Edit: Seventh college cannot be applied to this year as a transfer"

k311dy,2,2020-11-28,CS Grad first job options (UK),throwaway_a_throw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k311dy/cs_grad_first_job_options_uk/,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I would like to have some opinions on what to do for my first job out of Uni since I'm not quite sure what to go for. First, I should probably explain my situation: I'm a final year student doing an integrated Masters in CS at a top Uni in the UK. It's worth noting that I'm expecting to get a 2.1 (I think that equates to a 3.5 GPA) so I wouldn't say I've done perfectly at Uni but not bad either. I have done several Software Engineering internships in the past:

 - 1 for an entire year before Uni in my home town that basically paid minimum wage
 - 2 summer internships at the closest large city paying about 25k
 - 1 summer internship in London at a fairly large multinational company paying 32k

Now, when I was in London life wasn't particularly fun because I wanted to be relatively close to work to avoid the crowded and hot summer Tube so I found a very miserable house share for £800 in Zone 2 and I was basically alone since none of my friends had internships then. That kinda gave me an idea for how much money you actually need to live comfortably in London and that's definitely way above 32k.

Here's my current situation: many of my friends have found jobs for next August/September in London, mostly at FAANG or at FinTech companies. We're currently sharing a house for the academic year and we're fairly confident we wouldn't mind sharing one once we graduate but some of them have expressed a strong preference to find a house within walking distance of their jobs, i.e. in Zone 1 or near the edge of Zones 1 and 2. Me and one other guy are the only uncertain ones for now. These are the companies I have made progress with:

 1. I have finished and have been given an offer at a start-up dealing with very cutting-edge technology that I'm interested in but the issue is that the starting salary is 45k along with some stocks valued at around 5k. Their office is in Zone 2/3 so I'd have to commute by Tube. However I have no idea how long the HR person who I've chatted with is willing to wait for me to accept or if they'll even wait. They haven't said anything regarding acceptance deadlines which is why I'm worried about overextending.
 2. I have finished interviews and have been accepted by a larger multi-national company for a generic Software Engineering position and they should give me a final offer soon^tm. I've sent an email asking them if they can hurry up with that and I'll likely call them on Monday afternoon if they don't send me anything by then. According to GlassDoor they pay 60k/year for grads. The office is in Zone 1.
 3. I have a final interview with another company on Wednesday for another generic Software Engineering position, maybe a bit more DevOps-ish. I feel quite confident about the interview and believe that I shouldn't have issues passing it. That company is in another city but has very good transport links to London. This means that any accommodation that I find there will be significantly cheaper, as well as transportation in general since I can just bike to work since the town isn't big. According to GlassDoor they pay 40k/year for grads.
 4. I have 1 or 2 more interviews at a FinTech company in London. The other interviews I did with them were very challenging, though, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep impressing them. On the other hand, I am aware that even their grad positions are really well paid, like 100k+ well-paid. I'm not at all enthusiastic about working in FinTech, mostly for moral reasons, and I feel like that would prevent me from performing the fullest there. The office is in Zone 1.
 5. I have only done an HR interview with a mid-sized VC-backed company, again in London. The HR person said that their hiring team is flooded with applications and will try to schedule any technical interviews when possible although that was before I had an offer. The line of work seems much more interesting than companies 2, 3, and 4 but maybe not as much as 1. I already applied for an internship there one year but got rejected after the final interview. According to GlassDoor they pay 70k+ for grads. The office is in Zone 1.
 6. About 2 dozen other companies where my CV is still under review. I think I have a chance with some of those companies since I bet most of them process applications for grad positions in the next few months.

It's worth noting that I've sent an email to all relevant companies that I have received an offer although that happened on Friday evening.

So I'm kinda stuck rn. I would gladly work for the first company if the salary was higher but I failed to negotiate anything better, especially considering that I don't have any offers yet. So if I have to give like 60+% of my salary for accommodation that'd suck big time. Option 2 is probably my safest choice but I doubt I'd enjoy my work too much long-term. I don't have strong opinions on Option 3 but I might as well go through with it since all that's left is a 1-hour interview. Options 4 and 5 are what I'll go for if option 1 times out and I have enough time allowed from Option 2, ideally opting 5 over 4 because of the kind of work I'd do.

That was a lot of text but basically what I want to know from other people on here:

 1. Which company would you go for in this situation?
 2. Do you think that going for a startup as a first job is a good idea?
 3. If going for a company other than the 1st two how would you convince the HR person to set or extend a deadline with minimal chance of them dropping their offer or pissing them off in general? Not having a backup would suck big time.
 4. How much do you think I would need to make to have a comfortable life in London on top of accommodation? I think I should expect to pay about £1500/month for a decent place which leaves me with ~£1100 at 45k for everything else but idk if it's enough long-term.

Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom, you're the real MVP."

Here's the deal: 'm currently a sophomore in HS and trying to lay out my options. I'm a straight A student, taking too many APs for my sanity, and am deciding between three options for my future. Bear in mind that: I'm hellbent on graduating college with little to no debt &amp; definitely not on my mom's hard-earned dime, which means I'm a bit budget-oriented, I have my own apt. alone, so my family has no problem with me moving anywhere in the country, and I'm classified as OOS everywhere atm because I've lived overseas most of my life.

Option 1: Continue w/ the academic schedule I crafted for HS - 6 APs a yr., clinch those summer internships, try to win more national awards, then apply as a freshman to Cal and my other faves.

Option 2: Test out of HS (possible, I already checked) and go straight to CC when I'm 16 (next fall) - attempt to transfer to UW CS after 2 years. Yes, I'm from Seattle, but the admission rate is absurdly low for transfer CS so it's not a sure thing at all that I'd get in.

Option 3: Test out of HS, move to CA and go CCC to UC (Berkeley hopefully, but if not TAG to Davis). This is the choice I'm leaning toward, as I would be over the moon to get into Cal (or Davis) but I know I'd rather save some money along the way.

I also appreciate the CC plans because I could enter the work force earlier by 2 yrs., and I'm quite into financial security...err fat stacks.

Do you guys think my California plan is deranged, viable, or have any other input/alterations? Thank you in advance!!!"

I recently graduated from a well-regarded political science school in Washington, DC, where I majored in political science and minored in communications. I'm drawn to political communications, specifically digital communications (social media) because it's a new way to engage people and it's clearly effective (look at AOC).

I've been published in 3 academic journals and I've had 7 internships working in political non-profits and campaigns. My grades aren't the best (3.34 cumulative), but I've gotten no lower than a B+ for all of my major and minor related courses. I also studied abroad in Brussels fall of my junior year, where I interned for a women's political organization.

The only weak spot is my grades, but even then, I do way better in courses that are related to my major and minor. I plan on taking a few years off to work and gain more experience, and I certainly don't plan on going to school until the pandemic is over. I'm a very strong writer, so I'm not all that worried about my personal statement. I've also stayed close with a tenured professor since graduating, who I plan on asking to write me a letter of recommendation That said, what are my chances of getting in?"

k35e1t,25,2020-11-29,What are some things you can do to make you less replaceable in your career?,[deleted],UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/k35e1t/what_are_some_things_you_can_do_to_make_you_less/,"I somewhat regret majoring in international business. Most of the course material, I probably could have self-learned. It was a fun major, and I met a lot of cool people, but I feel like it would have been better as a minor. I’m not sure if I got any employable skills from my major.

Come to think of it, between when I first declared my major and now, I don’t know if my coursework taught me a single skill that would be useful in a job - not even an Excel feature. I learned cool business facts, and I learned about financial investments, but I’m not sure there’s a single thing I couldn’t do before that I can now do because I learned about it in major classes.

I interned in a couple places, but those internships mostly gave me basic stuff to do, like editing press releases. The experiences were good, but if I hadn’t been there, I feel like it would have been easy to find someone else to do the same work.

The problem with that kind of job is that the employees are really easily replaceable. So under new management, it’s perfectly possible you’d get the boot and they’d hire someone else, and the company wouldn’t suffer at all.

I’m not sure about this, but I feel like structural engineers probably have more job security, because structural engineering probably teaches you way more employable skills as a major. A company can’t just fire one structural engineer, and easily pick from 20 others who happen to be looking for a new job. The skills that a structural engineer has are not easy to get (especially by self-learning), so I would assume it’s not as easy to replace structural engineers.

But for someone who has no employable skills that are hard to replace, what can we do in order to improve our chances of landing a secure job?

I have gotten a job offer from one of the places I interned at, and they’re offering me $4,200 per month to work on press releases. I worry about a situation in which the company downsizes, I need to find another job, the only experience I have is in editing press releases, and it turns out all the other companies are struggling in kind.

What can people (without ~~irreplaceable skills~~ *skills that are not easily replaceable*) do to improve their job security?

EDIT: I agree with one of the comments saying that no employee is truly irreplaceable. Anyone could theoretically be replaced, but some employees are harder to replace than others are. With the job I’ve been offered, finding someone else to do the same work would be really easy, because TBH the job is kind of easy.


Think of value like this, and I hate to be morbid. If “Sophia” were to die in a car accident, obviously her friends and family would be really sad, but how much would her employer care? Depending on what she does for the company, they might either say “oh fuck, now we have to find someone else who can do the same things, and it’s going to be really hard to find,” OR they’ll say “no problem, employee #1293 left for some reason we don’t care about. We already have 300 more applicants lined up wanting to take that spot, and she never had any skills that were too hard to replace anyway.” I feel like you can still make it in the “hard to replace” category, not through coursework alone, but through other means. Ideas I’m gathering are certifications and getting to know management and others in the company."

k37few,11,2020-11-29,I am terribly indecisive and losing my mind. Please help,riggadahigga,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/k37few/i_am_terribly_indecisive_and_losing_my_mind/,"Hey guys, I'm having so much trouble making a decision, and the options in front of me keep going back and forth in my mind like a ping pong match. This has been going on for the past 3 to 4 months and I am getting so sick of it. I'm unhappy and I'm spending all my free time looking for advice as to what I should be pursuing instead of relaxing or doing something productive. I've spent a lot of time writing this and it's required me to think deeply and to be very honest with myself. I'm hoping to get any kind of insight and advice that will help me actually arrive at some sort of conclusion. I apologize for the length, but I feel like everything I've said is relevant.

Here's my current situation:

I'm in uni, studying Mechanical Engineering. In 2 weeks, I will have spent 2.5 years studying mechanical engineering. I came to this major right out of high school because it felt like the right thing to do; I took more of the hard academic courses (Calc BC, APES, etc.) and mostly ended up avoiding the technical ones (like arts, welding, auto-repair) in high school for some reason. Long story short, I'm generally unhappy to do ANY of the work required for all the courses of my major, and I don't find it all that interesting. I've looked all over to find people who share my opinion, and there is absolutely no shortage of engineering students who hated school. But they all say the same thing: ""Engineering in practice is nothing like engineering school."" 

So naturally, I keep my hopes up for later classes and start really looking into what engineers *really do.* 2.5 years in, all I can say is 'meh'. It's alright, but I don't find it exciting to analyze heat exchangers or optimize the design of large engines or work in CAD all day or something like that. I even had an internship, and the jobs of the blue-collar assembly-techs who worked right next to my white-collar computer station looked *way* more fun. So now, I'm thinking, ""well if I'm not enjoying school AND I'm not too excited about the careers, I should just find something else to study."" So, I've looked and looked and looked, and these are the ideas and career advice I found that stand out the most to me:

* What are you doing in your free time? 
* Revisit your childhood. Liberated from all worries, what did you do for fun?
* What struggle or sacrifice are you willing to tolerate?

Well, growing up, I mostly played videogames... I love them. I spent two years making an adventure map in Minecraft... that's all I really remember doing, other than homework. I've enjoyed editing a few videos on YouTube. Nowadays, I still play lots of videogames, albeit less than usual... I enjoy and watch plenty of videos that analyze the storytelling methods present in movies, TV shows, and games. I'm learning guitar. I built a drone to see if I could ignite some sort of passion for Mechanical Engineering but to no avail. I think that ultimately, this self-reflection reveals a more creative side of me.

So now, I'm looking at switching to Computer Science. I feel pretty indifferent about coding, but my university offers a program where you get a BS in Computer Science along with an emphasis in game development. This way, I'm still getting a STEM degree, but placing myself closer to studying something creative that I feel like I could enjoy. The idea of being a CS student kind of excites me, however inaccurate the idea may be. However, I do have to wonder if I actually *want* to go into game development, or if this is just some impulsive and ill-advised last-ditch-attempt to get out of MechE and do something I only kind-of-sort-of like. Well, I've done my research, and being an indie game dev is a big no-go for me. Working at a decently sized studio though - that sounds pretty cool. I'd probably have to relocate for a job, but maybe that's change I need.

But here are the things that keep swaying me *back and forth* and preventing me from actually making a decision:

* I've been in MechE for 2.5 years now. My grades are completely fine. I only have 2 more years to go and I know I can do it.
* On the other hand, switching majors would actually only add 2 more years to my original graduation date. I'm only 20 and the extra 2 years don't mean much to me.
* I have this idea of finishing Mechanical Engineering, ""settling for less,"" or ""being humble"" with whatever job I find, and pursuing other artistic and creative endeavors in my free time. As a bonus, Engineering in my locality is abundant and seems like a safe route to go. It pays.
* I kind of feel like if I follow the above route of settling for a job that I only somewhat care for, 10 to 15 years from now, I'll be looking for a career change. Then I'll come back to Reddit seeking advice, be regretful, and wonder why I didn't just switch when I acknowledged these feelings in my 20's. 
* I don't know if I have the resilience for game development / computer science. I know it's a lot of self-teaching and furious googling. I've never been a fan of those things, and while I hate to admit it, I think I actually give up kind of easy when it comes to doing that. For some reason, self-teaching frustrates me. When I come across an engineering homework problem, look for the relevant equations in the notes that I took from class, only to find that they're nowhere in my notebook and instead meant to be obtained from the textbook, I get kind of pissed off.
* At the same time, I kind of feel like studying something I care about a bit more will somehow give me the drive to work harder and better at the tasks I need to perform.
* I only have a tiny bit of experience with developing games. I know for a fact that learning how to make some small projects in Unity, modeling in Blender, and creating pixel art in my free time is going to be completely necessary if I choose to pursue CS / Game development. That's a lot of time spent at the computer, and touching on that point about resilience, I'm worried that I'm just gonna give up early on. I wish I knew if I had the will to push through these projects, but that only comes with actually having tried them out. I haven't *had time* to try anything out because I'm always doing some goddamn homework for MechE. By the time I'm done, I have no more mental capacity to learn or try anything new, so I just fall back on watching movies and playing videogames. 
* If the game dev side of things doesn't work out for me, then at least I have a degree in Computer Science. This satisfies my craving for doing something practical that will at least allow me to not starve. 
* But if I'm just going to give up on game dev, then why even bother switching? Is it better to just stick it out and try to be humble with the Mechanical Engineering path? If I don't like it, I can maybe transfer to a more hands-on field like A&amp;P maintenance.

I just want to say that I know a student's choice of major does NOT define their entire career. Everyone I've spoken to takes my problem at face value and says that if I'm not happy doing what I'm currently doing, then I should do something else. The answer seems so obvious. But just when I'm about to act, I'm reminded of the unique nature of engineering school... ""The early years suck, but it gets interesting the further in you go."" The same could be said about school overall and finally going out into the industry. MechE is also like the ""undecided"" of engineering... that's one of the main reasons I chose it to begin with. It just feels awful that after 2.5 years in, I still don't find the application of physics and all these natural laws and equations to solve real-world problems *that* interesting. Sure, it's useful, and there are so many sectors to work in, but how do I know if I'm going to enjoy even a single one of them? I don't even do engineering-related things in my free time. I didn't grow up with Legos and car mechanics in my home. I didn't ever pull things apart and put them back together. So, it sounds like I'm not made for this, right? Well, hear this: There's plenty more advice out there that says ""you know what, the reality is, most people in this world aren't lucky enough to get paid to do exactly what they want to do. They just find something and stick with it. You don't have to like your job enough to take it home with you. If you're making enough money doing what you're doing, then you can just spend your free time doing whatever the hell you want."" This kind of appeals to me. 

In case I haven't made this apparent, I'm TORN. I'm TORN and I don't know what to do. I've laid out these two options in front of myself, and I still feel like it's entirely possible that there's an even better third option, hidden somewhere. I worry about things way in the future when I know that I shouldn't, but I can't help it. Writing all of this out helps, but I'd definitely appreciate some specific insight, advice, and guidance right now.

Thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this."

I think I tried to take the highest courses as much as I can in the context of my high school. I hope admission officers take into account that my school doesnt offer a lot of aps

Ill write awards and ecs exactly as I mentioned in common app

Awards:

Creative Writing Contest by Seongnam City - 1st Place in Poem Division (State/Regional)

FPS Cryptoanalysis Competition - Certificate of Excellence (School)

Academic Excellence Award for my sophomore and junior year (School)

FPS Spelling Bee Contest - 1st Place (School)

HSK Level 5, Chinese Pinyin Competition Bronze medal (International/School)

ECs:

Leader and Founder of Software/Multiware Development club (2years) I instructed my members on C language how to program mindstorm/arduino robots , fundamentals of JavaFX(A java GUI framework) and we had a goal to build an announcementt systetm for our school cause our school's one is really scattered out and messy. We planned on competition but didnt had chance to attend any

Programming Blog Entry: Basically I have been writing about all the sentiments,mistakes,or activities I did about computer programming per day encompassing broad subjects over app, desktop, website, game, ai, etc this went from 10th grade and it is still being recorded now. I wanted to show college that literally I spend most of the time outside school studying and fiddling with computer programming

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming Application Development: I founded my own self-started development team and we worked together (tbh I did most part lol) to build an application that can remotely stream and control phone from web browser on any device to assist communication during COVID-19. We published this on google play store , well obviously didn't get much attention but we offered this to some other club in another high school since they seemed to need something like this. I didn't write about this offer part though)

&amp;#x200B;

Publication of Poem book : I have been writing poems for 3 years about my sentiments for Singapore ( I had to leave Singapore it was sort of second hometown for me) and I selectively published 34 and submitted to the national library

&amp;#x200B;

Harvard Model Congress Asia 2018 : I was a delegate for Germany and we contended on issue regarding Sri Lankan Civil War. I mean im introverted so like I didnt stand out or anything like that but i still tried to participate actively

Yearbook Team : I proposed title design, formatted design ffor club page and scrapped photoes for sports pages and as a team published throughout the school

&amp;#x200B;

POSCO ICT AI Contest : I devised and submitted an idea to use ImageNet and thermal image dataset to extract temperature from plain image

Class President: I was class president for my senior year. I mainly helped tutoring kids on ap physics C or computer science and arranged homeroom events with vice class president

JavaScript Tutor Volunteer: I volunteered at my local community to provide organized tuition for Javascript 1 to 1, teaching html/css, creating a chatting website and guiding proper practices for concurrent programming

Consultation website development : I worked for the private tutor to build a website that can serve as a connecting platform over tuitions and students with recommendation system and something like that

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah.. I wish I could have gotten some computer related awards like USACO or something like that but I was just deeply dived into studying this by myself and everyday staying at home working on my programming projects

There's more , but common app only allows 10

&amp;#x200B;

Common App Personal Essay: I just wrote about some of the hobbies I had (memorizing english vocabs, speedcubing, minecraft modding) and tried to emphasize that when I do something I always do it with utmost persistence and how I came to realise computer science is the way in which I can gratify my community

&amp;#x200B;

Community Disruption Essay: I wrote about some projects like auto zoom scheduler or Q&amp;A AI bot we tried to conduct as a club during COVID 19 which failed due to some special circumstances and what I did to compensate for it

Cornell Supplementary Essay: Noticing the flawed education system in Korea, I said about how I developed a dream to build humane personal assistant who can empatheize with these students and how cornell's program and courses may help me achieve this and excel beyond this project to make posittive difference in little corners of society

&amp;#x200B;

Recommendation Letter:

English Teacher : He knows me well and he sort of emphasized on my lingustic ability (my poems , essay writing style etc)

Ap Physics Teacher : He knows me well too but Im not sure what he wrote about me. But I think he talked about how I am extremely passionate for computer science

Disceret Math  Teacher: He is the senior math department and he told me that he wrote me an extremely strong letter. Idk what he said though

College Counselor : I think he tried to emphasize about what separates me from other applicants besiodees my passion for computer science

&amp;#x200B;

I am also applying to other UC schools like UC Berkely UCLA UCSD UC Irvine

and MIT/Stanford/CMU (my app is slightly different for them; I dont even expect much here. Just trying you know)

And some other schools known for comp sci like UIUC GeorgeTech etc

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking your time.. my genunie concern is that I don't have any computer olympiad awards or like state national championship or local college internship super fundraising or something liek that :C"
k37oe1,0,2020-11-29,Working as a Software engineering vs Data Scientist,Alienbushman,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/k37oe1/working_as_a_software_engineering_vs_data/,"I just finished my master's in machine learning (2 years research) after doing my undergrad in computer science (4-year degree) (good schools, good marks, a few internships and I have a minor publication). I am more than qualified to work as either a software developer and as a data scientist, but I am concerned about the future if I choose to pursue a career in data science.

From what I have read, it seems like junior data scientists aren't getting jobs, it seems like more and more universities are creating dedicated data science courses (which will lead to an increase in the supply of data scientists over the next 10 years) and I am not sure how well I will do in the interview process. I am ok at math and statistics, but I can't tell you how a Naive Bayes classifier works (I can use models, but I don't understand how the underlying models work), my main skills are that I can wrangle data, run different models, understand the results of the models and deploy it in a ""production-ready"" way. 

A software engineering role (backend developer) on the other hand has been well established for more than 30 years and there is still a fairly big shortage. Given that, I feel like I am likely to be employed with a good salary indefinitely while finding the work mostly rather interesting. That being said, I fear I will not be using my full skill set and there are very few software companies that will need someone to do some machine learning on the side (which is work I do want to do).

I mainly chose to do my master's in machine learning, because, from a postgraduate perspective, computer science research is dying, while machine learning is interesting and it is easy to get a full scholarship."

I am a CSE undergrad studying in a tier 3 college. When I took admission, I had absolutely no idea what actual work I would have to do daily after graduating, and now two years later, it's kind of embarrassing, but I still have no clue. Like I can *vaguely* see how a company would build an app or a site, but that seems to be an entirely different entity  than the ""work"" I have done - writing a few toy algorithms for semester exams and in competitive coding websites. 

So, I started looking for internships in sites like internshala, thinking they would be some magical gateway to real work. I was told it's hard to get an offer due to the sheer number of applicants, but I quickly realized the actual problem lies elsewhere. For one, I don't have *any* of the listed skills, and secondly, *I again have zero idea of what I will be expected to do*. So here I am.

My undergrad is in Physics from a school in Asia (GPA: 3.9/4.0) and now I'm a second-year MS student studying EE at a top 20 school. I have taken courses in C/C++ programming, algorithms, data structures, linear programming, and intro to ML. I went to a 3-month coding Bootcamp and decided to study more about the fundamental of computer science. However, I don't have a cs-degree nor formal working experience. (I just started my position as a software engineer intern at a 10-people startup, but I think this is very different from a full-time software engineer position). 

What is my chance of getting accepted? By the way, I'm also wondering who I should ask for a recommendation. My professor for the data structure in undergrad could help me, and my current manager at the startup could also help. But I'm not closed to any professor at my current school since COVID turned the school into a remote version, and it's difficult to interact with a professor. Is it ok if I ask my Bootcamp TA or groupmate to write me a recommendation? Or should I ask the professor even if he/she doesn't quite close to me?"

Really just looking for people who have had or heard about internship experiences at either, and also which would best set someone up for a good full time offer in the future.

I’m leaning LinkedIn since their overall compensation is higher and I am more interested in their product and industry but it’s remote and I really don’t wanna be stuck in my house for another summer.

Sorry for the text wall. I've been facing a dilemma lately and it's been giving me some anxiety :(

I'm a CS undergraduate currently in 5th semester at my uni. So the thing is, the lectures are going really slow and I thought I could learn more in that time, so I've really been hammering away my free time learning and creating anything I can. I had some experience with web dev and thought that would be a great starting point, so I spent the last 2 months doing anything and everything with JavaScript, even invading the mobile app domain with ReactNative haha.

However, I recently took a genuine look at [my github](https://github.com/TheZoraiz) and realized that almost everything there is a JavaScript project. Now I really love JS, but the fact that you can invade almost any tech domain with it's numerous frameworks (ReactNative, ElectronJS and such) makes it a tough decision for a newbie like me to attempt learning other languages when you can *just do it in JS and AVOID the new learning curve.* Besides JS, I only know Java and some C but haven't done any projects with them.

I feel like this dependency on a single language really looks bad on my CV and will most likely impact my chances at interning or eventually working at some of the better tech companies (which I really want to). Right now, I've managed to get comfortable with JS, but I have no idea if I should keep pushing forward and have a more solid grip on it, OR if I should start hammering in other crucial places (like diving into the low-level world with C, Golang or something). The next summer will be my last one before I get my degree, so I'm trying to do everything I can before it to score a good internship in its duration.

I would really appreciate any advice regarding this. The prospect of potentially wasting important time in the coming semesters is kinda haunting me right now...

* Why I want an MBA (now): Primarily network and opening doors that my current background simply doesn't.
   * Short term: PM role at FAANG (can do without MBA but it's more uncertain + will take longer)
   * Long term: entrepreneurship (and later not-for-profit entrepreneurship)
* Target schools: M7, INSEAD, LBS.
   * May consider a few others - currently researching if they do help meet my goals (Haas, Fuqua, Tuck, Yale).

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* Work Experience: \~7 years in total by matriculation, of which
   * During college, did a 12-month 'business' internship at Fortune 30 company in UK - think GE/HP/IBM (non-consulting)
   * After college, 5.5 years in IT Consulting firm in London ($10bn+ revenue, think Infosys/Cognizant). Started as Project Manager, then moved to Business Consulting arm - went from AC to C to Senior C
   * Product Manager for digital marketing firm (300 employees) in London
      * Will have been in this job for 9 months when applying, 1.5 years at matriculation
* Extra Curriculars:
   * charity Trustee for small youth charity for 2 years, helped fundraise £50k, gather team of 30+ volunteers, and set up several programmes
   * During college:
      * Exec for one of the largest student societies - Entrepreneurship society
      * played soccer for my campus team (NB: it's not the college-wide team, just one of the 7 campuses)
   * won an internal public speaking contest at work (conference-style presenting)
   * Several other small things: volunteering in schools (50+ hours), working with older people (200+ hours)
* Undergrad school: Official rankings: Top 5 UK Management school, Top 10 UK overall, Top 140 globally school. Think Lancaster/Loughborough/Surrey- not Russell Group, and virtually unknown in US I presume. To get an idea, at undergrad it's target for Big4, but not for any MBB or even niche MCs.
* Major: BSc Management Science
* Other education: Product Management weekend bootcamp (over 8 weeks)
* Race/Nationality: White / Eastern European (Bulgarian)
* Sex: Male

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: based on practice tests, 730-760
* Undergrad GPA: UK 2:1, \~80th percentile in my class. There's no standard conversion to US GPA, estimates I found range between 3.0 and 3.7 GPA.
   * I have some mitigating circumstances (bereavement + supporting family), but I'm considering not bringing it up

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional thoughts**

* How much do you think a GMAT score of 730 vs 760 change my application strength and target schools?
* Conscious of being above average Age and WE - how much of a factor is that? Showstopper for any of the schools?
* Thoughts on how profile would change if waiting 1 more year to apply? May beef up GMAT further and potentially come in as Senior PM, but would be ancient at 31

My mother has always treated me like trash compared to my sister. 

I graduated from an Ivy-league university with a degree in computer science. I am completing two internships in the spring. One at Amazon and one with the government (a total of 46 hours of work). My dad is actually excited for me, but my mother immediately tried to discourage me. She asked me how I could ""handle"" all the work and got angry when I said the internships were in DC. They are mostly remote, but I need to be in the city some days. She really hates me so much that she can't handle me living in the same city as her. She immediately said that I have to take the metro and she will never drive me (even though she does not work and it a stay-at-home mother). Then she got even angrier when my father said he would pay for an apartment for me in DC....since she really can't stand me being in the same city as her. 

Of course, she loves my sister (always has), despite the fact my sister almost failed out of art school (graduated with barely a 2.0 gpa) and lost her job at vistor services in an art museum. She has been unemployed for months, doesn't even seem to be looking for a job, and my parents pay ALL her expenses. She is lazy, only goes on tinder dates, gets drunk or smokes all day, and seems to have no ambitions. Yet my mother never shouts at her, never calls her a worthless piece of shit, never acts like spending time with her is torture. 

My mother acts like I am a burden, she diminishes all my accomplishments, makes me feel like shit every time I speak to her, and ridicules me in front of relatives or friends. She also picks at my hair, my weight, my appearance...everything. She can never be happy for me. I was literally in tears after speaking to her on the phone. She is actually MAD at me for committing to my spring internships, since I am creating ""more work"" for her somehow (????). I am sick of feeling like shit all the time, and having my own mother call me worthless, a failure, or a disappointment. She used to tell me this ALL the time in high school and she would say that I would ""never survive"" in college too. Every time I prove her wrong, she cannot congratulate me....but instead she makes me feel like a burden or an inconvenience. I am just so sick of it. My sibling is so lazy and just lives off our inheritance, yet I get chastised for actually TRYING and making an effort to please my parents.

I am going back to finish my degree starting in the spring. I have 2 years left of classes. I had an internship where I worked for 14 months as a software engineer, so I do have some experience in java, javascript, spring apps, and in dev ops stuff like Kubernetes, AWS, and docker. I've recently been playing around with some React, but I'm not close to mastering it at all. 

I have 8 weeks before classes start, I have money to cover my expenses, what skills do I need to add to get an internship for next summer. Should I focus on leetcode, and hope my stronger technical skills will outweigh the fact that I dropped out (and tanked my gpa a bit)? Should I look into any udemy or pluralsite courses? Or would adding a few projects to my GitHub be a better use of time. 

Also, when interviewing, how should I explain the 3 month gap in employment? I'm planning on being up front about the fact that I am in recovery, is that something that would backfire against me? Any help would be appreciated, I am trying to turn my life around."

I haven’t been to a doctor yet, but I know I’m suffering from some form of OCD/Anxiety and  it’s been getting super rough, especially living alone away on an internship right now, and not being able to go out and see people because of COVID.

I can’t talk to my dad because he’s just begun to start living better after my mom passed almost 3 years ago, and a lot of that has to do with his relationship with God... and so how do I tell him that a lot of my OCD seems to stem from religious thoughts and moral guilt and all that and so I’m taking a break from church and stuff..

I can’t talk to my grandparents because they constantly worry about our family and I can’t pile on.

I can’t talk to my closest friends because most of them are doing a university study term right now and they’re already stressed enough and fighting their own battles.

I’m just feeling very alone because I have no one to talk to without just burdening they and making their lives harder..... 

So is my only option to talk to some sort of professional? If so.. a doctor? Therapist? School counseling?

I graduated on the summer of 2019 with a B.S Kinesiology (health science). My initial career path was to become an occupational therapist. In order to beef up my application for OT school, I worked at a hospital as a scribe for 6 months and shadowed a local clinic 3 times a week for 3 months.

COVID news surfaced around January and I was laid off from my hospital late in that month, as they would say for “protective” reasons. So immediately after getting laid off, I was hired by a big video game company on a contract basis for a QA position and worked for them for 3 months (1 month at the office, 2 months remote due to COVID lockdown). During my time at this video game company (shall not named), I loved working with numbers, analytics, and working with team members from different departments.

COVID has put a halt or possible permanent end to my career path as an occupational therapist. Clinics are still very skeptical about volunteers shadowing their clinic. Who knows when this COVID thing is going to end.

I was unemployed from May to late October. During my unemployed period, I had a lot of thoughts about what i’m going to do, career-wise cause I knew for sure that any jobs that are in the health industry will not hire you unless you were licensed or certified. I had coworkers, upper management, and friends of mine say I have great analytical, critical thinking mind and great with computer and business software programs. Not to be arrogant, but I know i’m smart and love to solve challenges and great problems. With that said, I would love to work in a business field, like as a business analyst or business strategist, something along with that field. 

As of now, I am temporary employed through a staffing agency and work for a consulting company that has a contract with the state I live in and work as a processor. I love the job I am in because again, numbers, graphs, analytics, crunching numbers, and solving business problems.

However, my contract ends in January and will looking for similar entry level jobs in the business field, but afraid that I will be unemployed again for months because of my limited work experience in that field. *I also have internship experience for a startup company as a marketing and business analyst intern.*

I am thinking about going back to school for mainly for a business degree or my backup plan, as a nurse.

What are my options?

Edit: adding internship experience, if it helps my case."

There’s a ton of other moral things I struggled with as well, basically making me feel guilty for not being a good Christian and I just want to take a break from church and everything so that I know I’m Christian because I want to be, not because my mental health issues are guilting me into it.

However, my dad is very upset when I say I’m not listening to services online and I can’t even lie that I am because that’s ironically another moral thing I struggle with.

The reason I can’t tell him my situation is because after my mom passed almost 3 years ago, he has been lost but recently has started to recover I think, and a lot of that has to do with his relationship with God... and I can’t just tell him that the thing he’s holding himself together with is.. giving me pain.

He’s begun to notice however, and is starting to call or text on sundays asking me if I did service and if I say no, he asks like “are you even a good Christian?” And it just gives me so much anxiety expecting his check up call all day and I just don’t know what to do.

My brother is graduating this Fall. He is an ITSS major and is interested in business analytics. Due to some poor choices, he had a pretty bad dip in his grades. He went from a 4.0 to below 2.0, and will now graduate with around a 2.5. 

He couldn't get an internship so he replaced that with the capstone project. As far as experiences are concerned, he did the AT&amp;T summer learning academy and he is google analytics exam certified. He really enjoys working with Tableau and JMP, and he is working on getting a stronger grasp over SQL and Visual Paradigm, because this is what most jobs (that he found online) require.

If you were in his place (or currently are in a similar situation) what would you do? His plan is to apply to ~300 jobs before January so that he has a job soon after graduation. 

I am concerned that he won't be able to land a good (or any) job due to a few reasons. 1) His GPA is too low. 2) He did not do an internship. 3) He does not have amazing opportunities to talk about in job applications/interviews. 

I would really appreciate any feedback from you guys! Thank you."

Currently have one year left to graduate from university as well.  


What skills should I focus on to learn?  
I know ruby/python/Go and some java( no experience with java outside the university)   


I want to work in a better international company with proper processes and proper automated testing.  
I would love to do something related to DevOps as well as writing code (I had one internship as a system admin intern )   


What would you recommend to learn in my free time and what should be the kind of jobs I should look for in the future?  
Is it worth it to try to learn and gain experience with Java now? it's the most needed skill here.

I previously graduated with an accountancy degree but looking to change field of study to IT/ Tech.

Therefore i have 0 back ground in this field and im wondering if i can cope with the modules. Any advice?

For those who are in SIM UOW Com science, does the module prepare you for the working industry?  
I also know they dont provide internship so therefore, how do i solve that? Is there enough time to find internship during school holidays?

(Im focusing more towards software dev, web dev, data related. Not really interested in cyber security.)

All feedback and opinion appreciated! :D"
k3w1ux,29,2020-11-30,Junior position without help,throwaway98654111,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/k3w1ux/junior_position_without_help/,"Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons.

In the middle of this year, I finished my apprenticeship as a Software Developer, the company where I spent around 9 months as an intern thankfully took me on full-time in October for a new position that was being created.

The company is a service provider, and so far have 2 products. Its a smallish company of around 40 people, just a few developers work here to customise the products that are being licensed to customers.

The company wants to go in the web-direction, off the back of a popular e-commerce software.

There I come in, I will be responsible for the e-commerce product, and I also need to develop an app internally using MS Sharepoint. 2 seperate projects. 

I was supposed to just be working with the newest version of the e-commerce product, but since another project has came in, it'll be using the old e-commerce product. So now I have 3 projects.

Great opportunity in a way, but I'm struggling. There is noone here for me to turn to, nobody does the products or the developing I'm supposed to do. The e-commerce product is only ran from a Linux server, I had never used Linux until now. In school we learned Java. In my internship, I first had to learn some Javascript, but then that was scrapped and then I had to learn Android Development for my final exam project. Now I have to get used to Linux, and everything that is packaged with the e-commerce product: php, yaml, twig, mysql....usw.The idea is, is that I'll be doing all of the back end things for the customers.

And then yeah, on the side another project in Sharepoint - which looking at how complex the project needs to be, will have me then probably having to learn C# and more.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what my question is, if you've made it this far - is, is this normal to feel so overwhelmed. I just feel like I can't do this anymore, and I won't be able to achieve the results the company is looking for. I have no ""go-to"" person who can make sure I'm learning the right things, or looking in the right direction. I feel like my project leader has just as little know how. He said once that I'll be responsible for ""..all of the web stuff."" Like, yeah ok but thats a lot of stuff.

I don't even know how I can approach my bosses, without sounding like I'm not cut out for the job. Maybe I'm not, but maybe I'm not supposed to be as a fresh Junior.

How much responsibility should a junior really have? Should I start looking for a new job already? I'm feeling somewhat alone, and just not knowing what I should be able to do or not.

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far, thank you. If not...

**tldr**; junior overwhelmed with first job, wondering if what my employers expect of me is normal."

Im a 19 year old BBA student. I came here as there is noone that could properlu guide me as my parents dont have enoigh knowledge about all this. I wanna pursue MBA after this. Ofcourse im preparing for CAT. But alongside that i wanna build a strong reasume. I see a lot of my friends doing part-time jobs for which i applied as well but thn COVID happened. I am really confused on where to start and what to do. Im in for part-time jobs but dont really know what to do as noone is willing to offer me a proper job without any degree or experience. I tried attending a couple of seminars and currently pursuing an online course about leadership as well. I also gave coding a thought. Coding would be a great eye catcher for my resume according to me. To be honest i dont know where to start. 
Unpaid internships are cool as well, no worries but i just need a brief understanding about what i should do right now. I dont know what to specialize in as well. Let me know what electives to take as well. I wanna focus on what profile to select further as well.
Please tell me about any soft skills, or hard skills that i can aquire that'd be helpful for a career in management. Or anything that would be helpful for my future as a manager."

I am a college student in NYC, 21 female. I just moved here from the middle of US 3 month ago, but I haven’t made any friends. I cheated on all my assignments and I haven’t finished any class recording, so now I’m failing on tests. I couldn’t find any internship that I’m suppose to find. I can’t go back to be with my parents because of the pandemic. Even if I go back, I’m just trapped there and lonely. 

My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago during his trip to visit me saying that he cannot be my rock, he can’t be that person for me. I went through similar thing a year ago around the same time where a friend (roommate) told me that we aren’t good fit together. They both once told me that I was their favorite or very important to them. But they still can’t stay in my life. This hit me hard. 

I’m just trapped in my apartment in memories and pain. 

I attempted then, a year ago. I called the ambulance myself and stayed in hospital for a week. I was in psych ward for a few days. The only thing I found out is that, I can just lie my way out of this. I was so sure that no amount of medicine or therapy can help me achieve a healthy life again. 

Yesterday, I had my passport by my side, and my parents number and email written on a paper. I had my suicide note written the day he broke up with me. I was ready to go. I will text 911 first to report my suicide and then text him and my parents a note and my suicide note. I had everything ready. 

I pointed a knife on my rib cage for so many times during these few days, feeling exhausted for everything. But when I look down, I see my body, and on my bed I can just see him and I having a sweet time together, then I just couldn’t stop crying. I changed it to a plastic bag because I don’t want it to be messy. 

I ended up calling the suicide help line. 

[Edit: I called the help line because I realized, if for any reason, I could just have him back promising that he will be there for me for ever. I would be having enough drive to finish my work, and have continued my life. If I have a loving partner by my side, and I have my rock, I would still want to live. Although impossible to happen right now, there are situations that I would like to live in. That’s when I thought maybe I should call for help. ]

I was connected to a lady for 1hr before the line broke. I was talking to her about how my boyfriend told me among his girlfriends I was his favorite. 

When the line broke, I just put the bag on my head. I was counting to 30 something when my phone rang again, the lady from help line called me again. This time we talked for another 1.5hr. She asked me some really good question to lead me to think about the choice. 

I then proceeded to call my mom. Magically, she knew something is wrong and she started apologizing for not being intimate when I was young and stuff. I have got the apologies or recognition I always wanted. I felt much better. 

I wrote my ex boyfriend a message saying that I’m thankful for him but I’m finally ready to move on. Then went to sleep at dawn. 

But here I am again. Not seeing any way to be out of the situation, wanting everything to end for good, thinking that’s definitely the easy way out. I don’t see a point in continuing this life I had.

On a scale of 1-5, 1 being the least likely to commit suicide, I’m still not a 1. Maybe not going to be a 1 for the rest of the eternity. 

I want to buy a gun, so that I have freedom at hand whenever I needed.

Update Nov30 night:
I called again to the suicide line and talked with a lady for 1 hour. I was feeling unbearable with my memories again. I tired myself out so that I can sleep. 

I found out that when I am really tired and can fell asleep in the next second, I would have the strength to act on my suicide plans and I would like to just let myself fall asleep. 

I don’t know if this technique will help anyone."

As the title said, I am a 20-year-old who is feeling a little bit lost in life right now. It's not that I have depression or is in a bad place right now. In fact, I am a college student currently studying Engineering and am not failing in any way whatsoever, and currently having an exciting internship ready for my upcoming semester.

The problem is that sometimes, just throughout the day, I feel that my daily life and routine is just a bit empty. It might be because I'm hating my major, and although I found the materials to be somewhat 'interesting', I don't really find myself exploring stuff on my own. I just more or less exists there for seemingly no reason whatsoever - at least from my end.

What's more, I hate the fact that I cannot seem to bring myself to do anything productive. I feel like, after class, I'm just wasting my time playing video games, reading manga, and just doing stuff that doesn't really matter later on in my career or life in any way whatsoever. I also party on weekends but am feeling myself gradually finding the constant hangover meaningless. And plus, I feel that the party itself is a waste of time as well since they don't really contribute to anything in my life and I'm just basically giving myself an unhealthy lifestyle.

Essentially, I feel like as 20 years old, I am already dead inside and just living my life waiting for the days of my funeral. My ambition ever since graduating high school was always to live the multi-billionaire lifestyle with private jets, yachts, islands, and all that good stuff. But at this rate, I think I'm just living the life of someone who can only dream but can't do anything to save his life and I'm really not happy with where I am right now.

For those who found your motivations and the reason to DO what you do, and is currently loving your life (you don't have to be a billionaire like what I described), how did you do it? Please help out a fellow young bud because I really wanted to go out there and live a non-regretful life and have awesome and amazing adventures/stories to tell my grandkids."

So I secured an internship for next semester and I'm wondering if working a part-time developer role during the internship would be a good idea? The reason I thought about doing this is to increase the amount of experience I have to put on my resume.

k40494,3,2020-11-30,Stay in startup with high potential or leave for more experience?,CoheedMastodon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k40494/stay_in_startup_with_high_potential_or_leave_for/,"I've been working at this company for more than 2 years now, started as an intern in backend development when the startup was just created, and was finally hired as the first employee. After that, the company grew from 4 to 15 people (4 in the tech team) after a first fund raising, and a bigger one is scheduled in the next year. In the meantime, I switched from backend development to a DevOps and Cloud Architecture role.

I've been thinking a lot about my future in this company, especially my ability to learn new skills with my position. From what I can tell our startup has a high potential, and the fact that I'm the first employee (so I basically built the first version of our platform on my own) and that my direction trusts me very much makes me think I can hope for a very good position in the future.

However, I'm doubting that I could learn as much as I would like if I stay. My boss does not have a CS background (but still engineer) and is very goal-oriented, meaning that he doesn't care about the way we code things as long as it works. For example he hasn't written a single unit test in 2 years. 
He's also very stubborn about his way of seeing things, and doesn't realize that our software would probably be of very low reliability if my co-workers and I didn't pay attention to code quality the way we do. We regularly have some ""emergencies"" in production, but he doesn't want to see that this is related to the way we sometimes abandon quality for quick things that just work. We also hired a senior software engineer to help us in this area, but he decided to leave a few months ago because he and my boss disagreed on this specific subject.

So even if I get to be in a leading position in the future, this fact about my boss makes me think I can't have as much experience as I want to. I would learn new skills for sure, but I would probably lack the experience of a senior for the best practices. But since I'm young, I want to gain as much experience as possible, I know I'm capable of learning fast, but I also want to have a deeper knowledge of what I do. I also try to learn during my free time but the job is very time consuming. 

Good points :
- good position in the company, trusted by my boss
- salary is good, not huge but I can hope for a substantial raise in 6 months, and I have stock options 

Bad points :
- boss very stubborn and prefers quick and dirty to following best practices, which is frustrating
- all developers are junior, and direction is not technical

What do you think? Should I try to change his opinion? Leave or stay?

Thank you!"
k4075l,1,2020-11-30,I'm a recent Electrical Engineering graduate with over 16 months of work experience and I have been jobless since Jan 2020. Please advise. Thanks.,cmanagoli,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/k4075l/im_a_recent_electrical_engineering_graduate_with/," I graduated with an Electrical Engineering Bachelor's degree from University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in Feb 2020. I have 16 months of coop experience, working as an instrumentation and controls coop student at a gas turbine testing facility. I have experience working with Allen Bradley PLCs, SCADA, control systems, precision instrumentation, creating technical documents and safe work procedures. The coop term was great since it exposed me to a lot of new things and I got a lot of hands-on experience. I even graduated on the Dean's Honor list with a 3.65 GPA. I am also pretty decent with Python, Matlab, C and Java. I have built simple software applications and interfaced different kinds of sensors with boards like Raspberry Pi, Arduino and BeagleBone.

But I absolutely cannot get a job. I have applied to over a 100 places. I have gotten maybe 2 or 3 interviews all year. I make sure to tailor my resume to every job I apply. I even follow-up on my applications by contacting people working in the company on LinkedIn after I apply. But I just end up with more useless connections on LinkedIn who don't respond to my messages. Internships are reserved for students still pursuing their degree.

I am trying to stay motivated by taking courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript on LinkedIn Learning. I am also preparing for the provincial 4th class Power Engineering exam. But it's very hard to stay motivated. I try to work on personal projects in my spare time when I am not applying for jobs or freaking out about my future. I also work 32 hours a week at Best Buy in the warehouse.

Living in Canada is a major disadvantage since there are so few jobs here for recently graduated Electrical Engineers. I am eligible for a TN visa by virtue of my Canadian citizenship but I doubt I'll get calls from any American companies even if I do apply (I applied for a couple and got zero response). I know I am not perfect and there is a lot that I don't know, but I am seriously starting to question whether this degree was worth wasting 6 years of my life on.

Anybody have any advice for a frustrated graduate? Thanks."

One caveat is that going into my final semester, I unfortunately, do not have any internship experience, but was able to land one with Northwestern Mutual.

I am also studying for the SIE exam which I have heard can look good to employers.

:--|:--
Hey Alex, this is more of a general question rather than rodent/rabbits, but last year we found a wild Partridge and took it to 3 different vets (1 that specialized in birds and 2 regular) and no one would help. I wanna know why they rejected to help and do you ever get animals you reject helping?|They rejected it because it was wildlife. Unless you're a wildlife rehabber they couldn't have treated it then given it back to you and typically your average vet doesn't see wildlife because it's not in their base of knowledge and frankly there's no one to pay the bill for wildlife most of the time.
 |We also cannot take in wildlife that requires a rehabilitation permit because we are not permitted rehabbers. We can take in captive bred wild rodents and get a permit for them, and we can take in animals that don't require a permit (mice, rats, voles, chipmunks, and groundhogs). However, despite that, we are well connected with rehabbers so if someone calls me with a litter of baby opossums I'll usually tell them to bring it over and I'll transfer to a rehabber within 24 hours. If it's really sick I'll take it to our vet who does do wildlife and they'll see it then transfer to a rehabber.
 |Also, we really mostly stick to rodents and rabbits, but if someone contacts me with something else I can usually find a place for it.
I love capybaras. Can you talk about how the laws in your different states impact your ability to care for them? Also, do people surrender them or were these guys captured for being invasive in American ecosystems?|So, we are in Indiana, and Indiana has notoriously lax laws for keeping exotics. We don't have any state restrictions on owning capybaras but we do have to notify our county animal management board about their existence in this county. While permitting is not a problem for us due to Indiana's laws it is an issue that people who want to own capybaras do need to research thoroughly because if they're illegal to own then there's going to be a lot of problems getting them adequate care.
 |Ours are surrenders, for the most part they aren't particularly invasive in the US and they certainly wouldn't survive up north in the wild.
Hi Alex! I just wanted to say I've been such a huge fan of all the work that you and Jason do for years now. You both work so incredibly hard, and although I know rescue work is incredibly rewarding, it's also incredibly draining as well. Every time I see an adorable animal being rescued, it warms my heart a thousand times over. You've been instrumental in helping me make sure that my own hamsters receive the best care possible. Truly, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the incredible work you do. I suppose I should ask a question instead of just fangirling. What has been your craziest hamster/rat escape?|Probably the hamster escape where Mia (a chinese hamster) was gone for like 3 weeks and avoided all of our live traps. Eventually we found her in the bedding closet where she had opened a huge bag of bedding, burrowed in and stashed a bunch of food. We finally found her because she was using the guinea pig cage to drink water. We adopted her out shortly after she was found and she lived a great life up in Michigan.
Hi Alex I'm a Patreon supporter and follow you on multiple platforms. Recently I've been so pleased to see Steve coming out of his shell, getting all the pets! What is the highlight of your day at The Pipsqueakery? And how is the new site coming along?|The highlight of every day at The Pipsqueakery is usually going to sleep snuggling whatever animal happens to be in bed that night (usually it's Delilah). Obviously some days there are more exciting things than that, but I like sleep and I don't get enough.
 |As for the facility... well the state department of health cashed my check for the septic permit on the 30th, so maybe a tiny bit closer?
Thank you for your dedication and care! As an animal lover it’s exciting to see others turn this passion into a career. I have a special place in my heart for senior rabbits. How do you think we can encourage people to become informed pet owners who are knowledgeable and committed, whether or not an animal is special needs? How do you emotionally and mentally deal with the fact that some animals should not be kept alive at all costs due to suffering and other challenges?|First, I just want to say that at this time this isn't what I would call a career. It's completely unpaid labor that dominates every single part of my life. I hope someday The Pipsqueakery will be in a position to hire because doing this and a day job isn't sustainable but for now I have to work to keep a roof over all of our heads. I only address that because it's a super common misconception.
 |As for encouraging others, I always find the best way to educate people is to lead by example. We don't do a ton of adoptions (we work with other rescues for the adoptable animals and take their sanctuary animals), but what we show on social media has an impact.
 |As for emotionally and mentally dealing with the heartbreak. Well, two things:
 |1. I'm on antidepressants, two of them actually. You can't really be involved in rescue without it impacting your mental health.
 |2. You get better at it with time and experience. You learn when to call it quits and give them the gift of a good death and you might cry over it but you learn to move on to caring for the other animals in need because you did everything you could.
How does one help a rabbit pee? Also where can people go to donate?|You express its bladder by pushing on its lower abdomen with a slightly cupped hand. Some are easier to manually pee than others though and there's various positioning and techniques that are used depending on the animal.
 |People can find ways to help at thepipsqueakery.org/help. I think that's ok to post here since there's options for non-monetary help too and I'm directly answering a question. Everyone do your independent research before donating to any charity though to make sure they're legit, doing what they say they'll do with the money, and that you're actually donating to who you think you're donating to.
We rescued a baby squirrel that was on our deck. Its eyes were still shut. We assume it was brought by its mother or a predator and the process got interrupted somehow. We did dog formula and eventually transitioned to greens and nuts. The question is, how do we transition to the outside? Is it some form of gradual thing it do we just take them to a tree and let them go?|It really needs to go to a rehabber to have a successful release. They can't typically be released at this time of year, but it needs to be with others of its species so it can learn necessary survival skills. If it doesn't gain those skills before release it won't survive in the wild, and that's just not something we can teach them. If you look up your state Department of Natural Resources website you can usually find a list of rehabbers.
How did you get started? Was there one special critter in need who spoke to you and set you on this path?|That would be a combination of things. Our first syrian hamster, Pipsqueak, passed away after 4 months of having her after being quite sick. In retrospect she probably had an infection called pyometra but we didn't know and didn't have a vet who knew at that point. She passed away during my first week of law school.
 |Then, during law school one of the primary extracurriculars I participated in was helping victims of domestic violence get protective order. As you can imagine that's pretty tough work emotionally and you often see repeat clients because the cycle of abuse makes it very likely that their abuser will convince the victim that the abuser has changed and to drop the protective order only to have the cycle repeat. While I never ever fault the victims for these things because there are much greater forces at play it is a reality that is very emotionally draining. So, we started with hamster rescue because with a hamster you can save them, put them in a nice big cage, give them good food and good health care, and keep them safe for the rest of their lives. You can't do that to humans (for obvious reasons) so it gave me an outlet that I wasn't getting elsewhere.
?|Small animal places definitely could we use tons of fleece blankets. In fact im using two right now. One to hold the squirrel I'm feeding and one as a placemat to protect the bed from rabbits.
Hi! Big fan of capybaras here. What is their daily routine?? Do they recognize you as a dog would recognize his owner?? Do they interact with you?? Thank you endlessly for your hard work taking care of animals|They mostly sleep, eat, poop, swim, nap, talk to the other animals, and cause trouble, then repeat every single day. They're smart and they definitely recognize us like a dog would recognize his owner, but they're really really not like a dog so I hesitate to even say that. They do interact with us to some extent. Steve has really come out of his shell over the last 9 months and he enjoys attention. Irwin isn't there yet and wants us to leave him alone.
Can you explain why rats are great pets?|They're smart, they're clean, they're fairly resilient, little kids will have a much harder time dropping them than say a guinea pig or a hamster because rats cling, and they're as domesticated as a dog in a much smaller package. Basically the ideal pet.
 |I did not look at your username when I answered this. Hi Ed!
Any need for an 8 year old virtual intern?? My daughter is obsessed.|Alas, not at the moment. I have a really hard time balancing the time and energy it take to coordinate volunteers vs the time volunteers save by doing tasks. However, there are always things she can do to help independently and we have had a lot of people do a lot of cool things to help from all over the world!
So happy to see you on here! What are your long-term plans for the Pipsqueakery?|The hope is to grow it into an organization that can stand on its own two feet by paying salaries and hiring staff. The expansion into other states was somewhat unplanned so I haven't quite figured out how that all works in. For now I'm treating the other locations as foster homes with some independence and focusing on growing our headquarters here by building a facility and working incredibly hard at fundraising so we can reach our goals.
Hi Alex, I follow you on IG and love your organization! Thank you so much for all you do to help support our smaller furry friends! I am a long time fan of guinea pigs specifically (been adopting pairs for 17 years now) and would love to be able to help more beyond just donations. I am moving to NY end of year and would love to get involved with your NJ rescue and help support/volunteer/foster - would you be able to advise me on how to do this?|Send an email to halp@thepipsqueakery.org and let us know you want to get involved. We're taking it easy on new fosters as we get established there so we might not have something for you right away, but get your information to us at that email so we can stay in touch and figure out ways for you to help!
I love rodents and have some myself, and I come up against people all the time who think they’re dirty/dangerous and bad pets/animals. What would you say is the most helpful/constructive thing that can be done to help battle the stigma people hold against rodents in general and also rodents as pets?|Post a lot of cute photos and videos, and a lot of educational information because for the most part they're pretty great. We obviously have some animals here that I don't think are good pets though.
 |Anyway, some people just aren't going to change their minds about rodents and we have to just let it go because there's too much other stuff going on.
what is a 501c3?|A 501c3 is a designation by the IRS that indicates that we have registered and all of our money should be going to our stated mission and allows donors to deduct their donations to us from their income taxes.
 |I say *should* because obviously there are shady 501c3 nonprofits out there so everyone should always do their own research before supporting any cause.
Wife and I run a similar rescue (she's a shelter vet) but haven't gotten formal status. How did you go about getting the 503c status and any tips or places that helped?|I'm a lawyer so I did it myself, and if you have the money probably just hire a lawyer to do it for you so you don't miss any steps. Otherwise start by incorporating in your state, writing a mission statement, getting a board of director together, and writing bylaws. Once you have your state incorporation done, get an EIN (it's all online just google get an EIN), and then fill out IRS form 1023 or 1023ez if you're a small rescue.
 |Just be aware that registering as a 501c3 comes with very few perks and a lot of responsibility so take your time to decide if it's something that really fits with your goals.
Ooo perfect AmA to run into. So my brother has 2 chinchillas and a huge cage we've been having an argument recently. He's had the 1 chinchilla for a yr give or take. And just got a 2nd one that's alot younger and they fight. Him and his fiancee solution was to separate the top 2 floors from the bottom 2 with something blocking the ramp opening. I told him you should've done like I did with my rats. And that's 2 cages move em closer together a little bit at a time. (I never did the mixing bedding thing) then let em meet etc. Until you know they won't eat each other then same cage. He is sold on the fact that yeah but they aren't rats...so solve the argument do you treat the introduction the same or is my brother just an idiot?|You treat the introduction the same, but I find chinchilla bonding to be much more difficult and less reliable. If they're both males consider getting them neutered.
Thank you so much for your work ❤ I'd like to know how guineapig Cormac who was found dumped in the road and was having seizures is doing? He looked so poorly. Also, if this doesn't bring back bad memories, did Mini die of old age? I was wondering is 7 old age for her breed.|Cormac is doing ok, but he looks objectively really bad right now and sometimes I don't have it in me to post and explain that. He has gained a ton of weight and we have managed to get the thick crust off his skin and it's looking pretty good. Alas, with that thick crust came most of the hair on his face so it would be a lot to explain if I post a picture and for whatever reason no one reads the captions.
 |Mini did not die of old age but what exactly killed her is hard to say. Even though she was overall relatively healthy Mini had a lot of issues with repeated stasis and some sort of mass in her nasal cavity that made her snotty. I suspect stasis was the ultimate issue though even though we were treating for that with fluids and handfeeding.
Do you feel there is a bigger need for little critter rescue? It seems like a lot more attention is focused on dog/cat rescue than the little guys.|Yes, for every animal I take in I probably turn 20 away because we simply don't have the space or resources.
How many mice do you see at the Pipsqueakery? I’m a big mouse fan and would like to know more about the mouse population there|We have 43 mice here right now. They all live in 3 big colonies that will eventually be 2 big colony once the males from our last big intake get neutered. They're somewhat adoptable but since mice do so well in large groups we tend to not worry about adopting them out since it's not a lot of work to have a few extra mice.
This is probably asking a lot but how would you describe the stereotypical personalities of the different species you deal with?|Chinchillas: Mischievous
 |Guinea pigs: cheerful
 |Rabbits: destructors
 |Groundhogs: Lazy
 |Prairie dogs: hardworking
 |Hamsters: introverts
 |Rats: loyal
 |There are more of course, are you looking for something more in-depth or specific?
Hi Alex! I follow you on Instagram and love seeing all the love and care you give every animal you take in! I was wondering what first got you started rescuing and rehabilitating small animals: was it accidental, or something you’ve always wanted to do? Thank you! 😀|Here's the story:
 |Our first syrian hamster, Pipsqueak, passed away after 4 months of having her after being quite sick. We adopted her from a shelter that didn't know her sex or type of hamster much less that she had medical issues. In retrospect she probably had an infection called pyometra but we didn't know and didn't have a vet who knew at that point. She passed away during my first week of law school, and at that point I knew that animals like her, rodents, didn't have a place to go where they would be able to receive adequate care if they were sick because we could barely provide it despite our very valiant attempts and many many vet visits. Then, during law school one of the primary extracurriculars I participated in was helping victims of domestic violence get protective order. As you can imagine that's pretty tough work emotionally and you often see repeat clients because the cycle of abuse makes it very likely that their abuser will convince the victim that the abuser has changed and to drop the protective order only to have the cycle repeat. While I never ever fault the victims for these things because there are much greater forces at play it is a reality that is very emotionally draining. So, we started with hamster rescue because with a hamster you can save them, put them in a nice big cage, give them good food and good health care, and keep them safe for the rest of their lives. You can't do that to humans (for obvious reasons) so it gave me an outlet that I wasn't getting elsewhere.
 |As for whether this was something I always wanted to do? Short answer: Nope. Longer answer: I never even really considered myself an animal person. I liked them but I never wanted to be a vet or begged for a puppy and my partner and I even agreed we didn't want pets because it was too much work and responsibility.
Hi Alex! I run Atlantic Critters Rescue in NJ, we are affiliated with HALP and have been excited to support them in merging with The Pipsqueakery. What has been the hardest thing about merging with other rescues? I feel like I have my hands full managing one very small rescue!|I'm really stressed out about keeping track of all the intakes and adoptions, and making sure there's enough money to give the best care to all the animals in all the locations. If I don't think about it too hard it's honestly going pretty smoothly, but if I think about it then OMG the panic. It's a lot to handle honestly and I think it will be ok. I'm sure in someways it's hard for the rescues we are taking over too because most of the decision making power ends up with me and the board which is a big change.
My 4 year old daughter really wants a guinea pig for xmas - my question is: is it true you should always buy a pair so they are more social?|Yes, you should always have at least two, but also unless you're up for constant close supervision possibly consider rats instead of guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are pretty delicate and easily droppable. Rats are much harder to drop since they just kinda hang on. Of course, depending on how you handle it that could all be a non-issue, but I've always thought rats were a much superior pet for a young child.
Wow! Thanks for all you do and for being there to rescue those that need help the most. You state that animal rescue and human rights intersect in your organization's efforts: are most of your critters straight-up rescues (i.e. abandoned, neglected) or are most temporarily rescued (while owner is homeless, financially destitute, etc.) And the critters eventually return home?|The vast majority of out animals are straight up rescues/surrenders. We do occasionally temporarily care for animals for people in those sorts of situations but we can't provide vet care for an animal that isn't surrendered. However, understanding that these things are related very much impacts how we handle those surrenders.
 |Often people look at people who surrender their animals with disdain for not being able to keep their animal and it's seen as shirking responsibility. Of course, there are some cases where people just suck but the vast majority of individuals who surrender animals are surrendering them because they want the best for their beloved pet. They're surrendering because they want their animal to get the care they can't afford and frankly they're doing a responsible, brave, and compassionate thing. I like to think that we treat our surrenderers with respect and kindness, and we have some great ongoing relationships with people who have surrendered.
 |It also informs our posting on social media, our merch (we try very hard to represent human rights issues in a diverse way with input from people from the groups that are represented), and just out general belief system that the rescue is built on. Animal welfare and human rights are intricately intertwined and if humans are forced to fight for their basic needs then it's very clear (at least to me) that they can't focus on giving their pets the best lives because they just need to keep surviving.
What has been your best experience so far? Animal wise or with other shelters? 💕 fellow Indiana resident here. 💕|That's a really good question that I'm not sure I have a good answer to because almost every experience is a mix of good and bad when it comes to rescue. However, I will say that working with other rescues, particularly EARPS Inc., IHRS, and A Critters Chance, has been a wonderful experience overall. I also think that the relationships I have made with supporters has been wonderful even though that can also be very stressful.
What are your thoughts on people owning single rabbits when there is a growing consensus that they are social animals that need a companion?|In general I think social animals should have companionship from their own species. However, I do think rabbits can successfully be kept as single pets with a dedicated owner who is able to fill their needs, and some rabbits are frankly not very into other rabbits.
 |Keeping a guinea pig or a rat without their own species is flat out cruel though.
Is it fun?|Wellllll that depends on how you define fun.
 |Parts of it are fun, but a lot of it is paperwork, poop, cleaning, sleep deprivation, death, bills, and people getting angry at you. I don't want to paint animal rescuing in a negative light, but there's a lot of not fun parts of it.
How much is [your budget](https://i.redd.it/8k0obmhsrkj01.png) for a new house?|Alas, way way less than that. I mean the Pipsqueakery's facility build is going to cost about $250k to $300k and frankly The Pipsqueakery has more money than us. I would like those budgets a lot though.
Wow this AMA is fantastic!!! I'm a year and a half into running a small fish rescue out of my home. I've read through your comments and 100% relate to shoving all my money and time into rescue efforts. I've had several people surrender fish to me and offer donations, but I feel uncomfortable taking donations when I'm not officially a non-profit. My big question: at what point did you decide to go for the non-profit status? What did you do before that as far as donations, etc.? I'd love to become a non-profit, and my brother is a lawyer who would be willing to help me, but I'm struggling to decide when my rescue is ""significant"" enough to warrant being an official non-profit.|It's really not about being significant enough, it's about what your particular goals are. There are a lot of responsibilities that come with being a 501c3 and depending on your goals there might not be a lot of reward. I will say though that you shouldn't feel bad about accepting donations as a non-501c3, as long as you're always honest with people you should feel free to fundraise and accept donations to help with your cause.
Do the smaller critters ever ride the capybaras or is that just a reddit thing?|Mostly a reddit thing. I mean I could probably put a rat on Steve, but the rat wouldn't really be interested in riding him around.
 |Now in the wild there are some birds that have a symbiotic relationship with capybaras and groom the pests off of them, but that's not really a thing inside our house.
So lucky to have people like you! My question is - do you rescue other small animals that may not be ""rodents"" like ferrets, for example? Or is that too risky? Me and my husband want to start a ferret rescue at some point!|We do not handle ferrets at our primary location in Bloomington as we have a no predators policy. However, our location in NJ does take ferrets, and if someone asked to surrender a ferret I would arrange to have it surrendered at one of our local sister rescues.
Can rabbits be kept as house pets? We have a small flat and have wanted one for a while but not sure if they get on well with being indoor pets|They should basically always be kept as house pets the same way you would keep a cat! They're really not good as outdoor pets.
[removed]|Patagonian cavies are also called maras. They about 12 to 18 pounds with long legs and pointy ears.
 |thepipsqueakery.org/help has lots of ways to help us from donating funds to sending supplies from our Amazon wishlist.
 |As for capybaras, I strongly discourage people owning them in almost every case, and I've had a lot of people tell me that following me has cured them of any desire to own one. They're very much wild animals that can be tame, but they are still clearly wild animals. They do get very attached to their owner especially if you keep a single one but honestly I really think they should be kept in at least pairs if at all possible. They're really messy, incredibly strong, and even when they don't mean to hurt someone they can do a lot of accidental damage. If they do want to hurt you, well let's just say I got lucky and have a bruise on my leg so deep that it has been there since February 2020 because Steve got scared at the vet. They need tons of space and the ability to swim in a temperature controlled environment. They don't handle cold well and they're very very expensive to feed. I know there are some people out there who can handle owning one, but I really think the vast majority of people don't know what they're in for with a capybara. Even I don't think I truly knew what I was in for and I have pretty extensive animal experience at this point.
ah hemm.. okay, here it goes. ........... why? Like, i get it. they're living animals, and it's sad to see anything happen to them. But, what was the tipping point that made you go 'okay, i'm setting up a rodent/rabbit rescue!'|I really wish I knew the answer to that. Masochism? Impulsive ADD decision that I can't back out of now? My proclivity towards turning every hobby into work? It's frankly unclear. In fact, I've never even really considered myself an animal person and my partner and I said we wouldn't have pets together because it was too big of a time commitment and responsibility.
 |I also swore off going to law school though and then did that too, so probably I just make bad decisions.
 |Though the actual tipping point story is a little sweeter than that. Let me go copy and paste it:
 |""Our first syrian hamster, Pipsqueak, passed away after 4 months of having her after being quite sick. In retrospect she probably had an infection called pyometra but we didn't know and didn't have a vet who knew at that point. She passed away during my first week of law school.

As an ex-rabbit owner and ex-rescue/sanctuary volunteer/foster, what do you feed your rabbits? I'm always curious about what other people feed their buns.|Oxbow pellets and orchard grass hay. We free feed pellets because all of our rabbits are special needs, many with dental issues, and we use orchard grass because I am deathly allergic to timothy hay.
My daughter has 2 pet rats. We’re pretty sure they picked up mites. Best suggestions to help safely get rid of the mites? Thank you.|Go to a vet for revolution. Technically you can get ivermectin OTC but it's a bit less safe overall and if dosed inappropriately is very unsafe.
Hi Alex! I just want to say that your facebook posts are glorious, and it's been a delight working alongside you (I'm with A Critter's Chance). But I guess that I have to ask a question. Uh....what's your favorite Final Fantasy game?|Final Fantasy VII, but I've never actually played it. That was not my thing. I'm a serious pokemon nerd.
Are electric mouse traps ethical? I'm not letting these things live in my house, but I want to be as compassionate and expedient in their murder as possible.|Not really, but they're better than glue traps or poison. The most effective thing you can do though is first go around the perimeter of your house and seal up every hole with steel wool and caulk (or other sealer of your choice). Then get a couple of life traps and bait them with peanut butter, and evict that mouse. If you don't seal up the entry points first though it doesn't matter how many mice you kill or catch, more will just keep coming in.
Do you have room for 17 million coronavirus infected minks? If so, Denmark would like a word...|No predators allowed at The Pipsqueakery unfortunately.
I was wondering if you had anything that you would tell someone who was considering a similar project?|Don't do it.
 |If you're going to ignore me and do it anyway then first start fostering for another rescue and learn how that rescue works.
 |Then if you still insist on going out on your own take all your money and throw it out the window because you're going to be paying the expenses out of pocket for years while you get established.
 |Also, I would tell them that most of running a rescue isn't animal care, and most of the animal care isn't fun. It can still be very rewarding but it's an incredibly difficult path and I do not recommend it.
A friend of mine also does little critter rescue also based in Indiana, I believe. A handful of weeks ago, she got an assload of rats and mice from a guy who just dumped them on a lawn. Now she's overloaded with baby mice and rats. I don't really have a question. Just wanted to share? Let's put a question mark in there to confuse the bot?|she can reach out to us if she needs help
What are your top 5 animals that are submitted to your facility? And what is your most unusual?|Top 5 by individual animals or by species.
 |Most unusual is probably the capybaras. Though one time we had some rescue carpenter bees that I handfed. Those were cool.
How many of the animals are kissable? 95%? 100%? Because they all look extremely cute.|Kissable without getting bit? Maybe 70%. Kissable if you have no regard for your face staying intact? 100%
Hi Alex, I have a Dutch rabbit with pasteurella, and he requires a nebuliser every day. Sometimes, despite his medications, he still ends up uncomfortable and with a snotty nose. With all your experience caring for small animals, do you know of anything I could do to make him more comfortable? :)|Has he done a course of penicillin-g?
What should people know about rabbits before adopting one? Why do they make great pets? With love and respect, a fellow rabbit rescuer :)|That if you don't invest in good care for your rabbit from the start (spaying/neutering, good food, plenty of hay), you'll end up paying much more in vet bills trying to fix it later on. As for why they make great pets, well they're soft and floofy with personality for days.
Hello, thanks for doing this. I have a question, a few years ago I found a very small squirrel struggling on a sidewalk. I tried to nudge it into a patch of leaves but it kept trying to snuggle into my hand. It’s eyes were not open and it was very shaky. I put it under some leaves and left it there. I don’t know what happened to it but I assume either it’s mother returned or it was eaten. What should I have done with that little guy? It was too late in the day to contact any rescue agencies and there aren’t any near me anyways.|Your approach wasn't necessarily wrong. Basically there are two possible approaches. 1. take it home, keep it warm, don't feed it, and get it to a rehabber within 24 hours or 2. Leave it and hope mom comes back. A lot of times mom will come back but obviously there's always the risk that she won't. Some people will do a hybrid of those options and put baby in something to keep it slightly more warm and watch for mom from inside a house and then take it to a rehabber if mom doesn't come back after a certain number of hours. There's really not a perfect answer.
What’s your favorite critter?|Specific animal or species?
 |Species is definitely guinea pigs. Specific animal is probably Delilah.
Hi Alex! I just really want to say thank you SO MUCH for all that you guys do at the Pipsqueakery!!! I'm a longtime rabbit butler and have only recently dipped into guinea pigs - my girl is from one of your rescues in NJ who came out of a major hoarding situation. Sadly her sister/friend also from that group passed last week, but I've since learned she's not the first NOR most recent from the group to have gone unexpectedly, which is terrifically sad. I'll be the first to admit that rabbits are my area of 'expertise' so to speak, but I'm being pressured by other pig parents to adopt another companion for her right away... even going so far as to say it's not morally or ethical to have a single. To be fair, I'm still grieving Bubbles and given the mortality rate that seems to be happening in this group, I kinda want to get a feel for if my girl is going to live another month before trying to bring in another friend. What's your perspective on this? Is it okay to keep her single for a little bit or is it completely unethical to keep her alone? Her pen is in one of my rabbits' rooms so she's able to see and ""chat"" with him and I'm in that room several hours a day.|Longterm, it's completely unethical to keep a guinea pig alone. In the short term, even like a couple of months, it's fine. No rabbit or human will replace the companionship of another guinea pig, but as long as she's getting attention and still eating and drinking then you can take some time to make-up your mind.
ALEX!!!! My sister (she was the idiot) and I drove over 1700 miles to bring you some hamsters! Is Amos still kicking? He was SO CUTE! You are absolutely an amazing human!! Keep up the good work!! ❤️❤️|He is not unfortunately! Thank you so mucb for helping with transport!
Hey Alex!!! I absolutely adore you and Jason and the Pipsqueakery, and I was wondering if any of your long term plans include ever bringing on some more volunteers and/or staff? Helping you guys out would be my dream :)|Yes, definitely. Since we operate out of our home currently volunteers are very limited, and since no one gets paid at all we obviously don't have any staff. I would love for The Pipsqueakery to be in a position to pay staff though because frankly running The Pipsqueakery and working full time isn't sustainable for me.
Hi Alex/Jason, I was wondering if you had any experiences with Patagonian Maras (Cavys)? I work at an animal rescue in Georgia and we have one who’s about as dumb as a box of rocks. If you have any experience with them, how do they compare to their larger cousins the Capybara?|We have two here and they're not the brightest but they do so much better if they have others of their own species. They're much jumpier and faster than capybaras but also significantly less destructive.
 |But also, they can be kinda dumb....
How do you fund this? Is it sustainable? A friend of mine would love to start something like this in our area, but as far as I can tell it just seems like a big money sink|Fundraising! I spend a minimum of 20 to 40 hours a week fundraising year round, and during the end of the year (like now) I easily spend 40 to 60 hours a week fundraising. It's a full time job to fundraise and there's lots of skills and knowledge that you actually need to gain to do it well. It takes time and effort to build a base of supporters and nurture those relationships and it's a freaking ton of work.
 |Alas, the vast majority of rescues don't have someone with the skills to fundraise efficiently and many many rescuers pay for their rescue out of pocket. Even if you do have the skills you'll still be paying out of your own pocket for years while you start up. We definitely did.
Hi there! I have a sweet 7year old Dutch rabbit who recently got into an accident and lost the use of her hind legs. I’m glad to discover here who you are and really love what you’re doing!Especially after my rabbit’s accident, I found it difficult to know, how little small pets are taken as serious companions. The lack of vet surgery clinics for small pets, the jokes and even the disregard of the love i have for my rabbit— I know this might be an obvious question to you but I’d just like to know your opinion, why do you think that is? And how are you expanding people’s views of small animals? Thank you!|I think it's because they're seen as cheap pets that are easily replaceable and it seems like every single person has a story about the horrific way their childhood small pet died/was killed/was set free in the woods. I mean there have even been a decent number of comments that get quickly automodded here about how this is a worthless thing to be doing.
 |I hope that by sharing them online people fall in love with them and their big personalities, and see their value as individual tiny beings. Some people are just going to be assholes no matter what though and you just kinda have to let that go.
Hi Alex, we have had two Degu for the past 5 years (sisters). Unfortunately one of them passed away yesterday. What is your suggestion for ensuring the happiness of the remaining one? We have been ensuring we are playing with her as often as possible and getting lots of attention. We are just unsure if we should get another one to keep her company or not?|oof, that's a hard question. If her health is really good and you intend to keep owning degus in the future I would probably get another one. If her health isn't great I would probably just spoil her rotten for the time she has left.
What do you guys think about coming to rhode island sometime?I would love to visit and volunteer|Well, we never actually get to go anywhere. There are too many animals in our house. But if you mean expanding to RI? I'm not sure. We are only even considering taking over already well established rescues and we won't consider expanding again until at least next September because this is still very much a learning process."

Both internships are 4 months long, but the Rubrik internship is full time (\~40 hrs/week) and the DRW internship is part-time (\~20 hrs/week).

I'm a sophomore majoring in CS. I don't really care much about the compensation difference between the two. Right now, I just want to take the one that would benefit my career in the long term and where I could learn the most and improve my skills for the future.

I would really appreciate it if you could help me make this decision."
k483dl,1,2020-11-30,"I'm quite sure that my mom has bipolar II, and I feel like I'm being driven crazy too",No-Cryptographer8643,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k483dl/im_quite_sure_that_my_mom_has_bipolar_ii_and_i/,"I'm in my early 20s, and I had to move back in with my mom due to covid. I always know my mom had depression, and she was recently diagnosed with it (and is also refusing to take drugs for it). Every couple years, when things aren't going well for her, she had said very dark things and tried to do very dark things with me, a child (back then).

I love my mom. I can confidently say that she is my best friend. I love watching TV shows with her, I love sharing memories with her. I love cooking for her, I love spending time with her. 

But I am now realizing that she has periods of ""highs"" where she is fine (happy, normal, etc.) and periods of very ""lows"" where even minor things make her irritated and scream at me. 

Since I have some income (though it is very low, lower than minimum wage bc I'm an intern), I was thinking about getting my own flat. I also need to start studying for a pre-professional school exam (LSAT/MCAT/GRE, not saying because I don't want to be identified), and I know I cannot do it. I also need some space.

But as much as I'd like to remove myself from her, it's really difficult because I also understand that she needs me. Let's be real, I'm not a drug or a medicine that she can just take and make herself be happy. I also don't think that I'm the bestest and the most understanding son. If she makes really annoying or irritating comments, then I make faces. I also stop talking to her when I am fed up. Those aren't necessarily my proudest moments, but I do recognize that I'm not this perfect person. But I do think that I have some kind of stabilizing effect. My parents are basically divorced, and she really depends on me for a lot. 

So I'm not sure what to do. There are a few things that I'd like to achieve, but they seem very difficult/unattainable.

1. How can I get her to go to a hospital and get herself treated? I'm no doctor, but I have read enough articles to recognize very prominent symptoms of Bipolar II. She. Needs. Help. But how does a person say this without telling a loved one that they are crazy? Because knowing my mom, she will think that I'm insinuating that she is. I'm not. I just know she needs help. But how do you say this? How can you encourage them to get help? 
2. Should I move out? I really could use some privacy. I could use some space for myself. I need me-time, but I don't have any when I come home. I'm an adult (it sounds funny as I type it but I am) and I need this. But I also don't want to somehow negatively impact her. What if she has dark thoughts again? It will be my fault if I move out and she decides to do unthinkable things to herself. 
3. How do I take care of myself? I'm tired. I work hard, and I have a very privileged life and I know it. But this doesn't mean I'm not tired. This doesn't mean I don't also feel like I'm drained. I feel like I'm being dragged into a dark place that I have been to before (also had depression and anxiety).

I feel like this kind of advice has already been widely seeked before, but each situation has its subtle differences and nuances. I already somewhat feel better as I can finally let this out to others. Please. Help me."
