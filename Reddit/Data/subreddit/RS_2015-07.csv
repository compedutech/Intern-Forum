3bp3ro,1,2015-06-30,How do I deal with a co-worker who is a massive distraction and is causing me to be counter productive?,workPlaceThrowaway17,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3bp3ro/how_do_i_deal_with_a_coworker_who_is_a_massive/,"Hello,
Using a throwaway just because.

I have recently started an internship at a large tech company working as a front end developer. I absolutely love this job, and MOST of the people there. I have learned so much in just the first few weeks starting. I have even impressed the director of the lab I work in, making a name for myself already.

My problem is that I work with someone who is here for her second internship and she is a massive distraction in the workplace. She has some family connections within this company and as a result she has a guaranteed job when she graduates. I on the other hand do not, so getting praise from the director was a big deal for me. Where I work was mainly R&amp;D last time she was here, this summer they are putting out a commercial product, and time is running out. She has way too much of a relaxed attitude and literally said ""It is ok if there are days you don't get anything done."" That is nuts in my opinion. I want to work hard, and secure a great opportunity for my future.

What is even worse is she was brought on as a front end developer, and she is an EE student with a minor in comp sci. She understands some code but otherwise doesn't know even some of the most basics concepts in programming. One of my biggest pet peeves is she doesn't turn to google first before asking questions. She hits a bug first compile and immediately turns to me for advice. What is crazy is it is usually me who goes to google for her... She hovers over my shoulder. I just can't get any work done this way. It's a huge distraction.

What drives me even more nuts is that after working a bit on something, or reading about some code she immediately pretends that she understands everything and that she is an amazing genius on the topic. When I am talking to my mentor or someone else in the lab she interrupts what I am saying to reiterate what I am saying, and most of the time she isn't even saying it correctly.
I worked 60 hours last week, working the hardest I could to make quality contributions to the product, and I won a lot of praise for that work. All she said was I was ""working too hard"" and that I need to relax. This is a top of the line lab, there is no such thing as ""working too hard"".

I am stuck with her on the same team as me, I have talked to my mentors and they helped a bit... they told me to try and task things out to her. But even tasking things out to her still makes her come to me with unnecessary questions that could be easily Googled...
I am not an asshole, I try to be a nice guy. I just don't know how I can be a nice guy in this situation anymore. This situation is giving me an extreme amount of unnecessary stress.

Any help would be welcomed. Please help.
---------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR Co-worker with family connections in internship is too laxed and doesn't understand to turn to Google first before asking me, a fellow intern...stressed out of my mind."
3bp3zh,1,2015-06-30,"[Career] Finance Professionals off Reddit, please shed some light on CFP and Series 65.",ambitiouslady,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3bp3zh/career_finance_professionals_off_reddit_please/,"Hello. My questions are directed specifically towards *professionals in the world of finance*. I will try to be as concise as possible for time saving purposes. You can skip to ***""Actual Questions""*** if you find unnecessary other sections. My big gratitude in advance to these who can help.

***Background:*** 25 years old, 1 year after graduating from american MBA program, finance concentration. BS in marketing from overseas (not a native English speaker).

***Even more background:*** While I was pursuing my MBA I did not do any internships due to legal restrictions, however, I did work part-time a grad research assistant (also I think most potential employers don't view it as a relevant experience). After graduating I didn't start a job search right away due to personal circumstances. So, I seriously started my job search only 1.5 month ago after moving cross country. 

***My perfect job:*** I want to HELP (in my understanding helping excludes ~~selling~~) people with optimizing their finances. I believe there  is the best way to do everything, including managing personal finances, and despite a need to do so, there are plenty of people who don't have time/desire for that, and would rather pay someone to help them. So, basically, I want to be that person who they would to pay. I am talking about a comprehensive and client-specific approach. I do not wish for my daily agenda to include cold calling ""prospects"" trying to ""hook them up"" for my glorious services. Does the job like that even exists or do I live in a dream world?

***Assumption:*** after a lot of reading, I assumed/concluded that I have the best chance of finding my dream job withing ""fee only"" advisers. (Is this correct?)

***What I have done so far:*** Besides a lot of reading about general advice on how to job hunt, resume write, interview behave, etc., I located all of the ""fee only"" advisers in my area (or at least that is what they say they are anyway). I have contacted a lot of them with simple message *""here I am with my skills, here is what I would like to do for living, can we work together?""*. Got my victorious response rate of 10% (2 advisers). They both (A &amp; B) seemed to be sincere and truly interested, however I may be confusing it with their politeness. A seemed to be doing exactly what I want to do; B - couldn't tell. Both recommended me to look into pursuing CFP. 

Besides that, thanks to my LinkedIn account, I got another potential job offer, but it sounded like what I described above what I would like NOT to do. An employer required me to get Series 65, and offered sponsorship for it. I had received another similar offer which required me to get Series 65 as well in the past (through LinkedIn as well), and like the other one it entailed cold calling.
It looks like CFP is a good match for me, but before I dedicate another 2 years of my life to pursuing it, I want to be very confident about whether it will give me what I want (see ""My perfect job"").

***Actual Questions:*** CFP vs Series 65? What is the major difference except from what I can find on my own by googling? Is pursuing one over another entail a different career path, and if it is so, what is it? When I encounter a job which requires Series 65 should I automatically associate it with selling rather than helping? If both of these (CFP &amp; Series 65) are not the path to arrive at my perfect job, then what is? And in general, what am I not getting/doing right?

Again, ***I would be very thankful for any insight information.***

*P.S. question: can I post this question in a different sub if I don't get an answer for it here?*

*P.S.2: Do I need to mention how frustrating it is for an infant redditor to find a relevant sub for a post, and to make sure it complies with all the rules, guidelines, etc.? 2 hours of frustration. So, if you find it unsuitable for this sub, please kindly refer me to the right one.*

3bpex0,0,2015-06-30,Installing Autodesk Products on the D:\ drive,[deleted],techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3bpex0/installing_autodesk_products_on_the_d_drive/,"I am working as an engineering intern for the summer at a tech start-up. Because it is a start-up he doesn't have a computer for me to use so I have been using my own (aging) laptop. 

**Computer Specs**

* Dell Studio 1749 
* Intel i7 q720 @1.6GHz
* 8 GB RAM (upgraded from 4)
* 120 GB Sandisk SSD C:\ drive
* 250 7200RPM HDD E:\ drive

My problem is that I am running out of space on my SSD (120GB) for the frustratingly space consuming Autodesk software. I ran SpaceSniffer and found that Autodesk had 30GB of stuff installed on the C drive. Even though I had told the installer to put Revit 2015 and Inventor 2016 on the E:\ drive, it installed all the libraries and extras on the C:\ drive. I have 120gb free on the HDD, and after the inventor install I only had 8 free on the SSD. I got angry when the drive filled and went through and uninstalled everything Autodesk related.

I will regularly be using Revit 2016, and Recap 360. I also want to install Inventor 2016 to use on my own time. I will also need to reinstall Revit 2015 for some projects. So far I haven't been able to find a [satisfactory answer](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/installation-licensing/install-on-d-drive/td-p/3313285) for how to manage where the installer puts everything. My main questions are: What should go on the SSD and what can go on the HDD, and how do I best control that?

I also have a few side questions. 

* I've read that you should have at least 20% of the SSD space be free space for best performance. Any thoughts on that?
* My pagefile.sys is only allocated 8GB right now, my dad says that I should double it to 16GB and that the swap should be 2x the RAM
* My hiberfil.sys file is 6GB. Shouldn't it be at least 8? Should I even keep it?
* How bad is it for SSD life to be installing and ininstalling these programs?

Is this kind of arrangement feasible and has anyone done it before? Also what kind of wage should I be trying to negotiate for? Since it would be part time and no benefits now the hourly rate should probably go up a fair bit? I was thinking of targeting 40$/hour. Is that too aggressive?

How did you get there?,TimelordViktorious,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3bq3ze/microsoft_explore_interns_google_engineering/,"Hey,

To students currently (or previously!) taking part in the Microsoft Explore Program or the Google engineering Practicum (or any first year internship at a big company, really), I want to hear your experiences! 

1. How did you land this job? (University Career Fair, Applied Online, etc)

2. How is your experience so far? Are you working on anything exciting? Are you being mentored?

3. How was your interview? What kind of questions were you asked? Did you have experience in data structures &amp; algorithms before-hand?

4. What sort of side projects or previous internships do you have?

I'm currently a student transferring from a small community college in Canada to  the University of Toronto for Computer Science &amp; Math. I'm quite excited about the road ahead and I'm equally excited about making an impact for myself in the field, through internships.

I currently do hold a bit of work experience as a web dev in the public sector as well as a general interest and minor contributions to Mozilla's Firefox for Android (alongside self-teaching android dev.). I'm working on a side project but I honestly have nothing super impressive. I also feel my technical interview skills are weak - I'm not a pro with DS&amp;A (hence why I'm going to University for the theory!). 

What can I do to maximize my chances of landing something sweet next summer?

Thanks!"

This particular internship's job description consists entirely of the kind of work I've been employed to do full-time in the past. I know that I'm not senior developer material yet by any means but I was surprised to be informed that I was only being considered as an intern. The company has listed the internship they're offering me as ideally suited for someone who is currently completing their undergraduate degree.

If I were being offered a more junior full-time role or even an entry-level position I'd take the job in a heartbeat. I have to admit that I'm very disappointed that this company has evaluated my skills to be lacking.

Should I attempt to negotiate or should I interpret this as an indication that I should look for a company that values my skills more highly?"

I have been feeling really stupid at my internship because it took me soo damn long to make good progress.
Since May I have been at my second internship. I was tasked with a project that at the time was exciting. Infact it still is really cool. But I feel like my progress has been extremely slow, and its due to my stupidity. Let me dive in.

Prior experience: 
Finished 3rd year of a CS degree. Have taken most of the core courses including networking and operating system. I also have many credits in math courses since I was a math major prior to also doing computer science. I have always been a mediocre student, partly because have lazy tendencies. But honestly, partly because I am a stupid person, who asks stupid questions. I had nobody to guide me, my parents are immigrants and I'm the oldest. 
 
My prior internship had me doing some java programming and research. It was a startup that wanted me to help optimize something. I don't believe I ended up helping them solve anything, but somehow got a good reference (out of pity probably). 

The project:
I was tasked with making a full web application that connects with 3rd party hardware. I had never made a full web app. so everything was a learning experience. After 6-7 weeks of learning the hardware, learning web development, and getting comfortable in a fresh startup, I was finally able to show a screen that connects to a backend via localhost and displays realtime data from the hardware. I honestly feel like a complete idiot that it took me this long, and that the founder was expecting more from me. 

So, should I give up in this field? I hate this feeling that there are people from more well known universities who could do this in much less time than I. I feel like the incompetent employee. "
3br9bx,45,2015-07-01,[update]Just started an internship and the boss said I could try to re-start a water jet machine that hasn't run in years. Looking for suggestions for CNC control boards.,DumpyLips,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3br9bx/updatejust_started_an_internship_and_the_boss/,"I just started an internship and the boss said I could try and start a Flow jet Bengal 4X4 water jet from 1998. I've found the service manual and a box of spare parts/tools. 

What I've gathered from rumors around the shop are that the computer and boards that interface the servo pack are fried. The computer is gone, apparently with some 3rd party computer repair place so at the moment it's difficult for me to verify that this is the case.

I've found a few companies that retrofit cnc machines with new computers, controllers, servos, etc but before I tell my boss we have to shell out $4-12k to retrofit his machine, I'd really like to try and run the machine with a DIY hobby controller and some free/open source software.

I have exactly ZERO concern for accuracy or precision at this point, I just want to be able to basically move the cutting head to demonstrate that the servo pack, motors etc are functional for as cheap as possible.

The servo controllers are SGDA-04VS (x2)

In pic one and two, you can see where the computer is *supposed* to be and the 60 pin ribbon that connects to the computer and servo drivers.

What do you guys think would be the best course of action moving forward?

Should I start with some kind of adapter for the 60 pin ribbon, connect it to a new computer with a free/opensource cnc software to verify that the boards are in fact fried?

I also have several books over Java that I've been working with in my spare time so once I get a good understanding of Python and C++ I'll probably really start into Java heavily. This field is probably the most expansive and enjoyable field I've found so I really do want to get started with internships as soon as possible.

 I'm funding all of my school through student loans currently because I didn't graduate high school with a good GPA and then had an awful first semester that I took time off to mature after. My GPA is now up to a 3.31 so I'm smart enough to do great and now I'm mature enough to not put off school work to chase a girl. Are there any CS based scholarships I'm eligible for now? Every time I asked at my community college they looked at me like I was stupid and I haven't figured out who at MSU would know this stuff.

I appreciate anyone who has any advice or recommendations for me. I love this sub because it gives me hope that I'm gonna escape rural Kentucky even though I'm pretty average."

I don't really have a ton of experience, but obviously I want to practice.

For practice over the summer, I am trying my hand at developing one or two simple iOS apps (literally just starting #1, so I've spent most of my time getting a grasp on Swift). The app is a pretty simple idea, but I still feel it's one that could potentially make money.

This brings the question--what should I put on my GitHub? Obviously, as I look for internships this fall and winter, I want to have something up there (it is barren right now). But I don't want my application to be open source, so I don't feel like it should go up there. Should I put my projects from my intro course up? (They are extremely simple projects doing medial tasks in MatLab and C++). Basically, what type of stuff should go into my GitHub repository for potential employers to look at and what type of stuff should I keep proprietary?

Sorry if I am missing something obvious, as I said, I'm new to this all.

Thanks!"

I am supposed to be getting money for the government while I'm studying.
For some reason, I have to donate 100% of that to my mom. Which I do not mind that much, seeing as it's apparently hard for her to come by.
This does mean I haven't bought new clothes etc in ages.

Now I finally have found an internship, but I have to wake  up at 5 AM and I'm home at 8 PM. No biggie, were it not that my mom works 3 - 3,5 hours a day and still doesn't want to pick me up from the train station.

Today my train was late, which means I was home at 20:30. I tell my mother ""I'm tired"", her answer: ""yeah me too"" ... I think to myself ""WHY? you spent 3 hours at your job and you did nothing at the house, how can you possibly be tired?"".

But I wave this thought away, seeing as at least she cooke...""Yeah, I didn't feel like cooking because it was too warm outside. There's still some stuff from yesterday left.""

At this point I'm boiling.

Anyways, because I'm away until 8 every day, I evidently need some pocket change because I need to be able to buy something to drink etc. So I say ""Hey mom, could I have some money"" (WHICH IS TECHNICALLY MY MONEY) and her answer is ""I hope that internship is over quickly, it's costing me way to much money.""...

I'm too stunned to say anything as I walk out the door.
Now I'm sitting here thinking to myself. I give her 400+ euro a month, and when I ask for 10 euro she's complaining because it's costing HER too much? She's actually actively trying to get me to quit just so she has 10 extra euro a week?

She does nothing in the household. The cat puked on the floor two weeks ago and it's still there. There's fleas in the sofa and there's blood in the kitchen from when one of the cats dragged in a bird.
It doesn't even come to her mind to clean it up. MEAN-EFFING-WHILE I'm home at 8 and I have to go to bed at 9-9:30 because I need to wake early again.
I have to tip-toe around the house so I don't stand in nasty stuff.

The cherry on top is the fact that she generally sleeps at her boyfriend""s place, where he and his parents do all the cleaning. When he asks her to do anything she answers ""I have my own household to clean and take care of"".

THEN FUDGING DO IT."

What should I study; Java, .NET, or database?",bleuberry73,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3bs87w/about_to_start_a_new_government_sponsored/,"Florida State College Jacksonville was recently awarded a [government grant to offer an IT crash course](http://www.fscj.edu/press-releases/fscj-awarded-3-million-grant-by-the-department-of-labor) to unemployed individuals in order to get them back into the workforce.  I have applied for the very first class which will be starting in a few weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

The way the grant is structured, the school works with a local business who sponsors the training and provides a paid internship after the training.  FSCJ is currently working with CSX who is looking for Java programmers, .NET programmers, and database managers (SQL maybe?)

&amp;nbsp;

This will be a boot-camp style crash course.  Intro to programming for 3 weeks followed by 8 weeks in either Java, .NET, or database.  According to the school, CSX has told them that as long as the students have an aptitude for programming and complete the course, they can learn on the job.

&amp;nbsp;

I have never taken a programming course, though I have taught myself some rudimentary scripting skills.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I would like opinions from those of you already in the field as to which of the three I should choose?  Is one easier to pick up on than the others?  Are job opportunities better for one over the other?  Is one less stressful in the workplace?  Any advice at all that you have to offer would be appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;

edit:  Ok.  Two votes for not pursuing database right off the bat.  So, between JAVA and .NET, is one easier to learn quickly than the other since this will be a programming crash-course?  Any compelling reasons to learn one over the other?"

I have a degree in international Business since last year. I have been working as an administrative assistant since September 2012, first in a small business and now in a big multinational (with a small presence in my country). Both companies are in the same industry.
I have a standing offer for an entry-level job, ready for me whenever I want it, in a Government Ministry, in which I coincidentally did an internship at two years ago. (My former job let me do the internship part-time). 
I really like my current job because I make more money (which is by no means a lot but I am 22 and have no real responsibilities/dependents) and it’s less responsibility/stress than my last job, but it is a dead end, and as much as I am enjoying it now I have to move on. Having said that, this is a very lucrative industry.
In my job prospect, the type of work I would be doing, I believe would be more closely related to my field and would be coherent with the graduate studies I want to pursue (international economy/finance). 
Now, some pros and cons:
Current job/Industry
Pros:
-	Higher wages compared to similar positions in other industries.
-	I already have experience in the industry having worked at two companies.
-	Could easily make a change of path into marketing/sales (where the wages are even higher due to sales commissions) if I ever decide to chase the money and let go of the high executive career life dream.
-	My experience would translate easily if I decide to work in a different company and different industry.
-	Companies in said industry are all privately owned.
Cons:
-	High competition
-	I do not see myself as being very good at marketing/sales
-	High executive jobs (my aim) would require having worked at sales.
Job prospect:
(I should note that I don’t have all the absolute details about this position, I would receive more If/when I accept it, but I have general information and having been an intern at the Ministry before so I have a fair idea)
Pros:
-	Higher entry wage than my current job (maybe almost double)
-	Better position/position title, even if responsibilities wouldn’t differ that much (I’m tired of being an assistant)
-	Related to my degree and partially related to the graduate studies I want to pursue
-	Better hours

Cons:
-	Being a government position it becomes unstable if the current president/political party changes.
-	Hard to escalate for same political reasons.
-	Very “specialized job”. I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to make the transition to a privately owned company when I inevitably am let go of/have to leave.

The job prospect is better as of NOW but I worry about the future, I want to have a career that’s coherent and consistent, thought of, with goals and personal growth other than “pay bills”, and given that I’m young and unattached, I feel I should work towards that goal. I don’t want to jump from a job to another, would like to join a company that I can stay in for YEARS and not have to quit because there’s no possibility for growth. That said, I want to make more money in the not too distant future.
Family and friends opinion:
Mother and family: Take prospect
Boyfriend: Don´t take prospect
I think I could really benefit from others perspective. Thank you in advance!

Note: English is not my first language.

3bst8d,1,2015-07-01,The Job Hunt is Brutal,coldburido,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3bst8d/the_job_hunt_is_brutal/,"Hey guys, I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for with my post. I think I'm just kinda worn out by my job search. I'm a 22 year old in my last semester of college and I'm beginning to doubt my choice of getting a BA in Psychology (I also minor in Business Management and Philosophy). 

This is the first summer that I cannot find anything at all for work. I started with my standards very high, applying to only internships that were relevant to my learning or future career goals. With enough time, I had to resolve by just applying to restaurants like I usually do for summers, which really ain't that bad. By the way, I really tried my best on this. I applied to over 20 different Craigslist listings. I'm not too educated about other methods of finding work, but I'm strictly looking for something to do this summer that may extend into the fall, which makes craigslist seem more attractive.

I ended up getting three offers. Place 1 was ready to start training me, but I chose to decline the offer because Place 2 and 3 had better hours and location. By the way, I had already interviewed with Place 2 and 3 and was told that I would have training but no time or date was specified. Today was supposed to be my training day at Place 2, I haven't heard from Place 3 since the interview (4 days ago). 

I'm feeling pretty beat up by all this. I tried my best to stay positive throughout this job search, despite thinking the whole time, this experience won't teach my anything about my future aspirations. It's been a little over a month of job-hunting and I feel like it's broken me for now. /r/jobs, how do I recover from this? What can I do to stop these feelings of desperation, of bitterness towards education and the economy and all the vague things that one could blame?

TL;DR:  It's really hard to find a job, my failure is creating a lot of self-doubt. Help!"

Any kind of general answer regarding my title question would be great, or you can answer the questions below if that helps. I'm also happy to PM/leave in comments details on my specific situation and program options.

I'm in freelance marketing at the moment and am considering doing an MBA to either grow my own business or get a job in-house for a company in marketing communications, coordination/management, or brand strategy. Still figuring that part out and hoping the MBA will guide me in a certain direction.

So I'm wondering: 

1. Does it matter much where the MBA is from and what type of program it is, or is it more of a box most companies are looking to tick for potential employees so long as they also have the right work experience?

2. What about if someone is going for their first job out of a full-time MBA program (but they have several years experience prior to the program)? Do they look more at the type of MBA then? Is internship experience within an MBA very important?

3. How much do any of these variables matter: school location and region, national/worldwide rankings, Exec vs. Full-time, one year vs. two year program, international vs. U.S., strengths of that program, and whether or not the candidate specialized within a certain area in their MBA or did a more general management program?

4. Do you think an American candidate who did their MBA abroad would be looked upon favorably or unfavorably when trying to secure a job in the U.S.? What if the program they did is highly regarded in Europe and ranks respectably worldwide but is not at all a known household name in the U.S.? 

Would you consider an American candidate from a European program even if it meant they would be need to relocate from that country back to the U.S to start the job?

**Any general advice? I'm wondering if I'm blowing this whole name-brand recognition/ranking/location thing for MBAs way out of proportion when it comes to the hiring process, or if it's actually as important as the schools claim it is.**"

I've posted here a few times, and they seemed to have been well received.  As I mentioned in my [previous stories](https://www.reddit.com/user/isp_tekkie/submitted/), I work for a local ISP (henceforth referred to as $LISP).  What I haven't shared yet is how I got my start, and I know everyone loves an origin story.  So without further ado, let's get down to it.

**tl;dr - ""You've already proven that you don't seem to know what you're doing; how would you like to get paid for it?""**

*We open on a crisp autumn evening*
____
It was warm that day, so the cool night air was greatly appreciated.  I only remember because I had just finished a 10-hour shift at my fast food job, and, despite showering, I was still uncomfortably sticky from the combination of the humidity, sweat, and grease from work.  After a long week of work and classes, I was more than grateful that it was Friday.  I was hanging out at my (then) girlfriend's house, bouncing around the interwebs, when I was approached by my girlfriend's mom ($gfMom).

&gt;$gfMom: isp_tekkie, can you change our wifi password?

I didn't have many skills at the time, but what I did have was general computer magic.  While I didn't have much experience with router configuration, I did know how to use Google.

&gt;Me: Of course I can.

___
*Pride comes before destruction...*
___

I pulled up the router login page with ease, tried a few default logins, but to no avail.  'No problem,' I thought to myself, 'I'll just reset the router and reconfigure it.'  I grabbed a paper-clip and pressed in the little black Reset button.  In 10 seconds, the little box forgot all it knew and returned to a default state, proudly broadcasting it's standard SSID for all the world to see.  I logged in, changed the SSID and password, and declared the work complete.  Minus the internet connection, of course.

I hadn't bothered to consider that *maybe* there was important information on that router.  Y'know, the kind of information that allows the internet to flow like water through a faucet.

After making a few calls to some friends who were much better at networking than I, it was determined that the connection was, at least for the meantime, broken.  And given that it was 9 o'clock on Friday night, I assumed that support for $LISP was all but gone for the weekend.  I resigned myself to my own stupidity and acknowledged my mistake.  As penance for my error, I offered to drive the router to $LISP myself (about 45 minutes away) and get it reprogrammed, as well as cover any associated expenses.

___
*Two days and one beautifully sunny drive later...*
___

I pulled up to the offices of $LISP, router in hand.  I walked it in and handed it to the woman behind the counter, sheepishly explaining that I defaulted the router and now the internet doesn't work.  She just smiled and waved me to the back.  She spent the next 10 minutes walking me through how to log into the router and change my desired settings.  She even gave me a copy of the configuration file in case I ever did it again.

After gathering my stuff, thanking her, and walking to the door, I handed her my resume (always keep one handy, folks) and mentioned how I would be looking for an internship come springtime.  She took it and asked me to call them in the spring to see if any positions were available.  I told her I would be in contact and left.  I was excited at the prospect of being a real tech and finally quitting my fast-food job.

Ironically enough, a semi-serious injury later that night would end up putting me out of work until spring, but that's a story for another time."

So I just graduated this past May with a BS Computer Science from a large state university and started a job in mid-May at a startup in NYC. I'm a junior iOS developer, but here's the bad part:

Basically, from the get-go I've felt sort of undervalued by them. They offered me a 65k salary and equity (after I negotiated up from their lowball 60k salary + equity offer). I accepted, because I didn't have any internship experience and thought I wouldn't mind taking a lowish salary. I'm sort of an unknown quantity as far as someone hiring me goes, and I'm very reasonable about that.

I'm just over a month into my job and I literally just dread going into work. First they told me to come into work when I'll be productive. Cool, so I shot for getting into work at 9:30-10:00am like the lead engineer told me to do. After about a week of coming in at 10 and working until about 6:30 or 7pm, I was pulled into the hallway by the CEO and asked to come in earlier around 9:30. Cool. A little weird that you're making a big deal out of a half hour, but ok.

Then, at an engineering meeting that included the CEO, we discussed the next 6 months. I stayed quiet mostly, but I proposed that we maybe make a style guide for our code so that we all write similar code. Standard fare. The CEO mockingly asked the lead engineers ""What is that like a book report for code?"" In addition, I recommended that we get a build server going with something like Jenkins. Both of those ideas got shot down immediately by the two lead engineers.

In addition, I recommended that we alter our custom Xcode templates to be more organized. This was accepted by them, and then when we were being asked to give time estimates, the CEO cut me off and said it's going to take &lt;2 hours to do the Xcode templates. I'm just like ugh yeah, no shit. That level of micromanaging signaled to me a severe lack of trust in me, and made me very unhappy to go to work from that point on.

Finally, over the past week, I've been working on a pretty comprehensive program to automate one of our processes, and I've hit some speed bumps along the way due to using programming languages / new technologies / solving a relatively difficult problem of parsing unstructed text and turning it into a structured CSV. I initially said 5 days for everything, but it ended up taking about 7 days. Classic junior engineer mistake of not estimating time correctly. The CEO went to use my script Monday when it was half-complete and after seeing the output, chided me over how long it was taking and even asked if we should just throw out my work. All because it wasn't catching a few edge cases that were easily fixed that same day.

All in all, I'm feeling micromanaged, untrusted, and I'm getting a sense that they think I'm incompetent, which is absolutely not the case, but I'll admit that it's having an effect on my work output. I can't really focus at work because I constantly am stressed out about getting pulled out into the hallway by the CEO for something again. It's hostile.

What would you guys recommend? I don't want to leave after a month, but at the same time, I'm getting extremely depressed here."

Back story:   

I have a bsee in engineering from a top 100 school. Struggled a lot during school. Had to retake a lot of classes. Eventually graduated with like 180 credits. Sigh of relief.. .Few months after graduation took up a contract job for an aerospace company. Didn't realize it would be 0 training, mentoring, etc so it wasn't the best learning environment.  Kind of figured they weren't going to extend the contract or hire me considering the lay offs going on at the time.  

Fast forward 15 months and here I am still jobless. Feels like there aren't even entry level jobs anymore. Without an internship or knowing someone it seems fruitless.  

I've had plenty of interviews... About two a month at least but no bites.  

I haven't really thought about getting a master's because I barely got my bachelor's and it still wouldn't help my lack of experience.  

I'm thinking about studying for some IT certifications and perhaps trying out my luck there. I've always been pretty tech savvy and in reality have troubleshooted technical issues all my life.  I just don't know what other options there are.  Maybe engineering was the wrong major? 

I've worked temp jobs while I've been looking and have taken some online programming classes but it doesn't feel that productive.  

Tldr: struggled in school, barely graduated, can't find an entry level job."

3buqtd,7,2015-07-02,Am I over-preparing for my first internship?,ThatGuyqwq,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3buqtd/am_i_overpreparing_for_my_first_internship/,"Hey. Long time lurker here, first time thread-poster. Some background:

**tl;dr - I landed an internship but because of my degree, lack of computer science theory and feeling I am not up to their standards, I believe I may be over-studying for it. I picked up several books which I am trying to complete before the internship starts. Looking for advice on how others have prepared for their first internship before it started and whether or not I am over-exaggerating this.**

I'm working on a degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in software development. First starting, I thought this was fairly equivalent to a computer science degree but it turns out it's more hands-on based via programming/technical stuff vs theoretical. Oops...

i landed a very good internship starting in September. The thing that kind of upsets me is I applied as a software developer but received a devops role. I didn't know anything about devops but didn't want to lose the opportunity, so I took it. However, I was quite upset because I have a feeling I lost the developer role due to my lack of a computer science background. 

I'm trying to study as much as I can about devops and the information I received from my future supervisor. I feel like a had a fluke getting the job and I'm compensating for it by over-studying during summer. Regarding my studying, a few examples are:

* The company uses C# and other .NET technologies whereas I've been using mainly Java. I know they're similar but I still have the urge to study because I have little knowledge about .NET and I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up quickly. 


* Supervisor said they work with a windows-stack. I have limited knowledge of the windows stack and so I picked up a book on Windows Server 2012 and loaded a VM to play around and study it.


* He also said they use Ruby and Power Shell. I picked up a book to refresh my Ruby skills and a book on Power Shell. I also picked up a book on IIS, which I believe is Microsoft's web server.. I think..


As you can see, I picked up a lot of books. I also picked up additional books on TDD, design patterns and on clean code. I picked these up because I went onto their website and looked at job descriptions for devops/software developers. I did learn a little bit about these topics during my software engineering courses but I don't feel like it was enough compared to other schools that teach ""real computer science""

I do enjoy studying, but I am feeling a lot of pressure as I believe I am not up to par to their standards. All of their job description list ""strong computer science background"" and here I am sitting with a lousy CIS degree. 

Am I over-exaggerating this? Should I continue to study during summer and get as much in before I begin or do I need to slow down and do this when I get to the job? My biggest fear is getting fired from an internship.

Currently, I have an Associate's degree in Information Technology. I go to a 3 year private university (all year round) that is ""career focused"", meaning we don't stress the menial classes like Psychology and whatnot. The school is well known with employers in the surrounding area, which is really nice since I'm almost guaranteed to get a job just by having a degree from my university. I currently have a GPA of 3.56. Some of the courses I've taken are:

-Computers and Application Software

-Programming Logic

-Computer Networks

-Computer Architecture and Troubleshooting

-Internet Concepts and Human Computer Interaction

-Network Server and Operating Systems

-Linux Administration

-Network Security

-Routers &amp; Switches

-Routers &amp; Switches II

-System Administration Scripting

-IT Project Management

-Mail Servers

-Computer &amp; Network Forensics

(I also have a lot of white papers that I made for each of the final projects in these classes ranging from 20-40 pages each that I plan to show employers in interviews.)

As far as work experience goes, when I was a senior in high school, I worked with my school's system admin to learn a lot of the basics. The summer before I went to college, I got an internship at a restaurant technology company where I took care of servicing the POS systems for many major restaurants around the country. After 5 months, I decided to move onto bigger and better things, and got a job at one of the top Universities in the state as an IT assistant, which I've now been at for 1 year and 8 months. Currently, my work weeks are anywhere from 30-45 hours (on top of school). I've worked with such things as:

-Spiceworks

-Linux

-Windows (XP, 7, 8.1, Server 2008, Server 2012)

-Mac OS X

-Active Directory

-Group Policy

-Microsoft Exchange

-Creating and implementing a WSUS server

-Powershell scripting

-VMware vSphere

-Battling Crypto Wall (and winning)

-Desktop management

-Cisco Routers and Switches

-Application Management

-Remote Desktop solutions

-I've done a lot of racking and stacking servers, network switches, etc.

Based on all of this (and the fact that I am 20 now), how likely would it be that I land a nice job (that doesn't deal with me having to be in a call center reading from a script) when I get out of school? What do you think my pay range should be (being that I also live in Wisconsin)? Could I get a good job now with my current degree and experience that pays well?"

I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and will be returning to the company where I interned last summer. However, I will be working on a team that uses different technologies and I am unsure what is expected of me in terms of prior knowledge. How much preparation should one do before the first day of work? Or will there be a ton of time to learn on the job?

The team I will be working on uses Java and a number of open source frameworks. I have had a small amount of prior experience with Java, but it is mostly in Android programming. I plan on reading [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683) and [Thinking in Java](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Java-Edition-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486/) prior to my start data. Should I also begin to explore the frameworks?   

Since my internship led to this job offer, there is no formal description of technologies which I am expected to already know. That being said, I am already familiar with their build system, methods of version control, and other internal systems.  

Thanks in advance for any advice! I searched this subreddit and checked the FAQ but could not find anything detailing first-day expectations.   "

He is ALSO requesting access to systems that are co-mingled by a sister non-profit in the same building. Sadly I was informed I was not able to buck the Chairman as he would simply terminate my contract for refusing his request (Stupid I know.) However the sister charity is also a client and they are asking why non-IT users should not be allowed admin access, with the intent of taking it to the parent national charity explaining how stupid this is and some of the shenanigans that have been going on. I have been tasked with composing an eloquent, thoughtful, polite, and positive E-mail stating why it is incredibly abnormal for a request of this nature and so on and so forth. I'm hoping some of you can both empathize and sympathize and help me out....

Little frustrated today

Tl;Dr Started screaming at poor monkeys in the cars on the highway on the drive home today.

Ps, and yes i'm seriously considering dropping the client.

Edit:

Here's the E-mail I finally sent to the Chairman of Org A

Mr. Chairman
First off, I want to say that I understand your desire to know what's going on in IT and get things done quickly, and I want to work together with you to achieve that goal. I am not here to say ""no"", I am here to be helpful, solve problems, and if possible prevent them from ever happening in the first place.
That being said, I feel that I would not be doing the right thing if I didn't push back on your request for full administrative access to our infrastructure. As a system administrator, one of my primary duties is the safety and security of our computer network. One of the important rules for keeping a network secure is called ""Least Privilege"": we only use an admin account when it is absolutely necessary, we only give the keys to our critical infrastructure to staff who really need that access to get their job done, and when we do give access, we control it and make sure that each staff member cannot access anything they don't need. In most cases, certain sysadmins have access to only certain parts of the infrastructure, and we pass requests to each other depending on who has what access.
This rule is a common standard in the IT industry and we should absolutely adhere to it as much as possible.
If you need access to a device or service, please let me know what you need to get done and I will make sure you have the access that allows you do it. If you are requesting admin access so you can keep an eye on what's going on, I would like to work with you to come up with a solution to that problem. We can schedule a regular meeting where I go over my open tasks and talk about what's going on in our infrastructure, or I can grant you access to view the monitoring system I use so you can know everything is going OK, and have access to usage and performance metrics. I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make good decisions about our IT; please let me know what specific information or visibility you need into our operations and I will make it happen.

​That being said I must be absolutely clear, that if you decide you must have administrative rights, I can no longer be held liable for any portion of the network and my duties as a Volunteer systems administrator will, sadly, have to be immediately terminated. 
Please respond via email your intentions.


And the E-mail I sent to manglement of Org B

$Executive_Administrator/$ChairmanOfOrgB,

Before I complete this request I will require written consent that you understand I can't guarantee the state of the network at any point after you grant $ChairmanOfOrgA administrative rights as at any point someone else could cause instability. Credentials can easily be compromised even with the best of intentions, this out of the scope of our original service contract (in that this is NOT for the general well-being and security of the Foundation Information Systems). Any Labor arising from this granted admin access will result in regular fees of 100$/Hr to repair any issues caused, and up to 300$/Hr for data recovery.

This is a non-reversible decision because even if at a later date you revoke his control, there's no telling what changes or compromises have already been made (including creating or changing accounts in the active directory). Ultimately it IS your decision but I must be clear that this will violate the 4th bullet of our service agreement in that it goes against the security of our network granting access to a non-it professional.

Random folks with admin access make changes you will never hear about, which, in theory, you're much more likely to know about if another sysadmin makes them (assuming you talk to your coworkers). So, fixing new problems is likely to start from a place of unusual ignorance about the actual state of the machine, leading to a giant waste of time (money).
Non-IT users messing around with IT are not doing the job they were hired to do. If they want to do IT, they should apply for that position. Otherwise, what important work are they leaving undone? Most of the time there is no reason to have admin access to do their job.

Rather than provide him with administrative access I would much rather provide him with drawings on how the network work.

Here is a link showing how important maintaining proper security is http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/06/epic-fail-how-opm-hackers-tapped-the-mother-lode-of-espionage-data/​

Edit 2: Response received From $ChairmanOfOrgA
CBCITGUY, I understand and appreciate your position.  One day soon you will understand mine. There is no need for discussion until after my request has been completed as requested.  
Thank you. ChairmanOfOrgA

Edit 3: Holy bajeesus I didn't expect this many comments

Edit 3.5: Lets add some backstory.

Org A Hierarchy Regional Office
Grand Poobaa - it is what it is

Org A Players
$ChairmanOfOrgA - Unknown entity, retired
 Edit: Sounds like a good guy, background check pulled up former VP of IS for major company. Convo confirmed. Requesting I do not resign until after we've spoken.
$GeneralSecretary - Hired me as an intern and kept me on. Reason I graduated years ago. Works FT at Org A
$FormerChairmanOfOrgA2 - Reason I received a massive scholarship for BA, Was forcibly politically removed 2 years ago, strongly believe to be pulling strings of $ChairmanOfOrgA, Father of $FacilitiesCoordinator's lifetime friend. Retired, BusyBody

Org B
$ChairmanOfOrgB - Former Chairman Of Org A ($FormerChairmanOfOrgA2's replacement) Has a FT job in politics, paid very well.
$Executive_Administrator - Has FT job in finances, paid very well.
$FacilitiesCoordinator - Busy Body, Sometimes referred to as Slagathor, Works FT at Org B, firmly believed to be in league with $ChairmanOfOrgA and $FormerChairmanOfOrgA2.

Story
$EA is being investigated utilizing monitoring software on her pc for theft of company property. She has been printing 100's of pages of Full color prints on Org B's dime and selling them for profit without reimbursing Org B (She runs a graphics company). $ChairmanOfOrgA just happens to be a client. She also has a sexual harassment complaint against her from $GeneralSecretary for some comments made a year ago. I have also filed a complaint against her for some comments she made around the same time.

Edit 4: Last night at about 1215 am I did a trusty google search for $ChairmanOfOrgA and Found that he was listed as Executive Administrator of OrgB (Keep in mind $Executive_Administrator is still performing his funcitons and no one has told him or $ChairmanOfOrgB). The only way OrgB's website can be changed is if $FacilitiesCoordinator Makes the change (I wanted hands off as the website has crashed multiple times under her reign). I screenshotted this and forwarded it to $ChairmanOfOrgB and $ExecutiveAdministrator and $GeneralSecretaryOfOrgA.

Edit 5: At approximately 330pm today I received a text message from $Executive_Administrator ""I have resigned, it's done, i'm sorry, thank you""

Edit 6: At Approximately 5pm $ChairmanOfOrgB Called me. He and Executive_Administrator turned in resignation and forwarded reports of the investigation being run on $FacilitiesCoordinator to GrandPooBaa

Edit 7: I'm in the process of creating an offsite backup as requesting by $General_Secretary Of all investigation related materials as well as cleaning up my account on the network. Once complete I will nuke my account, and clean the HD's that may contain personal information, restart the backups so that none of my data can be recovered (And not jeopardize BC of OrgA) and then I will submit my official resignation.

Edit 8: Just got off phone with ChairmanOfOrgA He has requested I NOT resign, I informed him if it's a password/access issue that i'm legally/ethically and morally obligated to provide them with there access, so if that's why just let me resign now. He said no, he would like to make changes to personnell, and he wants to meet with me on the 23rd to go over his plans for the network and he's expecting it to go at least 2 hours.... Guess I'm not being replaced. Also turns out I've been being lied to by A lot of people in the org.

Expenses for next 4 years: 48k tuition cost, 5k misc. (No rent, utility, and etc overhead cost)

Income for next 4 years: Summer internship (Unknown. Assume $0)

* Of the 36k in TFSA I will Invest 5k into Tangerine balance portfolio(60% bonds/40% stocks)

* 16k available on hand, 12k will be gone this September leaving me with 4k on hand until 2016 September

Is it wise to put 5k in an investment portfolio? I'm expecting a moderate annual return of 4%. I am not planning to add or remove funds from this portfolio for the next 4 years. I don't believe that it's smart to use a brokerage to manage my own investments with only 5k. Or should I just put it into TFSA?

I've been suicidal for the last three years and have come close to going through with it a few times. I've always been stopped by the thought of the pain I would put my mom through. This time it's different. I feel so numb to everything. And that numbness is overwhelming. It's crippling. And everything in my life is suffering because of it. If I don't end things now, everything is just going to get worse. 

I don't have anyone close to me anymore. I've distanced myself from everyone because I feel like sooner or later I'll take my life. 

I can't think clearly and that's why I'm posting here. Maybe someone will have advice on how I can save myself. 

So here's my life. At 22 I'm living downtown and my roommate bailed on me so I'm stuck paying $1050/month for rent. I only make about $650/month and I've used up all my savings. I've asked for financial help from anyone I can think of and this month I'm short again. I'll probably have to go to collections and my credit score will be shot. 

I had the blessing of a prestigious internship this summer. That plus my current job had me working 94 hours a week. Because of that, I can no longer relax and I'm constantly stressed. I talked to my father for advice and he called me a quitter which hurt so badly. 
It sounds so cliche but I've always wanted anyone, especially my father to be proud of me. It seems like everyone has given up on me and I'm just a giant disappointment. 

I've battled manic depression for years and haven't found any medication that has worked well. I can't even afford to see my psychiatrist anymore so I'm currently not on anything. 

I find happiness through my achievements. I know that's not healthy but it's what gets me by. I feel like people expect big things from me and no matter how hard I try, I can't come through. 

I haven't experienced joy or hope for the longest time. All I know is disappointment and numbness. 

I honestly don't know if I'll go through with it this time whether that's tonight or in a week. But I'm reaching out for anything to help me.

I'm currently a rising junior in college and interning at a Big 4 company. The company offers interns the opportunity to interview for an internship next summer with them, which I'll definitely be trying for. While the interview (and possible offer) is a while away, I've been thinking about my options a bit. Particularly, I've been thinking that in order to give myself the best exposure to the tech industry, it might be a good idea to apply/interview for smaller companies. At the same time, however, there's definitely some advantage to having a Big 4 company on my resume for two summers. And while I'm happy with the company I'm at, there's definitely an appeal to smaller companies (i.e., bigger impact). I'm just thinking about the possibility of turning down (assuming I get it) this offer for another one from a smaller, but still solid company.

Any thoughts? Have any of you turned down a Big 4 offer for a smaller company? Did you regret it? Or if you didn't turn it down, do you wish you did? Appreciate any input."

I am starting university in September (in Toronto) and am working on improving my coding skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms, etc. I tried applying for jobs this summer at the Microsoft Store, Apple Store, and various fast food places... but made the mistake of applying only 2 weeks ago... So I think I'm out of luck. But when it comes to CS and Engineering related internships, when is the best time to apply? I really want to avoid the mistake I made this year... 

And what should I do to prepare? I'm going into engineering next year but am most likely looking for software related jobs for next summer."

I had to stop school because I simply didn't have the money. My parents didnt have it, and I dont have the credit to get a loan. 

I completed 3 years in a 5 year computer engineering program. My grades were so-so. I was dealing with some serious medical problems that negatively affected my studies. 

I'm currently working a part time job and constantly applying for internships. I had one  but got laid off with the rest of the interns after 2 months. I haven't had luck since then. 

So, does anyone have any tips on how I can market myself, or know of any jobs that will pay well enough for me to survive? 

Financially, I'm completely on my own, so keep that in mind when giving advice. "
3byflm,11,2015-07-03,The application process: Getting drained and depressed,justanotherjobseeker,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3byflm/the_application_process_getting_drained_and/,"I graduated with a fairly good degree with a decent/average GPA that could have been way better but due to some anxiety/stress, it wasn't excellent. Still, I performed a lot better (grade wise) than many of my friends and was very involved and active in school. I've technically been applying to jobs since my junior year to get an intern position relevant for my eventual graduate role. Since then, I ran into all sorts of problems, constantly told positions were all full, even though I talked directly to manager, met them in person and dressed well. There wasn't a resume required for these positions, just filling out an application/interviewing, which I reviewed my skills with a neighbor who works in speech. My peers who were getting jobs were getting it basically per a hit or miss basis-just depended on who could grab whatever open position that wanted an intern. Now at post-graduate I've finally reached approximately 100+ apps. I had to take some time off in applying for personal reasons, but my mental health is definitely getting affected. I have never felt so depressed/empty in my life. Doing well in school has always been a coping mechanism for me and I feel like a failure. Currently, the only thing I kind of have going is a volunteering. I don't want to sound like I am making myself a ""victim"" here,  but it is slightly heartbreaking to work hard in academics since age 14 and see yourself behind while peers who've done half the work are getting by. I hate making comparisons because of course I want to feel good for people, but I'm just doing the best I can and still sort of stuck. Just hoping somebody who may understand can give some positive words or good advice. 

By the way, I'm in a STEM degree. "
3bzk7b,8,2015-07-03,Do my personal projects need to be visual? How can I make my resume stand out if I have many factors going against me?,unybtv,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3bzk7b/do_my_personal_projects_need_to_be_visual_how_can/,"I'm a CS student and keep reading about how personal projects should be things you can show off in an interview or have others look at, does that mean that they basically have to be web applications? Although I do not want to go into academia, I am still much more interested in the theoretical side of CS. I am currently trying to figure out what kind of projects to work on to put on my resume, but can't decide. I do not want to work as a web developer, but that seems to be the easiest kind of project to show off. It also seems like the easiest way to make projects seem impressive, for example to a person without much knowledge a simple web app with pretty graphs might seem more impressive than a really complex project that uses natural language processing but only outputs some text files. 

I'm not from a ""target school"", so it's a little difficult for me to get the foot in the door in many places I want to work at. I practice a lot on sites like topcoder, and I'm pretty decent, but that doesn't seem to be something worth putting on a resume. I would rather not spend a lot of time learning to do things that don't interest me like web development, but at the same time I need things to put on my resume. What kind of projects can I work on? I'm pretty confident that I could pass most interviews, so I just really need things that will get me the interviews. I know a lot of people say to just work on things that interest you, but I think a lot of people who say that have other factors in their favor. 

I have a lot of things going against me, my parents are American and so am I (so I don't have visa problems), but I don't live in the US. Therefore, the only companies that will probably give me a chance are companies that have enough resources to interview and relocate international applicants. A corollary to this is that these companies are not easy to get interviews at. Also, my name doesn't sound American, so even though I am perfectly fluent in English, I think recruiters might assume I'm not. Would it be ok to put the English version of my name even though it's not my legal name? No one reading my resume will have even heard of my university, so that's another factor against me. Another thing is that even though my GPA is among the highest in my class, grades here are not inflated and there are no such things as 'curves', so it's like a 3.0 in the US scale, which makes me look even worse. 

I just need some advice on how to stand out, I know these companies get thousands of resumes, and because of the things I mentioned I feel a little hopeless. It's not like getting internships is any easier, if anything it's even harder. I looked into getting an MS, but I can't afford it. "

The main thing I'm supposed to learn is the Spring framework, then I'll go on to study Hibernate.
The thing is, it took me 2 days to kinda understand the principles of Inversion of Control design pattern, and the reference pages for spring are absolutely huge. It's not that I won't read them, but it's hard to wrap my head around what I should be learning. I'm a bit confused.
Do you know any resources that would help me kickstart this learning process? I need a sense of direction.
Before you ask, the guys from the internship will assign me a project the following days but until then I want to be prepared as much as I can, and with no prior Spring experience, I feel like I'm not even getting my toes wet."
3c055i,67,2015-07-03,"Now if you listen closely over the sound of the pumps, you can hear my wallet weeping! The Angel's Heart",AugustHorch0,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3c055i/now_if_you_listen_closely_over_the_sound_of_the/,"Hello everyone! 


Last year around this time, I built my first pc (specs here: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/tjMRYJ) and loved the entire process! Picking and learning about every part was a labor of love and getting to see the entire assembly in action brought a smile to my face like you wouldn't believe. However, with 2xGTX760s, I felt it a bit.... lacking in the horsepower department. 


So, I managed to get a well-paying internship and said to myself: ""You know what? If I'm doing a 40 hr/week job, I'm going to spend the money I make on what I want!"" And so I did! I set out to build not only a powerful PC, but a great looking one too, and I like to think that I accomplished that. The specs of my new build can be found here: 

http://pcpartpicker.com/p/ssDtYJ


Now I know what you're all going to say..... ""Isn't that complete overkill? Why would you do that?"" And my answer is..... because I wanted to. I wanted a kick-butt pc to last me a long time, and since I could afford this right now, I went for it. So, let's break it down by part! 


1. CPU: i7-5820k I chose the 5820k because.... well, c'mon, it's a 6-core hyperthreaded unlocked intel processor! I wanted an X99 build and this was the best choice since the 5930k really didn't offer much more that I would benefit from and the 5960X would require me to sell a kidney. So, 5820k it was! And I must say, I am very pleased so far (see below for overclocks). 

2. CPU cooler: H100i  I chose this because I got a great deal on it from newegg. $90 was a pretty good price and I really didn't want to wait for the H110 to go on sale. I love Corsair products, so it was a no-brainer for me! It's fitted with SP120 fans. 

3. Mobo: ASUS X99-Pro USB3.1 I chose this because it was from a brand I love (ASUS) and the white theme is something I was going for. Plus, the features included are pretty darn great! Very easy to use BIOS. 

4. Storage: 500GB Evo SSD + 1 TB WD Blue HDD I chose the 500 GB SSD because it was on sale and the HDD because I wanted a bit more space. However, the 1 TB HDD doesn't fit in the case right now, so I'll need to get a 5.25'' bay to 3.5'' drive adapter to use it. 

5. Memory: 16 GB Crucial RAM I chose this for absolutely no other reasons than 16 GB of RAM + white-ish theme + good price. I would have preferred Corsair RAM, but the cost and color options weren't there. 

6. PSU: EVGA G2 1300W I chose this because of the power requirements and the price. The equivalent Corsair products at the time of purchase were twice the price. 

7. Case: Phanteks Enthoo Luxe I chose this because it fit the white theme and I needed the space the full-tower provided. Personally, I think it's the best-looking white case on the market, so it's what I got! 

8. Graphics: 2 x Sapphire Fury X's in Crossfire. AKA CrossFury. I was debating between the Fury X and the 980ti but ultimately went with the Fury for the liquid cooling. I don't really notice the noise, but it gets HOT around here, so the liquid cooling makes sitting in a chair and gaming for a long time bearable! With my old build, the 760s just got way too hot for comfort. 

9. Sleeved Cables: I wanted sleeved cables for a nice and clean look but I didn't want to have to sleeve them myself. I'm very glad I bought these, they look great! 

10. Monitor: ASUS VG248qe Now this is where I expect some flak. ""Two Fury X's for 1080p?!?! Are you nuts?!?"" Yes. A little. But it's what I had for my previous build and until I get the money for a 144 Hz 1440p monitor it's what I'm sticking with. The color-reproduction was awful stock but some tuning made a difference. 

11. Keyboard: Razer BlackWidow I chose this over the Corsair competitor because of the feel of the switches. I like Cherry Blues but the Razer Greens feel fantastic to me. Once you go clack... well, you know! 

12. Mouse: G502 I got this at Christmas with that $50 steam card deal. Amazing features + feels great. Love it. 

13. Speakers: I got these cheaper speakers because I really didn't need too much more. I use headphones more often (I'm looking into buying a new pair, so if you have recommendations, let me know!), so these speakers are great quality for the price I paid. 



Use: I'll be using the build mainly for gaming and some photo-editing and 3D modeling. 


Overclocking: So AMD has yet to unlock the voltage settings for the Fury, so they remain at stock speed for now. RAM hasn't been messed with just yet, but I plan to once the Fury voltage is unlocked. CPU overclocking has been an absolute breeze. First try, set the speed to 4.5 GHz on 1.3 V and ran stable for games for three sustained hours. I put it through a real stress test after that (ASUS Real Bench) and it became unstable after 40 minutes of 100% CPU load. Because of that, I dialed the clock back to 4.4 GHz and got a stable clock with it at the same 1.3 V. After that, I ran a 3DMark FireStrike benchmark and got what you'll see in the album below! I am insanely pleased with the result and I can't wait to see how it changes with upcoming Fury drivers + overclock options, Windows 10, and DX12. I just finished the build last night, so I have no game benches just yet (sorry :( ), but I expect good numbers from games that utilize Crossfire well! 


Also, as with tradition, I named my pc the second it was complete. With so much coolant pumping through that white interior, the name was obvious to me! So, allow me to introduce the Angel's Heart, my personal overkill rig! 


Finally, [here is the imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/RlAKi) so feel free to take a look and offer any comments/criticisms/etc. Thanks for helping me along the way and I hope you enjoy! 



EDIT: Darn, thought the flair system would let me select ""Build Complete"" :( Mods, sorry to trouble you, but can you make this change for me? Thanks! And sorry for the issue! 


EDIT2: Looking back through the pictures, a lot of them are very bad quality and out of focus. I'm terribly sorry for that, I hope that you still enjoy the better pictures :)"
3c0puy,1,2015-07-03,Leaving my first job out of college and what I’ve learned…,Thrwaway599,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3c0puy/leaving_my_first_job_out_of_college_and_what_ive/,"*TL;DR – After seven months at my first job out of college, I’ve decided to move on to something better. I weighed my options and took an offer that was better in every respect. Below I put all the details that I’m able to post about my first “professional” employment experience, including my thoughts on and feelings each matter. I tried to put it in a semi-organized manner. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Please, feel free to ask questions and I’ll do my best to answer them.*

**So, what did you do?**

Depending on which titles I wanted to use, I would call myself a member of a “Production” team at a local TV/News station. I directed newscasts, put together programing, and other duties to get stuff onto local TV.

**Alright, so that sounds pretty cool. Why did you find another job so quickly? Why did you quit?**

Well, that’s probably the bulk of what this post will be. I’ll admit, it sounds pretty cool, but in reality, it was not. It was perhaps the farthest thing from “cool” in the world. There were a lot of things that slowly built up until I realized that I no longer wanted to do that job anymore. A few were significantly larger than others, but there were no shortage of issues that went into my thinking. What were those issues you ask? Look below.

•	**The Pay:** Yes, I’m pretty sure you all knew this was coming. The big money issue. Frankly, I’m not ashamed to say that I felt that I was underpaid. Did I think I was grossly underpaid? No, of course not. **So, how much did you make?** Well, I made around 12.50/hr USD. That gets to around 27,000 a year without taxes removed. So less than 27k a year. Don’t get me wrong, some people would be scrambling for 12.50/hr, and I was one of them. I needed money; I needed a job when I accepted the offer. Yet, a few months in I noticed that 12.50/hr was chump change compared to everyone else in the station for a “professional” position. Aside from the janitor and the part-timers, I was the lowest paid employee in the entire building. With that in mind, read on…

•	**The Work:** Without beating around the bush, I can say that I hated it, but not in the way you’d expect. I hated the way local TV/News worked. I didn’t hate “working” but I disliked the “content.” Anyone who watches local TV (anymore), can say that sometimes you wonder “Why in the hell is this even here” and I asked myself that almost every day. In addition, something I liked to call the “trickle-down-effect” was glaring at this particular place. When people didn’t get their work done in other departments, it made it harder for me. I was the final pass-through from what was in the system or studio, to Live on the air. I was the one who had the final check over, and most often, I had to fix it on the fly. And when things went wrong, it was often me that was the one who got the flak. 

•	**The Time:** This right here is probably one of the biggest reasons, if not the biggest on why I left my job. I was a shift worker. My shifts often ranged from 1:00PM – 1:00AM, in eight hours shifts sometime within that time frame. In addition, I also worked all weekends, every weekend, same shifts, with every holiday as well. My “off” days were sometime during the week. Needless to say, I found this completely horrible. Some people could do it, but I couldn’t. Don’t get me wrong though, it’s a part of the job, someone has to do it. Yet, I found myself becoming more and more drained by this as time went on. Days, turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, and everything was progressively getting worse. The combination of the time I worked and the days began to takes its toll on me. I was never able to be social with everyone else, when I got off work, everyone was checking in for the night. When I was on my off day, everyone else was working and didn’t feel like going out during the week. I began missing out on “life” and not having one of my own. Before work, I’d sit around, watch some shows on Netflix or play some video games and perhaps go for a jog, and when I got home, I’d do the same thing, simply because no one else was available or willing to stay up with me during the night. My friends began to forget about me. I could never be there, so why even try inviting me? Oh yeah, I was told we “rotate” weekends, we never rotated any weekends. (So, even though the next one could be tied in with this one, I’ve decided to make them their own thing, and expand on the thought). 

•	**Nonexistent Love Life:** Ok, so even though this seems rather extreme for a 24 y/o to say, it was the truth for my situation. Now, I’m not going to claim that during this time I was looking for “the one,” but instead I’ll throw a wide net and say that there was no looking at all, for anything. No dates, dinners, movies, and yes, even sex. When you worked the times I worked, I was unable to follow through on anything. I met a girl; we hit it off well, really well. We had the same interests, hobbies, everything. (And god damn she was hot) Yet, as time went on, she admitted to me that she couldn’t work with the shift I had. It was rough to hear, but I couldn’t blame her. Who would want to waste their time for a person who couldn’t be there? It wasn’t her fault, and it wasn’t my fault. It just didn’t work. That’s the way it was. Now, I know that some people might say “Well, why didn’t you find a way to make it work?” and I have an answer. We did. We tried, we tried really hard, and failed. She had a regular job, I had this one. When I got off, she was asleep, and when she got off, I was working. When she woke up, I was still sleeping, and when I woke up, she was at work. Trust me, we tried our hardest. It just didn’t work.

•	**My Body Began to Hate Me:** I bet you all can remember when you had to get up super early for a trip, or when you’ve woken up super late and each time you feel like dirt? Imagine that, but every single day. Due to the times I worked, my body began to revolt against me. I felt like crap each time I woke up even though I got a full eight hours of sleep. Old injuries began to hurt once more, and my stress level went through the roof. Even though I tried my best to keep my stress under control, the stress of Live TV as well as the other facts (as noted above), made it extremely difficult. My once cheerful attitude toward everything took a large dip. I began to feel frustrated each time I woke up, with each month slowly getting worse. I was unable to decompress and let it out. I knew why I was feeling this way, I just couldn’t fix it. And, on a more physical note, I started to become unhealthier. I often found myself eating out, instead of making leftovers. I was drinking more soda and energy drinks to get myself through the day instead of water. I was getting more sluggish. I started to gain a bit of weight (although, thankfully I was able to keep it off after I began jogging more). But all-in-all my body was feeling run-down and broken, both physically and mentally.

*Now, take all of these and combine them. They all fit together to frankly make something much worse than what I put here. Feel free to ask questions.*

**What was the tipping point, or was there a tipping point? What finally made you say “I’m done” and put in your two weeks?**

There were many tipping points that finally made me say “enough is enough.” Oddly enough (or not), they all came really within my last month of employment. Now, before I go any further, I should say I knew my job stunk before any of this. The first was this time when I was on break, I went to the mall to get some Subway. It was there I ran into a friend of mine from back in college and we began to talk about jobs and whatnot. He told me what he did, and I told him what I did. After I finished talking, explaining to him what my job was like, I can never forget the look on his face. He looked both sad and disappointed. Not at me, but at my job. He straight up told me that “Dude, that job really stinks” and in turn mentioned that if I needed something else to talk to him. Go work at the bank he worked at for more pay and better times. After that, we sort of went out our own business. But since that time, I had the itch that I couldn’t scratch. I needed something new. Secondly, was something I already mentioned above. That girl that I hit it off with. Without restating it all, I’ll just say that such things got me thinking more along the lines of “I can’t do this for another year” and I wasn’t going to let my already paper-thin social life dissolve into nothing. (I had a large one before the job). Lastly, was recently, a few weeks ago. On one of my off days, my Dad took me out for supper and a few drinks. He knew that I wouldn’t get the 4th off so he decided to treat me to a night out to help make up for it. We got some food and then went to our regular bar. We sat down, talked, and then fell into a strange silence. It was then I heard the words “I want you to find a new job. You Mom, Brother, and Sister have all been talking, and we dislike not having you around. We miss you and we want you back. You can move back in with us, or you can stay out in your apartment. We don’t care; we just want you around more.” It took a lot of strength for me not to cry in the bar at that point. Ok, well maybe not cry, but needless to say, when he said that I was mentally wrecked. It was at that point I knew that I needed to find something new. And thankfully, not too many days later, I did…

**What now?**

Now? Well, right now I’m in-between my old job, and my new one. I moved back in with my parents as my lease expired not too many days after I spoke with my father. While I don’t plan on sticking around for long in my parents place, I’m eternally thankful for them and their honesty. I did my research on my new job, and will be ready when it starts next month. I know the people and I know the company. An old internship of me took me in. I was overjoyed. Now, the pay isn’t the best, but it’s better and the hours are regular 9-5. The day after I put in my two weeks I could already feel my body recovering. It felt good, beyond good, literally like I was on some sort of high. I feel normal again. I’m trying to piece together what I’ve lost since I began my old job.

**So, what was the point of this post?**

Well, to be honest, there really isn’t a point at all. I simply wanted to share my experience with you. I want people to know that there is no point in being miserable at a job and wasting away at something you don’t like. Yes, I know it happens and sometimes it needs to be done. But if you don’t keep moving forward, if you don’t keep trying to better your situation, you’re not going to get anywhere. You’ll find somewhere you fit in, I promise.  Take some risks. Life is short, stunt it!

*Feel free to ask questions, I’m more than willing to answer them.*

3c1mg4,12,2015-07-03,How to find jobs/employers with realistic expectations for a junior dev?,tadhgerty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3c1mg4/how_to_find_jobsemployers_with_realistic/,"I'm an (increasingly less) recent grad who's applied to 55 jobs since exams finished (I applied to some in Feb/March but didn't keep track of those). 

I have a CS degree from a good Canadian school, &gt;3 GPA and did two internships in between my studies. I'm not the next Bill Gates and I understand that but I think these credentials should be ok and as such, I've been applying to mostly modest positions at medium sized companies or startups.

I try to focus on junior positions, but there are only so many. I have had a few interviews, and am feeling like I need to be a ""rock star"" or someone who lives for development all day and in my spare time to succeed or even get a call back after any of these interviews. I'm not that person. I'm competent and willing to work hard, but it's just a job to me - my passion is music production and audio engineering and I sink all my free time into that. Until that becomes a viable source of income though, I need to find something so I can be independent and support myself. At this point, I don't really think I should need to spend another 3 months working on extensive personal projects (leaving very little time to spend producing music) to be able to qualify for something, but that's the vibe I'm getting. Do you have any tips or strategies for finding a job that doesn't expect me to be a ""ninja hacker"" in my spare time or want to devote my entire life to coding? Or am I being too complacent and my expectation for such a job is unrealistic? At this point, I would gladly take a lot of the positions people on this sub scoff at, like QA, patching together web APIs, etc. even though I have prior experience doing dev. In an ideal world, I would greatly prefer a 25-30 hour a week job as well, but those seldom exist in this field.

Ex. I interviewed at a small startup a month ago and the first interview question was ""Why do you want to work here instead of IBM or Google?"" (which, given the choice I obv. wouldn't but I crafted an eloquent answer about startup culture and team rapport) and then continued with ~25 minutes of intricate trivia about Java EE and Spring, which I had used for a work term a year prior, but at the recommendation of this sub prepared using mostly CtCI which was not sufficient for such specific language questions. Another interview had me implement my own version of the ""contains"" library function from PHP (which I did successfully, but to my fault I stumbled through as binary search was not fresh in my mind), which I can't see as ever being a useful skill on the job. These questions and expectations are strange to me and I'm trying to better understand their perspective for my own benefit. Of course, stress, nerves and unexpectedness make these questions a lot more difficult during the interview than it is to explain them now.

Why are employers throwing me through such a gauntlet for these positions? I feel like I should have taken an elective on interviewing. Is it just that they have a ridiculous selection of applicants? My resume and cover letters seem to be ok, but I have only had 4 hits from 55 applications, and I am struggling in some of the technical interview tests, even though I did well in my internships and courses. 

I'm not trying to take it personally, but I never got a call back from an interview I took a 2 hour train back and forth from and I had a technical phone interview that the employer didn't follow up on but sent me a survey via email about whether or not I enjoyed the interview process 3 weeks later. It's frustrating.

This post is a little all over the place, but is there any advice you can give me? I'm having a tough time trying figure this all out and just get **something**. For context, I'm applying almost exclusively to positions in Toronto, because of my Canadian-ness and aforementioned other interests."

I need help figuring out what my next step should be.",021fluff5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3c1ou2/background_in_special_ed_and_ive_taken_a_handful/,"**Career/education path thus far:** Graduated with psych degree, worked as a teacher while doing the first year of a Masters in Social Work, found out that less than half of the people completing my program were finding jobs, started taking CS classes at a nearby university in the hopes of eventually finding a better job. 

**University courses I've taken:** Three data structures and algorithms classes, four classes in software development practices, and an operating systems class. 

**My problem(s):** I did decently well in my CS courses (3.2 computer science GPA, 3.6ish GPA overall). I did as much of my homework in a text editor as I could (to avoid being dependent on a compiler) and didn't resort to Googling the correct answers. I did well on everything that I could take home and work on all night, but I really struggled with exams, in-class participation and anything where I had to think of the answer on the spot. I felt like a moron in every CS class I took.

At this point, I think anything requiring a technical interview is out of the question. I get so nervous when I need to give an answer right away, or when someone is watching me code. My mind goes blank and I completely freeze. I also haven't been able to even get any interviews after months of applying, and I just feel so embarrassed and discouraged right now. I'm not sure if I'm starting to hate programming or if I just hate the job application process. 

For what it's worth, I've always interviewed very well for teaching positions, and I've been told I come across as calm/smart/likeable. 

I think I'm going to give up on finding a junior dev role or an internship, and just look for something where having research/education experience and the ability to read code is useful. 

**What should I be applying for right now, and what are my long-term career options?**

I was initially prescribed with a dose of 30mg but had my dosage upped to 50mg 2 months ago.It's also worth mentioning that I've taken no days off medication ever since my diagnosis. **Over the last week, however, I decided to take a day off medication and,boy, it has been quite the experience**.

I usually wake up feeling super groggy, so I just pop a pill and go to the shower, while I patiently wait for Vivian to kick in. I can feel vyvanse in my body within a couple of seconds and it's almost as if I lose awareness of my body. I become lost within my own mind, obsessively thinking either about novel machine learning algorithms (I'm a data scientist and I just founded a startup company) or about several ways in which our company can enter the market. Those thoughts are monotonic within my mind and I honestly have a very hard time thinking about anything else. Women don't spark any interest me, friendships are the last thing that come to my mind and I see people merely as actors within this world. I then proceed to work all day and I don't really care about anything else. My empathy is also gone. It becomes absurdly difficult for me to talk to people,as I find myself ignorant of all of their emotions and body language. Speaking becomes very hard, as words don't form naturally anymore. They are just images and mathematical vectors that I vividly see in front of me, so I have an absurdly hard time forming reasonable sentences and most people are completely unable to understand me. This gives me absurd social anxiety and makes me feel absurdly uncomfortable next to people. *You may ask the following question: ""Why the fuck do you take those meds then?""*. Well, the processing power that I get with the meds is just absurd. I'm able to literally learn in one day something that would take one month for my unmedicated self. Mathematics and algorithms become more natural than language, so I've been having a lot of success at work and school. I made more progress in my life in the last 6 months than I did in the past 4 years, as I started a company, got a really good internship while also being invited by a professor to do research with him. **However, I still feel like I'm almost autistic at this state and I'm almost unable to interact with other people**

Now, let's trace back to today. As I walked into the shower, my mind didn't wander away into an obsessive state. I, for the first time in months, simply felt the hot water touching my skin and slithering down my body.I immediately felt a weird, warm sensation inside of me, but I had no idea what that was at the moment. After that, I just walked out of the shower, changed my clothes and walked outside. I then saw my dog, just staring at me. That was it. I felt several different feelings inside of me that culminated on me crying over how cute my dog was(Yes...). **I had forgotten what was it like to feel emotions** . I was then overwhelmed with all the different emotions that I was feeling at that moment. Happiness, humor, empathy. All those feelings were long gone in my mind and god it felt good to have them back. As the days passed by, I then realized what a different human being I was when I was unmedicated. I just started to reach to people and socialize without even noticing. I reached out to dozens of friends in which I hadn't spoken with in a while and I made several new friends by simply talking to random people around the area in which I live. I started delegating several work-related tasks that I had to do to other people, as I no longer had the manic disposition to do them. Several of those people mentioned that I was really motivational and empathetic within this week and they ended up doing a really good job at those tasks. I then started noticing how natural it was for my unmedicated self to connect with people. I was just naturally curious about those people and I was making zero effort about socializing. That came at the expense of my mathematical and technical skills, as it would take hours to do something that would simply come intuitively for my medicated self. **It's almost as if I have to choose what skills are intuitive to me. People x Numbers** .


And so, I come to y'all redittors with a simple question: Do y'all also feel like your medicated self is a completely different being from your
normal self? I believe there are grotesque distinctions between my medicated and unmedicated self, up to the point in which I had difficulties at determining what is the true nature of my personality.

Also, sorry for the long post hehe. I noticed that we adhders tend to hyperfocus when writing about our problems and then try to describe those problems in the most vivid way possible "

I have not discussed my salary officially but I casually asked my boss what I might expect to make last month. He told me: “60-65k maybe more.” I would like to aim at 70k but would not be disappointed by 65k.

When do I negotiate the salary? As soon as I see the figure on the offer letter? That would mean I negotiate it with my boss’ boss?

If I want to discuss details (like health benefits) with an HR representative, should I do that before negotiating salary?

I just finished freshman year at a pretty great university for computer science. But I often feel like I'm the biggest idiot in the class. I get high exam grades and decent project grades- but I feel that other people just *know* more than I do. For example if I ask someone for help with a project- they go into detail about how they used this specific method never talked about in class and I just sit there dumbfounded and go ""oh"". 


Even just visiting this sub I have no idea what anyone is talking about 95% of the time. I was thinking of trying to get an internship this year as a sophomore (hopefully), but I feel that I couldn't ever pass an interview and even worse- I could never actually contribute anything to a company. 


I came into cs with no knowledge of programming and I've gotten decent grades. But I still have trouble with some of the basics from time to time and that makes me feel stupid. Like I'll get the supposed ""hard"" part of the project completed but I accidentally used the wrong method or made a syntax error or something. Or I just completely forget how to use recursion in relation to the problem and I skip that part of the project entirely and I just get so frustrated with myself. 



Does anyone else feel this way or felt this way? What can I do? I hear people in my class contributing to open source projects and getting internships at IBM and Google as FRESHMEN. Meanwhile I'm sitting here with a year's worth knowledge of java and nothing else really going for me. I looked at github and the projects people are doing just make me feel like more of an idiot and I have no idea how to start contributing. 



Am I just in the wrong major? Should I even bother applying to internships if I know the company will hate me for my stupidity and incompetence? I feel so out of place amongst people who have been programming for over 10 years.. "

I'm working both food service and retail to pay for school, which is great but definitely a job, not a career.    
I'm majoring in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, and minoring in Management. I competed in national programming contests and entered a game a friend and I made into a local competition, and did well in both, but other than that I don't have a lot to show for my experience.

3c3e1e,77,2015-07-04,"Worried, unemployed 34-yo front-end dev",nnumber6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3c3e1e/worried_unemployed_34yo_frontend_dev/,"So I see a lot of posts about college students freaking out about internships or the unrealistic expectations of entry-level positions (I get it, I've been there) or whether to take the 85k job or the 75k job with better benis straight out of school, and not so many from us ""established"" folk.

I'm 34 and beginning to freak out.  Some background: got a non-CS bachelors degree from a respectable university, went into graphic design, then about 6 years ago changed my career path to web development.  At 28, got an associate front-end dev role at a large company, and slowly increased my salary, title, and responsibilities.  Mostly HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  With some vanilla JS, SVN, GIT, JIRA, and templating experience.  Overall I was very happy, enjoyed most of my coworkers, felt like I was learning a lot of new things, and excelled in my position.  I took on freelance projects which helped expand my skill-set, but I also became content, my main job was lax, and I didn't push myself in learning a lot of the popular new front-end frameworks.  Work-life balance is very important to me, and while I am passionate about and excited by a career in web dev and the sort of problem-solving it entails, I never came home after a long day at work and contributed to GitHub or open source projects.

About 3 months ago, due to reasons both personal (depression, which I'm still fighting, and alcoholism, which I'm overcoming but ""prevents"" socializing) and professional (spread thin across many projects and mismanagement of key projects which pulled me from an in-company path I was anticipating and excited about), I self-destructed and quit my job.  I didn't have another position lined up.  I know this was stupid.  Please refrain from telling me this was stupid.  I know and regret it.  (""Funny"" story: I resigned on a Friday, my boss told me to take the weekend to think it over, I did and on Sunday night asked if I could stay on, and he said he already submitted the paperwork.  Tough luck.  Welp.)

I made the decision that I wanted to leave my current area (in which I've lived most of my life) for another.  LA to NYC, ideally.  I know the cost of living increase is ""huge.""  I just can't bear to live here anymore.

Two weeks into unemployment, I had a disastrous technical interview over Skype which my previous job experience left me ill-prepared for.  It broke me a bit, but I devoted time to updating my personal website, refreshing my JS knowledge (never knew what a closure was), and learning what I could about newer frameworks and front-end techniques.  About a month ago, tried Hired.com, and came away with several phone screens, some technical phone interviews, and one company flew me out to NY for an all-day, face-to-face interview.  Overall it was a positive experience, but needless to say, I'm still jobless, and more ""broken"" than ever.  Lack of MVC and OOP experience appears to be a blocker.

Finances aren't a huge problem at this point (though they will be in another couple/few months).  However, minor setbacks are having a debilitating psychological effect on me, and getting out of bed before 100pm, productive before 600pm, and asleep before 300am is becoming a problem.  I have zero support system, and already feel a bit old or behind in this industry.

Not sure what I expect to get out of this post.  Catharsis at the very least.  Maybe some advice from fellow mid-30 (or any established) devs, particularly about relocating and standing out against local candidates (I'd prefer to secure work before moving, but have contemplated just packing up and shipping out and then worrying about work), suck it up and actively look in LA even though I want to move (?), how to overcome lack of specific experience in a company's particular stack, whether it's worth it to spend time working with MVC frameworks beyond tutorials before jumping back into the job search, the best places to search these days.

Thanks for reading and/or helping.

**EDIT:** Wow, I wasn't expecting to get so many great, encouraging replies.  Sorry for not replying to comments directly.  I've read everything, and it's heartening to see the effort put into replies.  It helps.  It's difficult for me to put myself out there, and even more difficult to read (both positive and negative) feedback.  (I also liked Shia even before his recent resurgence.)

It's definitely not as easy as saying ""just change.""  Otherwise I wouldn't be in this rut.  But this morning I set my alarms for 700am, didn't hit snooze for the first time in 100 years, took a shower, and took a walk around the block.  Just a step, but it felt good.  Not looking forward to battling the urge to nap at 100pm.

I've been putting off a project from an old co-worker that I could use to implement Angular, Node, and SASS.  Now just to freaking dive into it.

I want to clarify that the alcoholism is still an issue in that it's part of who I am, but is not affecting me nearly as bad as it once was.  I used to drink 6-7 times a week, getting shit-faced 3-4 of those days.  Since I left my job, I drink maybe once a week, if that, and moderately (a couple beers).  I tried implying before that it's difficult to socialize without having one drink to calm my nerves, which leads to three or four or ten.  Some make a good point that it may be difficult, but it's not impossible, and even cutting out alcohol completely from my life for the time-being could be extremely beneficial.

I thought I could weather the depression for a little while until I got another job that came with health benefits.  COBRA seemed too expensive at the time ($500/mo), and absentmindedly I passed the special enrollment period for national healthcare.  The anti-depressants I was taking three months ago didn't seem to be working, so I stopped (with my psychiatrist's approval) and I didn't want to play with new medications that might make things worse.  At this point, it might be worth it to try treatment again (at the very least, a mild medication and/or therapy).

And to add, I am 100% positive that I want to continue with this career path.  While I don't want to spend every waking hour programming, it's something that I love and find very rewarding professionally.

Thanks for the words and time everyone."

Thus far I've maintained a &gt;3.5 GPA, currently cumulative at 3.8, however due to what I believe may be a bad bout of imposter syndrome, I have no practical experience in CS to put on my resume. I think I feel this way because the program is small and while it was rated well for a game design minor that interested me when I was applying, I feel like I should've chosen a more rigorous and intensive program. The other advantages that I weighed when deciding on schools was that it was close to home so I could save on housing expenses and with the scholarship package they offered me, it was very affordable. I feel very average among my classmates, as some have had prestigious internships and went on to get jobs at big 4 companies (Microsoft, Google), while others have no projects or 

Relatively early on (mid sophomore year), I felt inadequate and that I would never succeed in CS and I started to feel out other options. I was offered an IT summer internship that summer, which I enjoyed and excelled at. Following that, I took on a part-time IT internship and later a part-time IT job to make some extra cash during the semesters. I have about 1.5 years of experience in IT now, and despite my degree being in CS I worry my IT time will work against me on my resume. I enjoy IT, but a project that I worked on last semester has reignited my interest in pursuing a CS job.

I have tinkered around with teeny tiny projects, for example I made a simple table-based HTML page with a very basic CSS sheet for formatting that used a Javascript script to autofill a form that needed to be filled out for a friend's event. My github currently has a few small Java solutions to word problems. I feel inadequate and I get disheartened when I get lost when I try to learn more, I'm finding it difficult to stay motivated to keep learning. I struggle to get the hang of the basics when I'm learning by myself, but in a class I find that I can get the basics and then self study beyond them with no issues. At this point, my schooling was primarily in Java, however after the introductory programming classes it has been entirely theory with pretty much no programming other than what I have built to figure out the problems and then write about them, and then I did a small project in Javascript. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? Thank you."

For my second term I did an 8 month term in the regulatory affairs department for a large company and after graduation a 14 month contract with them as well. So basically no engineering experience. I moved to Alberta in August of last year since I believed it would be easier to get an engineering job here. The economy took a hit so there werent many jobs available. I have applied to over a hundred positions all around Canada since I am willing to relocate anywhere but only had two interviews from pulp and paper companies in BC who considered me until the second interview but I was then rejected. 

At this point I do not know what I should be doing. There are two options I am looking at. One is to take a certificate program at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology called the ""Process Piping Drafting - Fast Track"" program. Its 34-weeks in length, consisting of 30 weeks of instruction and a four-week practicum located in industry. I am thinking this may help get my foot in the door, gain some experience and lead to better things. Here is the course listing: http://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/full-time-studies/certificates/process-piping-drafting-course-overview/program-outline.php

The second option I am looking at is doing a masters. Specifically an MEng that is course-based rather than an MASc that would be research based. There seem to be many areas of specialization available at the University of Calgary: Chemical Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Energy and Environment, Environmental Engineering. I am thinking that with this there may be a chance to try for an internship once in the program since I may be eligible for one being a full time student and that will help with engineering work experience. Also, when I graduate I could be again considered a new graduate and may qualify for hiring through new grad job postings. Of course the risks are that with no real engineering experience a masters may make me overqualified for entry level jobs as well.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated since I really dont know what I should be doing and feel stuck.

EDIT: For students who see this post, make sure you try as hard as you can to get good internships/work experience during school so that you dont have the same issues."

I live in a household of six, my brother decided to go out bar hopping, my older-younger sister was out with her boyfriend, my older sister fell asleep at eight o' clock in her room after working an internship a job, and college class (she was pretty exhausted). My parents were having a blast as they were binge watching Heroes and they had just downed about two fairly sized bottles of wine. It was about half past 12 in the morning and I just finished showering.

Being the only sober awake person in the house I thought everything would be fine if I slept, usually I stay up with my parents because during nights like these, they are blacking out on the couch and they dont notice my siblings coming home. I would help my siblings work their way to bed or to the bathroom, make sure they are sleeping on their sides then proceed to call them idiots while I tuck them into bed etc. (what people do to help out drunk people when they come home).

Anyhow there was your typical party going on in my neighborhood, mexican music blasting all night long. I leave the door unlocked as I got to bed where I somehow managed to fall asleep with party music in the backround. And after a couple of hours I'm woken up as my brother stumbles into the room and sleeps in his bed (we share a room with two beds), I go back to sleep.

I smell something awful and look around the living room until I see human fecal matter going in a direction from outside the porch to the household bathroom. I find it staring at me square in the face on the ground. Happy fucking fourth of July. I follow the hobo trail of disgusting assjuice drippings to the bathroom from the livingroom. It only gets worse. I see caveman paintings of shit smeared on the bathroom walls, where the toilet is destroyed, the seat cover is broken, as it hangs on the toilet in a twinged state and crap is covering it as though this person hit everywhere but the intended target. ""Fuck this"" I then make my way to piss in the sink, only to find slightly dried diarreah, splashed all around the sink counter/tabletop...

I stood there for a few moments trying to make sense of the state of the bathroom and decided to climb on the little shower edge ledge of the built-in tub I have in the bathroom as it is directly across the sink and against better judgement, reasoning to myself, it's I can get a better angle to piss in the sink.  TIMBER! I come falling down with my dick out on the bathroom tile after slipping on top of the tub's edge and a large thud echoes throughout the quiet house. ""They are all going to think it's me"" are my final thoughts as I was landing. I then get knocked out temporarily after hitting my head on the tub.

I wake up again, and my first breaths of air of consciousness is in the crap-attack bathroom. I quickly, and clumsily get up to once again try to take a piss. Luckily no one woke up.

Why is that?

Having aspired to achieve ""full ascension"" for quite some time now, the first thing I thought to do with the money was to make a massive build. For the past 5 months now I've lurked on this sub daily, watched a metric ton of build-logs and Linustechtips, and dreamed of completing a massive build. Having said that, this will be the first time I've built a computer and I'm looking for the well-versed advice of my PCMR peers. This is not to say I haven't planned and prepared for the build, I have, I just need your opinions and help filling in some blanks. This build will be going into the ""overkill"" realm of computer builds, and I really don't want to mess it up. I am planning on water cooling and overclocking the components. I'm going for a red/black theme (original, I know). I'm going for a standard of 75fps+ averages at 1440p. Thanks!

3c5x4h,1,2015-07-04,It's been a long 7 months with an abusive friend,oyxela,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3c5x4h/its_been_a_long_7_months_with_an_abusive_friend/,"So I've had a friend, G, for over 15 years now. As we've grown up, I've always felt like she was jealous of me, but I was still as nice and supportive as I could be. Lately though, she's been a lot more clear about her feelings.

We both completed the Disney College Program in January, and both returned to the same hometown, and started hanging out almost every other day. Neither her nor I had a job nor were we in school, we were just enjoying ourselves.

I was seeing many doctors and nutritionists to combat my combined anxiety, depression and B.E.D. She was just doing her usual thing... until I introduced her to two acquaintances of mine from high school that we ran into. Soon, they were hanging out with each other almost every day, and I was left alone. I was lucky if G asked me to hang out once a week. At first she claimed my not being invited to group outings was because I had no money (no job) and they all did, but once I got a huge tax return, they still weren't inviting me to hang out. Then G claimed that one of the girls, D, didn't like me (for no particular reason). I was nothing but nice and respectful to all of them, she just ""chose not to like me"". That's stupid and beside the point.

The point is, G has been EXTREMELY distant either

A) when she doesn't need me to do something for her (like call up her retail job and quit for her after 2 months because she was scared to do it--and yes, that actually happened) or

B) When I'm doing well.

Last month I finally got offered a position for a job of my own, and G and I also had plans to hang out that night. I texted her beforehand letting her know the good news and she claimed to be excited, but then never showed up to get me that night. She was supposed to pick me up at 7, but I didn't hear from her until 8:30 telling me she had to cancel (after I texted her multiple times).

This month, I discovered an internship in a major metropolitan city (that I've been eager to move to since I was a little girl) that was due to last for at least a year. I applied, had two phone interviews, and got accepted. I hesitated telling her, but finally did so this past week. She was about to scream at me about ""not growing up"" and ""being an adult"" (she's a year older than I am) either because I

A) don't wear make-up every time I leave the house or

B) didn't agree to do a green tea diet with her

when I told her that I was moving away in about a month for this internship. G was shocked. It took her 10 minutes just to process the idea. She said she was happy for me and hoped all work out, but at some point she said, ""I thought you'd never make it out of here"" which she later denied saying.

A few minutes before this reveal, she invited me to hang out with the group on July 4th for a party. I accepted. We later went to wal-mart where she asked me to shoplift with her. I denied, saying I had too much going for me right now to risk screwing it up. She called me a pussy, and walked out with a pair of sunglasses and new lipstick.

It's July 4th, and my facebook is covered with photos of her and her friends. I was not even contacted today.

I get the feeling that she was okay with being unemployed and not in school as long as I was too, and now that I'm not, she's upset.

I don't know if I should talk to her, or just let the whole thing go and ignore her.

FOR THE RECORD, yes, I know this is a beyond abusive friendship. The only reason I hang out with her is because I have literally no one else to hang out with here. All of my other close friends have moved to that city. You can imagine why I'm so eager to leave.

**TL;DR** My friend is not okay with my success and she's intentionally being rude and uninviting me from events when things start going well for me and not her. I'm leaving the state in a month and I don't know how to handle the situation."
3c60nd,2,2015-07-04,"I am graduating from Dev Bootcamp after deciding to go because I got fired from 3 jobs in the last 18 months. How can I explain gaps, and become gainfully employed?",cscareerquestion_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3c60nd/i_am_graduating_from_dev_bootcamp_after_deciding/,"This is a throwaway account, and I hope this is the right place to ask this. My back story;

I am 23, and for the last 3 years, I have been a self taught developer. I dropped out of school at 20 due to unforeseen things (mom getting sick, not wanting to be there, not doing well in school, general need of wanting to figure myself out etc) and decided to start a business after I got money from another business I started. I started a job service connecting college students (i see the irony) with employers. I outsourced the work to an offshore team, built an MVP, and was getting responses from employers....but they requested ""we want to see 'x' before we sign"", and I ran out of money. I figured out, hey, I really like this stuff and started teaching myself more. 

I was able to get a job teaching front end stuff to newbies, and then an internship. After that, I got my first actual gig working for a consultancy. I was their only in house developer and they had a huge rails project they were doing. I was contributing to it, but I guess they lost the account and the boss had a heart-to-heart with me and said I wasnt far enough along for them at the current moment. He wrote me a letter of recommendation for the hours i did put in. That lasted 2 months. 

Next job was at an agency doing front end work in JS and some PHP. I didn't do a very good job, and on the 3rd day of my job, I had my head-phones in doing something and the boss threw something at my head to get my attention. I guess I let that event get the better of me, and i found myself having a poor attitude and quitting that job after 5 weeks. 

The last job was from January 3rd to January 25th. I was supposed to be front end, and was going to shadow a more senior front end developer. Well, a week into that job, she gave her 3 weeks notice which no one saw coming. I was working one day on a launch for a client event. I didn't know the VP was working on the same thing and I pushed my changes up to be ready to merge into production, but it caused a merge conflict that took me and him an hour (during his lunch) to figure out (always pull when working with larger teams). Later in the day, he called me in, and said i was too slow for his team and he let me go. 

After that, I realized i was missing something, and applied at some hack schools. I got accepted into DBC and have really, really loved it. I do solemnly feel like a better programmer than before i came in, and a big part of what I love about DBC are the non-programming things they teach and my very competitive peers who push me. 

I know this makes me look dumb, and look like a border-line fuck-up. But, I have made my peace with it, and i am actively taking steps to make sure I am never in a position like that again. For example, I am now graduating from Dev Bootcamp in 4 weeks. In the fall, I am going to be going back to the same CC I dropped out from, to finish my degree and transfer to a good school. I hope to do this while working full time as a developer (going to school at night) to pay my way through school to avoid loans.

I havent talked to many people about my full situation mainly out of shame. I guess I'm just looking for some (constructive) unbiased advise on how I can get an entry level programming job (to an extent, I would even be fine with an unpaid internship) and explain some gaps (like I probably shouldnt put those jobs on my resume if I've been let go from them). I know I have the skills for it, but I keep getting these ""flashbacks"" of how I'm just going to end up getting fired again. That is an issue in and of itself.

Anyway, thanks for reading this. And any advice you could give me would be very appreciated. "

I plan to be Computer Science and Mathematics major. I have two related questions:

1) How possible is it to find a summer internship as a freshman around San Francisco area (doesn't matter where if it's close to Berkeley). I know companies usually want to take interns with substantial depth in the field, which a freshman may lack. Some info about me: 

I have more than 6 years of programming experience, github projects, two internship experiences (with three big projects; the companies were a startup and I was quite impactful on the projects as only a couple people were working in the companies) I know PHP, JS (especially nodejs), C++, Java. 

I plan to take these classes in my freshman year (they are only plan, I only enrolled CS 61A and Math H1B as of now):

- Fall:

 - CS 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

 - Math H1B (Honors Calculus)

 - Philos 25A (Ancient Philosophy)

 - SLAVIC 45 (19th century Russian Literature)

- Spring:

 - CS 61B (Data Structures)

 - CS 70 (Discrete Math &amp; Probability)

 - Math 54 (Linear Algebra)

 - RXA (Some Reading A class; probably CW R1A)


So is it likely / impossible for me to find an internship in the area? Should I expect it to be paid or nonpaid?

2) Suppose I found an internship. Is it also possible for me to take a class concurrently? I plan to take CS 61C (Machine Structures) in the summer session. Will my company complain that I do not focus only on my work? Can't I manage the class in the time I do not work? Will there be a legal problem (I'm an international student, I know that I can work as an intern but only for a limited time each week)

(worries/looking for support),Kumagoro314,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3cap41/im_not_sure_i_picked_the_right_career_choice/,"A couple months ago, after finishing university, I picked up an internship at a big corp's IT helpdesk, dealing with ERP software. Unfortunately it didn't last for too long and I got laid off due to internal changes.

Anyways, someone spotted me there, and offered another job to administer a couple small company networks, manage backups and whatnot. Nothing too ""big-IT"" or full-scale sysadmin job but a job nonetheless.

I tackled AD DS, FS, CS, IIS, a bit of FreeBSD. I set up my own cacti-based web traffic graphing server, and right now I'm creating a postfix installation on FreeBDS (don't get me started on this, how do you guys figure this thing out with 1000 config files strewn all over the place, often with differing syntax and so on).

Anyways, that's not the case here. Problem is, it was an opportune job, I don't have any actual education in that field, apart for being a ""family tech guy"" who kinda always enjoyed trying new stuff. I worry that once I get laid off, I won't have anything to show for myself.

I'm trying to learn programming, started with C++, moved onto C#, and finally Python. However I wouldn't call myself proficient in any of those. I got a couple database-drive application ideas which are tied to my grad/other passion (animal husbandry) which would bridge that awful dissonance between my job and my diploma (in a way at least).

But... I don't really know where I'm headed. Once I get home, I rather want to unwind, I'll read some stuff about different Python frameworks, create example db tables but I just don't feel I'm cut for programming as I always find myself stuck when I face the inevitable ""tabula rasa"", not knowing where to start. All while I keep hammering basic backups, learning about MTA's, and whatnot.

I don't know what I should actually do for a living, program or admin. Right now I'm in a weird helpdesk-sysadmin limbo, but I don't feel that what I'm doing is vital in any way, and I fear I'll be disposable.

I'm just worried about the future. :("

However, it pays a few dollars an hour less than my other option, which is a little further away (commute of about 45 mins - 1 hour each way) and interests me, but not quite as much, but also pays a few dollars an hour more. 


If I take the lesser paid option, I will have to take out several thousand dollars in student loans my senior year to help me pay for my housing. If I take the better paid option, I will be able to take out less loans my senior year. I already have some loans, although it's not too bad, and my degree/career is in a well paid field with a good demand, so i'm not too worried about paying it off. I'm just worried that I'd be making an irresponsible decision by choosing the option that I like more and that is closer when I could be making a better financial decision.


What do you guys think?

Basically, I am a industrial designer based in Southern China.
Looking for someone to help with building my social media presence for my kickstarter.
After that hustle and find distributors for my product and future products. I am after a long term US business partner.

Here's my story...
I came to China for a internship, got yellow fever and married a local chinese lady(who is amazing!)whom I meet on the bus.
Next, I am working for the communists designing the interior of automobiles.
Then I got into aquaponics and gardening in general, which I found to be a lot more fulfilling. So I combined my passion for design and gardening/nature to start a garden products company.
Now I have some awesome manufacturing partners here in southern china and a production ready prototype.
My passion, is nature, design and manufacturing.

I am looking for someone who is equally passionate about nature/gardening products, but is a marketing king and a mad hustler!"

How do I communicate with him?,elsani,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cbgtq/doing_a_cs_internship_with_an_antisocial/,"Started my first CS internship at a small software company. The atmosphere is very casual and the people are great.


However,  I'm assigned a small project completely different from everyone else's roles with my classmate and one other software engineer as our mentor. My classmate and I worked on a school project together (probably the reason why we've been picked) but he mainly coded the entire project and we did little to no planning.


Fast forward to 1.5 months later (now) and I can't take him anymore. To sum it up, my co worker is very antisocial and he's very schooled. He hasn't understood a single thing involving us designing our project and I've been trying to describe to him we're MAKING something for our company as opposed to doing something already planned (like a class assignment). The kid is a coding wiz but when it comes to people, he doesn't know how to communicate. It's gotten so bad that I was talking to the QA engineer him and I are making the product for and when I mentioned my co worker's name, the QA engineer didn't know who I was talking about... even though my co worker and I had meetings with the engineer before (my co worker of course didn't participate in these meetings.. just sat there).


I'm only assigned here until the end of August and thankfully I've been offered another internship at a company closer to home. I'm incredibly stoked to work there but I'm finding that my motivation at my current internship is decreasing.. how do I find the motivation to complete this internship with a really lame co worker?

I just want to see if any of you have some ideas of how to better manage my finances now that I've graduated.
I currently am 39,500 in debt with a CIBC student line of credit. I also hold a CIBC Tim Hortons Visa card with a $500 limit as it was the only one I could get while I was jobless and in school.

I just graduated and got an internship making $1750 a month (this income is technically a scholarship so it is untaxed). I may qualify for better credit cards etc, I've been looking but there are so many that I do not know how to pick. It seems like the better ones are not with CIBC and I don't know if it would complicate paying them off if I switch banks just for a credit card. 

The bank lady also suggested that in 12 months I can convert my student line of credit to a personal loan and that would lower the interest rate by up to 1% (I currently pay $200 a month for interest and insurance !!) 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm a uni student summer intern who was working on a project with a popular js framework and found that I really enjoyed making a structured application. I decided that backend is what was meant for me (since styling/design etc. doesn't feel like what I want to do.) When that project was over, I asked my employer for a project that was more backend-heavy and he gave me one much to my delight. However, this new project was to build upon an existing site. 

I guess I'm finding it hard to learn PHP/working with databases from scratch and feel pretty useless while always asking my coworkers how to do the simplest thing with databases (eg. create users/tables etc.) or PHP. I feel like this is more of a gap in knowledge rather than skillset. I still enjoy programming a lot, do a bunch of stuff on the side but just don't know how to really get into what I'm doing at work anymore. I've read the docs for PHP and stuff and generally understand the code (I think). Just can't get anywhere. Maybe it's just overwhelming?

tl;dr - intern who delved into backend with no knowledge of databases/PHP now demotivated at work.

Dear COMPANY team,

my name is NAME and I will arrive to CITY in August in order to study a MSc in STUDIES in the UNIVERSITY.

I am contacting with you because I am looking for a serious company where develop my knowledge in finance and acquire experience in the field, and since my long term career goals are set in private equity (short/medium term in investment banking) I did not find a better company in CITY to be part of as an intern.

Because I do not have serious relevant experience in finance I think it is worth saying that I am not looking for further compensation beyond experience and the opportunity to learn. But please, bear in mind that this does not mean that I do not have anything to offer to your company.

Please find my CV attached to the email, I will be at your entire disposal for a phone interview.

Best regards,

I'm going to use fake names and fake cities for the people in the actual situation.

Amanda just moved home to Chicago after finishing an out of state internship. Before she moved home, she began looking for a job so she wouldn't be broke right when she got back to Chicago. She found a place that would be opening shortly after her arrival, and the owner gave her a phone interview. The owner, Michael, was very pleased with the interview and agreed to hire her for a salary of $500 a week, plus occasional bonuses.

Once Amanda moved back, she met Michael and talked more about the business that would soon be opening. He said it should only be 2 or 3 more weeks before the business was going to be open. She understood that it may take a few weeks before getting paid. She agreed to help promote the new business by going to events and handing out flyers, posting on social media, etc.

One month later, the business is still not open. Amanda has done a number of things to help Michael, putting in at least 80 hours of work, and has not received any money. Michael has a few other ""employees"" that are in the same situation as Amanda. He tells the employees that if anyone else asks when the business is going to open, they will be written up. The other employees comply, but this upsets Amanda.

Michael then tells Amanda that he will pay her $250 if she went to a specific area in Chicago and handed out flyers. She did so. When she returned, he said he couldn't pay her the money because the business's Facebook page did not generate enough new likes to be worth the $250.

She realizes something fishy is going on and decides this job is not in her best interest. Up to this point, Facebook has been her best means of communication with Michael, so she sends him a Facebook message saying she is no longer interested in working for the company BECAUSE she is not getting paid for the work she has been putting in.

He then begs her to stay and offers her $500 cash to stay with the company. He now says the business WILL be open in three weeks, and since he sees so much potential in Amanda, that she will be the only employee getting paid. She declines the offer, as she does not see it morally right to be paid under the table and that none of the other hardworking employees are getting paid either.

He continues to message her. He offers her now $700, and tells her that she can live with him free of charge, so long as she walks his dogs for him every day. She says no because she already has a place to live. He then messages her again saying he will ""take care of her"" specifically because she has the most potential out of all of the other employees. She, once again, says no. He then becomes angry and says she is on the verge of being no longer welcome with the company and she is not allowed to quit without giving notice.

Amanda has not signed any contracts, papers, licenses, anything. At this point, she has not even received any money for the work she has done, but what can she do about this harassment without the potential hazards to future jobs in which he may try to contact?

TLDR: A girl has been working without pay for a business that is not yet open. She told the owner she no longer wants to work for him. He is aggressively responding by offering her large sums of cash and telling her to live with him. What should she do?"

I am a 21 years old guy, working towards my bachelors degree in EE. I have completed 2 years of college and to say the least I have enjoyed the most of it. I have chosen EE because technology interests me and also brown guys only have two professions to choose from, engineering and engineering (just kidding)! 

I couldn't take any engineering classes on my first year because I wasn't in the engineering school. As a result even though I have completed my sophomore year, I have only taken very basic EE classes, for instance Circuit Analysis and Digital Systems. I heard that programming is very important for an EE so I took a C++ course but didn't learn much from it. Since I don't have much skill on my field I didn't associate myself with clubs like IEEE, Robotics etc. I want to know that whether joining clubs like these are important or not and if it is how can I improve my skills in computer and electronics to contribute something on the projects.

Also, internships, which are the companies that offer internships for EE majors in NYC. I am a lone immigrant and I don't have any connections to company or anything like that.

So, basically I would appreciate if any of you could share your expertise and experience as an EE major and how you are utilizing your time to get the best results in the future.

3ccsjz,102,2015-07-06,Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays,WriteToCollege,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3ccsjz/top_ten_mistakes_students_make_on_their_college/,"The following should help you...feel free to go to my website for more information:  WriteToCollege.com
Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays

It is important to first understand the purpose of the college application essay. A student’s transcripts as well as his academic and extra-curricular achievements do not give any unique insight into the student as a person. Yes….they will illustrate hard work, intelligence, drive, aptitude, etc. However, these are the same attributes reflected in the other 30,000 applications for the same institution. I know that grandpa says, “No one is as perfect as my granddaughter” but in this arena….the obvious is commonplace. 

Quick Reality Check:

Class of 2018

Harvard:         34,295 applicants        2,023 accepted                                        
Yale:              30,922 applicants         1,935 accepted
Princeton:      26,607 applicants         1,939 accepted
M.I.T              18,357 applicants        1,419 accepted
Columbia -     32,952 applicants        2,291 accepted 
UPenn            35,788  applicants       3,551 accepted
 
Harvard turned down 500 students with 2400 on the SAT and….
1,100 students were turned down with 800 on SAT Math Component.

DON’T BE DEPRESSED….

Simply put, essays help the admissions office evaluate your potential to fit into their school’s community and culture as a person. (Not as a student….not as club president….not as the driving force for raising money with a dance-a-thon or relay-for-life team and not as a swimmer who placed first in his county). Once again…the 30,000 other students….many of whom were driven to get 2400 on their SAT were also club presidents and competitors who gave their time to charity work….if not a kidney. 

Just remember, you parents aren’t the only ones with a bumper sticker that reads, “My child is an Honor Student.”

TOP TEN MISTAKES…

1) Writing about academic accomplishments. 

a)	Deja Vu: These accomplishments are on your transcripts. The admissions officer already knows you achieved high marks in twelve AP classes.

b)	Birds of a feather flock together: Remember your best friend when you were in the 6th grade? You drifted apart in high school once you started getting straight A’s and your friend ended up on America’s Most Wanted. The two of you aren’t applying to the same schools. On the other hand, everyone who is applying has similar or identical academic accomplishments as you do 

•	Similar Classes / Similar Grades / Similar Test Scores / Similar Extra Curricular Activities: President of Physics Club, Class President, Swim Team Captain, 1st Violin in School Orchestra, Yearbook Editor, Mathletes Captain, 1000 hours of community service.

Academic accomplishments don’t tell the school anything about you as a PERSON…
…as an INDIVIDUAL. It’s no different than stating the obvious… “I am smart.”

2) Trying too hard to appear intellectual.

a)	I can curse in twenty languages: A thesaurus is not necessarily your friend. Using words like, “plethora” or “myriad” only serve to drive an admissions officer to early retirement. You need not swallow a thesaurus to “sound” intelligent.

This comes from The University of Virginia: An actual excerpt from a TERRIBLE essay…. 

“From an early age, we accept death as the inevitable, but do not comprehend its actual denotation. Death is the impending future that all people must eventually grasp. In my early teens, my grandfather tragically perished. As a youth who did not identify with such a cataclysm I was saturated with various emotions. Initially, I was grieved by the loss of a loved one and could not understand why this calamity had to befall upon my family. I always considered death to have a devastating effect, but was shocked by the emotional strain it places upon an individual.” 

Do you get any sense of the PERSON who wrote this? It’s just a collection of clichés put together with “Ten dollar words.” I get NO insight into this teen as an INDIVIDUAL. 

b)	That Pythagoras was no square: You don’t need to discuss your love of Shakespeare or Milton if it’s not true and you think it sounds better than discussing the merits of the Twilight series. On the other hand, if you’re reading Fifty Shades of Grey you have bigger issues to worry about than what college you get into.

c)	Eszopiclone, Ramelteon, Triazolam, Zaleplon, Zolpidem: There are enough sleeping pills on the market so the admissions officer doesn’t need an essay to put him to sleep. I am not suggesting that the essay rival that of a SNL monologue but it can’t be boring either. You can write about something as dry as my mother-in-law’s Thanksgiving turkey but it needs to sound interesting in story, sub-text, personality, connotation, sentence length, syntax, and unique in perspective.  

3) Trying too hard to appear creative. 
            There is a good reason the common application topics changed a few years ago, removing “A
        Topic of Your Choice.” Too many came across as pretentious, clichéd, and desperate (trying    
        too hard) in an attempt to “stand out.” These aren’t creative writing assignments. They aren’t    
        looking for “clever,” they are looking for YOU.
             
A few bad examples…

•	Sweat dripped from my brow as the proctor meticulously handed out the nationally recognized assessment examination. My pulse raced and my heart pounded through my chest…

•	It was a cold and dreary night when I first arrived in London. I could hear the faint whispers of the Bard himself beckoning me to the Globe Theater. 

•	It was all up to me. Bases loaded with two men out in the bottom of the ninth. We were suffering a dearth of three runs. I dug my cleats into the dusty granules of dirt, held my bat firmly and watched for the pitch like an eagle watches for its prey. 

4) Taking a generic approach.  Stay far away from these types of clichés. 

a)	Check the basement for Pods or Avoid clichés like the plague. 
i)	 “I’m hardworking, ambitious, and driven.” 
ii)	“I love to be challenged.”
iii)	“I am intellectually curious.”
iv)	“My peers often look to me for leadership.”
v) “My grandfather’s death made me want to be a doctor.”
vi) “I want to make a difference in the world.”

5) My Major interest is to Major in Chemistry

•	No matter which common application question you choose, don’t write about what you plan on   majoring in. Let’s say you want to be a Chemistry major. (My homage to Heisenberg and Breaking Bad) Your resume is filled with AP Chemistry, internships and summer programs in chemistry, chemistry clubs, etc. And now you write that the place you are most comfortable is in a Chemistry Lab??????? You appear one-dimensional. You don’t look like a well-rounded person with multiple interests, perspectives, etc

•	Most colleges have supplemental essays….one of which asks why this major. If your main essay is about your major….what will you write for the supplemental essay? It will appear repetitive and further promote you as a one-dimensional person. 

6) Not understanding the true point of the essay.

a)	I can touch my nose with my tongue: What makes you unique and not like every other student who is applying?

b)	When I was five, I was abducted by Aliens:  What life experiences imply that you will fit in academically and socially? 


7) Not reading the school’s website.  

a)	I want to go to (Name of School Here): “I want to go to NYU because it is in New York City and I want that city experience.”  There are more than TWENTY colleges in New York City….so why specifically NYU? What does NYU offer that all the other institutions don’t offer?

b)	Professor Smith’s maiden name was Quackenbush: Read through the school’s website and discover that 80% of the faculty are Nobel Prize Winners, that there are 250 clubs and the school provides internships in Papua New Guinea. But don’t write this. Be specific as to what internships and why….and what clubs and why…BE SPECIFIC 

*Don’t cut and paste. Don’t plagiarize. Don’t regurgitate the website’s stats. Merely show the admissions officer that you KNOW the school and what makes the school UNIQUE.

Don’t use the website information to sound like you are working in their advertising department. Here is an example of that….as well as too many clichés to count. (That itself is a cliché) 

Penn Nursing’s motto, “Care to Change the World,” speaks to who I am.  I want to be that nurse practitioner who impacts families, who betters society, and who makes a difference.  I want to be that PNP who smiles, who makes children feel comfortable, and who heals.   
And Penn’s School of Nursing will help me achieve that goal.  Where else can you gain clinical exposure in the sophomore year with access to world-class hospitals, such as The Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania?  Where else do you have the opportunity to engage in real-world research, like at LIFE, and improve quality of elder care?   
But practical experience is just one side of the double helix of education.  The rigor of Penn’s academic curriculum also calls my name. The emphasis on leadership appeals to me.   



BE SPECIFIC
Why do you want to go to our school?
What are the SPECIFIC things the school says about….Academics, Internships, Clubs, Organizations and Traditions that appeals to you? And SPECIFICALLY WHY?  


DON’T KISS THEIR $#$@%.
Why do you want to go to our school?
Telling them it’s a prestigious university with distinguished professors, unparalleled resources and a spectacular campus tells them nothing that they don’t already know…and you sound like a Kiss Up!

8) Forgetting that you are unique.  

You didn’t have to be abducted by aliens, or work with terminally ill dolphins. It’s about you as a teenager. Not a student, an athlete, a volunteer. Just as a citizen, a sibling, a son, a social animal, a human being
Clarifying Points

Although these are overused and clichéd topics…(The SEVEN DEADLY SINS)….  
                       i) Vacation: Club Med / Costa Rica/ Cruise 
                      ii) Sports Injuries
                      iii) Death
                      iv) Disease
                       v) Divorce
                      vi) Disorders 
                     vii) Relationship break-ups

9) THEY ARE FINE IF your perspective is UNIQUE!!!!!!!!!  
•	It’s Okay to Fail
•	How I discovered my love of science when all I really wanted to do was impress a girl in class.


IT’S NOT THE ACTIVITY…IT’S YOU IN THE ACTIVITY. 
It’s not about being a member of the swim team because you swim. It’s about the relationships you developed, the life lessons you’ve learned…without the “hard work” and “driven to win” stuff. This applies to everything you write about. It’s about YOU in the topic…not about the topic. 

10) DON’T BE NEGATIVE: 

Word Choice is extremely important. The following “sound-bytes” come from a first draft. The girl is writing about being a Muslim in a Post- 9/11 world. Notice the language.
•	“Faced the same abuse…”
•	“Soiled Muslim image…” 
•	“Erase the grime…” 
•	“When others realized that I was human…I acknowledged it as well.” 
•	“Forced to go through the motions of being a Muslim…”
•	“Face the realities of the world…”
•	“A religion with a tarnished image…”
•	“Ease the burden of future generations…”
Same essay….nothing in the content was lost. Notice the word choice now.
•	“A sense of self-respect and pride…”
•	“Love and kindness...family…Muslim community…”
•	“Perceptions can be changed with honesty, patience and education…”
•	“Misguided information…”
•	“Erase the stigma…”
•	“Defuse myths and assumptions with a smile and understanding demeanor…”
•	“Supportive friends from all backgrounds who believe…in tolerance.”
•	 “I aspire to further promote the positive reality…and acceptance…”

3cd18r,22,2015-07-06,Is an IT internship useful for someone pursuing CS?,NeoWasAProgrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cd18r/is_an_it_internship_useful_for_someone_pursuing_cs/,"I'm at my first internship, but most of the work is IT related. It was labelled as a CS internship. I may do some web programming in the future (the other interns are all due to leave because of graduation) so I may have to take control over some more stuff later on -- but so far its been child's play.


The company is very close with the city and I work in a city building, so its a pretty secure place to get my foot in the door, but I'm not programming at all (only minor front-end tweaks that a kid can figure out). 


I learned basic useful things, like solutions to simple IT problems, computer networks, inventory, and even how to use git. I even learned some logistics of real world situations, like outdated, messy code, and dealing with worker problems and how to act around big-shot executives.



Is an internship like this even useful for a CS major? I *really* do not want to get into systems or IT stuff, because I feel like there is not much logical challenge in this field. So, I learned some things, but after a month here I already feel myself struggling to get to work because I'm uninterested, and its an unimpressive position to be honest. I feel very underutilized, the code base is all a terrible/outdated mess.


I have a year left in school and I don't want to stay here until I graduate. But I also don't think leaving early is a great idea, especially since its my first internship and its only been a month.


Any input is appreciated!"
3cd1zc,14,2015-07-06,Advice needed on how to manage people older than you.,buttrapinpirate,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3cd1zc/advice_needed_on_how_to_manage_people_older_than/,"I currently work at a company just out of the startup phase, and we're starting to hire on more people as we grow. We just hired a guy who's 35, and unfortunately I didn't have the pleasure of being there during the hiring process.

I'm currently in the process of creating written SOP's for his position, which used to be mine. He's replacing some of my duties which were mostly I.T. related, as I switch to something else within the company, which will be a more involved step towards operations management.

I helped train him for the first week and gave him a good outline of what is to be expected of him as his familiarities with the tasks at hand increases. He knows that he will be taking on my old roles, as I move to different ones.

I currently manage a group of four interns, and occasionally will have meetings with a software development team, so the person who is taking my responsibilities sees that I am not one necessarily always taking direction. Quite the opposite usually.

So the crux of my situation is that I am 20 years old, with someone who now is filling my old position and is much older than me, but with no clear directions on who is from a position of authority. Often times he tries to tell me what to do, but I am having a hard time not being a straight up dick to him, and telling him that my resources in terms of time or brain power are not best spent with him at that point in time, and that instead they should best be spent elsewhere.

What really started it all I think was that my boss made a joke about me not being able to drink (not 21 and in the US), and from there all I've received is crap about what a baby I am. While I am in a position of authority over him, it's been hard to make that clear, and I don't want to be that asshole that has to say ""stop making fun of me, and by the way, I know what my responsibilities are, etc."" because I feel that it will cause tension, and he'll lose respect for me.

So I feel like my two options are to either suck it up and say it, or have my boss say something to him directly, saying that orders are to come from me to him as time progresses, or hopefully there is another option?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and let me know if there is something I haven't made totally clear, I'm writing this relatively hastily."

I know the electronic charting system like the back of my hand which makes me useful. I have a supervisor who is outside contracted with the facility to maintain the network. He (call him Troy) works 2 days a week were I work 5 days. I need to approach my supervisor because I don't feel my education is being utilized to it's fullest. And I am really struggling with it. Troy has not allowed me to be involved in big projects, as a college student i hate that I'm in a job with no real kind of mentor 😞. I am going to be moving to a bigger city with my fiancé sometime after graduation and I am afraid my skills will be useless when I get there. Currently it is summer and Troys company offered internships to high school students interested in the field. So now when Troy comes to work he brings his 16 year old intern. Troy has given more education/training on our network to the intern than he has me. I don't know how to approach my supervisor or even what to say to him. My anxiety level goes so high just thinking about talking with him about this. I just want to be a functioning part of society."

So I'm a double major in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. On paper, I sound pretty good - Chair of the most active and involved student engineering society, tutored programming and math for a year, some cool projects, and I secured a great internship this summer. But all of this aside (and I promise this isn't a bragging post, please don't get the wrong idea), I still feel like some key CS concepts don't click. I took Data Structures and Algorithms last semester which I absolutely loved and I received an 'A' in, but I constantly needed to consult online resources for the sorting algorithms and more complex structures (e.g heap, binary tree), while some of my classmates had the time and the inclination to figure it out all by themselves. Because of this, I feel like I don't have as concrete of an understanding of some key CS concepts, and I find it difficult to teach myself now. I also don't think my practical application skills (building GUIs, File I/O, etc.) are up to par with what they should be. I don't know if many of my peers are in the same boat and are good at hiding it as I am, or if I'm just falling behind. Plus, I don't do much programming outside of my internship this summer - I know some people who dedicate all of their free time to opensource programming projects and app development.

Is this impostor syndrome? Am I bad at this? Will I be able to bounce back from this weird slump feeling? I know this is seems like a weird breakdown, but it's been something that has been plaguing my mind.

3cdlx8,529,2015-07-06,I'm now an entry level programmer with great pay...but I feel so guilty and useless and unsure of myself.,Hackstatic,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3cdlx8/im_now_an_entry_level_programmer_with_great/,"Greetings all. I interned for several months at a mid-sized company. I think I did okay for an intern, although I relied on the senior developers quite a lot for the SQL and C# I was tasked with writing. Most of my work was basic maintenance and simple new features rather than anything major. Anyway, after several months the team and I grew attached - the company made me an offer. Somehow, I managed to negotiate what amounts to nearly $70,000 in base salary. For the state where I live, that's fantastic pay. I commute to a very nice area for work, because it's fifteen minutes away. I live with my parents and have few expenses, so this is a huge financial blessing.

But I'm an awful developer and I can't help but feel like the company made a mistake. I can barely finish tasks on my own without taking 50%-100% more time than the other entry level developers. Granted, they've been there for a year or two so maybe in that time I'll be better. What I'm trying to say is that I'm an awful programmer. If I wanted to work on some code by myself, at work or for my own personal projects, I'd have a hard time. If I wanted to code something from scratch, I'd have a hard time. Figuring out how to piece together the different layers of an application is hard and time consuming for me. For example, figuring out how to use entities in ADO.NET or how to access the DB if I was writing some Java for a personal project isn't something that's easy for me, because I have a hard time remembering what I read in documentation or applying code snippets I find online. Simply put, I feel like I'm definitely not deserving of $70,000 a year. That's insane. That's a huge amount of money, way more than what I was making at my old job as a technician where I was much more productive working on configuring networking equipment. 

Is this a normal part of the learning process? Is it normal to feel completely inadequate and undeserving when you get an entry level position? I mean, I should be happy! I AM happy. The pay is great, the company is great, the team is great. The potential to grow is very real. I intend to maximize the opportunity, for sure. I intend to learn as much as I can and provide as much value as I can.

But I just feel guilty whenever I think of how I negotiated for this much pay. I don't think I deserve $70,000 a year, or the perks. What's wrong with me? "
3cdm7w,2,2015-07-06,Would appreciate some advice on which technologies are appropriate for certain situations,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3cdm7w/would_appreciate_some_advice_on_which/,"Hey everyone, I'm fairly new to the web development world, and I had a few questions about what I should be using for a couple different types of projects. 

Right now, I'm currently using/learning the Symfony PHP framework for an internship with a web development/internet marketing company. From what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, frameworks like Symfony should really be used to aid in creating more complex web apps that require a lot of programming logic. However, I need to create a relatively small website for a personal project that will consist of mainly static webpages and the occasional form, and I'm not quite sure what direction I should be going in. 

From doing a little research, it seems like WordPress is popular for creating less complex websites, but I almost feel as if it's too much for what I'm trying to do. I don't really need a CMS, blog features, or plugins for this site, and I could just as easily use Twig/Symfony instead of building a WP template. 

So I guess my questions are mainly, what is the best way to go about creating a website that doesn't require a full blown CMS or complex backend functionality, and are there any general rules for when I should use a backend framework like Symfony vs something like WP/Joomla/Drupal? 

I really appreciate any advice or further reading you all can provide, and feel free to correct anything I may have misspoken on. This internship has been my first real experience with web development, and all of the different technologies out there are a bit overwhelming :)"

3ce3ar,1,2015-07-07,I have completely given up at my internship,completely_givenup,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ce3ar/i_have_completely_given_up_at_my_internship/,"Sooo I am graduating this fall and am currently interning at a large well known tech company. Ever since day one it has been very difficult for me to get time out of my manager/mentor. My manager knows nothing about what I am working on, and has told me he is only my manger for administrative reasons and has no time to help me. Therefore, my mentor is the one who is supposed to be in charge of helping me with my projects. Based on my interactions with my mentor I feel like he has no time for me, and he is not willing to make time for me. 
  
My internship was supposed to consist of two projects. My first project taking 3 weeks, and my second project taking the rest of the time. Interactions with my mentor have been very sparse. He will never come and check up on me, and 4 out of 5 times I go to him he will tell me he is busy and to come back later. Also, my mentor will never follow up on anything he says he will do for me, making it very hard to be productive. After completing my first project (with no guidance) in 4 weeks, whenever I spoke about my next project to my mentor he would continually delay the project and have me do small meaningless tasks related to my first project. After two weeks of this I decided to try and make our meetings more formal by blocking a slot on his calendar. He ignored my meeting request and when I went to him during that time he said he was too busy. 
  
I have realized that if I give up on trying to get my mentor to start me on my next project, I could probably go the rest of the internship with no work to do. The thing is, due to the way I have been treated so far at this company I have absolutely no desire to work for them full time. So I do not care about my performance reviews. Therefore, starting last week I have given up on contacting my mentor and use my time at work to study for technical interviews. Now that it has been over a week I am starting to feel a little guilty getting paid to study for interviews. My question is, are there any repercussions come the end of my internship, when they realize I did nothing for 5 weeks?

**tl;dr** Mentor and manager won't give me time of day at internship, therefore I am studying for interviews at work"
3ce9fg,1,2015-07-07,What's the point behind employers giving tuition assistance\reimbursement if you already need an M.S. degree and 3-5 years of experience just to be considered for the position?,KarateJons,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ce9fg/whats_the_point_behind_employers_giving_tuition/,"In my opinion the whole concept of ""tuition reimbursement"" is a giant fucking joke.  I had $50,000 in student loan debt before I even joined my present employer.  Obviously they're not going to give me more money beyond my salary to help pay it off.

The concept of course is that if you're a current employee trying to better themselves by earning an undergraduate or graduate degree, then the employer may have an interest in furthering your *edjimakacion* under the theory that a higher educated workforce will benefit the employer.

In reality, tuition assistance only benefits for example, someone who joined Walgreen's at the associate level but has no degree, is about to be promoted to regional or district manager or something, and therefore would ostensibly benefit from taking business management related courses from the local community college (whose tuition and fees would be low enough for tuition assistance to expense).

Tuition reimbursement as a concept makes very little sense to fields like engineering and computer science where the minimum entry requirement is to already have finished a degree to get your foot in the door.

As evidenced by the perception that computer science curricula at best only teach 40% of relevant things and the rest is learned by real on-the-job industry experience, it seems most of my peers are able to get by with just having undergraduate degrees, making graduate degrees superfluous and unnecessary.

But the whole purpose behind so-called tuition reimbursement is defeated where putting yourself tens of thousands of dollars in debt just to get your foot in the door is required in order to get a ""real"" job in the first place.

It hearkens back to the conundrum of needing experience to get hired, but nobody's willing to give you that experience in the first place except through internship exploitation and wage slavery."
3cek96,7,2015-07-07,21 y/o Fella working at an MSP; am I getting screwed over?,Fekkii,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3cek96/21_yo_fella_working_at_an_msp_am_i_getting/,"Hey everyone,

^^^Wall ^^^of ^^^text ^^^below, ^^^TL;DR ^^^at ^^^bottom

I'm a 21 y/o Dutch guy currently working as support engineer/sysadmin/jack of all trades at an MSP.
I actually like working at an MSP because I'm currently able to gain a LOT of knowledge across multiple ""fields"" in IT.

So, even though I'm enjoying the work I currently do, I really feel I'm getting screwed over. Let me give you some context:

The MSP I work at has GREAT work atmosphere and my colleague's are basically my friends. It's that chill over here.
My boss is pretty much the most knowledgeable guy I know when it comes to IT. So I learn a lot.
I messed up my high school (divorce, puberty and ADHD don't mix that well it seems) and went on to get a ""basic"" IT degree. I did my internship over here and they offered me a job after graduation.

So, fast forward about 3 years and here I am. Let me give you guys some insight on what I do:

- Tech support
	-	This is for about 300 or so small to medium-sized companies that call us whenever there's a problem. This could be printing, not logging in, getting an error, etc etc.
	-	We also manage their connections, so fiber issues, router issues and all that are also part of the tech support role
	-	I must note this is pretty much all Windows; Terminal Servers and local environments. Barely any OSX or Linux.
- Server management
	-	Now to be very honest this is one of the more minor aspects of my job, because this is mostly done by tier 2/3 support. But I do manage AD, troubleshoot Exchange issues, generic server issues (printers and all that), expand disks on VM's, install new servers, and all other basic stuff.
- VOIP
	-	We also manage VOIP for a lot of clients. Basically if a client wants to remodel their telephony solution, I'll come in and build up their PBX with their requests such as an option menu, forwards, pickup groups and all that stuff.
	-	VOIP support such as bad call quality, dropped calls or no connectivity are also part of my day-to-day job.
- CISCO
	-	I've done a small course for CISCO, and I must say I'm not the most proficient guy when it comes to this, but I'm able to configure Cisco routers for simple connections, add VLAN's, troubleshoot issues, review configs, basically all basic connection issues/configuration/adaptations.
- Networking
	-	I don't really know how to describe this part so I'll just give an example of what I did last week.
	-	Just a couple of weeks ago one of our major clients (a big construction company) requested us to set up a network/work environment at a construction site. This site would accomodate about 40 users from 3 different companies.
I deployed the following alone:
Phone number, phones, pickup groups (simple VOIP provisioning really, nothing special)
2 Switches (1 PoE, 1 normal)
1 Cisco router, config as well ofcourse.
3 Aruba AP's (with SSID's/networks for each company assigned to their respective VLAN)
2 Printers
Configured a VLAN for each company, set them up to be separate with ACL's in the Cisco, made 1 shared VLAN for the printers and stuff like that, made shares on the fileserver for each company with correspondent NTFS rights, and the rest is just stuff like adding the share at the users and the like.
- (some) Domain/Webhosting stuff
	-	If a client needs a new domain, I'll order it, put up the MX records, add it to our webserver if needed, and I'll give all the information needed for the client to get going
	-	Adding on to this, I'm currently making our new company website. I'm pretty proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, Wordpress, HTML/CSS and stuff like that. So long story short I'm able to make some pretty nice websites.

Surely I do more, but the list is long enough as-is.

And now the real point in question; am I getting royally fucked?  
This is what I make in a year:

~€1200 a month/€14400 a year ($1320/mo, $15800/year)
Company provided iPhone with unlimited data and calls/texts - for private use as well as company use
Company provided car with unlimited gas; I pay about €100 a month for this. It's a shitty ~€8k car though, but I should be upgrading next year.
Normal 25-30 vacation days, flexible hours when I want to and stuff like that.


So this post had become way longer than I anticipated, so I'll just cut it off right here. 

**TL;DR: 21 y/o fella doing tech support, servers, VOIP, Cisco, basic networking and some other shit, get's paid $14k a year with car+phone+gas. Getting fucked yay or nay?**


I hope you guys are willing to read this wal of text and give me some advice. Thanks in advance!!"

Sorry if this type of a question has been asked before but I think more personalized answer would be much better.

I'm currently studying for a 4 year degree at a local institute.(Third world country :P) I'm in its third year and currently I am doing an internship related to web development. When I was doing my second year project, I learned PHP from the beginning and started to like it more than other languages. As PHP is mainly focused on developing web based applications, I decided to focus my career path as a web developer in PHP.

After exposing myself to more web based app projects, I've learned PHP is not enough and things like PHP frameworks, JavaScript, jQuery makes things much easier. I only know the words AngularJS, NodeJS, etc and I've heard they are very useful in web development projects.

So my questions are, 

What are the things do I need to master before I complete my degree to become a successful web developer? 

What are the certifications do I need have to be recognized by the industry? 

What are the things/qualities do I need have to be independent from my working place if I want to move out from it if I'm not satisfied by working for them?

Thank you in advance. :)"

I am in my first job out of university and I'm a little worried. So when I graduated the company I did my internship with wanted to hire me (lets call them A) and I also had another job offer from B for a software engineer role. A ended up offering me more money and I liked the culture so I took there job over B and here is where the problem begins. A did not have a software dev/engineering role open when they hired me so I agreed to do SQL Dev for 9-12 months because I figured any experience is good experience. I like it but I really want to do software engineering in the long run and my concern is that I will get pigeon holed as an SQL developer. I get paid a software dev's salary (about 5k more than my team lead on the SQL project) so I can't imagine the company will waste any more time than they have to moving me to a dev role with a higher billable rate but I still have some concerns.

1. Will I get pigeon holed as the SQL guy if I switch companies at around a year? 6 months?

2. Should/Do I need to stay at company A until I get moved to a dev role to switch companies to avoid pigeon holing? 

3. What kind/scale of projects should I be doing in my free time to avoid getting stuck on the SQL track? (I can use freetime at work for personal learning and I just finished my 1st pet project which had a Go backend/RESTful API with an Angular front end portfolio/blog site)

4. Is it dangerous staying for a year as an SQL Dev if that's not what I want to do? Should I jump ship earlier? Tell A its not for me even though I agreed to it? It's my first job so I don't want to unnecessarily step on any toes.

I am a NY resident who is an intern in Virginia for the summer. I have a clean NY and VA driving record.

Being 21 years old I am trying to avoid keeping this on my record because of the threat of insurance increases. I have done my research around Reddit and it seems my situation is a little unique. Even though I am an out of state resident, I will be able to attend the summons date listed on my ticket (August 5), but if it were to extend past that date listed for another court appearance, I would already have moved back to NY and would not be able to make it (I leave VA August 10).

I realize that I did speed and know there are consequences, but it seems like a valid option that I have seen some people mention was to take a defensive driving course prior to my court date. It was suggested to bring in proof that I took it prior to my court date and plead no contest, showing the judge that I realize what I did but have taken steps to improve myself and a reduction will hopefully be given.

Does anyone feel that is my best course of action, or should I just pay it and send in the money as that is an option as well (probably skyrocketing my insurance). Or should I get a local traffic lawyer involved and have them help me when I leave? Thanks for reading my post and any suggestions would be helpful."

What's the issue?,drussell01,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cgkat/cs_student_with_low_cumulative_gpa_but_good_major/,"I'm currently studying computer science at a well reputed university. I changed major two years ago to CS and I've been doing pretty good. I currently have a 2.6 cumulative GPA and a 3.4 major GPA. I've been actively searching for an internship this summer but I'm not having any luck. I know that I have the skills (and work ethics) to succeed in an internship but I'm not getting an opportunity to showcase my skills. Only issues I can think of are my cumulative gpa and my inexperience as a professional programmer. 

I currently have both gpa's on my resume. Should I not have them on my resume? I have one more semester to go and I'm a little worried at this point. I do have an employer (that I interviewed recently) that agreed to interview me again for a full time position after I graduate but I want to gain some experience this summer. I have about 6-7 weeks until school starts again. 

Thank you for the help.

UPDATE: I decided to leave both gpa's on there. But instead of just 2.6 CGPA, I included my gpa for the last two years, which is 3.2. I figured that, this would show to the employers that I made mistakes my first few years but I got back on track and actually tried the last two years. My major GPA also shows that I got a good mix of A's and B's for my programming classes. I was able to get a non programming job for now. I'll definitely go all out this upcoming career fair. Thank you for all your suggestions!"
3cgki4,2,2015-07-07,Advice - Should I keep a job experience on my resume if I was terminated?,Reddit_Toss_Boss,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3cgki4/advice_should_i_keep_a_job_experience_on_my/,"I've been job hunting with some minor success, but the biggest draw back is that I don't have any feedback, or any real way to know if I'm ""doing something wrong"". 

I have asked friends and family, but I want to try to get an outsider's opinion on one or two things that might be hurting me in the job hunting process. 

Please, if I may borrow a moment of your time. 


A few years ago I was working for a particular entertainment company for a college internship. It was a great experience and I was there for a few months until I was terminated for ""sexual harassment"". I put this in quotes because how it happened to me made me think for the longest time that it was a set up, and after talking to friend's and family about it, including my therapist, they seem to agree that something was not quite right. 

Either way, I talked to the HR people and they had informed me that the actions they were taking would not be held against me in the company, and of course they would not tell anyone about why I was let go. 

Fast forward to today, and I find that the same company will not rehire me because of my termination. When I had called and finally talked to someone, they said I could *never* appeal the decision or get rehired, which contradicted what the HR guy had told me a few years ago. 

Perhaps against my better judgement, I have also put them down on my resume since it makes my resume pop as it is a highly reputable entertainment company. 

This all worries me because of the fact I have had job interviews that I thought went well, but ultimately resulted in nothing. In fact, I had one job interview where the guy told me outright that I had the job, pending a background check, and then they *never* got in touch with me. I called the manager and even their HR person that was going to do the check, and neither of them got back to me. That was about a month ago. 


As I said before, I have no idea what I am doing wrong. My background check would and should be absolutely spotless as the worst I've done is a speeding ticket. As I understand it, the only thing the company can say is if I can be rehired again or not. 

Would it be a good idea to remove that job experience off my resume? 

Would that be reason enough for a potential employer to not consider me? 

Is there such a thing as ""clearing my name"" with the company in question?

Once again, thank you for your time.

* I focus on Java and move away from web development
* I go full front-end even though I am more of an engineer than a designer
* I strengthen my back-end knowledge (JSP &amp; servlets are not hot nowadays, right? Maybe PHP?)
* I expand my CV by learning something new (JavaScript Framework? Ruby on Rails? Android?)

I decided to pursue a CS minor as I finished out my economics BA last year, and am now realizing it will take me into a sixth year of school. My econ BA is all but finished, so it'll be another 1.5 years of school for me to see the CS minor to completion.

The academic advising here is mostly peer sponsored and doesn't seem to be too in-tune with what's what in hi-tech. If I'm aiming for an entry level programming/development position with a decent salary, is this in my best interest? I have an IT job on campus and could see using the extra time afforded by school to work on extra-curricular projects, but the light at the end of the tunnel just seems ever further away and cant imagine this is the best route I can take.

It might be worth mentioning that I'm fairly new to CS, but it is of interest to me. Also haven't held an internship thus far as I slacked off big time for the first couple years, so I'm a bit behind there as well.

TL;DR- Interested in CS, fairly inexperienced. Wondering if its worth the extra 1.5 yrs to pursue a CS minor at an average university or if there's some other more efficient way to use my time. Thanks in advance!"

I've been there for two and a half weeks. I've been told there are other interns, but I haven't met them at all, even though everyone works in the same office. The first few tasks I got were documentation tasks, and I finished those faster than they expected. That documentation has been published on their site.

My next task is to add a certain feature to their product, and I was excited for this at first. However, they just threw me into the deep end of their massive codebase (2GB of code for a product that's not that complicated) with no guidance on where to look for the sections I need to edit. They said I can ask questions, but when I do I get the response ""be there in a few minutes""... and then it takes them a couple hours, during which time I do absolutely nothing. then they answer a question or two, and the cycle repeats. 

At this point I'm just wasting all my time there and not learning anything (isn't that the whole point of an internship?) It seems odd that they just expect me to know what to do in this spaghetti code ocean of a codebase.

Also, when they told me to install their product on the computer they've given me, it doesn't deploy properly. I've heard all their employees run into installation issues when they start. They ignore me when I tell them of the problem. Additionally, the code doesn't even build on the same computer. Again I just get ignored.

I tried their product on another machine, and it has to be one of the worst pieces of software I have ever used. Between the shitty product, shitty code quality, and shitty experience, I've lost all motivation to do well at this internship.

I want to quit, but I'm afraid it'll reflect badly on me in the future. Also, my parents are against me quitting, and I live at home with them when I'm not at my university so going against their wishes is not an option.

What do I do?"

That's a helluva lot of money to me -- I grew up with a single mom that barely makes 20k, and I need the money from this summer to help her with bills so I can't get fired from this internship. 

Maybe I'm the one who's putting too much pressure on myself, but I'm terrified that I'm not good enough in CS, that they're going to expect way too much from me, that I won't be able to deliver what they want. I didn't interview for the internship -- one of my professors connected me to the guy who runs the tech part of the company.

I'm tasked with developing a WYSIWYG web page builder/editor for a small business.
For the project, I plan to use AngularJS, Jquery, and an open-source rich text editor from GitHub.

The project is elaborate and actually a little over my head but I like the challenge.
I don't know AngularJS but currently learning it on my own.

Fortunately this is an open-ended project with a generous time frame (till the end of the year).
So I figure I'll get it completed in a few months but I rather collaborate with others on this project.

I'm hoping to find a fellow student, who like myself, needs to knock out internship requirements before graduating. 

Actually anyone is invited to help me but I figure, this being an unpaid internship, I don't want to waste someone's time unless they need the experience.

I'm very appreciative if anyone who is knowledgeable about these kinds of projects could provide pointers or be available to guide me when I run into trouble.


If you know a place on the web that is better suited for this kind of request, please let me know.

My boyfriend and I have been together 3 1/2 years. Let's call him Sam. At the time, Sam was living with a few roommates, all friends, in a 4 bedroom townhouse that Sam's dad owns. I started staying over at his place from fairly early on, he'd drive me to work and we'd basically just come back and eat/sleep before the next day. He lived in the master suite and his roommates were all single dudes except one, whose girlfriend was across the country at school. Let's call him James and his girlfriend Carla. Carla would come into town and stay a few days at a time, mostly keep to herself. Not a big deal. Nobody ever voiced a problem with girls staying over and like I said, I kept to myself. I was very, very rarely there when Sam wasn't, I would go home to my parents place. Flash forward a few months, we all move out. 

Flash forward another year and a half, and the townhouse is available again. I'm out of work (I got a bad spinal diagnosis in our time away) so it makes sense for us to take on a roommate or two and save money. We reach out. James wants to move back in, as does our other friend Ian. At this point, Carla is still in school, so Sam and I are effectively living with two NEAT, QUIET professionals/bachelors. We provided all the furniture for common areas, all the dishes, etc. It goes pretty well for a while. Carla moves back about 8 months ago. A few months later, Ian decides to move back in with his parents. Not a problem. James, Sam, and I have a meeting where James is very clear that Carla does not want to live with him (traditional parents, money, etc. she works about an hour away and has her own place out there in addition to her room at her parents place, which is near to here). Okay, so the three of us resign for a month to month lease. 

Soon after, we sign a roommate agreement that goes over taking care of the common spaces, quiet hours, etc. One specific clause is that if a roommate has a potential guest that is staying more than 10 consecutive days, that tenant has to ask the landlord and some arrangement has to be made regarding bills and rent. 

Today is day 10. That might be fine if Carla still kept to herself, but she has not. Oh, dear god. 

She stomps up and down stairs, she never shuts up (and not only does she constantly yell, she puts on this false cutest stupid voice and it's annoying as hell). She brings her friends over in the middle of the day, she has a key and let's herself in whenever. She takes up the entire kitchen during the day (the entire pretty big kitchen) for hours at a time. She's here constantly. Like I said, ten days straight, and it's not like she goes away for a week after times like that - she's here probably 20-25 days out of the month. 

We tried having a discussion with him once, about her being over for a week straight and the change in bills, and he brushed us off and said it was a one time thing because she had some test for her internship thing. Okay, we let it slide, he knew it was an issue. It's only gotten worse since then. She's practically moved in. She has no regard for Sam and I, and she and James play stuff at loud volume, hoard dirty dishes, don't sweep or clean any of the common spaces, etc. She does her laundry here, monopolizing the machines for hours. She uses our cooking stuff (mixing bowls, pots, etc) to store huge batches of food in the fridge. We then can't cook with the things we need. Sam and I know we want our own place, and health-wise I'm finally at a place where I can start working again, but it's not happening any time soon, financially. James has made it clear that he won't move out until we do. He's also had multiple occasions where he basically throws parties at the house with no prior warning, sometimes Sam and I come home from a long day of errands and crap and just want to watch a movie in the living room, on our couch, on our tv, but we walk in to 15 people crowding our living room and either a booming movie or a bunch of people partying. Like, at least ask if it's cool. They're mostly mutual friends. We might have even liked to have join. But we don't get so much as a courtesy text. 

What do we say to him? We can't really just knock on his door and talk because she's always here. He's also fairly confrontational and we're worried he'll get super passive aggressive again; he tends to do that. But they're not being considerate of our space or the common spaces, and like, if she had a key for emergencies or was here once in a while, fine. But when she's making it so that I can't make my own meals everyday, it's too much. We would never have agreed to live with another couple. It's gotten to the point where I'm miserable living here, Sam hates it too. We're afraid of pissing off James because he and Sam were like best friends once, but this is insane. 

EDIT: TL;DR; my boyfriend and I's roommate was pretty cool, his girlfriend moved back, now they're an amalgam of annoying behaviors to the point of making us miserable. "

Next promotion probably comes within a year but still only takes me up to around $15-17.

They made me the offer today and want me to give them an answer by tomorrow morning.  I've applied to several other jobs that pay much better and are better opportunities in general.  One in particular I think I have a very decent shot at.  My concern is that I don't want to lock myself in to this position and then get another offer that I would greatly prefer and have to refuse it, but I also haven't been hearing back from a lot of other companies so I feel like it would be a huge risk to turn down this offer.

About me:

* I have a CS degree from a liberal arts college, graudated around 5 years back. Had ~4 prior internships during college, 2 paid &amp; 2 unpaid.

* I've been working as a software engineer for a large corporation for ~4 years, working as a full stack developer

* Recently was approached by a recruiter for what I would consider a dream job working for another large, but much more prestigious company in finance.

* Sailed past multiple phone screens, was invited to have an in person that involved them flying me out &amp; an in person interview with ~6-8 people (one at a time, for around ~5 hours). It all seemed to go very well with the odd slip up here and there on more complicated subject matter, but nothing that nagged at me too bad afterwards. Felt pretty good 8/10 about my performance.

* Fast forward two weeks and I hear back from the recruiter. The interview team ""felt strongly"" about me and the company now wants to go forward with making an offer.

* They make me a pretty generous offer (with a ~$14k-18k pay bump) including relocation expenses, and honestly just having this name on my resume is definitely something that would pay dividends in both the short term and long term.

* I verbally accept the offer, a few days later got a written offer &amp; the full employment packet. **As this is a major player in their industry &amp; a household name, they do a pretty extensive background check (4-6 weeks) athat covers all parts of one's life (work, education, credit, criminal, drug, etc).** I don't have anything on my record that would mark me negatively...

...that is, except my college GPA. This is a company that, from many Google searches, I know they typically look for candidates in the 3.5-and-up range. **Up until this very point, I've never been asked once about my resume, not in phone calls or during the in-person, nor do I list it on my resume (purposely).** It is the only thing on my resume that I would believe paints me in a negative light, and to be somewhat specific it falls in the range of 2.4 - 2.7 with my major GPA about 0.3 points higher.

A minor note, it appeared from many/most places that I looked online that the GPA is typically used **as a preliminary screen before any interviews take place**. 

***

So after going through the paperwork about the documentation that I need to return to the company, among other things, there were two sentences that stuck out to me that seemed as if they might be a panacea for my anxiety. To paraphrase, they are something along the lines of:

* ""If you included your GPA on your resume, you must fill it out [on their online application software]""

* [regarding documentation to provide] If you have your transcript, provide it **only if they are conveniently available** (emphasis mine)

Regarding the first bullet point, again, I have never been asked about my GPA, nor did I include it on my resume (as I purposely omit it).

Regarding the second bullet point, I don't technically have that material readily available, but it's not like it would be terribly difficult to actually go ahead and get an unofficial or official transcript from my college

**Last note:** looking through the rest of the forms provided, there does not appear to be any sort of release form to grant the company access to my academic transcripts, so it appears as if I don't expressly provide it, they do not have it.

***

So, with the above details, it basically boils down to these questions:

* ##Am I past the point career-wise where GPA actually matters anymore?

* ##Do I provide my GPA to the company, even though it appears it may be optional?

* ##Do I provide my academic transcripts to the company, even though it appears it may be optional?

* ##If I do forgo giving the company these details, or does that put a ""red flag"" on my background check?

* ##If they've already made me a verbal and written offer (pending BG check), and I've never lied about my GPA (as I've never been asked about it or otherwise disclosed it), should I just bite the bullet and disclose it all?

Of note, I feel that were I to provide these documents to said company, the chances that my conditional offer would be rescinded would be maybe ~30-40% as I do have a reasonable amount of outside experience I can point to (and stellar references that will give me excellent reviews), but given that I would describe this as quite literally my dream job, the anxiety about getting this right is eating at me right now. I actually got an offer from a pretty good company that's in my area with ~$10k pay bump &amp; better benefits, but I declined it because I was waiting to hear back about this job &amp; I wanted this job much more.

Thanks in advance for any advice. Would greatly appreciate any insight from the more experienced, *especially anyone who has insight into how a major-player finance type company handles these sorts of things from an HR perspective.*"
3cirr5,2,2015-07-08,Advice/Tips on people who are CS/Biology (Any other science major),OnlyLikesKancolle,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3cirr5/advicetips_on_people_who_are_csbiology_any_other/,"I'm starting college next semester, but I want to make sure that whatever major I take, it helps me a get job where I can help my family financially, but at the same time, be able to enjoy and love what I do everyday. I'm making this post because I'm afraid I will make the wrong choice or do a job where I feel miserable.

**Background about myself just to help:**
 I graduated this year and I am going to college in SF State. I originally chose Biology as my major, but I want to change it to another because the major is impacted in my college. So I chose to either pursue a major in Computer Science or another major in science.

 The thing is my mother wants me to pursue a major in Science or Law, but I feel like I won't really enjoy spending extra 10+ years studying to be a doctor and lawyer work doesn't appeal to me. On the other hand I really love computers and technology, but I am afraid of the risk of being hired when I get a CS major. My mom tried to scare me off by saying the IT guys at her work lost their jobs. My dilemma here is I'm torn with choosing a major and I'm afraid I might chose the wrong one.

**TL;DR** I love technology and computers, but my mom was thinking about something in the law or scientific field as a major. I also love science, but when I think about a job in the scientific field, I feel ""empty"" when I imagine myself a couple of years compared to being a CS major. 

Basically I'm confident enough to say that I am proficient in Science and at least a bit interested to pursue something with it, but I also spend a lot of time with computers and enjoy every second of it. I want a major that can help me land a job to help my family financially and be able to finish college as fast as I can.

**Also**
My tuition is at least going to be $3,240 but that might go up since my brother is going to college next year! I know the basic tips i.e. talk to your professors, get internships, but those along with other new ones wouldn't be too bad!


* 1.)Which major did you pursue? (Computer Science or A major in the scientific field)(**Or any other major you are passionate about!**)

* 2.)What job did you land on with that major and a quick description about it.

* 3.)What is stressful about your job and what do you love about it?

* 4)Do you have any tips for me or others who might have the same dilemma as me? (Anything regarding choosing a major or the major you took)

* 5)What did you do to ease the financial struggle while going to college?

* 6)Any closing remarks?Anything you want to say to anyone that could be of use that you couldn't fit in the other questions?

**Thanks for at least reading this post as I am quite afraid of going into college and choosing a major that will give me trouble. I would also like to thank those in advance who post in this post! Sorry if there are any typos, English isn't my first language and I type fast enough that I make some mistakes :p**

**If this post is in the wrong place please tell me! This took me quite a long time to type-up and think of!**

I'm interning for a major company, and we have a presentation on a rough draft of a report that is due at the end of the week. I had some pretty big disagreements with a fellow intern today, that eventually led to most of his ideas being struck down. He wanted to tackle the project from a top-down point of view, rather than bottom-up, and completely missed the directive of what we should be doing. He also just generally had no idea what he was talking about.

I tried to be as polite, but honest, as possible, but he seems to have taken offense. Without him there, we maximized our productivity and got more done in 15 minutes than we did in a full two hours prior.

The problem is that I am afraid he will undermine our presentation and my ideas tomorrow. He still does not seem particularly on board, but has a charm to him, and experience (he's a 27 year old intern).

What is the best way to both be honest, while being enough of a team player to not come across as a dick to him and upper management?"

New Grad. Trying to find a decent position. 

I worked at a big company last summer. Paid 32/hr. The internship was ok. I didnt like the guy who I worked under much. He was a snob and behaved very arrogantly but before my internship was over he offered me a part time position for 6 months. I had to decline because of some issues. 

The report he sent to my college was mvere negative than positie. He made some really bad remarks with a few good ones. Which was odd as if i was really bad why would he offer me a part time?

Not to mention I m from a top 25 Uni and have 3.72 gpa.



So the question is, 

How do i email them asking for a full time position?

My friend was intern in the same company but in another department and his manager was really cool and offered him a full time last week .


Who should I message? The HR or my ex-manager? 

Is there a particular format I should stick to?

I am not sure if it's the right place to post that kind of questions, but any input is usefull.

I am currently finishing my 4th CS year at university, and doing and internship in a bank to validate the year. I'm not gonna say where, but i will finish my studies next year.

In think i've lost faith in what i do.

I'm not sure about what is wrong : 

-  the technology i use : won't get to details but mainly J2EE
-  the private sector with its own rules, but generally only one : money
-  the way people work nowadays in general : stuck on the screen 40-50h/week not caring about what is really important
-  the software engineer job : maybe some others like architect, system engineer or project manager is more fun.
-  the way our work is used in general : i'm not sure the majority of people working (IT in our case) are making a better world

To be honest, i have no idea about what i'll do after i finish my studies, but the more i learn atm, the less i want to work.

I just want to find a passion, make a better world (ecology, music...)...so what i'm planning to do is either find a thesis on an interesting subject or build my own organic farm.

If someone is/was in the same situation and have some answers, i'll be glad to reddit.

I went to a very progressive high school - an early college high school. I started there my sophomore year, and basically, it was a school full of whiz-kids. We all took college courses beginning at 15, everyone wanted to be a doctor/engineer, all Pre-AP/AP courses were given for high school courses, etc. I did well, with a 4.1/4.5 GPA, but it was an extremely competitive environment. I did well, but I was still third quarter since we had a solid tie of 10 people to be top 10% because they all had perfect 4.5GPAs. Anyway, I graduated with an associate's degree at 18 in biology. I was sure I was going to do something in biology. My biology teacher in high school proved that to me, and I was naturally good at the subject. I also worked really hard on it because it interested me so much.


After high school, I flopped around. Went to a big university, dropped out at the end of that semester. Decided I wanted to become a physical therapist assistant. My internship conflicted with my job, so I couldn't do it. Went back to a big university, dropped out again due to lack of interest and stress. Went to a smaller university (the one I now work for) to study biology, became a full-time manager (was full-time before but not manager) for the store I worked at and failed Genetics, putting me on academic probation. I haven't been back to school since. That was Fall of 2012. I've taken classes here and there at community colleges because I kept flipping back and forth with maybe a business degree. I actually just applied back to my university and was accepted to pursue a Finance degree. Now, I'm scared I don't want to do that, either.


I work in the Finance department of my school. I set up payment plans, talk to students about how to pay for school, send things to Collections, etc. I don't mind my university - I love it, in fact, because it has about 20 something students per teacher (the bigger school had some classes with 500 kids in it). However, there aren't many degrees available for me here. I can't go to a bigger school due to my work hours and that I have to share a car with my boyfriend. My boyfriend just graduated from the school I work at with a degree in IT and now works, making 51k right out of college, as a software developer. He's always been good with computers and coding, so he knew what he wanted to pursue. Me, I flop around a lot.


I feel like I have no real passions. That, or I end up liking everything and can't settle for anything, either. I will usually try something, get to one really hard/dumb class, read about how something else is much better ""fit"" for me, try that, and the cycle repeats. I have a lot of free time at work (hence why I am speaking to you Reddit), and I decided, ""Hey, I'm going to teach myself some programming! It's useful!"" I feel like I was influenced by my boyfriend, but I used Code Academy and taught myself for a week. Now, it's been five days since I've done it, and I'm feeling bad for starting something I now haven't finished. I also went onto Khan's Academy to teach myself some math, something I kind-of like but have only basic skills with. I haven't done it in over a week, either.


My interests are mainly just English and Biology. Neither fields are really...great for jobs at the moment. Too many of each degree. I wanted to become a biology teacher at one point for gifted and talented students, but I've since changed again. Didn't want to deal with the parents. I feel like every time I try something, I psyche myself out for the worst and immediately quit. I'm so terrified of putting so much work into something and regretting it because I won't be happy. At the same time, I'm paying on 8k worth of student loans for something I don't even have. I'm terrified to start something and quit. It's what I've always done. Maybe college isn't for me, but I at least want to go and have something to show for it to prove that, ""Hey, at least I went."" That way, if I ever need it, I'll be okay.


My boyfriend is very supportive and just says to do what I want to do. But the thing is, I don't know what I want to do. I even did a personality quiz to see what type I am, so maybe it would suggest occupations for me, but all it said was, ""You'd be good at most anything."" Thanks a lot, online quiz!


My biggest concern is that I work full-time at an 8am-5pm job. I can only really attend classes at night, and probably only 2 or 3 at the most each semester. It'll take me a long time to finish school compared to kids going full-time. It's so much time for me to second-guess myself and quit. I don't know what to do. I'm so at a loss. 


I'll continue browsing the sub reddit for some inspiration, but if anyone has been through this, I'd appreciate even a word or two. I need to get serious, but I'm always fighting it. 

tl;dr: Wants to be an English major/Biology major/Computer Science major/Business major. Quits everything. 

EDIT: I've decided maybe I'd like to continue working for my university but as a behind-the-scenes sort of person. I know I work for the university myself so I should understand what goes on here, but does anyone do anything like that?"

I'm looking for one guaranteed safety school where I get a guarantee of full tuition at a minimum with my act/sat score. Then two engineering match schools, three engineering reaches, and three finance reach schools. My parents dont really want me to go too far away, and they're pretty much against any school in California, so I would like schools that are closer than that, however its not totally set in stone. Things i'm looking for in a school; either a strong engineering program, or strong investment banking recruiting. I don't really have any opinions on size; I visited Northwestern, UIUC, and Notre Dame, and the size thing doesn't really matter, large or small it doesn't make a difference to me. Also sports doesn't really matter to me either, however if I was between two schools, and all else being equal, the one with the better/larger sports program would win. In terms of cost my parents could afford about 15k/ year for me at the most, an I would like to keep my debt under 60k at graduation, so these schools need to be about a 30k coa at most after finaid/scholarships.

**One Financial Safety (Guaranteed full tuition):**

* Alabama? Texas Tech(If I get NMF)? Uhouston(If I get NMF)? Suggestions?

**Two Engineering Matches:**

* UIUC

* Northeastern?(Possible NMF scholarship) Wisconsin? Suggestions?

**Three Engineering Reaches:**

* MIT

* Northwestern?

I would really love to even get into the gaming industry. I suppose I need some advice. If I were to switch to CS I would have to transfer schools. I would't get to start until the spring and it could take 3 more years. It would be much cheaper and a better school to get the CS degree though.

Also, what is the best way to prepare for a career in software development/software engineering. I've had a few internships and right now I am interning as a software engineer working with microcontrollers and creating mobile applications. However, if I want to intern at a gaming company or wherever are those skills even relevant?

This degree usually takes 3 years. This means I'm actually already 1 year overdue of getting my degree, which is only becoming worse as I have failed my second year re-take exams again. My whole summer vacation (which was supposed to be now) is filled yet again with exam re-takes of the second year, where I literally have three weeks filled with daily exams from 2-5 PM that has started on the 7th. 

I have already failed my first two exams, and I am on my way to fail the rest as well. This would mean that I will have to retake yet another year, lengthening the time to get my degree and my debts. I already have 23k euros in debts, which is only increasing and the only reason I have not killed myself yet, because that would mean that I would leave this debt on my parents, as I still live with them. I have never had a job because I have been so occupied with studying and dating the wrong guys. 

I am just very lost. I only get 4 hours of sleep daily, as I have to study for all my exams. It takes roughly 1 hour to even get to my university, so I lose 2 hours a day to travelling. 

I fear for my future, as I'm very scared I won't be able to get my degree. I was planning to take a masters degree after this in my recommended and preferred field, and have already gotten an internship. This will however not go well if I do not get my bachelors degree, which will ruin all of my plans.

The ideal life for me was to get my bachelors at 21, my masters at 23 and then go on to do research in cancer, which is what I've been doing for my internship and. 

Everyone around me is already getting internships abroad across the globe, doing charity work and have part time jobs and what not. I feel like i'm wasting away my life while being continuously stressed out.

My parents keep asking me when I will get my degree, and I keep ignoring them and keep giving them vague answers as I do not know. I feel they are incredibly dissapointed with me for having taken so long on my way to get my degree. 

I feel like a complete failure and honestly jsut want to drop out and quit and kill myself. The only thing that is stopping me is my debt, which btw will be gone IF I get my degree within 6 years. I really don't know what to do, I'm completely lost. 

I honestly just want to kill myself and be over with it. "

I'm an IT intern at a company that works to provide extra help in their area in the form of interns like myself. Generally, the interns are sent around the area to work on site and work as a technology guide for the people in their respective buildings. However, I work at the actual location of the company instead of being sent out by them. Hopefully that makes sense, I am trying to be vague. 

Alongside me is my friend, let's call him George. He's also in the same position I am. We were imaging some old Mac OS laptops one day, about a week ago. In order to image (erase and then copy over with a fresh installation complete with programs and some files) these old laptops, we had to tether them to our work laptops. Essentially, this means we had to run the imaging software off of our work computers and ""target"" (select) the other computer to image. George was busy, so he asked me to run an image for him off of his work laptop. I did so, but accidentally selected his laptop as the target to be wiped. I didn't realize for a while, until I remembered that I have no clue what his work laptop is named nor what the old laptop was named. I couldn't stop it, but in a hasty panick I did something you should never do: I force shut down both laptops, opened then both back up, and re-ran the imaging software, this time doing it correctly. I thought I had won, until he got back on his laptop later in the day and discovered it had been totally corrupted and wouldn't boot past a black and white matrix wall of text. Whoops. Sorry George. 

The three guys who work above us tried to fix it and couldn't. When they asked George what happened to his laptop, he just said he wasn't sure. After all, he really wasn't. Still, he doesn't know the corruption was my fault or that I knew it had happened the whole time and why. 

Luckily, his laptop is warranted and paid for by our company so he wont have to pay out of pocket, but he did lose all of his important work files.  "

So far it has been pretty overwhelming. I will have to learn the product in addition to learning the technologies within a short amount of time.

In addition, it is tough to understand the code because nearly every class involves the spring framework or other open source classes that I've never heard of. I'm looking for suggestions on how to break things down into smaller pieces so that I can begin understanding things. 

On top of this my manager has been with the company for only a week. This is nice because we will be able to learn things together but at the same time I can't really ask him questions.

For me, it is a little stressful because I have been wanting a software development/engineering internship for sometime now. As soon as I get one, I start to question whether or not I am up for the challenge. 

Any tips on how to keep moving forward would be appreciated. "

3cmsx4,3,2015-07-08,Am I being overworked?,WorldOfPug,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3cmsx4/am_i_being_overworked/,"Hi guys,

I'm a recent college graduate who is working at a quickly growing software startup. I had worked as an intern for about a year and got an offer to go full time after school. 

I've been here for a month, and I am starting to wonder if I am being taken advantage of. I work from approximately 9-6:30 (which is normal I guess). Then, when I get home I work a few more hours each night. For example, I worked 8:45-7:00 and now I've been working since 10pm and expected to go to 12am. Sometimes, I get a call at 10pm asking if I could do something asap and of course, I say yes and work on it. I work couple hours on weekends too.

Now, I understand everyone has their responsibilities, and I have to do my projects. However, this seems unreasonable. I have a life of my own, and these hours are stressing me out alot.

So, am I being taken advantage of, or is this the norm? Maybe it's just the nature of a startup? I can't guage this since this is my first *real* job. 

I feel extremely lucky to have a job when my friends are struggling to find work. However, this just seems too much. FYI, I make 45k and get health, get no overtime pay, and am at at-will employment.

If this is in fact unfair, I would want to leave but that isn't so easy either. First, I don't really have a specific skill or experience that would make finding work elsewhere easy. I have no confidence that I could find something. Second, working briefly at my first job won't look so great to future employers.

The problem is that I have no respect for him - he's a terrible manager and he treats his employees like crap. 

Also, despite my position as an intern, I'm well connected with people in upper management, and I've heard rumors that the only reason the IT manager still has his job is because he's kissed ass with one of the owners, and the owner likes him for it.

Basically, my thought is that I don't want to associate myself with this guy when going into a new job, even if there's no conceivable way they would know this guy.

What do I do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cpaka/i_accepted_a_few_weeks_agonow_intel_is_interested/,"Hi everyone. I recently accepted an offer for a permanent position at the company that hired me as an intern. I learned a lot in five months and really bonded with the team, so I was very happy to accept the position. I make around $70,000 which is excellent for where I live. Anyway, before they made me the offer I applied to several companies. I heard back from Facebook but didn't survive the technical interview. They told me to try again in a year. I also applied to Intel and they only recently got back to me. They are interested in me. 

I love where I work but I was wondering if it would be stupid to turn down an interview with Intel. I'm a year away from completing my undergrad, so this would be for a year-long undergrad internship. It pays on average a good deal less than what I make now and I would have to relocate to California. But the experience and skills I could obtain would be world-class given that it is Intel. So what should I do? Is it despicable to do this after accepting an excellent position with a company that I've really enjoyed for five months? Or is it foolish to neglect what could mold me into a stronger developer? Should I let Intel know that I'm interested in a future relationship perhaps when I am pursuing a Master's Degree in CS? Or are opportunities like these a one time thing?

Personally, I love where I work now. Great pay, great people, amazing work-life balance. The only reason I asked this was because I was wondering if Intel is unique enough to make me a world-class developer faster than if I stick with this mid-sized company and work hard on my own. Is Intel a big enough opportunity for better experiences and better pay in the long-term that I should go ahead and interview, even if it means leaving my current job after only a month or two of fulltime employment?"

Last week, I was forwarded an email from an employee here in the office, from the head of IT (medium sized company) across the country. I needed some more information, so I decided to directly email the head and ask for it, rather than bother the employee.

Mistake. Head has never heard of me, and instructed all IT staff to stop answering users messages while they investigate the ""security breach"". I was locked out of my account, and im still waiting to hear back from employee about what's to happen next. Wish me luck.

Edit: I was called into employees office, who said the head was very upset about the ""new sysadmin"".  Asked what exactly I've done around here (Set up new workstations, antivirus installs, computer name changes, other helpdesk stuff local IT guy asked me to do, etc), then sent me on an early lunch. Apparently employee was locked out of their account as well.


Edit 2: employee is trying to contact head so I can tell him about what I do here, I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs in the meantime.

Edit 3: talked to head guy. All seems to be going much better, I expect to get access to my domain account back soon. Hopefully I didn't get too many user requests in the meantime.

Edit 4: VP and employee came in to talk to me, assured me it was all a big misunderstanding and to leave early today and come back tomorrow. That's it for today it seems! I think regular local sysadmin will be in a bit of trouble when he gets back from vacation."

So... I started an internship on a laboratory of a factory last week and decided to bring my laptop to work on my report on my dead times while i was there. It gets really hot in there so we turned on the AC on the morning and everything was normal. Later went to lunch, and when i got back shit hit the fan. I couldn't believe it. The broken AC splashed water all over the table and my laptop. I took the battery off, dried it, opened it apart and dried more. Tried to turn it on, the power light was on but didn't started. I stopped there to avoid further damages 

Went home, opened the entire laptop again, and let it dry for 24h with a dehumidifier always on.

Today i assembled it, and tested. Pressed the on button, the on light lights for 2s and then turns off. Shit. I tried it again, laptop starts working, i see the motherboard logo, i almost start celebrating but what i most feared happened... Laptop shut down, and i saw smoke... Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck

I think my motherboard or processor burned :'( I don't know what to do. This laptop wasn't a the best on the market, but it was pretty good for me, it was by far my most valuable item and i don't have much money :(

On my resume I have legal internships (criminal law and special education related), a temporary position doing manufacturing materials sourcing compliance related work for a few months after law school (DBE/Buy America type stuff), and my current dead end legal job reviewing hundreds of litigation discovery documents per day for legal relevance, confidentiality, and privilege then redacting the sensitive bits. It is not a sexy legal job at ALL and the pay is very poor but employers outside the legal field do not understand that by looking at my title and job description). 

**What I have been doing:**
I have been applying for HR jobs since I finished law school, so for almost two years now (although I was not making the extreme effort until the past 6 months or so). I have not been successful.  I am applying mostly to entry-level jobs with modest pay because I understand that no amount of reading can match real on the job HR experience. I don't expect attorney pay, and I have been trying to approach this with humility. However, I haven't been able to get even HR temp $12/hr type jobs. 

I have followed a lot of the advice I have found on reddit and HR blogs to take it upon myself to do my research on HR issues and software. I also have been attending employment law related continuing legal education seminars (not my practice area) so that I am knowledgable about the relevant law. 

I have tried to emphasize in my cover letter my professionalism, commitment to discretion and confidentiality, willingness to learn, and interest/relevant knowledge of law. I have also addressed the attorney issue by saying that I prefer the collaborative nature of human resources to the adversarial work of an attorney but that doesn't seem to help. 

-----
**TL;DR START HERE**
I want to demonstrate that I have made efforts to learn about HR and have a real interest in leaving law for HR, but I am having a hard time conveying that on a resume/in job applications online. 

I feel my problems are:

1. I feel like the software/calculations analyzing my application don't take my interest and knowledge discussed within a cover letter into account well. I feel like I get tossed out before my cover letter can help. 

2. HR professionals are skeptical of lawyers applying for HR jobs 

3. I'm trying to relocate so networking is very difficult [If it matters, I wouldn't need relocation assistance, which I do mention in CLs]


Questions:

1. How can I fit demonstration of legitimate interest in HR and knowledge of employment law issues into a resume/online application form? 

2. How can I overcome the issue of attorney stigma/skepticism ? 

3. What else can I be doing/should I be doing? 

Any help would be so appreciated. I am really trying to soak up as much as I can.

3cpldf,15,2015-07-09,I recently accepted a fulltime position...but now Intel is interested in me. What do I do?,Hackstatic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cpldf/i_recently_accepted_a_fulltime_positionbut_now/,"I interned at a company for five months and really loved it. They made me an offer and I accepted it. I'm blessed to be making $70,000 a year doing something I love with amazing people, all before graduating. However, Intel just reached out to me. They liked my resume and two of the leads are interested in interviewing me for a 6-12 month internship. 

Would it be foolish to reject the interview? Would it be foolish to entertain the idea? I love where I work and see room for a lot of growth, so the only reason I'm asking is because Intel is a world-class company. Would I learn more and quicker at Intel? Is it despicable to even plan for an interview with another company if it means leaving my current job after only a month or two? 

I would have to relocate to California and I'd be making less than I make now. But if a long internship with Intel is worth turning my back on great pay in a great location with an awesome company, should I interview with them? I'm still working on my undergrad so I would be in Intel's undergrad internship. I would likely need to pay for housing, which I currently don't do as I live with my parents. Meaning, the $70,000 here is a lot more than the average $28 per hour I'd be making in California. More importantly, I am sure I will learn a lot here. Is Intel a big enough opportunity to learn more and become better faster that I should consider interviewing, or is learning fast mostly up to how much I do on my own?

I love where I work right now, and after five months I still enjoy coming to work every day. I am being paid to learn! How cool is that? So should I realize that the grass is not greener on the other side, or is Intel a better bet than a mid-sized company if I want to become a world-class developer and if I want to secure greater financial freedom over the next ten years? Is this opportunity a once in a lifetime thing or can I suggest that I'd like the interview with Intel down the road, perhaps when I'm doing my Master's degree?"

First off, let me apologise about the vague title, it's kind of hard to summarize this in a single sentence, but I guess this is the goal I want to achieve.

To get straight to the point I'm looking for ways to remain calm during social (verbal) conversations. I've never really been shy in my youth and loved making new friends and so forth and was always rather calm when socializing but for the past four years that I've suffered from a depression, I've become the opposite of that. I've become self-absorbed and sort of scared of talking to people, which is not how I've pictured myself as a 21 year adult. Man I'm even a little bit scared of posting this. 

I've been trying to improve in the last few months, especially since I've been on an internship and wanted to come off as a normal/stable person, but it just reminded me of how out of touch I am socially (and unstable). I've had moments where I'm talking to a colleague and just freeze up in the middle of a conversation and starting to panick. I basically just try to end the conversation quickly and go back to work, which I figure leaves a bit of a weird impression.


But the weird thing is that not every day is like that (though most is), atleast lately. I wake up feeling.. happy I guess? And I'm also maintaining a calm mind with people, thus not panicking. But these days occur quite rarely unfortunatly and this is why I'm here.

What I'm seeking advice with is how I can train my mind. I want to remain calm in said situations and stop being afraid and being more.. happy.

I hope this all makes some chronological sense, as I'm not in the most sober condition right now, but this is me laying my heart out and searching for advice on how to improve myself.

In any case, thank you for reading and I hope someone has some good advice for me."

I'm a rising junior computer engineering major from WVU. So while my school isn't bad with respect to engineering it probably isn't going to do me many favors in and of itself. I'm looking for more than ""get good grades"" and so forth. I want to know what companies like Google really look for in terms of qualities and actual experience. It would be my dream to work for Google someday in some capacity and I'm going to apply for internships there but I mainly bring them up in this post because of how competitive those positions are (Microsoft, Apple, etc. would all be good examples). 

I can read articles on this stuff from various websites but what I'd like to see is some input from people with personal experience whether it be as a student landing a competitive internship or someone who is a part of the screening process for one. 

And one last thing. I'm aware that there's more to the world than these companies and that smaller companies can offer great experiences. I have nothing against smaller businesses at all and will most likely end up working on one. But my interest in this instance is mainly how to stand out amongst thousands of applicants at a time. 


I look forward to some good input :)

Now, i don't want to be a nurse, pretty sure. In fact i wanted to go to nursing, work for years and transition to the programming side of health technology. Truth be told, CS is probably a better avenue for something like that.

I'm just wondering.. where do i start? i know i need to learn code, C++, Java, Python. So where do i begin? and what else? i know CS is a math based class, i've only taken calc 1 (got a B) and truth be told im not a genius at math but im not enormously bad either.

So where do i begin? I learn code, then i go for volunteering right? Open source projects? internships?

In terms of weedout classes i've even taken O-Chem, which i know isn't similiar to CS but darn you O-chem was easy for me and everyone says its supposed to be hard! So let me keep my pride!

I've been browsing reddit and google like a hawk so i've only picked up a few things here or there, and now im wondering if i could get some answers from you awesome people.

Should i take the dual degree program? (and add about 2-3 years on my college years) or just graduate with a CS degree. Does it truly benefit me enough?"

3cr73g,1,2015-07-09,How do I report my shady boss for hiring me under the table?,Tiredretiredtech,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3cr73g/how_do_i_report_my_shady_boss_for_hiring_me_under/,"//*TLDR*// My evasive boss hired me under the table for two weeks with the promise of getting on the payroll as of today. I was let go instead and I would like to know how to pay taxes on this income and how to report him to the proper authorities.//*TLDR*//

So I was interning as a technician for free for about 4 months at *ComputerStoreA*. It was a good shop, run by experienced technicians and generally good people. I learned a lot and had a lot of support.

One day, however, I go to work and find the shop was sold out to a local competitor, *ComputerStoreB.* Apparently *ComputerStoreA* was close to going under. *OwnerA* was now just a supervisor while *OwnerB* would manage both stores.

One of my coworker's was fired, and another quit in protest. Both had worked with *OwnerB* previously, and both had major falling outs. 

I was allowed to continue my internship, but I was moved over to *ComputerStoreB*. I continued hoping the strong recommendations from my coworkers would be enough to get me hired. I was handed a key to *ComputerStoreB* and mostly ran the store all alone.

After a week and a half of *OwnerB* avoiding the issue of my hiring, I finally got him to talk to me. 

He said would hire me at $10 / hour in the fall, but would train me at $8 / hour under the table. I told him that being paid under the table was unacceptable, and that I needed to have verifiable taxed income. 

He considered this and told me he would work me for 2 weeks off the payroll, then hire me on at $9 / hour on the payroll. I figured I could afford to pay the taxes on 2 weeks of pay myself if that worked out.

*OwnerB* turned out to be a terrible bully of a manager. He wanted to micromanage every detail of the store, but was never physically present.

I was never given a proper training, and the only rare help came from *OwnerB*'s son and the former *OwnerA* swinging by from time to time. 

*OwnerB* became increasingly frustrated with me over the last two weeks, as I never did work the way he would have done it.

I did my best to follow his instructions, which were frequently unclear and usually unhelpful for the situation. Sometimes he would ask me to do things that were totally irrelevant to a customer's situation, like check the condition of a hard drive when a customer had network problems. 

The quality of the work he asked me to do was far inferior to what I learned at *ComputerStoreA*, and he charged over twice as much for the poor technical repair.

I was seriously considering leaving for more ethical and legal work, and was about to confront my boss today about getting onto payroll. Right before I get up the nerve to talk to him, he tells me he is letting me go, that he needs someone who will call him every time a customer enters the store or any situation changes in the slightest.

I leave the store with my stuff. Later, he calls asking me to bring back the key to the store.

I ask if he will pay me for my last week of work when I go by, and he says to come to the store. I ask him again whether he is paying me when I come in, and he shouts at me to come to the store and hangs up.

I go to the store with a friend. *OwnerB* is not there, but his son is. I ask to be paid, his son says *OwnerB* mentioned nothing about it. I told him I explicitly asked about being paid before coming in. 

He gets *OwnerB* on the phone, who then offers to pay me tomorrow. Knowing how *OwnerB* has a tendency of avoiding people who he owes money, my friend recommends that I leave with the key so I have leverage to get paid. *OwnerB* threatens to call the police on me. I told him to go ahead, knowing its an empty threat.

Despite all this, I don't expect to be paid, and I will likely just return the key tomorrow to *OwnerA* instead. I do want to report *OwnerB* for hiring me this way though. I know he's done this to other people, like my former coworkers. I may be able to get them to report him as well.

I live in Tennessee in the US, if anyone knows any specific details on how this situation should be handled.

* Engineering already has its own rigorous course-load, will I be screwing myself over (health-wise especially) by adding additional classes?

* Will double majoring significantly reduce my ability to join clubs and/or internships and such because of the additional classes and possible summer courses?

* Any advice to prevent any limitations such as the ones mentioned above?

I need some help figuring out what to do with my life. Up until recently I had a pretty concrete path laid out. I just graduated with a degree in engineering in May, and I'm all set to start pursuing a PhD at a top institution in the fall. However, at the start of the summer I had an amazing internship opportunity come up in a completely unrelated field (business). Although I had very little interest in business at the time, I was currently looking for a summer job, so I took it. Now, two months in, I've been offered a full time position and I'm considering taking it. Here's why:

- The particular industry that the job is in is incredibly small and difficult to get into. A total of 8 people work in my office, including me. This is one of the reasons I'm being so vague. It is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
- Along those same lines, the job pays more than I could ever make elsewhere, certainly as an engineer. As in middle six figures within a few years. 
- The job is where I ultimately want to live. I was planning on moving in a month to start grad school with the goal of moving back after I finish. With this job I'd get to stay. 
- I thoroughly enjoy the work and the company. I can't imagine finding better people to work with and the work is varied and interesting. 
- The job involves a good amount of travel, which I currently love. I understand that travel gets old for many people after several years, but the travel is not excessive either. Maybe a trip every 1-2 months. 
- I can see myself doing this job for a long time
- I believe that this job would give me the balance I want in life. Despite the incredibly high pay, the hours aren't outrageous. 40-50 hours a week is pretty typical based on my experience this summer, and everyone at the company values balance. I'll be able to lead a fulfilling life outside of work. 

On the other hand, I didn't have my heart set on pursuing a PhD in engineering for nothing:

- I've been involved in research for over 6 years now and it really is my passion. I'm incredibly curious, I love to learn, and I do not feel that I've reached my full potential after finishing my undergraduate education. I know that there's so much more for me to learn, and I think I might almost feel incomplete if I don't get a PhD
- Besides my own interests, it's always been very important to me to help others, and I believe that obtaining  a PhD will allow me to do this very effectively, as my research interests lie in the medical field. As such, I feel that I have the ability to directly improve the lives of a significant number of people through my research. In comparison, the job that I'm considering only helps people indirectly at best. 
- I thoroughly consider myself a scientist and I have been set on pursuing a career in science my whole life. My math and data analysis skills are the only tools from my science education that I would get to apply if I take the job. 

So that's where I am. I feel that the job offers me a clear path to almost everything I want in life, but as a trade off I will not be pursuing my passion or helping others in the way I'd like to. Of course, I'm still very young and I know I could go back to grad school if I take the job and change my mind in a few years. However, I don't believe this is a great plan, as:

- This job offer comes from a small, tight knit company because they want me to become a part of the team for the long term. This offer was not made lightly and, should I chose to take it, I need to be serious about staying out of respect to them.
- I will be seriously screwing my PhD advisor and I will definitely not be able to go to the school I'm currently planning on attending. My advisor is banking on having me next year, has allocated funds for me, and likely rejected other students in favour of me. Essentially, I'll be burning a bridge with my number one advisor choice.

On the other hand, I will likely not be able to change my mind later should I reject the job offer. And to reiterate, this industry is remarkably difficult to get into. It's essentially a miracle that I've been offered this job, especially considering my background, and I sincerely doubt anything like it will ever come up again. So either decision I make I am necessarily closing a door. What do I do? 

***
**tl;dr:** I think grad school is the right path for me, but I've been offered an incredible job that I know I like which provides a clear path to the life I want. What do I do?

I just moved to a new town for a summer internship where I have a lot of responsibility (project management type role). It requires talking to people, getting answers, and running meetings (without much support/guidance). All of these responsibilities cause me to get anxious, and i'm finding it harder and harder to talk to people. It's gotten to the point where I have a hard time giving a confident ""good morning."" If a coworker starts a conversation with me, I start sweating and get all tongue tied. 

Last weekend I had a pretty severe panic attack. I was drunk with friends in a club, I got separated from the group. It think a combination of the alcohol, large amount of people, and loud music that freaked me out. I was in tears and had to push my way out of the night club. This really scared me. I'm starting to feel like i'm broken and I know I need to seek professional help.

Given that I only have ~5weeks left in this town, should I seek professional help here or wait to get home? Where do I start?

I want to email her now, but I don’t know what to say. And how I should explain my disappearance…. What advice do you guys have for me?…I’m not sure if this was the right place to put this, but its worth a try…I’m such an idiot. I just want to stop feeling so guilty and thinking I ruined my future in getting other lab jobs.

3csny4,9,2015-07-10,[UK] Salary negotiations at entry level?,Lonely_Seeker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3csny4/uk_salary_negotiations_at_entry_level/,"So I’m not leaning either way with any expectations just seeking some objective information.

Salary negotiations are spoken about a lot on this sub, are they a thing in the UK at an entry level or is it just standard practice you take what is offered?

Some background:

* Will have both a BSc (Mathematics with economics) and MSc in Computer Science when I graduate.

* 2 Internships under my belt, one at a front end web Development Company and another at a big trading Company in central London.

It’s looking likely (touch wood) I should have an offer from the second mentioned internship for when I graduate and I was wondering if I can think about negotiating, to be honest I’m not too fussed as I think the offer will be more than generous anyway and it’s a great environment to learn in but still I am quite curious.

3csrad,142,2015-07-10,"I worked for 500 dollars a month for a startup founder, including weekends, for two months and when I left he started badmouthing me to the friend who recommended him. What do I do?",OceansOnPluto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3csrad/i_worked_for_500_dollars_a_month_for_a_startup/,"Long story short, a friend recommended me for a job with his friend. His friend just got into a startup accelerator on an idea and needed someone to build his product for him. I met with him, and he said that he would give me a two month ""trial"" period where I would work for him for a 500 dollar stipend a month and at the end of it he would decide if he wanted to hire me. I shouldn't have taken it, but I trusted the original friend and I did.

It was hell. I ended up building for him a cross platform mobile app in angular and ionic (an ios framework), a backend api to serve content to the app, an admin view, twitter integration, custom oath (off the shelf gems with OATH wouldn't work with ionic, for some reason, so I had to roll my own version), auto embedding posts (the thing in facebook where you paste in a link and the content will embed), inline hashtags, and a bunch of other things.

I know this sounds like a lot...because it was. I had to work nights and weekends to get it all done. It killed me. I worked an overnighter once (that was the oath thing). I was the sole engineer, although there was an unpaid ""intern"" doing real work about halfway in. To be honest I also am massively insecure about my work (I was a dev bootcamp graduate and ønly have about a year of professional experience) and I push myself really, really hard to learn as much as I can. But I'm being honest, it ended up being spaghetti code because after a while there were so many features being added at the last minute. 

For instance there wasn't originally supposed to be a mobile app. It was supposed to be a website and two weeks in he decided he wants a mobile app. I would have built the rails app differently had I known that's what he wanted. If I knew he really wanted a mobile app, I would have never taken the job because I had never used Ionic or objective-c before, so I had to devote extra time to learning it. I kept saying he need to refactor but everytime he just wanted to add more features and it became like a JENGA tower.

So about 6 weeks in I've had it and I give my two week notice since it was pretty clear they weren't going to be funded by the time the weeks ended. He's all smiles and says you have a recommendation from me. Two weeks go by. On the very last day, he takes a look at my code for the first time in a couple weeks, and says ""There's stuff here that shouldn't be here"". There were a couple of bugs, I think some were documented and some weren't. He asked me to work a couple of extra days and said I was leaving them in the lurch. I took offense to that, because I was really burnt out at this point and I needed to get another job that paid me real money. 

Long story short, we argued and he said ""No one is saying you didn't work hard, but there's stuff in this code that shouldn't be there."" And asked me to work a couple more days for him from home. The next day we talked again and I told him I couldn't do it and again he was all smiles and kept going on about his reputation and asked if I thought I was being taken advantage of. I did, but I kept my mouth shut and I thought we left on good terms.

Two weeks later I get an angry message from our mutual friend telling me that his friend told him the code was subpar and he honestly didn't want to recommend me to someone again, and that I should square it with him because he would be a great connection. 

I know I did good work. I worked nights and weekends, and gave him every feature he wanted within 2 months, often at the last minute. I worked an all nighter. I accomplished a lot in a short time period and I did it for only 500 dollars a month. I gave him everything he wanted. It was utter hell and it took great personal cost and now someone is badmouthing me? 

They're both (he and the startup founder) really good friends, and I've only known this guy for a year. What on earth do I say to him. I can't badmouth his friend but I want to tell the truth.  I don't want to lose my friendship with him, because he's a great guy, but he's really close with the startup founder.

Edit: I really appreciate all the encouragement here. I don't think I'm going to sue him, but it's good to know I'm not completely and utterly crazy and I really was mistreated. "
3css2b,1,2015-07-10,TIFU by Flipping the Bird to an Angry Driver,Just_in78,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3css2b/tifu_by_flipping_the_bird_to_an_angry_driver/,"Some background first:

*I'm 18 and I work in an office, the same place as my mom, and recently got promoted to ""intern"" status or something like that, after working out in the connected plant last year and doing good work. I moved up upon recommendation from my mom, and the fact that I have 4 years engineering experience from highschool.*


Alright, so the place I work at has a lot of construction going on nearby (Michigan roads are awful), major road is cut down to 2 lanes from 4, lots of annoyed drivers, construction barrels litter the horizon for miles, etc. 

Me, my mom, and an older coworker named Ed decide to go to Mr. Pita for some delicious all you can eat pizza and other food for lunch, and all squeeze into his little sedan and have quite a pleasant time stuffing our faces. The traffic was bad getting there, but no biggie. 1 Hour lunch breaks are awesome! 

The lunch rush traffic is even worse on the way back, but I'm just chilling on reddit in the back seat with a full belly, and we cut through the parking lot of a movie theatre to get closer to the turnaround required of our route. No one wants to let us out, and a rather annoyed looking Latino man behind us in a dark lifted truck pulls up behind us and starts honking at Ed. 

Now Ed Is a bit old, but he's not elderly and doesn't drive like he is either. This Latino man, who we'll refer to as LM over the next thirty seconds, proceeds to get angrier and honk more, and constantly over the next 30 seconds, while ed is receiving no breaks in the traffic to pull out. The traffic is moving, but maybe 5-10 mph. 

After a great deal of honking, I am pulled out of my little world and look up from phone and back at LM in his truck, and he's PISSED. Hitting his steering wheel, yelling, the whole 9 yards. I'm feeling a bit more courageous than my normal shy self and stick up my middle finger at him like any reasonable person would do to someone acting like an asshole, and his fury boils over as he flips one back and proceeds to visibly freak out. I just happily go back to reddit, relishing in the enjoyment of annoying him and laughing at his uncalled for fury towards my buddy ed. 

We finally get a break in traffic and we pull out and right into the turnaround behind a couple of cars to wait for the light, when suddenly I hear yelling. LM has pulled out too, floored his brakes in the middle of slowly moving traffic, opened his window, and is incomprehensibly  and loudly yelling at me! Of the constant stream of words and heavy accent, I make out some of the words, and he said something along the lines of:

**""I'LL F#&amp;$ING KILL YOU KID! DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN, I'LL KICK YOUR ASS YOU LITTLE SHIT! GET OUT RIGHT F%&amp;@ING NOW AND I'LL TEAR YOUR F$#&amp;ING EYES OUT!""**

He shows no sign of relenting and continues yelling and threatening, and with a better view of him, LM looks like he is in his later 20's, a large man, and his attire is similar to that of a stereotypical tough guy criminal with a black bandanna on. Maybe he's on steroids? If his truck had a sunroof, I'm pretty sure steam would be pouring out. 

I sink back in my seat, rather scared and hoping this ends soon, and also hoping he doesn't pull a gun out or something. The car is silent, and after what felt like decades the light changes and we pull out of there, LM zooming away to catch up with the half a mile of traffic that cleared out in front of him while he was threatening me, and us escaping the situation unframed.

Ed lectured me a few moments later on the fact that there are a lot of crazy people out there, and when he was a kid someone with road rage pulled a revolver on him and his buddies and started shooting after they taunted the man, but they floored it and escaped unharmed. My mom was rather calm, but a bit shaken up. 

*__Tl:Dr- Was coming back to work after carpooling to Mr. Pita for lunch break during work and stuck my middle finger up through the backseat to an asshole being mean to my coworker, and the man flipped out, stopped in moving traffic after we pulled out into a turnaround, and threatened to beat the shit out of me and kill me.__*"
3ctchu,16,2015-07-10,Recently accepted an offer into a PhD program...I think I may have made a mistake. Should I go to grad school?,Academic_throw_away,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3ctchu/recently_accepted_an_offer_into_a_phd_programi/,"I'm having a bit of an existential crisis. Do you think grad school is right for me?


Backstory: I am a 29 year old male. In short, it took me a while to get my life together, so at this point I have a collection of internship experiences, and 1 year experience as a software developer working in computational biology, high performance computing, and visualization. I applied to several great programs in computational biology/human genetics because I am interested in those sorts of problems and I wanted to see if I could get in. I was offered admission into an ivy league program in computational biology that is top 10 in my particular interest. I was of course ecstatic to be extended an offer and I accepted. 


I am now having second thoughts, however. For one, I work in silicon valley as a software developer. I would be forgoing quite a bit of money, and a PhD (and possibly even a masters) wouldn't give me a great return on my investment. Second, I am becoming more aware of my age. By the time I would finish a PhD i would be ~35 (My program does have a ""papers option"", so I might be able to earn a PhD in ~3 years, but I think it is unwise to plan on that time-frame), and I would have nothing to show for it.  I don't even own a car right now. This is not something that I am personally bothered by, but this is such a concern to other people in their life that I am worried I am being naive and will regret forgoing all the money and assets I would accrue over the period I would be in grad school. And that would be all well and good if I could feel secure about my opportunities after grad school, but if I were to continue into academia I wouldn't even be looking at a TT job until I was ~40, which compounds all these problems, and I make more now as a software developer than a computational biologists makes, and feel like I would be closing the door or many software development jobs due to being ""over educated"" and due to age discrimination (I have read it is particularly bad in tech). 


On the other hand, I do enjoy computational biology and I think the research topics I would be working on would be fascinating. All of my friends who are in/have be in grad school tell me that due to my personality and interests I would love grad school and would really excel.  I worry that it would be unethical to drop out of the program before I even began. For one because the professors I have been in contact with have more or less invested in me already, and I am taking up a spot that someone else could have had in my place.


I guess my question is: what advice would you give someone in my position? "
3ctkn0,1,2015-07-10,Does being good at solving algorithmic problems translate into being a good programmer in the context of software development?,bassdeepdownlow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ctkn0/does_being_good_at_solving_algorithmic_problems/,"I'm a recent CS graduate and doing a summer internship. I've learned a decent amount about good programming practices and software design, but there are still gaps in my knowledge that I'd like to fill in. 

I'm looking for a full-time software engineering job at other companies, but due to my schedule I only have about 2-3 hours of spare time during weekday nights to prepare for technical interviews. I'm focused entirely on studying algorithms and practicing algorithmic problem solving, with a little bit of design/good practices studying. But I'd like to know if the algorithmic problem solving skills that I'm attaining during the preparation for technical interviews will benefit me at all once I become a full-time engineer and have to develop software applications."

3ctvdq,1,2015-07-10,Leaving an internship early.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ctvdq/leaving_an_internship_early/,"CS student entering senior year of college. Recently landed an internship with a company close with the city. The interns can stay until they graduate, then they have to leave.


The old batch of interns are leaving, and I'm the newest recruit. I've been here since May 2015. They've been showing me the ropes and teaching me how to handle the systems department of the city.



Honestly thought the position would involve a lot of development, but its 90% IT work and I'm pretty unhappy, especially for the bad pay for being in the heart of LA ($15/hour).



Anyways, back when I was searching for this job carpet-bombed my resume everywhere, and I may have a much better internship available at a big 4. 



I feel like my supervisor is depending on me to be the next ""go-to"" guy since everyone else is about to leave, but I might be leaving only after 2-3 months. 

Anyone have any advice?"

I will be finished with my degree in a year and looking for part-time/on call work in between that would possibly lead to full-time work after graduation.


In my undergraduate years at Virginia Commonwealth University studying Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry, I have conducted an EEG research study on the effects of binaural beats technology utilizing software including MATLAB and Brain-Computer Interface custom software.  Before I entered graduate school, I have worked for an e-Discovery company in DC as electronic media specialist, where I produce data reports using software to law firm clients to guide them on eliminating excess e-Discovery data, saving them thousands of dollars in the process.  I am a quick learner in utilizing software as I have classroom and project experience; at the e-Discovery company, I learned how to utilize Tableau without supervision and produced detailed and accurate reports within short deadlines.  In addition to MATLAB and Tableau, I have also worked with LabVIEW in a project setting.


I am also looking for research analyst position, either in a law firm setting or a private research company.  After graduating VCU, I entered an internship with PSK Marketing, where I received patent searching skills training from a Biotechnology Project Manager at the US Patent Office.


Last but not least, I have extensive laboratory work experience as an Organic Chemistry Lab instructor in Richmond, VA where I worked under Dr. Gevork Minaskanian in teaching students lab safety skills and advanced organic chemistry techniques including IR, NMR, distillation, and chromatography.  I have also interned for a pharmaceuticals company in one summer managing an extensive inventory of more than 12,000 bottles of chemicals.


I believe that my unique background and work experience has made me a quick learner and a motivated team-player.  If given the opportunity, my maturity and skill sets would help me to contribute to my organization's growth. 


Please do not hesitate to write me a private message to discuss further my qualifications.

I just came back from an interview that I absolutely bombed, this is the 3rd interview in the past year that I have royally screwed up in.

I think I'm a decent programmer, I work for a tech giant (not that it means anything as I was hired from intern to full time) and I'm able to get my stories and features in. But it seems that when it comes to interviews I get absolutely braindead and can't think. 

I've been studying data structures and algorithms extensively but for the most part these questions havent been asked in my interviews, they've been of the 'render a chessboard' or 'given this data set of stock prices, find the optimal sell price' variety. I don't know how to prepare for these 'write x that does y' questions and I'm getting pretty discouraged (EDIT: 'Write x that does y' is LITERALLY MY JOB). Are there any sources or books that I can turn to?

What do I do?",159456753,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3cucfk/i_will_graduate_in_two_years_i_will_probably_not/,"I graduated last year with a degree that I apparently can't get a job with. I've always had an interest in programming, so I decided to start a BSc in Computer Science (software engineering focus) in January. Because I already have a bachelor's degree, I can finish this degree in the space of two years. So, in May of 2017, I'll have my second degree.

I tried to get an internship for this summer, but because this was a pretty sudden change in my life I really don't have much to point to, and my transcripts indicate that I am still (technically) in the first year of my degree. I also don't have much in the way of projects to show, because before I started this I only made small crappy programs that aren't worth showing off, and after I only have like two projects -- one in Java, one in C++ -- that I never update because I'm too busy with other things, so I feel like they're barely worth putting on my resume. Ultimately, I applied for 30 internships and never received a single call. 

With regards to my work history, I've only had experience in various retail jobs to pay for school, and a single half-year research position for my previous degree, which has very little relevance to CS. I expect that my problems in getting an internship will probably carry over to next year. Though I will try to get an internship if I can, it seems unlikely that I'll get one. And I cannot append an extra year to my degree as I simply can't afford it. 

So my question is, what can I do to make sure I actually have a reasonable chance of getting a job once I graduate? "
3cucq8,43,2015-07-10,It Started With Little Things and Quickly Got Worse.,dystopia82,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3cucq8/it_started_with_little_things_and_quickly_got/,"It started right after I moved in. Little things happened on my first few nights sleeping there. Scratching in the walls, pictures I’d hung that day falling off the wall, the smell of cigarette smoke wafting through rooms when I didn’t smoke. Nothing I couldn’t explain away as rats, or improper hanging techniques, or an inconsiderate neighbor who didn’t take too the buildings no smoking policy.


Right around the one week mark though, things got worse. The scratching in the walls continued but started to be accompanied by the sounds of footsteps in my hallway. The first time it happened I actually grabbed the baseball bat from under my bed and investigated the noise. I was terrified, I genuinely thought someone was in my apartment. Yet, when I opened the door to my bedroom and looked around I saw nothing. I searched the whole place on shaking legs, convinced that some masked lunatic was going to come popping out of a dark corner. In the end though all I found was that I lived in an apartment without a whole lot of hiding places.


Every night that week I heard footsteps in my hallway. After my third time getting out of bed I did my best to say it was some trick of the acoustics. I convinced myself that it must be a neighbor walking around and somehow the sound seemed like it was coming from my place. The whole “acoustics” bullshit argument may have worked too, had it not been for what happened next.


After a week in the apartment I decided to go out with some friends. I figured if I got drunk enough, I wouldn't be kept up all night due to the noises. After a few games of pool and some conversations with a pretty girl or two, I forgot all about my creepy apartment. After last call I stumbled home. I collapsed in my bed and was over taken by the peaceful darkness that is drunken slumber.


I woke up around noon to the scent of coffee and cigarettes. I hoped the sick feeling in my stomach was because of a hangover, but I knew that is was from the fear that had settled in my foggy brain. Had the masked lunatic broken in and...made me coffee? I mustered up the courage to investigate (and grabbed my baseball bat) and walked in the kitchen. Tendrils of smoke danced in the air above the table where a single cup of coffee sat. I told myself that I must have made it in my drunken stupor before falling asleep. But the cup was hot and the coffee had cream in it. I drink mine black with sugar.


I walked over to the nearly full pot of coffee and poured myself a cup. I sat at the table, opposite of the other cup and took a sip. I watched as the smoke dissipated. I tried to make sense of the situation but was interrupted by another picture falling off the wall. Where the picture had hung were the words “Today is going to be a great day!” scratched into the plaster.


A dizzying confusion took hold of me. For a while my mind raced as I was desperately tried to pin a logical expiation to the strange events surrounding my apartment. Was some freak really breaking in, or was it my neighbor – Ted the jackass – having a coffee and smoke in my kitchen? After all, he quickly learned how much I hated the smell. No, that couldn’t have been it, after all the walls weren’t that thin (despite hearing the young couple across the hall make love every night). Not to mention my doors were always locked – I had the only key. Maybe I could have been losing my mind, or maybe I’d become a smoking, baby coffee drinking maniac in a drunken stupor. However that didn’t seem like me --- it was honestly very unlikely. Then it dawned on me… maybe, just maybe… instead of putting the events off on everything and everyone else, there was actually something wrong.


Despite being scared shitless, I knew that I had obligations and my work shift was only an hour away. Oddly enough, while I got dressed nothing abnormal occurred, however the calmness of that afternoon put me on edge. I grabbed my car keys and phone off the hutch and sprinted for the front door – I wasn’t going to let something get the drop on me. When I got to the door and reached a shaking hand for the doorknob a strange sense overcame me. I knew I was right, something really was wrong and my worst fear had come true. I flung the door open with the baseball at the ready to confront the snarling and feral minded intruder I’d been imagining, but I wasn’t prepared what really lay ahead.



I never subscribed to the whole ‘paranormal activities really happen’ thing, but as I stared into the open doorway I started to believe. “There’s no such thing as supernatural, Arron, it’s just a silly concept” I comforted myself by saying… but boy was I wrong. Instead of seeing a run-down hallway, I found myself staring into the bedroom I just dressed in. It felt like it was in a real life horror movie, complete with the flickering lights, bricked off windows, and the feeling of ice running through my veins. “What the fuck?” I shouted at the top of my lungs, “Am I taking fucking crazy pills?” Nearly passing out from fear, I closed the door and spun around to get a good look at the kitchen and the living room, but there was nothing except for a dark and never ending hallway. Realizing I needed to call for help I quickly I pulled out my phone and sent a group text. Within seconds every last one of my ‘friends’ responded, “The day’s just begun, and how great has it been? We’ll see you soon!”



“This can’t be happening, this can’t be happening!” I kept saying to myself, but I knew I had to act fast or I felt as if something horrible was about to happen. Staying in the same spot screaming to myself wasn’t a valid solution to these troubling problems, I had a choice to make: the bedroom or the hallway. It took every bit of willpower I had left… but I made my choice, and I’ve spent the past few days regretting my decision.



I put my back against the door, stared into the hazy non-end of the hallway in front of me and pictured the bedroom - my bedroom - that was my other option. From the vantage I had through the door, of the side of the bed I tended to avoid because it was pied with clothes and the bathroom door to my right, I had to have been looking from my closet door. I ran the scene back in my mind, closing my eyes. No, there was no other door. I could have ended up trapped in my bedroom.



I hefted the bat in my right hand, choking up on the slick, veneered wood to prepare myself for an easier one-handed blow. My left hand found my phone again and unlocked the screen. The manic-sounding texts stared me down, seeming to laugh at me. Taunting me like lifers in prison to which I had just been sentenced. I angrily clicked through to the home screen, seeing an empty signal bar and a full battery.



I took a deep breath, relaxed my shoulders down my sides to accentuate the broadness of my build, and walked down the hallway as menacingly as I could. A scene from the Warriors came to mind and started beating the end of my bat against the wall as I stalked forward. It wasn't a milk bottle, but it might do the trick. I walked. Walked. Took a short rest. Walked some more. I kept checking my signal strength, hoping to find a zone that would allow me to dial out in this hyper-hallway of Hell. Nothing. The only change on my screen was my dwindling battery. I had no idea exactly how long I walked, but it felt like half a day. I kept walking. I can't say exactly when, but at some point, passing the thousandth or so bricked-up window, the fear that had been steadily dripping away from me like fat from a rotisserie chicken coalesced into a palpable anger. When I realized I had definitely missed work and would likely be fired - just because of someone's dumbass idea of a joke - I lost it.



""Fuck personal property!"" I screamed into the hallway, not noticing at the time that there was no echo. I don't mean it didn't echo like the chasm it was, I mean it sounded like I was shouting in a well-insulated recording studio.



I slammed my bat into the red bricks that filled the void that had, once, been a window. Red dust puffed off the surface as a small layer of the old brick was pulverized with my blow. The shock of the impact moved down the length of the bat and shook my hands, painfully.



""Who are you?"" I shouted, hitting the bricks again.



""What the fuck,"" another blow, ""do you want?""



As my questions went unanswered, my speech devolved in a grunting heave of breath each time my bat connected with the bricks. They were breaking, pieces shattering off. Foamy saliva dripped from my lips. I had ceased to be Arron. I was Arron's vengeance. Whoever put me in this fucking maze, this god forsaken labyrinth would pay when I got out.



And then the bat began to crack. I didn't yield. I should have. The fucking thing shattered in my hands, exploding with a loud snap and shooting inch- and two inch-long splinters into my palms. I shouted with rage and kicked the bricks. I was almost through!



""You better give it a rest, lover.""



I looked over my right shoulder, spittle hanging from my lip, blood dripping from my hands.



""Who the fuck are you?"" I asked, my voice a phlegmy growl.



""What are you talking about? I made coffee. Come sit down."" I walked toward the tall, thin redhead who stood in the doorway, doing my best to appear outwardly calm. Inside, my brain shrieked with confusion. I wanted to drop to my knees and shout until the roof of the hallway fell in on me. Or until I passed out from lack of oxygen. Something - anything - to release the knotted tension that felt as though it was contorting every muscle in my body, from my forehead to my pinky toe.



The redhead walked through the door, back into my kitchen, and sat down in front of her heavily creamed coffee. The morning sunlight shining on her from the window back-illuminated her already sheer camisole and, though I was injured, confused, and enraged... I was still a straight man. I traced the outline of her shoulder downward until my gaze fell upon her unrestrained breast. The look in her eye seemed to know what I was thinking. The way she sipped her coffee was so feminine, so sensual, that my knees grew weak. A wave of pleasure rolled from my chest to my thighs. She really was beautiful.



""What's going on?"" I asked, my voice closer to its normal pitch. ""Answers,"" she sighed. ""Everybody wants answers. I tell them, they use their knowledge to leave, and I'm stuck here alone. For eternity, Arron.""



""Don't you want to stay with me, Arron? What's wrong with me?"" she asked, distraught.



I put a hand out to comfort her, twinging slightly as my ripped flesh came into contact with her arm.



""I just want to know what's going on.""



Suddenly, the world exploded into a high-pitched digital buzzing. I threw my palms to my ears to block out the sound, but it grew louder. The redhead looked deep into my eyes and said, ""Time to wake up.""



And then I awoke, in my bed. I was 45 minutes late for work. I told myself all that hallway bullshit had been nothing more than the strangest dream I'd ever had. As I walked to my car, I started to believe that was true.



And then my hands hit the steering wheel and shot angry agony up my forearms and beyond. I looked at my palms, still swollen, red, and bleeding slightly from the fucking baseball bat. It wasn't a dream.



That night I stayed in a hotel. My bandaged hands wrapped around a bottle of whiskey as I tried to decide what to do about the situation. Many people would just move out, but I didn’t have the money to move again so soon. I hoped a night away from that place would clear my head enough to think of where I was going to go from there; failing that I hoped the whiskey would cloud my head enough that I just wouldn’t give a shit.



About a half bottle down I realized it was likely going to be the latter.



I was exhausted though and crawled on top of the shitty hotel sheets still wearing all of my clothes. I closed my eyes hoping I would just drift away into the sweet, sweet, void of nothing. A nice long dreamless sleep. I needed it, I felt as if the night before I actually hadn’t slept at all. Hell, for all I knew I hadn’t. I let my body sink into the hotel mattress as best I could and started to feel like I was drifting away. I mumbled things to myself that I can’t remember - perhaps in that moment I even knew the answers to my problems – though that seems pretty unlikely considering my state. Just before sleep took me though I was greeted by an all too familiar smell. The smell of fresh coffee…



My eyes snapped open and I felt so disgustingly sober that I wanted to cry. I prayed I had just blacked out so hard that it felt like time travel, I prayed that I had slept through the night and when I sat up I was going to be looking at a rising sun outside of the window of a shitty hotel. I knew though, I knew before I lifted my head from that stiff, stained mattress what I was going to see. As I sat up and let my eyes focus to the darkness of the room around me my fears came to life. I was back in my apartment. The door to my bedroom standing wide open and urging me to re-enter that god damn hallway.



I let out a scream, not of fear but of frustration. I leapt out of my bed, nearly tripping over a pile of clothes as I did. I was ready to storm into the hallway and find her, find the red headed woman and make her tell me how to make this all end. She had said I could use my knowledge to get out and I intended to find out exactly what she meant.



“Where the fuck are you!?” I screamed at the top of my lungs. “Tell me what’s happening here! Tell me why I can’t leave!”



I stepped out into the hallway, looking left and right down seemingly never ending corridors trying to find the direction of the kitchen. I knew she was there, I could smell her damn overly creamed coffee. I made my choice and walked out into the hall but before I could pick a direction to go…I saw someone standing to my right.



This was no slender red head woman either. It was a man, large, heavy set. Nothing but an outline except for his mangled features, lit only by the burning cherry of a cigarette stuck between his lips. As I approached the kitchen the man became clearer to me. His face looked like it had been ripped apart. I could see tears stream down his reddened and scarred face. He babbled incoherently as he paced the room. A mix of emotions welled in me. His tears filled me with grief and his presence filled me with fear. The fact that he was ashing his filthy cigarette on my floor filled me with rage. I stayed still and watched from a distance, hoping that his ramblings would give me the knowledge I needed to escape this place.



“She said I was free. She showed me the door and I walked out. Oh but I missed her. I just needed one more time,” he began to cry again. Snot oozed from his nostrils as he gasped for breath. His sobs turned in to wailing; a horrifying sound for a grown man to make. I don't know how long I watched him, but he finally quieted down. He turned his head to the cup of coffee sitting before him. He seemed relieved at the sight of it. He carefully picked it up and took a sip. A wave of calm appeared to wash over him.



“I'll get out of here again. I just have to use all of my knowledge,” He pulled a pistol out of his pocket and for the first time he acknowledged that I was in the room. His eyes met mine and he smiled at me. “I just have to be smarter than her,” he said as he put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.



I woke up in the dirty hotel bed covered in sweat and piss shaking violently. I wanted to scream but my vocal cords would not comply. I laid there for God knows how long until I found the courage to get up and take a shower. When I stepped out of the bathroom I noticed the smell of coffee had filled the room. I looked in the grimy coffee maker and found a freshly made pot; beside it was a pack of camel non filters. I poured myself a cup, stirred in the sugar and lit up a smoke. I was surprised that I didn't cough. I always thought of smoking as a disgusting habit but at the moment I found it amazingly comforting. I refilled my travel cup, added some more sugar and a few shots of whiskey left over from the previous night's bottle and left for work.



I’d always had a bad habit of daydreaming while I drove. Strange and awkward thoughts took me and I tried to figure out what the hell was going on. Every now and again I would check my surroundings to make sure I was driving in the right direction. As I got on highway fourteen I started to think about the man and women from my dreams. Somehow I knew without a doubt that I was being given a message, and he was trying to show me something. But what? It was driving me absolutely crazy. I was lost deep into my thoughts when an angry commuter honked his horn at me. “Hey, pay attention to the fucking road!” he shouted as he flicked me off.



“Sorry!” I hollered back while I muttered under my breath, “What a prick…” Nobody could possibly understand what I was going through. Why would they? After all, I barely understood it. I kept driving and thinking, thinking and driving. I lost myself to another crazy daydream.



The turn to work was coming up, so I pulled promptly pulled myself out of my nightmarish thoughts and focused on the road. Something was wrong. I anxiously looked through my dirty windows for something familiar, but saw no distinct landmarks. I was no longer on highway fourteen, in fact I wasn’t even Madison. I was lost amidst a winding and heavily forested road. “Alright Arron, think!” there had to be an explanation behind this, “you’re just tired, that’s all… yeah that’s it, tired. And… you just drove a little too far.” However as the words came out I knew I was lying to myself. Being the only car on the road I decided to just turn around, and I prayed that I’d eventually hit civilization.



I drove in silence for what felt like hours. Every now and again I’d try to send a message to my friends, but I must have been in an area with bad signal. Nothing could get in or out. Panic set when the road continuously continued to wind in wild patterns. I felt like I was driving in circles. Somehow I had to calm myself down. I had to think of something. The radio! As I turned it on I clinched my jaw as an obnoxiously loud buzz greeted my eardrums. “Not even the fucking radio works?” I shouted and started reaching for the dial.



“Alright listeners!” A male voice interrupted the buzz before I could turn it off, “It’s that time again, and it’s going to be another lovely day! We’ve got a special guest with us today, go ahead and say hello, Arron!”



“What…” I started to shake.



“Don’t be shy, now! Go ahead and tell your fans how you’re doing!”


“W-who… who the fuck are you!”


“Hey, hey, hey. We try to keep this station PG, please reframe from swearing.” I knew he was mocking me.


“Fuck you! Tell me what’s going on, right the fuck now!” Right as the last word escaped my tongue my car jolted to the left, and then the right. It spun out uncontrollably. I tried to grip the wheel to no avail. I started to scream louder than I ever had before and the radio buzzed back to match. In one fluid motion the car regained control and started driving again, however I still had no control.


The guy on the radio chimed in again, “Wouldn’t want an accident now, would we?”



“Please… please just tell me what’s going on. Stop this…” I began crying.



“Stop what? This is what you want! We’re taking you to see her! That’s what you always wanted after all!”



“Her?”



“That’s a bingo!” he laughed.



“I just want to go home!”



It was silent for a few seconds before he spoke, “Where do you think you’re going? She’s waiting for you, and so far she’s been waiting an awfully long time.” I looked ahead and saw a lone building standing in the distance surrounded by an army of dark pines. It was home. Not my new apartment, but the house I grew up in. I started crying harder than I ever had before. “She’s there. She always has. I keep telling you, it’s going to be a great day.” The radio cut out and I was alone with my thoughts once more. I finally began to understand what this was all about. The red hair, the coffee, the cigarettes. It’d been so long I nearly forgotten what they looked like. After all, it’d been twenty years, and I actively sought out to block out the events from my childhood, and now I found myself in a position where I had to remember. It all came flooding back. For a while I fought with the car – I knew I couldn’t handle what was in that house - but it drove itself. Not even the windows would work.



Night had almost completely overtaken the sky, and by the time I reached my old house I could hardly see a thing. The car came to screeching halt and the door opened for me to step out. I knew this was it. If I wanted to put an end to this I had to be brave. No more bats, no more tears. It was time to be a man, I had confront her. I had to confront my mother.



I saw the old wooden door to our old home and it instantly brought back the years of abuse. “How’s a little shit like you ever going to get a girl?” mom would say as she took a drag of a cig, “You’re such a little shit Arron, I wish I never had!” I’d blocked the memories out for so many years that I nearly forgot I’d gone through these things. The doorknob was within my grasp. I pulled it, I knew I was ready. I found myself thinking of my father while the creaky door swung itself open. He was always the nicest guy. He liked his coffee with lots of milk and sugar, which oddly enough showed the man’s personality. He wasn’t right for that horrid women. She tormented both of us. She hit me, and cheated on dad. It’s no surprise he did what he did. I would have done the same thing.



I remember the morning I was taken away from my house. Dad had just come back from a business trip and he walked in on mother hitting me with a wooden spoon. “Good boys don’t bother their mommies during breakfast!” she said as she smacked me against the back of the head. The first thing my dad saw was probably the blood… it set something dark off inside him. He ran to the bedroom while mom screamed something awful at him. For a while mom and I were all alone, and she continued to scold and hit me. Then, he came back, but this time something was different. This time he was going to stop it, I just knew.



He stood in the doorway and motioned for me to come closer, and I did as instructed. Dad kneeled down and whispered into my ear, “Everything’s going to be alright Arron. Today’s gonna ‘be a great day. The best day you ever had!”. Quickly he put five rounds in mom, and she fell back flailing. He stood over her for a few seconds before he smiled at me, put the gun to his temple, and pulled the trigger. All I really remember was the sound the gun made. Oh, and the blood. I remember the blood.



I realized I was daydreaming again, and I’d already walked twenty feet into the house.



I stood in the living room, set up exactly as it had been in my childhood. I remembered building a protective fort from the cushions of the couch when my parents fought, using the throw pillows to soften my mother's blows when she turned her anger on me. The television I used to escape into still sat on the entertainment center, a hole through the center from the time I forgot to take out the trash. There was a thick coating of dust on every surface, but that wasn't unusual; my mother rarely cleaned. I rounded the corner into the kitchen to find the old man from my dream. He was sipping sugary-sweet coffee from a large, orange mug. He wiped the syrupy mixture from his mustache with his left hand in a familiar gesture. His eyes were sad. Wet. He had been crying.



""Hi, Arron.""



I jumped slightly at his voice. More familiar now, that deep coffee-tainted voice he always had in the morning. I wanted to run to him, hug him. Tell him how lonely I was without his guidance. But I didn't. I just stood there. Didn't even speak. ""I had to use all my knowledge,"" he said.



""You said that before, but what do you mean all your knowledge?"" I asked.



""I had to come back,"" he said, almost as though he couldn't hear me.



There was a loud thump on the wall that sent several framed pictures falling to the wooden floor with a crash and explosion of tiny beads of glass. I could feel my chest tighten, swallowing my breath. I wanted to hide behind the couch.



""Where the fuck are you, Arron?"" a shrill voice shrieked from further back in the house. From somewhere dark and hidden. ""Arron,"" my father whispered intensely, ""Take it!""



I dropped my gaze to the table in front of him. The little snub-nosed pistol lay in the center of the table like a museum display, the wooden grip closest to me. Presented to me like a birthright.



Another, louder thump echoed from the dark storage room off the side of the kitchen. This time, I could hear wood splinter with the blow. A low, quiet muttering floated to me out of the darkness like a sinister drone box drilling into my brain.



And then pain. A headache, but different. Acute and focused in the back of my head. No, not the back... inside my brain. The drone grew louder.



""Take it, Arron, please. We have to outsmart her.""



With a shriek that shattered the frames that still hung on the walls, the redhead - my mother - bolted from the inky hallway. She held a large, bloody kitchen knife above her head. Her face was streaked, like she had run bloody fingers down her skin. She looked like a crazed soldier from a Vietnam War film, her bayonet the last resort against attacking enemy soldiers. She was heading directly for me.



""Arron! Now!"" my dad yelled.



Without thinking, I grabbed the pistol and fired twice into my mother's body. She stumbled, clutching one hand over her abdomen.



""Arron, you shit! You ruined mommy's dress!"" she screamed. She stood tall, raising her knife again. There was no blood. No wound. The bullets seemed to pass right through her after ripping through the delicate silk fabric draped over her shoulders. She staked toward me now, less crazed and more deliberate.



""I wish your fucking stupid head never fell out of me, Arron. You were a mistake. My prize for enjoying the way it felt to let your daddy's boss fill my pussy when his dumb ass was at work."" I shot her again. No effect. She didn't even slow down. The droning screech grew louder.



""Arron, not that way,"" my father said softly. I looked at him and he gestured at his temple. ""Here.""



I put the gun to my head, hoping it would make the sound stop. Hoping it would make my mother shut up.



Suddenly, my father was up, out of his chair at the table. He stood behind me, one hand on the gun. He twisted my hand a little, aiming the muzzle up and back. I felt the cool metal slide my hair out of the way and press against my skin. It was a nice contrast against the warm room. I pulled the trigger.


*


I awoke to the soft beep of machines in a hospital bed. I felt good. Lighter, somehow. Like a weight had lifted, like a balloon inside my skull that had been expand so slowly I didn't notice it had finally popped. The last thing I remembered was shooting myself, but that had to be some sort of hallucination. I raised my hand to my face to find a bandage across my forehead and another on my chin. I traced them back to a nest of gauze on the side of my head. It was frightening, and my body initially responded in a natural way, but I felt somehow calm. Protected. I almost felt the slight pressure of a hand on my shoulder and smelled, just for a second, sweetened coffee.



My nurse came in to find me awake and brought me a veritable feast. I didn't realize how hungry I was until the entire plate ended up in my stomach in a mere 10 minutes. My doctor came in next to check out my reflexes and shine a light in my eyes. He said he was glad to see I was awake, but didn't sound completely convinced.



He stayed in my room when a third person entered, a tall woman in business clothes. They both sat near the side of my bed; one smiling calmly, the other on the verge of a scowl. ""Arron, do you know why you're here?"" the woman asked. I told her I didn't and said that the last thing I remembered was driving to work after waking up in the motel room. I didn't say a thing about the hallucination. It was hard to keep the two separate, though, as I wasn't sure where I could draw the line between reality and delusion.



""You have no memory of how you got injured?"" she asked.



""No.""



""Arron, this might be difficult to hear, so I want you to know you're in a safe place. I'm a counselor with the hospital. You're here because you tried to harm yourself. You shot yourself. Your neighbor heard the shot and called the paramedics.""



""Whoa,"" I said. I meant to ask a question; something like why did I do that? but I figured she probably didn't know. So out came whoa. I felt stupid.



The woman smiled. ""Yes,"" she said, ""it's a lot to take in. The doctors noticed something odd when they were fixing you, however."" She turned to the doctor behind her. ""Would you like to take over?""



Without answering her, he leaned forward and spoke in a gruff voice, ""We were surprised you were alive, first of all. Brain trauma isn't a joke. We also thought you might have lasting deficits with the kind of injury you sustained. But, even anesthetized, your reflexes seemed completely unimpeded. While removing the dead tissue from your wound, we noticed that it was not natural grey matter. You had a tumor,"" the doctor pointed to the top of his head, a little back from the center, ""right here. The bullet passed clean through and took a lot of the tumor with it. The grey matter was pushed back by the foreign tissue and was mostly unharmed. You may experience some minor motor deficits in your left side, but nothing major.""



The doctor sat back in his chair and glanced at his watch.



The woman seemed to be waiting for him to say more. When he didn't, she spoke up. ""A tumor in that area can cause sensory and motor hallucinations. Did you notice anything like that?"" I smiled. Wide. I wasn't crazy.



""Yes!"" I said, louder and more enthusiastic than I intended. I was on the verge of tears.



""Did you have an MRI prior to being admitted here?"" the doctor asked.



I shook my head.



""Then help me understand something; you're hallucinating with no idea why, then you shoot yourself. Right in the tumor. With almost surgical precision. Aside from the possibility of bleeding to death, you may have survived that bullet with no medical help. How can you do that? I guess maybe you'll tell us when you start doing the morning show circuit, though, right?""



I shrugged as the woman stood in a huff and escorted the doctor outside my room. They spoke in hushed, angry voices for a few minutes before the woman reentered alone.



""I'm sorry about that,"" she said. ""He's a very... skeptical thinker.""



""It's alright,"" I said. ""I'm actually wondering the same thing. How could I have shot myself in a tumor I didn't know I had? I took a biology course in college, but never anything about the brain. Definitely nothing advanced enough to take a chance like that.""



""I don't think they offer a course on ballistic surgery, Arron,"" the counselor said, smirking. ""That's your own invention."" She sat, sighed, and looked over her notes. Her blonde hair seemed to glitter in the sun shining through my window. She had a nice face.



""I don't know how you did what you did. The police investigation did show that you were the shooter, though. I think it's important not to downplay how absolutely amazing that is. Some people are more in tune with their bodies than others. Maybe you sensed the tumor somehow. It sounds crazy, but there are things about neuroscience that haven't been answered. It would also make sense that, in the face of intensifying hallucinations, you thought taking such a rash action was justified.""



I nodded. I could still almost feel strength pouring into me from the hand that wasn't on my shoulder. This was all so hard to understand.



""We talked to your coworkers and they noted that your personality had shifted dramatically leading up to the incident,"" the woman said. ""That's typical of this type of tumor. The police found bills from a motel in your pockets. Do you remember going there?"" ""Yes. I wasn't able to sleep in my apartment and I thought a change of scenery would help.""



""Sleep disturbances are also common with tumors in this area. Arron, I have to say, you're taking this very well.""



""Thank you. It's... it's more confusing than anything. I've thought my apartment might be haunted for a long time, but everything else seemed normal. And then it all hit at once and now... Well, now I have a hole in my head.""



The counselor nodded. ""It's a lot to take in. And it's common for emotions to rise to the surface as you process what's happened. I'll leave you alone to rest right now, but I'll be back tomorrow around the same time. If you need to discuss your thoughts or feelings, I'll leave you my card. Feel free to use your room phone to call me any time before 10 PM. If you need something during the night, there's a psychiatric intern on call who can help you out until I come in.""



I thanked her, enjoyed watching her leave, and then settled in my bed to sleep again. I awoke the next morning for a delicious breakfast. When my nurse showed up to take the tray, she had a small envelope for me. She said it was left for me at the front desk.



Inside the envelope was a plain white card. On the inside was a short message:



*Arron,



A father always protects his child. Always. I had to use all my knowledge to come back and help you one last time. I'm sorry I had to hurt you, but you're safe now. Today's gonna be a great day!

I realize that it will be an uphill battle, seeing as how I am not an Econ/Finance/Accounting major at a big name school, but I am willing to work as hard as it takes. Perhaps, with my degree it would be better suited for quant roles. Any advice or information that would point me into the right direction would be awesome.

The only class where we did have a project was in software engineering and I was part of the QA team for that class. At the time I didn't think much of it. Most of my Computer Science classes were just heavy on theory and computation. Although for the classes where programming was taught, we were shown c++. I have studied some java on my own as well.

I know my data structures pretty well and some of the most commonly used algorithms in regards to searching and sorting. I suck at recursion but I am practicing. 

Where do I look for jobs and what should I do? I did have one internship but I don't think I can tie it in as relevant experience.

3cvfwh,10,2015-07-10,"I'm 23, and have (almost) nothing to offer.",RedCoinNG,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3cvfwh/im_23_and_have_almost_nothing_to_offer/,"I think it's time to just let all of this out:

I graduated from college 2 months ago, with a Bachelor of Business Administration, with a focus on Computer Information Systems. Unfortunately, I was an idiot, and never really looked to hard into internships. I did well in class, but we all know that's not good enough. Now, I'm in a position where I feel like I didn't learn enough to actually meet any of the requirements for any (even remotely) relevant entry level positions. I feel like most of the time throughout school, I took a couple of classes here and there for each subject, from different management courses to programming, systems analysis and design, database management, networking, etc, and now that I'm looking back on it, it feels like I was good enough to pass a couple of courses, but not good enough to actually be useful with anything I learned. It really doesn't help that many job postings require 3+ years of experience for entry level jobs.

I never learned to drive, either. I have my permit, but I never really went past that stage. I'm terrified of driving, and the older I get, the worse it gets. Even when I was 16, I still felt like I wouldn't be capable of driving. I'm naturally awkward, and often have a hard enough time not colliding into people walking around corners, let alone putting me in a 2-ton speeding death machine. There's just so much to take in while you're going at such high speeds that I believe you can't really fully comprehend, and it bothers me. You could be a great driver, and still end up in an accident, and there's so many factors that can be at play. I don't think I could handle being at fault for a car accident that injured, or worse, killed someone.

I've always been a boring, awkward guy, on top of all that. I'm not that great at socializing, I have a low self esteem, and I'm not all that fun to be around. I'm just a guy that likes to play video games and sometimes the drums, even though I kind of suck. Even if I somehow overcame all of the previous problems, and managed to learn to drive, and get a decent job, best case scenario, I'm living in an apartment either by myself or with one of my roommates from college, where we'll just be awkward virgin friends for life, constantly shutting ourselves away from the world.

I've never had a girlfriend, and probably never will. To me, it seems like dating is like a job interview. The longer you go without any ""previous experience,"" the more you're fucked. Much like a 23 year old man with no work experience, I'm sure that hearing about a 23 year old man who has literally never been on a date would just get weird looks and raise a red flag for girls. There's obviously something wrong with me if I've made it this long and nobody has wanted anything to do with me.

It's hard to be positive from where I'm seeing things. But I did say ""(almost)"" in the title, and that's because of the one thing that has been holding me back from suicide for a while now: my sister is a lesbian, and semi-in-the-closet. Being that myself, and a couple of other family members know, but not our parents, grandparents, etc. They're very religious, and would likely kick her out if they knew. The other family members that know about it (aunt, cousin, etc) send mixed messages. They say they're okay with it, but everything they do seems to contradict that. I'm the only person she really has that knows, and still loves her - and most importantly to me, doesn't make a big deal about it either way. To me, the only thing it changes is that she might introduce me to a girlfriend instead, but that doesn't change any of the memories growing up, playing games together, going camping together, talking to each other all the time, and every other moment we shared leading up until now. On top of that, I have a really close friend I made in college, but only because we ended up being randomly paired together to live as roommates. We're both introverts, and probably would have never really talked to each other otherwise, but we really clicked. It's one of those friendships that you can talk about anything - and I mean literally anything - and it never gets too weird, there's no judgement, only laughter. We know each others darkest secrets, and we've both openly admitted that if we were gay, and attracted to each other, we would be the perfect couple. But you can't change who you're attracted to, and if we pretended otherwise it would just be an awkward mess. But still, we're best friends that know each others' weirdest fetishes, stories, thoughts, basically everything about each other. He even knows about my history with feeling depressed, and occasionally suicidal, and the fact that I've almost made an attempt before, and that I was irrational enough to let a coin flip decide that for me. I made a promise to him that I would never do anything without talking to him about it - but it keeps getting harder and harder to keep that promise. It's impossible to talk about. When we would lie in our beds and share all of weirdness with each other, if I tried to talk about it, I could feel a lump in my throat, and I physically couldn't get the words out. So far I've been able to keep that promise, meaning I just wouldn't do anything if I couldn't say anything.

To sum everything up, I'm boring, lonely, undesirable, unable to drive, and incompetent in spite of my degree, so unemployable. I have very little to actually contribute, the only thing being two close relationships. Yet that's the only thing that has kept me going for a while. Some days I know I just couldn't handle leaving my sister alone to deal with the rest of our family, and that breaking my promise to my friend would just break him apart. Other days, I just spend hours thinking, reading about suicide on the internet, slowly dying inside, and realizing that sometimes, you make promises that you didn't know at the time you just can't keep."

3cw3v3,4,2015-07-11,For all those conisdering taking on an Internship with AmPav (American Pavilion) next summer: Consider this your warning!!!,ammawell,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3cw3v3/for_all_those_conisdering_taking_on_an_internship/,"Tried posting this in response to a question [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nh77r/american_pavilion_internship_scam/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link] that had been asked three years ago because I'm a dumb fuck and the comment box was somehow still accessible via my smartphone. 



But I digress... I almost feel bad about posting this rant, because I honestly had a blast seeing France and experiencing the Cannes Film Festival and all that, and none of it would probably have been possible without this program. BUT they have some serious shit they need to work out because as of right now, AmPav comes across as a bunch of money-grubbing, false-advertizing assholes, and I feel I need to warn anyone considering the program as to what they're ACTUALLY getting when they get an internship with AmPav, because they do NOT advertise this program accurately at all. 



First: their website, for anyone interested
http://www.ampav.com/index.php/student-programs/cannes-film-program/

There are four types of internships one can apply for through AmPav for the Cannes Film Festival: film, business, hospitality and culinary. I've found film to be among the most disappointing based on what my fellow interns have said to me, so I've included that specific webpage above for reference. 

Second: This two-week program costs well over $4,000 when all is said and done (maybe more for students applying through different internships), and most of that is just for admission into the program itself (which doesn't include anything but rent for the shitty, sketchy economy apartment complex which interns share with French natives--which can actually be cool if you speak French, but awful if you don't--, as well as breakfast for the two weeks, and a couple polos for work). 



So, I've participated in this program and actually just got back this summer going on two months ago. Though the experience was one I'll never forget, I really recommend not going through the program, but perhaps visiting Cannes with a group of aspiring filmmakers / friends that you trust instead. AmPav's costs are extremely unreasonable considering their interns are unpaid and receive only one free meal a day-- ""breakfast"" (usually a buffet of croissants, apples and juice boxes). Accommodations during your stay are lousy and usually consist of four people living together in a roughly 100 square foot suite with absolutely zero closet space and one tiny bathroom to share. You are given one set of sheets and a couple towels which are to last you an entire week, after which they are replaced with clean sets for the second week. If you wish to do laundry during your stay, that's up to the individual and can cost up to 20 euro for one load of laundry. You aren't provided with toilet paper or soap throughout your stay and are expected to buy this all yourself. I'm also currently in a battle with them over a $75 surcharge I apparently ""owe"" them due to my room not passing their cleanliness inspection after my roommates and I had left to go back home, despite the fact that it has been well over a month since I've returned home from the program and have had little to no contact with AmPav since then. Each of my three roommates have allegedly been charged $75 as well, for reasons that have as of yet been unexplained to me as the woman who sent me the email earlier this evening informing me of this news is now ""out of the office on vacation"" and is apparently unable to respond to my queries, or provide me with someone else who can. (That's a $300 total charge, by the way, for something that may be complete and utter bullshit-- I wouldn't be surprised if I'm never provided with a reason as to why my room ""failed"" this cleanliness inspection. For all I know, they were just short on funds and decided that my dishes, upon inspection, looked a little too dirty after all and that they might as well go ahead and extort my roommates and I now that we've successfully gotten back into the routine of our boring, complacent American lives.) 



In short, all those who agree to do this program must buy all their amenities (including toilet paper, hand soap, dish soap and detergent-- despite being REQUIRED to have their room apparently spotless and dishes cleaned by the time they leave at the end of the two-week period, for fear of being charged $75 each), as well as meals and anything else they might need while over there, on top of working 3-8 hours every day for free with no breaks and only one day off the entire duration of the festival. Hours are variable, and interns are discouraged from conversing much with the actual customers AmPav manages to attract (despite the fact that they are the only tent in the entire festival to charge a ""membership fee"" -- which costs anywhere from €20 to €900 and frequently infuriates customers / makes America look like even more of a piece of shit to the French than it already does). This makes any ""networking"" they like to advertise so much nearly impossible unless you are brave enough to rub elbows with the elite in actual bars, clubs or restaurants in Cannes after you get through working for AmPav for the day. With all of their hidden fees and general shittiness concerning how they treat their interns, AmPav's internship program definitely isn't for everybody and I definitely think they inflate the fuck out of their program to the point of false advertising. However, the experience of interning alongside likeminded peers was one I'll never forget and I made a fuck-ton of amazing friends while doing this shitty, shitty internship. So really, it's up to you to make the decision of whether or not enduring the shittiness I describe is worth it to you. I definitely think it would be more cost effective and fun to go with a group of people you already know though, and just find the AmPav interns and hang with them while you're there. :)"
3cw8tr,1,2015-07-11,22M Where do I go from here?,AbstractAtlantean,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3cw8tr/22m_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"Sorry to vent here but I just discovered this subreddit and it was really humbling seeing so many other people even older than I am still trying to find their way. Anyways, I stumbled on here after getting into a fight with my mother about how I don't have a summer internship or a job and I'm not doing something productive with my time. And the more I've taken the time to think it over, she's probably right. I transferred to UCSB a year ago after spending 3 years in community college trying to figure out what I wanted to do. It was tough because the stuff I'm passionate about: sports, movies, music aren't really things that promising career paths. I know some people say follow your dreams and all that but I was turned off by probable lack of salary, as probably lack of success. This awesome international relations class really turned my focus towards that major; it made sense because politics and history were always two things that interested me as well. Suddenly, I wanted whatever I did to be meaningful, to have an impact. Maybe I'd have the cool title of being a diplomat, or an ambassador, or work at the United Nations. I ended up transferring to UCSB, which didn't have a international relations major, I settled on Global Studies, it seemed like a cool major that encompassed a lot of things. After months here, all that's happened to me is I've become less certain about what I want to do. Yes, I want to do something to help humanity, but I really do want to be financially secure as well. With global studies the options for career paths are endless, but I don't know which direction to go in. My major requires me to finish 6 courses in one language and 3 in another, and I'm currently studying French. Travelling is something I enjoy and unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to apply for a study abroad program this year but I still want to do it next summer. Knowing other languages is an awesome skill to have on your resume and I'm already pretty decent with Urdu as well, maybe I can pursue a career where that has some value. A translator of some sort. But I really fucked up by not getting an internship or anything this summer when I had a golden opportunity. All my friends who are as old as I am didn't spend an extra year in CC or go to CC at all and they are all heading into the workplace with jobs. They talked about how grades were barely even discussed in their interviews and how it was all about work experience. This worries me. My resume isn't going to look great. One job, a year at a movie theatre in customer service, and one sports blog I run with some friends, which admittedly gets a decent amount of views, and some volunteer experience, and hopefully 2 languages other than english. Are internships important though? Job experience? With my love of sports, the NBA and their positions regarding their global business sounds appealing to me. If only I had applied for their supercool summer internship program which I just learned about now to get me a step ahead. Anyways sorry for the long boring story. Had to get it off my chest. To sum up, I like sports, movies, music, writing, history and politics. Currently on my way to getting a global major from UCSB, studying french, and hoping to go abroad to Paris next summer to finish my studies. No internships and barely any work experience besides running a sports blog and working at a movie theatre. Where do I go from here :("

After reading and searching a lot here I have determined I should post to try and get some advice.
Also, I wasn’t sure if I should post this here or at ITCareerQuestions  so I apologize if I am wrong and can repost there if need be. This will be rather long, so here goes:

Background: 
I am a US Navy Sailor and an Operations Specialist, First Class (E-6), and my critical NEC is AIC. I have been in now just over ten years, but I am planning on getting out after the tour I am on is up in 2017. I will be at nearly 12 years in at that point. Please, before you say, “Oh, well why not just do the last eight and retire?” because I am not happy here and that isn’t going to change. I intend on going into the active Naval Reserves but staying in is not an option in my mind. I have my BS in Business Administration from the University of Maryland University College, which I earned within the last couple of years.

I would like to land a job in the field of computers (I really wish I was an IT or a CTN in the Navy…), and after doing a lot of reading here on Reddit, I want to pursue a Master’s Degree in either CS or Computer Information Systems. I am leaning more towards CIS though as while I really enjoy solving problems, I am not very good at math and I think I would struggle a lot. Plus I think I am a very personable guy and I think I’d fit in better doing CIS as it is more business focused.

Right now I am deployed, and in my free time studying for the A+ exams, which I plan on taking when I hit port. I am then going to study for Network+ and Security+ and take those when I get back to my homeport. A lot of my friends tell me A+ and Network+ are “useless,” but I have nothing to show experience being an OS so that is why I am pursuing them (plus they are paid for by the Navy). Plus it can help me get a (preferably) government job in the interim while I am going to school and gain some experience.

Everyone here seems to say one of two things about a Masters in Computer Information Systems:
It’s worthless and a degree is CS is much more desirable. If you go C.I.S. you will regret it.
or
Go ahead and get your Master’s in CIS, it’s a growing field.

So my questions are as follows:

1.)	What kind of classes, aside from these Certs, should I possibly take while I still can on active duty to help me increase my knowledge? We have something called Tuition Assistance and I can take online and hybrid online/classroom classes on base through UMUC for free (aside from books).

2.)	So is CIS worth it or should I man up and go towards a degree in Computer Science? I know that I am capable of doing both, even with my handicap in Math. I’d definitely have to take some more pre-reqs in math though if I went with CS.

3.)	Will my work experience in the US Navy be counted as a positive and help me land a good entry-level position or a decent internship, or is it essentially useless unless I go for a government job as I didn’t work in IT?

The Think Tank
222 Main St. 44444
Washington D.C.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to apply for the fall internship at the Think Tank. I have become familiar with the center through my academics.I became aware of the internship through the indeed job board.

I am currently in final semester as a graduate student at the University of State with a major in international relations. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from the same University in international studies. A large portion of my coursework has been Asian focused. I have taken courses on contemporary Japan and China as well as culture and language courses on China. I have also spent time abroad in places as Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Venezuela, and Costa Rica.

Upon graduating I hope to work for a think tank that specializes in international issues. With my academic background and international travel and experience I believe I can attain this goal. I also hope to be able to do this with the assistance of having interned at the Think Tank.

While earning my degrees I have been employed in the hospitality industry where I am constantly meeting and engaging with new people. I have also worked as a substitute teacher in XXXX County State. My time working as a substitute I was able to  lead classes alone with only the instructions left by the teacher and at times without instruction as well. I have also taken the leadership roles while coaching my son’s little league soccer team. Not only am I able to work well on my own I also work well as part of a team as well.

I would like to meet with you and discuss any internship opportunities you might have. Please let me know if you have any questions. I can be reached by phone at (123) 456 7890 and also by email at Myemail@gmail.com.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

I searched the forum and the web and I've only found a few inconclusive posts. I'm starting a 4 year comp sci degree and am just beginning to teach myself. I aim to be getting an internship with Intel by junior/senior year. One of my friends is a career coach and is saying I should be getting experience in about a year, whether it's a internship or a job, although he doesn't know to much about the industry. That was just about the timeline I had in mind before I had spoke to him.

So, the thing is, when I search around for entry positions and internships that I could qualify for within a year of hard work, web development positions/internships seem to outnumber software engineering ones twofold. I was thinking about learning HTML/CSS/Javascript to ensure I can start racking up the experience ASAP. Would experience for a different field be wasted time? Do they overlap enough that it doesn't matter too much? Or should I continue with my original plan of learning something along the lines of Java/Python/C-something and hope I can find the work?"

On April 18 of this year, my twenty-three year old brother Xavier, who has severe autism, got up from his share of the bed space inside my parents' bedroom, and had the most frightening tantrum we had ever experienced.

Everything was so normal earlier that day. I had a friend sleep over to celebrate our three-year ""geeksary"" as I fondly call it. Her name is Lexa and I consider her to be a treasured companion even if we haven't known each other that long unlike my other closest friends. We took the same course in college but belonged to different batches. It was only during summer internship for our broadcast radio management subject that we struck a friendship which deepened once she joined the school paper I was already a part of as the associate editor. We bonded over favorite shows, mostly, and in the next three years I would invite her over my place to marathon-watch certain series or films. For our third geeksary, we decided to watch two Michael Fassbender films because we had the most insane crush on this actor. Afterwards, we called it a night some time around one in the morning. I remember closing the lights, getting in bed with her, and telling her a creepy story which I delivered in a dramatic manner; whispering to her as she tried to kick me from under the sheets, trying to drown out my words by singing stupidly to herself. It was minutes after I finished my tale---and we were both feeling worn out from my laughter midway through telling it while she lay there exhausted from her state of agonizing sheer panic because of her refusal to listen to my story--when it happened.

There was a loud, crashing noise from across my room, just only three yards away, coming from my parents' bedroom, which was followed by my mother shouting my brother's name. I didn't move at first, mostly due to the familiarity of the situation. Xavier often had tantrums, and some of them have been physical confrontations. He would throw objects or bring down furniture or whatever is the closest tangible thing at hand he could destroy. It never got out of hand. My father, who was in his mid-fifties, can still handle him. I learned that I shouldn't get involved when this happens but there was something different about that night. I lay there next to Lexa who didn't make a sound herself after I assured her that it's going to be okay, that my parents can calm Xavier down. Just then, I heard my father's thunderous voice, filled with rage, and my mother sobbing uncontrollably, so I knew I had to get up and figure out what was going on.

I hurriedly got out of bed. It took only less than ten seconds to get to my parents' bedroom but I chose to first linger by the door, with a hesitant hand clutching the knob but not turning it just yet. A second passed. And then another. Finally, I twisted the knob and walked in.

Growing up with a sibling with autism has been understandably challenging. My age and experience (I just turned twenty-five) with taking care of Xavier alongside my parents over the years have made me considerably apathetic about some vexing things other people who never had to deal with them on a daily basis might find unusual or inconvenient. It's difficult to put into words what a unique experience it is to have a brother with a behavorial disorder. I often describe him as my Peter Pan--a perpetual child through and through. Sometimes, if I really stop to think about it, I find that the idea of being together with him for the rest of my life overwhelming. Decades will pass by but my brother will remain forever-youthful both in mind and spirit. I try to look at it as optimistically as I could because I want to believe that I can be strong and capable enough to sustain us in the future in the advent of our parents' passing. 

Now for the most part, Xavier had been complacent, cheerful and easy to live with. He's almost six feet tall, lanky and had a great smile that undermines his behavioral condition. I love him with everything I have, and often when he frustrates me over the simplest things or, in this case, when he gets these awful, inexplicable tantrums, I often feel as if I'm suddenly being scooped hollow inside---I feel powerless and it's a sickening feeling especially when I can't help but blame Xavier for making it so hard not just for me but for my parents to take care of him. 

Around 2003, Xavier was sent to a boarding school for special children. This was back in my high school years and it was a fated coincidence (as my mother explained) that when I recently dropped out of my first college due to failing grades by 2008, my brother was also taken out of the school because he had to be operated on. He had a benign cyst in his digestive track. It was nothing fatal but the operation was costly so my parents didn't have enough money anymore to send him back to school especially since I had to enroll to another college. In the next two years, he was bedridden and I was working as a part-time English teacher in our private-owned tutorial center. My parents were happy to have both of their children home with them and for a while it had been agreeable for everyone. However, due to this stay-at-home arrangement, my brother's carefully-honed routine from his schooling was neglected and he regressed. So now he just spends days and days on bed, not really doing anything except eat and sometimes type his name and random numbers into a cheap cellphone my folks bought for him. It was his only pastime. Sometimes he does the same thing with a computer. He doesn't go out much except when he had to ride in the car whenever our father would pick us up and my mother from the tutorial center I'm currently employed in full-time. It has been seven years; I got my life back on track and Xavier is being taken care of by my father who retired just so he can stay home and watch out for him while my mother and I work and hopefully earn enough money to try and send him to another SpEd school again. 

There have been no incidents of violent behaviors until that night. Sure, there were a couple small fits of anger from him over the years since he came back to live with us, but nothing like what happened on April 18. It was pure, unimaginable horror for me to stand there in my parents' room by the door, shocked to see the menacing event unfolding before me. It was the first time that I felt absolutely terrified of what Xavier was capable of. He is so tall now, clutching two pillows against him as my mother was gripping his hand, praying the rosary, muttering it between choking sobs. My father was standing across them, livid and breathing hard. I couldn't make out the exact details of the moment until Xavier moved again; this time to snatch his hand away from my mother's grasp. He then held her by the back of her head and slammed her forehead against the wall. My father's quick reflexes took over and he grabbed Xavier to stop him, cursing so harshly during the struggle. They both fell to the ground, with my brother biting him on the shoulder. My mother was holding Xavier back, crying--crying so deafeningly loud as she begged for him, for my father, for God and whoever up there is listening, to stop. Just stop. No more.

The numbness spread from my face to my limbs, rooting me in place. The entire thing only happened less than a minute. When I was able to shake off my daze, I immediately ran over to Xavier and held his face between my hands. I tried soothing him with words, comforting him by saying that no one is going to hurt him anymore, that he's safe. We're his family. Everything's gonna be okay... 

We never really talked about whatever happened to him during his four years in boarding school. All my mother ever said was there were some people who were unkind to him there so when he gets these tantrums now, it's only because his fragmented mind is trying to work out some of those memories and since he doesn't have the proper mental capacity to cope and handle such trauma and pain, he would lash out and hurt us...or himself.

As I held his face between my hands, his eyes kept darting to the left, unfocused. I knew he's unable to process what I'm saying due to the suffocating circumstances, but I still tried my best to get through him. Just then, he ripped my glasses from my face and broke it in two. I coiled away and got down on my knees to pick it up. Selfishly, I got annoyed because that was a very expensive pair of glasses which I just bought a week ago. Seeing it broken in two on the floor, I wanted to get angry myself but I shoved that instinct away and picked it up. It's a good thing that the lens are not damaged, just the frame. It was only while I was kneeling down that I was able to see what was on the ground. It took seconds to adjust my blurred vision and for me to notice that the floor was littered with glass fragments. My mind made logical connections in an instant--the noise of something crashing earlier, the position where I was kneeling--it had to be because of that mirror.

The mirror in question was about four feet in length and was attached to the wall next to my parents' bed. I was now facing it. As soon as I looked up to get a glimpse of myself with it, I was taken aback when Xavier punched his fist on its already broken surface once more. He didn't stop until he pulverized everything. I just knelt there in a state of brief shock as I watched my mother take his bloodied fist, begging him to stop. I was being pulled up from my position and realized it was my father trying to get me as far away as possible from the commotion. I looked down on myself and saw that I scraped my knees from the fragments on the floor earlier but the pain, if there was any, didn't register at all. I watched the blood drip down my legs but all I could feel at that point was the numbness.

***

We're an ordinary nuclear family composed of two parents with their eldest daughter and youngest son. We lived in my grandparents' old house when we were only babies but moved to our own place in the province when it was time for me to go to kindergarten. Xavier was just diagnosed with autism when he was four. Over the years, he was unable to develop speech of his own except through ""echolalia"" where he echoes the words being spoken to him. He can write his full name and address though, after a grueling two-year supervision by my persistent mother who wanted to at least make sure her son knew who he is and where he lives. I had a difficult relationship with Xavier when we were children. We fought a lot. We also had a viciously passive-aggressive caretaker who favored him over me so I had some ridiculous amount of envy-complex going on. Looking back at the girl I was around ten to twelve, I was pretty ashamed of the way I mistreat Xavier. I had anger issues. I remember just being...angry. I took it out on him. I thought about these things as I lay there on bed with Lexa, unable to sleep after what just happened. I told Lexa that she could just leave in the morning. We originally planned to have her stay over for brunch. But due to what happened, I didn't want her to feel unsafe in my household so she agreed to go early, and then was able to fall asleep as soon as everything was peaceful again. Xavier did eventually calm down. He took his pills. My folks just bandaged his bloodied hand for now. They decided to take him to the hospital the next day. After some time, they cleaned up the mess in their room, and now the three of them were sleeping as if nothing just happened.. But I couldn't.

I was beyond distraught. I felt like the entire world as I know it crumbled into sharp, jagged pieces and I can't begin to put them all back together because doing so feels like I'd cut myself in the process. Much like with that mirror in my parents' bedroom, its irreparable damage a stark reflection of how I felt in that moment. It was in this most painful and vulnerable moment that I recalled a childhood memory. I was about nine, I think. Xavier was being impossible again. Something about a stupid toy. We were quarreling inside my parents' old bedroom. I don't know how but the next thing I remember we were in the hallway leading to the staircase. I don't remember pushing him. But I remember him tumbling down---and the look of disbelief in his eyes as he watched me from above. I remember the bitch caretaker going to him, screaming at me as I stood there on top of the staircase. I remember Xavier didn't cry. The fall was short. There were only a dozen steps in the stairs and he only bumped his arms and legs. He didn't bleed. There was no concussion or anything. I don't know why my mind chose to select that memory but thinking about that made me want to keep digging until I found more memories that I felt were peculiar. Somehow, recalling them just after Xavier's tantrum earlier seemed to fit somehow. Like it makes sense to think about those things now. A part of my brain is allowing me to remember.

I remember his very first display of odd behaviors and that singular object of his morbid fascination when we were kids. 

The staircase.

Or rather, that particular step near the landing. Nowadays, we still have the same staircase which has a weird angle to it--a curve that seemed physically out of place. It was modified somehow and that's when it struck me. I can recall my father having construction workers over to fix that step. He had it...removed. So now the last three steps of the staircase curve to compensate for that missing step. The staircase itself was nothing special; it was wooden and closed with no holes or gaps between each step, and the last four flights were made of cement. But somehow, Xavier fixated on the first cemented step. He would draw on it. Relentlessly. He would take crayons, pencils, even forks and spoons and just carve into its unpainted cement surface. He would sit there, single-minded and preoccupied, just doodling for hours and hours. It wasn't unusual for children with autism to fixate on objects and find amusement on repetitive activities they find soothing so we didn't think it was a big deal. But then it became weird, as far as things could ever go weird for someone like my brother.

Every time he goes down the stairs, he would skip that step. It became some sort of a bizarre practice. I remember I'd do the same just for the heck of it. There was really nothing to this phenomenon. It's just Xavier being himself, turning mundane things into something extraordinary because he lives in another world and therefore may have a different playing field of imagination. We will never know since he doesn't have the ability to talk about it. But he kept obsessing on that step and that step alone. When we eventually got the staircase painted, he would chip it off and draw on it again. He would carve stick figures and other illegible stuff. It was just simple vandalism we didn't pay much attention to until one afternoon when I was in sixth grade, when I came home from school to find my mother by the gate. She explained that they had to take Xavier to the hospital. He had a tantrum. I was completely detached about it. As children, he would always act out whenever he feels like he's being ignored or when he wants to get something but couldn't say it. He would hit us or throw something from across the room to get our attention.

But I could tell from my mother's expression that this was different. It was the very first time Xavier physically hurt himself. He was eleven.

She gave me the details as clearly as possible as we sat there inside the house now, and I was eating my dinner. She said that the caretaker was sitting beside him on the table as they ate their dinner together. Xavier was able to eat by himself now, finally mastering how to hold a spoon and fork properly. Suddenly, he just stopped. His utensils clattered against the plate and the abrupt sound made the caretaker look up from her meal. She watched as Xavier sat there, motionless for a while. And then he slowly turned his head to the direction of the staircase. There was nothing in his expression, according to the caretaker when she told the story to my mother, but he looked just a tad bit curious as if he saw or heard something that caught his undivided attention. After a minute while the caretaker was asking him questions, trying to engage his focus, Xavier turned to her with a jerk. It surprised her. My brother was staring right at her. She said it was so uncomfortable because it was the first time he made a steady eye contact. People with autism often can't sustain that. It was also unsettling because for the first time she saw that there was recognition in those usually dull eyes, a spark of intelligence. For a brief second, Xavier looked like he didn't have autism. He looked like a normal boy, trying to communicate something to an adult.

He must have failed to do exactly that because, the next thing she knew, Xavier had grabbed his plate, still filled with food, and hit his face with it three times with such a violent force. It cracked by the third time. She pushed herself off the chair and pried the plate away. Xavier didn't resist her. He just sat there, his hands now clenched to fists as they rest on the table. Blood from the open wound on his forehead sipped down the bridge of his nose. The pain didn't register to him at all but he was rocking back and forth. The caretaker took out her cell phone to call for my father when suddenly, Xavier took the fork and hurled it across the other side of the room. 

The fork landed on the staircase. Right on top of that step he's been fixated on for months.

The caretaker was unable to form a coherent word as my father picked up because she was still watching Xavier closely. My brother was just sitting there, his entire body now facing the staircase which was a good three feet away from where they are. The caretaker described that he looked like a dog, attentively waiting for something to happen. Nothing. At this point the caretaker was finally able to speak to my father and as soon as the call was dropped, she put a towel on my brother's face and put some pressure on it to stop the bleeding until my father came home to pick them up so they can head to the hospital where he got at least four stitches.

Recalling this incident left me feeling more numb than ever. Dread was rising at the pit of my stomach as I thought about the staircase which was just a few yards away from my room. Shaking it off, I shifted my body to the right and watched the shadows from outside dance serenely on Lexa's face. She slept so soundly and I didn't want to wake her. I didn't want to scare her, not like in the playful manner I did earlier with that stupid story. I slowly got up from the bed to glance outside the window. There were faint shafts of light breaking through the horizon. I took comfort in the knowledge that the room will be filled by dawn in just a few short hours from now and I may not have to bother sleeping. I just have to wait it out. I just have to stop thinking about the past and those unsettling old memories of Xavier and whatever quarrel he has with our staircase.

***

I did fall asleep after all. Freshly dressed and smelling like a fruit, Lexa woke me up and told me she's leaving. We talked about what happened last night for a few minutes and I tried to make my explanations as direct and short as possible. She wished me the best and I could see she wished she could do more but I shrugged her off and told her to take care as I walked her to the gate of our house. I watched her walk away for a while before I shut the gate. That was the last time we ever spoke. I still can't talk to her and I'm not sure why. On some level, I think I didn't want to burden her with my family problems so I refused to have any kind of conversation with her. But, to be honest, I wished she could have done something more that night. I know it's foolish to expect an outsider to be able to act properly given the unfamiliarity and horror of the situation Lexa found herself in, but I still feel like I should be angry at her. She's my friend and she didn't provide me the comfort I sorely needed in that moment. I hated her a little for it so now I just avoid her at all costs which was easy since we're not in school anymore and we have our respective work to be preoccupied with.

But it wasn't just with Lexa that I found myself drifting away from. Gradually, I've stopped making plans with some of our other friends. I made the same excuses as before; that I didn't want to burden them, that I wasn't ready to talk about what happened. But Xavier was much better now. His new medication was helping and he was laughing again and is even affectionate whenever I lay beside him and cuddle with him. He may be twenty-three but he will always be my baby brother. So I don't understand why I continue to devote most of my time with family and work and ignore possible social get-togethers with friends whom I have such strong bonds with. Maybe I just want to focus more on my family after that incident. All I know is that it became a habit now not to answer texts or messages in Facebook. They did stop contacting me now. It was a relief, I guess, because now I can just focus on what's more important to me which is the future. I want to ensure Xavier and I will still live comfortably once my parents pass away. I can't be bothered with friends. 

But earlier tonight I had to text one of my friends because I have to talk to somebody about it. Since July rolled around, there have been some pretty stormy nights. The climate change has been a welcome treat for me because I hated the sizzling heat of the summer and was more than pleased to sleep through the cold and enjoy this indescribably comforting scent of rain that seemed to cling to my sheets during the night. Two nights ago, I was sitting on the bed when I reached out for my compact mirror to look at an irritating pimple on my cheek that seemed to be worsening. I was in the middle of inspecting it when I heard my brother's voice from my parents' bedroom.

He repeated it for the second time. It was only then I understood what he was saying.

He said in a calm but audible voice. ""Miyoy.""

""Miyoy"". That's how he says, ""Mirror"".

I froze. It took a few seconds to realize why it creeped me out. The fact is, since his big tantrum, my parents had all the mirrors removed inside the house. We had six of them before, counting the one he destroyed. We had an oval-shaped one in the kitchen near the sink. Then there's the one in my parents' bedroom, the one in the bathroom next to my room, and another one in one of the closets which was now stashed away in the storage room. And then there were the other two mirrors.

These two mirrors were the same in appearance and they were located specifically on the staircase both for the top and the bottom. The one in the bottom was near the landing, located right at that unusual curve. The other one on the top was in the hallway between our two bedrooms. They could have easily been facing each other if it wasn't for the uphill slope of the stairs. Last year, my father accidentally broke the one in the bottom. We only have the one on top, at least until we hid all the mirrors away.

It was only four days after his big tantrum that my parents finally explained to me what happened to Xavier that night that got him rattled. My mother said they were all in bed, sleeping. It was dark and this was around the time Lexa and I just finished watching movies. My mother felt Xavier get up from his bed. When she opened her eyes, she saw him just standing in front of the mirror in the room. And, without warning, he smashed it with his fist. 

I thought about all of this as I sat there, holding the compact mirror, gazing at my eyes behind my newly repaired glasses. And I heard Xavier say ""miyoy"" again for the third time.

Since all the mirrors disappeared around the house, there are instances when Xavier would say ""miyoy"", his hand outstretched in a manner that we taught him long ago every time he wants to ask us for something. He would reach a hand, palm open and ask, ""Mama, I want..."" and then speak the name of the object. He doesn't say, ""Mama, I want..."" anymore but just go straight in naming the object he wants. And for a time, in the last couple of of months, he would, almost unceremoniously and out of nowhere, ask for ""miyoy"".

We would refuse him and tell him we have no mirrors anymore. My mother would sometimes tell him we removed them because he's hurt himself with it and we don't want that to happen again. Sometimes he would plainly accept this explanation, or sometimes he would go on for a few more minutes asking for ""miyoy"" again before he would stop altogether and go back to whatever he's doing at the time.

But it was only at that moment when I was holding the compact mirror when I realized that maybe he wasn't asking for a mirror. Maybe...he was checking to see if we have mirrors. And right now I was holding one. Did he sense it? Why is he saying that word again from across my parents' bedroom? I shut the compact mirror and put it away in one of the drawers of my desk. I walked to the hallway and couldn't help but look at that glaring empty space where one of the mirrors used to be. I slid my hand on the door knob of my parents' bedroom and turned. I walked in and saw Xavier on the bed and he was looking right at me as soon as I appeared.

He didn't say anything, just smiled in his usual manner, and then looked at his cell phone which he was playing with. I stood there for a couple more seconds before I called to him. I don't know why I've done it but this creeping suspicion and curiosity was nagging at me. 

""X,"" I said. ""Stairs.""

Nothing. It didn't register. He didn't look at me.

I repeated again, calling his name a few times to beckon his attention. When he did look at me, I made a motion to illustrate the word I was telling him. ""Stairs,"" I repeated. I don't know what I was trying to accomplish here and felt really stupid.

But then, he put his hand on his forehead...right at his scar from years ago when he smashed that plate on his face.

Numb, I nodded. ""Yes."" I said quietly. ""Stairs.""

He kept his fingers on the scar and then he answered. ""Miyoy?"" with a slight raise in tone at the end as if he was asking me a question too.

""No mirrors."" I told him and I felt something constrict in my throat. I wanted to cry and I can't exactly understand why this was such an emotional moment for me.

But Xavier just smiled when I answered him. In his own way, I knew he trusted me. 

There are no more mirrors in the house anymore. Just like that step in our staircase my father had removed years ago. Whatever it is that has bothered him about these objects, they're gone. He doesn't have to harm himself or us anymore.

""Love you,"" I managed to murmur as I blinked my eyes to get rid of the tears that are beginning to form. I immediately left, almost knocking over the chair near my desk on the way to the bed where I collapsed. I was breathing hard. I don't know why I feel suddenly so mentally exhausted. After a few minutes I was calm again. I sat back on the bed and looked across the drawer where I put the compact mirror. I stood up and took it from its prison. I didn't flip it open. I just stared at it in the palm of my hand. And then I dropped it to the floor and it made contact with my slipper as I repeatedly brought my foot down again and again until it was utterly destroyed.

Inexplicable relief washed over me. That singular action was cathartic. I was chuckling to myself as I look around my room when my eye caught something from under the bed. Its shape was familiar. I could see its metal frame peeking from the shadows from under my bed.

Oh, I thought, there it is.

I think it was a month ago when my father went in my room while I was sleeping and he stirred me awake and told me that he had to hide the bathroom mirror in my room because there was no place in the storage. He decided to place it underneath my bed. I almost forgot that it was there...that it had been there for weeks. Until now.

I stayed where I was as I typed a quick text message to one of my friends, telling her about the ""miyoy"" thing. It didn't feel enough though. So I opened my laptop and started typing this all down, hoping to make sense of the weird things happening to my brother, hoping it will help me understand if there are certain gaps in places inside the house we've lived in for two decades now that only he could connect with, only he could sense, but fail to communicate it verbally with us. I want to know what it was about that step in the staircase, about the mirrors in the house that have gotten him so angry and maybe even a little scared that he had to lash out.

It's funny how selective memory works and the timely ways certain remnants of the past could just re-surface without you being able to be completely in control of it. Right now, I remember asking my father one time why he and my mother decided to place those mirrors directly on top and below the staircase. And he would laugh, and say something about Feng Shui although I know that he must have been joking. He said it's to ensure that spirits will encounter their reflections in the mirror the moment they climb the steps of the stairs and therefore this would trap them inside the mirrors. It was a funny joke, I know.

And then I also remembered a very old tradition concerning stairs called ""Oro, Plata, Mata."" It was said that in constructing the staircase, you must count each step using these words and that the last step towards the top should always be ""ORO"" which means ""gold"". It will bring consistent prosperous times to the household. ""Plata"", which is silver, will also do.

But never have your staircase end with ""Mata"" which means ""death"".

I wonder now. If superstitions such as this were true, then perhaps something did climb our stairs years ago and was trapped by the mirrors which served as a barricade that prevented it from ever getting out again. It stayed there until my father broke the mirror by accident at the bottom of the stairs. Maybe it can now freely move around, going through mirror through mirror. Maybe my brother saw it that night. Maybe, when I tried to look up at the one in my parents' bedroom as I knelt there surrounded by the broken shards, it was still there so Xavier had to destroy the rest of the mirror or I will see it--

--or it will see me.

I don't know. It's just my imagination theorizing these things.

But then I just returned from walking down the staircase and up again, muttering ""Oro, Plata, Mata"" the entire time until I reached the last step above. I just had to make sure. I was thankful that it ended with ""Plata."" I laughed at myself and was about to return to my room, eager to finish my entry, when I abruptly turned around when it hit me. I stared down the staircase below me, engulfed in the dark and I couldn't bring myself to look away from it for a whole minute which felt like eternity.

The missing step.

If it was still there..if Xavier didn't obsessively fixate on it to the point of hurting himself, if my parents didn't have the insight or the providence to make an association between the two things and have that pesky step removed...

...the last step I just reached would have meant death.

So I stood there on top of the stairs and remembered once again the time when I watched Xavier tumble down its steps with that look of disbelief in his face. 

Try as I could, I just don't remember pushing him."

I'm currently doing freelance web and mobile app development, but mostly web. I was an intern for the summer between my junior and senior year, using mostly web dev technologies.


On a whim, I applied to a private bilingual (i.e. English primarily, some Arabic) school in Kuwait in June. I wasn't job searching then at all, because I was doing some freelance work that was going to keep me busy throughout the summer, and I decided that I'd look for work (in the US) in July/August so that I could start in September. I was rejected for the job, told that it was because they didn't have it in their budget to hire another teacher from overseas and that it wasn't about me. I let it go, then started my job search late June and got a lot of bites (which was surprising to me, because finding an internship was TOUGH last year). I started the interview process with 4 companies last week, then I got a call - the school wanted to offer me the job as the Information Technology/Computers teacher for grades 1 through 5. The contract is for one year, and I'll have the opportunity to renew it next year for another year.


I have personal reasons for wanting to take the job - my parents live in Kuwait, the pay is pretty good, and I lived there for 8 years previously so it isn't new to me. I just worry about whether it would affect my job prospects afterwards. I'll only be doing it for 1 or 2 years maximum. I'll be continuing the freelance web and mobile app development, but I worry it won't be enough to look good on my resume. Will teaching overseas be a red flag of any sort? Would my knowledge look ""outdated"" to recruiters/hiring managers if I tried looking for a job in 1 or 2 years in the US? Keep in mind that this would be my first job after graduating. I'd appreciate any thoughts/opinions."

However, next summer I'm looking to go out of state for an internship because I live in Alaska, and it doesn't offer many structural engineering opportunities (I'm planning to use my Civ degree to become a structural engineer). I'd also like to be able to live in a bigger city and on my own for a summer before I graduate in 2 years.

So I've just got a few questions about pursuing out of state internships.
1) Do larger firms even consider hiring interns that are from out of state?
2) If so, is it likely that some companies pay for housing, or help with housing? Being a college student money isn't exactly flowing off the trees for me.
3) Since I'm an out of state student, when are the best times to start applying for those internships?

Any answers would be much appreciated!! "

I don't normally post that much so forgive me if this reads too awkwardly, but this has been clawing at me for some time so I figured I'd ask you all for advice.  

  I'm going into my fifth and final year as an EE. I applied for 20+ internships for the summer in February/March/Early April, but only got one interview at Lockheed, which didn't lead anywhere. It's unlikely that I'll have any other opportunities for internships, unless I end up having to stay for part of a sixth year.  

That being said, I *do* currently work at my school's engineering building as ""lab support"", which does involve some work that would be found at an internship. For example, I'm responsible for fixing test equipment (o-scopes, DMMs, etc.) and writing test code for the microcontrollers that we use in some of our courses. I was told by the Lockheed interviewers that the internship position I applied for was extremely similar to the job I currently hold.  

**I guess what I'm really asking is this:** I know that not having an internship is a disadvantage for my future prospects, but given my current job, I'd like to know just how much of a disadvantage I'm at. Also, I'd like to know if anyone has any suggestions as to what I can do in my final year to gain additional experience and improve my prospects once I graduate.  

As I said earlier, this has been eating at me for a while now, so I appreciate any advice anyone can give me, good or bad. Thanks for reading."

In the fall semester in 2010, I attended a university in my home state of Tennessee. I wasn't ready for school and failed two semesters. I was never dismissed, but decided to leave at attend community college in VA (where my parents had moved to). Well, I attended for the fall of 2011 and failed again. I took a semester off, found a halfway decent job and went back in the fall for 2012. I did better (1 B, 1 C, and 1 F), but not good enough. At this point, my CGPA at the community college was a 1.13. 

I took two years off, moved back to Tennessee, went to a trade school and found a great job. I did well and at the end of the two years, I had decided to give it one last shot and go back to the community college for the fall of 2014. I did well (I ended with a 3.0 for the semester, but it was better than I did before). I attended the spring of 2015 and received a 3.5 and I am now attending for the summer of 2015. My current community college GPA is a 2.63 and should be a 2.8+ at the end of this semester (*knocks on wood*. I'm doing well right now with 3 A's and 1 B.)

I applied to my old university in TN this spring, but I was rejected. 

I am also involved in a couple of clubs on campus and have recently begun volunteering in the neighborhood. I am also applying for internships, though I am doubtful with my history and community college status. 

I plan to apply for spring semester at a list of Virginia schools. If I dont get in, I will just graduate the following semester (spring of 2016) and hope I can get in then.

7) Longwood University

8) James Madison University (reach)

9) Virginia Tech (reach)

10) William and Mary (reach)

3cz8ek,1,2015-07-11,TIFU By Ignoring Detour Signs,Bioniclegenius,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3cz8ek/tifu_by_ignoring_detour_signs/,"So. First time posting here, though I've been stalking this subreddit for quite some time. Obligatory dating: this actually, yes, happened today to me. I ended up driving probably around 330 miles or so all told today, and this happened in the first half, the trip out. Buckle in and get ready for the ride!

So, tiny bit of background. I've only recently got my license, and I could be missing three fingers and still count the number of long-distance car trips I've made solo on that same poor, mangled hand. Well, before today, anyways. After today, I'd need to use the other hand or a toe or something. Also, the highway that this happened on is only sorta a highway - it's two-way, one lane each, no median, and the speed limit is 55. I drive a mom van, or more specifically, a Chrysler Town and Country.

So I was driving along the road, jamming out to my tunes, enjoying the lack of other drivers, and I'm about 30 miles out from my starting point. I'm on a trip to finally visit my girlfriend for the first time this summer - we both go to college together, but in the summer we live quite a ways apart. Thanks to my internship I'm about an hour closer to her, but it's still over two hours away. Anyways, I pass this brief sign saying ""Road Closed in 6 Miles, Detour"". I wasn't given much warning, and I was already past it, so I kept going.

Quick excerpt for some background. I've only ever hit detours one other time, and that time was in the middle of Kansas City (it's on the border between Kansas and Missouri, in the US, for all you people who aren't knowledgeable of this region. It's pretty near center of the continental US), and the workers were really lazy - they just put one sign saying ""hey, this is closed, go this way."" The other way never led back, and I got hopelessly lost until I got help from some locals (my parents). Therefore, I didn't much trust these signs, and tended to not want to get lost.

So! I continue down the road for six miles, keeping a close eye out. Sure enough, there's a roadblock up there, saying something about the road being closed... for the fall. Due to bridge maintenance/work. I was slightly quizzical of it saying for the fall, considering it's the middle of summer, but I guess they started early. But, I still don't want to trust their detour because it's all highway and I don't wanna get THAT badly lost, so I take a left at a road that's quite handy right there. It goes on for a while, thin and windy, and eventually ends... in a gravel road. I take a right to try getting somewhat closer to my original road, and... drive past a cemetery... and past a field... and finally give up and turn into some lady's driveway to try and work out just what's been going on, with the aid of my handy dandy GPS, which has no data. As it turns out, I'm... off of Google maps. I am on roads that it is blind to. Then, the lady who lives in the house, some elderly peasant, comes out to stand on her porch, lean on the railing, and GLARE at me while I'm trying to figure out where to go next. I finally give up and decide to head back to the detour, which was my only hope, and back out of her driveway and move along, to which I'm sure she was very... grateful? Triumphant that she glared down the intruder? Anyways, she was happy I was gone.

I drive all the way back, through the gravel road, past the cemetery, and back down the six miles. I'm keeping as sharp an eye out for detour signs as I can on the other side of the road, ready to seize upon the turn when it shows up, and then I see one on my side - ""Detour Ended."" I had just gone PAST it.

This is where I really started messing up. I see ahead of me a bridge the highway passes over, and then it continues for a long time with no turns that I can see, and I see one short gravel driveway to my left which appears to be my last hope. I try slowing down as much as I can safely, and cranking the wheel to the left to try making it aaaaand... nope, I'm exactly one width of my car to the right of the driveway. In a very deep ditch. Some other car comes up the way I was coming and slows down, unsure of what's going on, and then just speeds up and continues. I pull all the way into the ditch, rather than leave my bumper over the near side, and now I am squarely in this ditch that has a couple tubes used to drain water to/from it on either side. This ditch is essentially shaped like an elongated bowl, and after a tiny bit of work, I'm lined up along with it, fitting quite snugly in. I'm somewhat freaking out, but I figure, hey, I got in it, I can probably get out. I check my phone to see if I can call anybody for advice or help... no signal. This entire area has no cell signal. Therefore, no data, no wifi, no cell calling, I'm on my own.

I try pulling out to the right, after checking that there's no oncoming traffic. My front wheels make it to the road, and... I can't make any progress. I back up back into the ditch, and try a different spot that's more angled on the front corner. Again, no dice. Several people passing slow down a lot, but keep going. I begin banging my head on the wheel repeatedly.

Finally, FINALLY a godsend appears - a kindly gentleman - a saint, really - pulls into the driveway, hops out of his car, and starts signalling me which way to go. In my panic I had failed to notice one part that was much smoother than the rest on the bowl, mostly because it was along a line of trees that made the far wall up. I misunderstand and try the corner under his direction, not making any progress, then he frantically directs me to back up and come HIS way, not the other side of the pipe. I kinda pull forward, roll my window down, and confirm with him that yes, this is how I can get out of the ditch, and yes, that detour was actually the correct one. I manage to pull forward, onto the driveway, and under his careful eye for oncoming traffic, a bit into the street so I can more align myself and back up back into the driveway. I then manage to get onto the road properly, and I'm soon zipping along merrily, with a healthy dose of adrenaline.

I take the detour, only to find out that these road workers, aside from their paltry amount of forewarning, actually did their job properly - every couple miles or so along the detour, they put a sign marked with the road I had been on and the word ""Detour"" with an arrow pointing ahead, just to let me know that yes, I was on the right track.

I maneuver through the detour's roads, and finally make it back onto the proper road. No further trouble happens the rest of the drive, but you can bet that I sure had the adrenaline to keep me alert and going for quite a while longer.

For those of you who wish to hear about after the drive, I showed up, had a great time with my girlfriend, we all went swimming for about four hours, and I got a reasonably bad sunburn, though not an absolutely terrible one. Drive home was uneventful, thanks to me actually knowing about the detour in advance.

TL;DR: Instead of a sign from God, got one from road workers and didn't believe it. Quickly came to terms with my own stupidity."

3czu5z,44,2015-07-12,Project Rosetta Stone was NASA's biggest project. This is why you'll never be told about it.,RememberTheirStory,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3czu5z/project_rosetta_stone_was_nasas_biggest_project/,"I used to work for NASA as an aerospace engineer. To date, it was the greatest job I've ever had. In reality, it didn't pay all that much, considering the time and effort I had to put into my work, but I loved every bit of it. The people, the workplace, the assignments, everything—I loved being able to say the words, ""I work for NASA."" Each and every time I'd swell up with pride upon hearing myself say those words. Of course, I was no astronaut, but I was proud of my position nonetheless.


Unfortunately, all of that is in the past tense. I no longer work for NASA. I quit a little over eight years ago now, in the spring of 2008, something my family will always resent me for. 2008 was a shitty year for the US economy, and due to that, my wife had gotten laid off. We were barely scraping by even before I quit, and then when I was out of work, things got even worse and we lost our house, which put us in the unfortunate situation of having to raise 2 kids in a 1 bedroom apartment.


Worst of all, I couldn't offer my family an explanation on why I quit. The best I could do was ""Things just weren't the same there anymore."" I couldn't explain then, and I couldn't explain two years ago when my wife divorced me after years of marital strain. 
I still can't tell them why. There's too many risks that would come with them knowing, so my family has to be kept in the dark. I know a part of them will always hate me for that, but it's what has to be done.


But I know inside myself that the things I know and have seen need to be passed on to somebody—and what better place to get information out there than the internet? What better place than a website meant for scary stories and nothing else, where this tale won't be taken with an ounce of seriousness?


Please. Please take this story and remember it. Tell it to your friends when you're all huddled around in the dark telling scary stories. Allow it to resurface in your mind when you hear NASA speak about some great new discovery they've made. Do not let them sweep it under the rug any longer. Do not allow the world to be kept in the dark. It's not a matter of believing at this point; it's just a matter of getting the information out there before the last of the people that experienced it die. Imagine a world with no Holocaust survivors to pass on their stories. That's what will happen here if people are not told, if this isn't shared.


Well, here we go, then. 


The short answer on why I quit is three simple words: Project Rosetta Stone.


It was supposed to be NASA's magnum opus, something that would change not only the future of the association, but our view of the universe too. I remember being so excited to be able to have a part in it, despite the fact that my role was little in comparison to others.


Of course, all information on the project was and is classified, because NASA was very much aware that the mission could easily fail, which would put the association at risk of a pretty massive budget cut. Success would mean a public unveiling of the entire project and its results; failure meant for the entire thing to be terminated and wiped clean of all records - and obviously, it wasn't the former that happened.


Project Rosetta Stone sounded great in theory. What NASA planned to do was send a group of astronauts out into the depths of our galaxy and attempt to locate extraterrestrial life; if it were intelligent, communicate with it, and if not, take it back to Earth. The astronauts were going to be equipped with some heavy duty technology, some stuff that NASA's best scientists had been developing for decades by that time, and the spacecraft was NASA's best at the time. The project was the result of many years of planning, drafting, editing, and preparing. The amount of time and effort that went into preparation for this project was astounding. 


It was a long shot, of course. I don't think anyone truly expected for the project to end with success. But the 'what ifs' of the project were enough to keep people interested, including the companies that made under-the-table donations to the project. In fact, Google was one of our top supporters—but you'll never hear that from anyone, not even if you're one of Google's higher-ups. I don't mean to sound accusatory, it's just...it's changed the way I view the companies that funded one of the biggest mistakes mankind has ever made, and then had the nerve to help NASA cover it up.
But that's neither here nor there.


The way the plan was laid out was this: the astronauts would skip over Mercury, Venus, and Mars for the simple reason that they were easy to reach in terms of space travel, and so NASA didn't want to waste time and resources on exploring planets that would have robots on them within the next few decades anyways. No, NASA wanted to go deeper than that. Project Rosetta Stone included an exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their respective moons. 


Impossible, you must be thinking. It takes 3-5 years to reach Jupiter from Earth, and even longer for the rest, doesn't it? In terms of today's standards, yes, it does. Not for Project Rosetta Stone, it wouldn't. It would take the astronauts only one year. Again, though, you'll never be taught that in science class. Hell, even if you work for NASA, even if you're a goddamn astronaut, you wouldn't know that in February of 2008, a human spacecraft had landed on Jupiter's moon, Europa, after only one year, two months, and 18 days of space travel.


That technology is gone now, though. The spacecraft is gone, its blueprints destroyed, its story locked away in some filing cabinets. I guess in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter that nobody knows of this extraordinary accomplishment, because we may never do it again—at least if we value our safety on Earth, we won't.


Anyway, you can see why nobody was really expecting success; how, after all, could aliens be lurking in our own solar system, going undetected for so many years? Blasphemy! Of course that couldn't happen. Of course humans couldn't be so blind or stupid as to ignore something as incredible as extraterrestrial life when it was so close to them. That's what we thought. It's what I thought, it's what the astronauts thought, it's what our bosses thought.


We were wrong.


I'll skip the part about the journey over there. It went smoothly, and for the most part, it was honestly pretty boring. Instead, I'll tell you the names of the four astronauts that lost their lives while on this mission. Please remember their names—Joshua Bing, David Sykes, Eric Criddle, and Julie Anderson. Those are their real names. You can search for records, family members, graves...but you won't find anything. That was made certain. They didn't get funerals. Their families weren't given anything for the losses. Their names were covered up, forgotten, gone like ghosts in the wind.


On February 9th, 2008, those four astronauts landed on Europa. Everyone thought the moons would be the most boring part of the mission. Their assignment was to land, drill, and leave. Collecting mineral samples and all of that, see what the surface was made of. It was supposed to be quick and easy. Boring, even. But imagine their surprise when they drilled a little too hard and a little too far and hit water.


That's right. Real, liquid water, the kind of water we have on Earth—granted, freezing cold and practically untouchable, but it was water. The team back at home on Earth went nuts over this. Water is a clear sign of life in any environment. Where there's water, things can thrive, and it could be anything from single-celled microorganisms to some intelligent aquatic lifeforms. They didn't know which it would be, or if there would be such a thing at all, so the team was ordered to drill more holes and collect samples of the water rather than the surface itself.


The mission was put on hold for several weeks while samples of Europa's newfound water source, which was, as we discovered, practically an entire subterranean ocean, were collected. Weeks went by with nothing of note to show. If there was anything living in that water, they couldn't find it right away.


Then things began to happen. Holes appeared in the surface that everyone claimed they didn't drill; upon further inspection, they found that the holes were made by something underneath the surface. As if that wasn't bone-chilling enough, scratches on the ground surrounding the water began to appear in the form of three wide, long gashes. It was unlike anything we'd ever seen before, but they knew what it was all the same: a marking of extraterrestrial origin, likely made by a hand or a nail of some kind.


Something had come out of that ocean, and was now on the surface with them.


They wanted to leave. They wanted off of that moon. But NASA wasn't having that. They called it the ""discovery of the century."" They were fully convinced that there was alien life on Europa, and those atronauts weren't leaving until they had something to show for that mission, whether it was a picture or a corpse. I began feeling uneasy around then, and God, did I feel terrible for those atronauts out there, risking their lives in the face of some unknown danger. But I kept on with my duties. I was helpless to stop what was to come, being light years away.


Another week went by after the scratches appeared with no incident, but that isn't to say that each and every day wasn't filled with tension and fear. Those were the worst days of the whole mission, I think—waiting for something to show itself, and to keep being disappointed (or relieved?) time and time again. It felt like a year went by in that week.


March 25th, 2008. A radio broadcast to Earth, informing us that David was missing. Nobody knew where he could have gone; they woke up in the shuttle that morning and he wasn't there, nor was he outside. Nobody really wanted to go looking any further.


Two days later, on the 27th of March, David's body floated up to the surface of the water. The only reason they knew it was David was because, being the only four people to ever step foot on Europa, there was no one else it could be. That doesn't mean his body was recognizable; it was bloated and grotesque thanks to the time it spent trapped in the water. Normally, they would have just assumed he had drowned, if not for the fact that he was naked and bruised.


With only three left, they begged home base to be allowed to come home. Eric was practically catatonic, as David was one of his closest friends at work. NASA continued to refuse their request, and they refused the astronauts' request for their families to be made aware of the situation.


March 30th, 2008 was the last day we heard from the remaining three astronauts. Their last communication attempt with Earth consisted of three separate radio broadcasts, made at 1:17PM, 5:55PM, and finally 11:31PM. 


The first one consisted of Julie's voice, informing us that they had locked themselves inside the shuttle upon hearing strange noises outside. She described them as ""wet, squishy sounds"" accompanied by occasional gurgling noises. They didn't know what the sounds were, but they didn't have to in order to sense the danger.


A few hours went by with no word. Then we received the 5:55 broadcast, now with Josh's voice. Eric, in a burst of rage, had flown outside the shuttle despite Julie and Josh's pleas with the intent of either killing or capturing whatever was out there. They weren't totally sure what he planned to do, but said that they were listening, as there had been no noise for the last 20 minutes, not from Eric or the things outside. 


They heard Eric's frantic screams then, and unfortunately, we did too. Josh quickly undid the lock and ran outside, but he was too late; all he saw was Eric's beaten, bloody form being dragged into the water by some unseen creature. His screams stopped then, and the transmission ended after Julie began to cry. We were left in suspense for another six hours.


The last transmission is more sad than it is scary, I'm afraid. Julie's voice came to us first, and at first she was hard to understand, as it was evident she was crying while speaking. After a few minutes, though, her words became more clear. She was saying goodbye. I heard my name amongst the words she was whispering, and that's when I finally broke down crying. 


After she ended her speech, Josh began to talk to us. His voice was more steady and clear to hers, but the sadness was all too evident. Like Julie, Josh spoke about his family and the people I loved—particularly, mentioned several times was his 9 year old son, shattering our hearts even further. Josh begged for his family to be told the truth, and we all promised that they would be, knowing all too well it was a promise we couldn't keep.


I think about Josh's final words a lot; each and every time I hear about space travel, they come back into the front of my mind, almost daring me to say them out loud. ""We go into space expecting to find heaven, and instead we stumble upon hell.""


The transmission ended there. We never heard from them again. No efforts were ever made to recover the shuttle or the bodies from Europa, and I quit my job in mid April, haunted by the mission and feeling as if I had their blood on my hands.


We still don't know what those astronauts' murderer looks like. Part of me hopes we never will. If you were expecting a picture or a description, I'm sorry to disappoint. I don't think Earth is ready for that; God knows those astronauts weren't.


My oldest son has an internship at NASA now. Recently, he told me that there's talk of some fantastic new mission that'll change the future of NASA itself. He says he's been an observer to some of the speeches, and that they're speaking of some extraordinary new shuttle called the Europa Clipper.


History repeats itself. I know NASA will be going back to that god forsaken moon sometime in the likely near future. I know that people's interest in Europa seems to be resurfacing. There's nothing I can do to stop it, but maybe, just maybe, if the right person hears about this, maybe they'll think twice before they let NASA ship them off to a distant place where we have no business being."

Right now, Im going into my third year into my university's chemical engineering program with a GPA of 3.44. I know that is not ""bad"" by any means, but it would have been much higher had I not had any extracirriculars during the school year. I have had one previous internship experience in the past, but i dont think its what employers are looking for since it was a small internship at my school and i didnt really learn any useful skills marketable for industry. I didnt get an internship for this summer which is part of the reason why I'm constantly stressed about my future.

I have one friend who last summer got an internship with an engineering company and this summer hes part of an REU program. I always find myself comparing his achievements against mine and feeling bummed about it since hes obviously buildng a stronger resume for himself than I am.

I know Im not in the worst of positions but I cant relax. I feel like if I dont get an internship next summer before I graduate, I wont be able to find an engineering-related job in the future. 

I dont know if you guys have been through this/are going through this, too, so what I ask is some advice on how to handle this.

How do I relax? How do I stop putting so much pressure on myself? How do I stay optimistic and confident about my future? 

Again, sorry for the long post.

Hey guys! I intended to do this much earlier, but between starting my new job and some family issues going on, this is a bit late. So here is what I've decided based on the interest garnered with the last post. 

Here's a summary:

* 4 sessions. 
* Streaming my talks via http://www.twitch.tv (will post my actual account later). 
* 9 - 10 pm PST Tuesday nights. Wednesday's or Thursday's can be done instead if the group should prefer
* Initially, I will only be working with 15 people. 
* I'll give each person 2 mock interviews, one before and one after the 4 sessions.  
* My goal is to finish all of by mid September, just in time for career fairs.

---

To be selected, please fill out the form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZpFGwrT8f_r7W3f_S8faVlrsrmgUpi7T8Th95LyC8_0/viewform. I'll get back to you guys next weekend, depending on how many applications there are of course. Please fill this out to the best of your ability. I didn't making much required, but I do recommend you put everything in.

I would take more people, but I'd really like to personalize this experience so that it is the most beneficial. There are general interview tips that are good rules of thumb for everyone, but Google can do a better job of giving those to you than I can. I'm going to try and do this regularly so be on the look out! Just because you aren't in the first 15 doesn't mean I won't help you. 

Time permitting, I'll attempt to send some feedback to each individual based on the form.

If you have any questions or comments, please provide the feedback so I can improve. This is my first go at doing this, so sorry for the noobness.

I have about a semester and a half of college left but because of internships, I was able to secure a permanent position as a programmer at a great company. I'm making a decent amount of money and enjoying my work every day. Should I take the plunge and spend another $7,000 or so on classes? Or should I wait for the tuition bubble to pop and finish my degree at a later time when the cost of tuition is much lower?

I really don't learn much in class. Everything I know, I've learned on my own or at work. It is unbelievable how much more you learn in the real world. Note that I'm talking about development - you learn more about real development in the real world. While a CS degree has taught me a lot of theory that I wouldn't learn on the job, my development courses have been pretty much useless when it comes to learning how to build real applications.

So should I spend the money to finish the degree? Does it no longer really matter since I can just finish it when it's cheaper? If I were to get a solid year or two of experience as a programmer and then lose my job, would I have a hard time finding a new job without the degree?

I'm not lazy...I get straight A marks. I am just tired of spending money on what has proven to be a very expensive and overvalued experience. I would rather spend the money on an awesome hacker bootcamp and all the theoretical CS books I can fit in my room!"

""Something I never understood is why all these executives have their children as interns.  Wouldn't it make more sense if they hired students who don't have those kinds of connections spoon fed to them, and would actually work hard?  Give them a chance to network?""

She looked a little uncomfortable, but gave me a half smile and turned back around.  My other intern buddy comes to my desk later and says, ""Hey /u/POUND_MY_ANUS_SENPAI, you know you were talking to the CEO's daughter, right?""

What.  The.  Fuck.  How the fuck did I not know that from last year?  So, I pretty much obliterated any chances of getting with this girl, and probably ruined my chance to ever go far in this place.

#The situation

I'm a summer student (intern, basically) at this company. I got there because the company I was previously going to be a summer student at got bought by them recently, and they decided to take on all of the summer students from the company they bought as their own (pretty nice of them). As part of the process of getting set up as an employee of this new company, though, they've asked me to agree to some contracts, two of which have one paragraph each that I strongly object to. I haven't agreed to anything yet (except offer of employment and a short agreement just says they can use a photo of me on my ID card and on internal websites), so I think it's safe (legally) for me to post this.

Excerpt from the first contract (Code of Business Conduct and Ethics):

&gt;Employees must disclose any invention, improvement, concept, trademark or design prepared or developed in connection with their employment with [company] and [company] is the exclusive owner of such property.

When I saw that, I thought I should get some clarification on the meaning of ""in connection with"", and that, at the *absolute* worst, they're claiming ownership of anything I think about while in the office (because I'd be using their office space as a place to think). But then I came to the below.

Excerpt from the second contract (Confidentiality Statement) (emphasis mine):

&gt;I agree that I will make full and prompt disclosure to [company], and to no other party, of **all** inventions, improvements, discoveries, developments, computer software and documentation and other works of authorship, whether patentable or not, **that are written or developed by me alone or jointly with others** during my employment, **whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of [company]** (collectively, the ""Inventions""). I hereby assign to [company] all of my right, title and interest in and to each Invention throughout the world, including all trade secrets, patent rights and copyrights therein, and I further agree to waive my moral rights in each Invention. I agree to cooperate fully with [company], both during and after the termination of my employment with [company], with respect to signing further documents and doing such acts and other things reasonably requested by [company] to confirm such transfer of ownership effective at the time the Invention is created and to obtain patents or copyrights or the like covering Inventions. I will not receive any consideration or royalties in respect of such transfer of ownership, beyond my regular employment remuneration, provided that the expense of applying for patents or copyrights and the like will be borne by [company].

I understand that many companies claim ownership of intellectual property generated at work, or even during time off if the company's resources or knowledge were used in its generation, or if the IP can be applied to the benefit of the company.^([1]) From reading other threads about similar situations, such a policy tends to be indicated with language like ""in the course of employment"", which is present in the summary in the first contract (but notably absent in the full text in the second). I have no problem with giving my employer ownership of IP that I create for them. If I came up with a new process to improve the company's production, or a new logo for the company, I'd have no problem giving them that IP.

**However, this company seems to be trying to claim ownership of everything I create, 24/7, from when my employment started to when it ends. As an independent (hobby-level) inventor, who will be working on multiple inventions this summer, I find this unacceptable.** My feelings about my inventions, in general, are that I would like to release the majority of them somehow for the benefit of the world, and profit from some of them, which will only be possible if they remain my property until I do so. The company is not in any kind of science or technology development industry as far as I'm aware, and they're certainly not employing me to do any work of that nature, so don't think they *should* have a claim to my inventions. I doubt they'd even be able to use them, and it probably wouldn't be worth it for them to try to sell them. Also, as a member of a hackerspace where we frequently collaborate on projects and help each other out when we're stuck or need expertise, they seem to be claiming full ownership of any ""Invention"" I help anyone else with, so unless I stop participating in that for the summer, they could (claim to) own my friends' ""Inventions"" too, without their knowledge!

**Furthermore, I find these contracts' stipulations to be absurd even for non-inventors**—their definition of ""Invention"" specifically covers all forms of IP I can think of, not just actual inventions. That means that if I write a letter to a friend, I must ""promptly and fully disclose"" that letter to the company (no privacy!), and if I write a book or compose a piece of music or take a photo, the company owns that too.

I value my inventions (and other ""Inventions"") more than my summer job. I would like to have both, though. I have not agreed to any of these contracts yet.^([2]) The Confidentiality Statement is a condition of employment; it says that if I refuse to sign it, my offer of employment is invalidated. (I signed the offer a couple of weeks ago, before I got to the company and had a chance to read the contracts. It didn't contain any NDA or other restrictions on me.) Obviously, I will not sign these in their current forms. I'd require the quoted paragraphs to be struck from the respective contracts, possibly to be replaced by paragraphs that give them ownership of only the IP I create while I'm actually at work. I also don't mind waiving moral rights in the IP I create that they get ownership of. I will not agree unless the contracts are actually altered; promises to not use the powers they're giving themselves are not an acceptable compromise. (If they're not going to use the power, why not strike it?) Therefore, I'd like to talk to somebody in the company who has the power to do that. Many of the contracts mention talking to one's supervisor, the HR manager, or the CFO in case of questions about the contracts, so I guess I'll go in that order.

Keeping my inventions in my mind until the end of my employment is not an option: The contracts don't, as far as I can tell, specify whether an ""Invention"" is created when I first think of it or when I first record it. I think any competent lawyer could argue that ""developing"" an invention encompasses thinking about it. And if I don't write them down when I think of them, I'll forget them. Also, I'm working on multiple inventions that are part of a contest that has a deadline before the end of my employment, and also for which progress is wanted to be shown on the inventions before the deadline. (No, the contest doesn't claim IP.) Lying, including implicitly or by omission, that I haven't created any IP is not an option—I want no liability whatsoever if I can avoid it, and I'll be publishing IP this summer as part of the contest.

[1] Though that kind of policy [might be starting to change](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/introducing-innovators-patent-agreement).

[2] I haven't agreed to any contracts, including the ones I'm not objecting to, and won't until this is resolved, because they're presented as a package on the HR information system, and I don't know if I can agree to them separately. (The photo use one was separate.) Nevertheless, I have been complying and intend to continue to comply with the contracts that I'm not objecting to, and the parts of the contracts whose excerpts appear above that I'm not objecting to (basically everything except what I quoted).)

#My questions to you:

1. Is this legal in Alberta? From searching /r/legaladvice, I've learned that some jurisdictions, such as Washington and California, have laws banning contracts that require employees to assign all of their IP to their employer. (However, it's legal in, e.g., Virginia.) I just don't know if Alberta (or Canada) does. [These](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2a34t9/do_i_have_ownership_over_my_side_projects/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/275ibl/ca_potential_employer_wants_me_to_sign_over/) have comments saying it's likely to be found unconscionable by a court, but I don't want to go to court over this.

2. Can you give me suggestions (not advice!) for how to proceed with getting the contracts altered? Who to talk to, what to say to each of them, etc. Should I expect that they'll ask me to sign an NDA before negotiation?

3. Some companies offer to let employees list their inventions that they want excluded from the IP ownership transfer policy; should I ask for that instead? (If I got that, I'd fight generality with generality by listing something like ""all of my non-company-related Inventions previously invented and yet to be invented"", inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/380hwm/concerning_intellectual_property/).)

4. If they don't agree to alter the contracts, I'm planning to not immediately refuse to sign (because that would immediately invalidate my employment and they'd probably immediately escort me out, but I'd like to say goodbye to coworkers from the old company/warn them about this). So, soon after negotiation, I'll either resign on my own terms or just officially refuse to sign (so as to avoid having to give notice of resignation). Is this a good idea, or should I go the immediate invalidation route? Should I refuse to accept payment (which I haven't yet received any of) from the company if I lose my job (in either way) over this, to limit my liability to them?

Thanks for reading. Sorry about the extreme length.

---

Edit: Here's what I'm going to ask for the second contract's paragraph to be changed to. I'll ask for the first contract's paragraph to be struck, because it's just a summary and is redundant. **Bold** is what I've added; I've removed nothing.

&gt;I agree that I will make full and prompt disclosure to [company], and to no other party, of all inventions, improvements, discoveries, developments, computer software and documentation and other works of authorship, **that either a) relate directly to my job duties, b) relate directly to another of [company]'s activities of which I am aware at the time I create them, or c) are created using any of [company]'s resources (including work space, information technology, knowledge, trade secrets, etc.),** whether patentable or not, that are written or developed by me alone or jointly with others during my employment, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of [company] (collectively, the ""Inventions""). **For clarity, all inventions, improvements, discoveries, developments, computer software and documentation and other works of authorship, whether patentable or not, that are written or developed by me alone or jointly with others, that do not relate directly to my job duties or to another of [company]'s activities of which I am aware at the time of creation, and are created without any use of [company]'s resources, are not ""Inventions"", and I retain all of my rights therein.** I hereby assign to [company] all of my right, title and interest in and to each Invention throughout the world, including all trade secrets, patent rights and copyrights therein, and I further agree to waive my moral rights in each Invention.

Quick background, I graduated college in May 2014 with a degree in Management Information Systems. After college I decided to stay on board with the company I was working for as a intern(at that time i've been there for a year). A few months later, I decided I wanted to look for more opportunities for a full time position as a Business System Analyst. They knew I was looking for a new role so they offered me a full time position on the team I was interning for. I was grateful for the opportunity and was satisfied with the pay/benefits. 


Now today(9 months later after I took the full time offer), i am presented an opportunity to interview for a larger company  as a BSA which will expose me to many different industries and businesses and  have much more room to grow at a faster pace. The pay increase is a good jump too.   I feel like I am getting tired of where I work today(??) since I've been there for 2 years already(a bit more than a year as an intern and a little bit less than a year as full time). However I feel like if I take this interview I feel guilty that i am betraying the company that stuck with me since I was in college...


 what are your thoughts? and lastly I havent done too well in interviews in the past so what are some interview tips??



TLDR; need advice to either stay with company I've been with for 2 years(1year intern, 1 year full time) or switch over to larger company with more pay,benefits and larger room to grow. need advice on not feeling guilty. need advice on interview tips

I'm going into my senior year at a good CS university.  I feel very confident about my abilities and my experience, and I've already landed two internships that both went very well.  When I get talking about something I'm interested in, I can go on for hours, which has helped me so far in my previous interviews because I'm very passionate about what I do and I think that passion comes through pretty well.

But I've recently been suffering from massive bouts of anxiety that spike whenever I think about performing interviews, which I will certainly be doing to get my first job out of college.

I just started reading Cracking the Coding Interview and literally had to put the book down because I was shaking after the first chapter.  Even thinking about it has me sweating bullets.

I never suffered from this anxiety before.  If I did, I wouldn't have landed my two internships.

But something's different now and I stay up every night dreading the moment where I walk into the interview room but bolt out after the first question because my anxiety is just too much to deal with.

I've always been an anxious person and I'm sure this showed up in my previous interviews a little bit.  I'm okay with that, everyone gets nervous in an interview.

But what I'm dealing with now... the way I feel now, I wouldn't even make it into the building.  I'm terrified.  Typing this, my heart is beating like I'm going for a jog.

How do I deal with this anxiety?  Before, it was just an inconvenience, but now I feel it has the potential to truly ruin my life, if I can't land a job that I feel like I am totally qualified to take."

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering major that's graduating next May with a lot of future ahead of me. My biggest goal in life is to become a CEO of an important company. I have a girlfriend who I live with and a cat. I also think I may be insane.

I haven't spoken to my family in over two years. They punished my physically, when I made bad grades they would show them to my siblings to show them what a failure I was, and we would sometimes get mad at each other for days to weeks. I remember the first time I was angry with them really bad (well earliest I could remember). We stopped talking for a day or two and I was under the age of six. They sent me to bed without dinner for being angry about my dad winning over me in a race to the front door. He beat me there, I got pissed, they punished me with no dinner. After that they never punished me that way, but I would get beaten for stupid things they thought I did wrong. Like when the computer broke they would blame it on me. I used to wet my pants and they would slap me up when I came back home smelling like pee. It got to a point where I was just pissed at them all the time and the same time afraid I would get beaten for something they thought I did wrong (sometimes I did do something wrong). I also played sexual games with my cousin at times when we were young and no one was around. Sigh, I kinda think I had a fucked up childhood.

Now I'm in my 20, in college, and it's been 2 years since I've seen anyone in my family. I just left because everything I did was wrong. My parents started becoming extremly Christian and began judging me for every move I made.
If I didn't call my dad, he would just never call me. When I saw him, he would be pissed because I never called him and put the blame entirely on me. My mom would call me weekly, but every time she called, it would be an argument about her personal beliefs against mines. They hated gay people, they told me to not marry out of my race (black), and they would tell me that my major was stupid and I should go into the health field because that is the only place black people can get jobs. I just always felt punished for being black by them (because they thought white people were bad and always wanted me to stop hanging out with them), and I always stuck up for the sides I thought was right. Eventually I just grew tired of all of it and stopped calling the bigots. I actually just got a CS internship, saved up money, then bought a new phone plan and phone. Then I never told them the number. I talk to my sister on Facebook sometimes, but that's it. They have never come to look for me even though they know exactly where I live (they were paying my expenses before I cut the cord). 

In those two+ years, I have realized so much about myself. I started experimenting with psychedelics and I love them. It's made me really interested in virtual reality, other universes, human consciousness, and escaping our human reality in general. I believe humans are inferior to the next super species we will create because we waste time on stupid things like the media's dumbass propoganda they shove into our mouths. KId Rock and confederate flag? Seriously?? The fucking planet is dying dumbfucks. Why are we even wasting time with dumbass stuff???

I apologize. As I type this, my emotions are getting a bit heated, but I will calm down. My only goal in life is to manipulate people to doing my bidding and use my power to change the world for the better. I believe that we as a species can't handle getting things done on our own, and we need to automate the thinking process with a better system.

And... that's where I draw the line. I know I'm fucking crazy. I know it. My girlfriend is the nicest person I ever met. She treats me so great. I love her as much as I can love another human being, I think. She cooks for me, she does anything she can to help me, she knows I have mental problems and I totally change personalities behind closed doors. I'm not physical with her in any way, but when I get pissed, which is not too often, but sometimes I blow. Everytime she goes home, I sink back into my demonic ways. I think these thoughts all the time, and I enjoy them. She is the only one who keeps me.. human. I argue with her about why being a cyborg is better, and why we as humans should just live in a Matrix universe. 

So after reading that, what do you think is wrong with me? My favorite television characters are Frank Underwood, Walter White, the guy from Nightcrawler, and anyone who has those type of personalities (Isaac Newton or Alan Turing for example). I believe that I have this wrong hunger for power and my girlfriend doesn't deserve a person like me to fuck up her values.

Honestly, I want to change. What should I do?

3d21f7,1,2015-07-12,How should someone like me approach dating? Should I give up and focus on success?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3d21f7/how_should_someone_like_me_approach_dating_should/,"This is my first time truly sharing this story in full, so sorry it's so long! This is all related to the question, I promise. First off, I've had social anxiety issues my entire life. I've never really faced this problem until the last six months. I actually find it very easy to talk to new people one on one, but I am not good with big groups. All through high school I was very critical of myself and very negative. I had a verbally abusive father when I was younger and I think that some of these issues stem from that. I actually had a lot of friends but I failed to see it at the time. Many people thought that I was stupid since I was socially awkward and didn't talk very much. I always turned down invitations to most social events and people eventually stopped inviting me. 

My approach to overcoming this problem was try to be ridiculously successful. I thought that if I was successful that people would accept me no matter how weird or awkward that I was. So I went to a high ranking college for software development and decided to double major in CS and SE. I lived at home and didn't care about making friends. All I wanted was to get to the top and to be rich. I read all kinds of stuff about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and aspired to be like them. So I went through college and made zero friends, although I did make a few at my side retail job. My retail job was honestly my only social life through college. Sad, I know, but true. I spent all my free time working on side projects... mobile apps, games, stock market software, etc. 

Here I am now. None of my projects were particularly successful, but they did build up an impressive resume. I've gotten internship offers from Amazon, Microsoft, etc. I'm working as a software intern at a local defense contractor and have helped build the groundwork for a huge new product for them. They've already given me a job offer. It's what I always wanted, so I should be happy, right? Nope. I feel incredibly empty. 

Now that I'm not working at my retail job around tons of new people every day, I realize how empty my life truly is. I have hardly any social interaction now except family and a few coworkers. I've been trying online dating for five months but all it's done is make me depressed. I'm not a very attractive guy but I've worked on my personality and body language GREATLY over the last five months. I feel more confident than ever and am less awkward in social situations. I actually managed to go on three dates from the whole thing with very attractive women but they all eventually stopped replying to me. Most people that I message never reply. I truly do care about having a meaningful relationship and am a very loving person. I might sound negative on here, but in real life people that know me say that I'm funny, kind, and caring. Women just don't seem to be attracted to me though. I feel that there's not much that I can do about my looks and I don't have many interesting things to talk to them about since the last four years of my life have been all about my career. 

As a little experiment I created a fake profile with my same pictures and basic info but put a much higher income. I also changed the wording a bit to indirectly sound financially successful. And what happened? I had a much higher message response rate. Perhaps my reasoning was correct about trying to be successful.


Now! Here's the part where I need advice. When I stop trying to date and focus solely on  success again, I don't feel as depressed, but I do feel empty. I think about my loneliness less if I'm deep into some new project. If I try to date, my anxiety is through the roof and the rejection causes all sorts of depression. I feel truly awful about myself when I try to date. 

Should I continue to try to become as rich and successful as possible then find women who like me for my money? That's better than nothing I suppose. Messed up, but at least I won't be alone. Or should I continue to try to date and have a more interesting social life, but face constant rejection and depression? I don't know where to turn or what to do."

The one thing I'm worried about though is my GPA. It's slightly below 3.0, due to me being depressed my sophomore year and overall not really having motivation/dicking around in school. I'm going to try to bring my GPA up during my senior year, but I'm still kind of worried that it's going to kill my chances of finding a job despite my internship this summer.

The main file imports weekly information form a certain files, and imagine it copies the values present in those columns to my main file and in another week file the same information is there but with some different changes. You can noticed the changes by the column ""M"" I will explain what are the changes in the information that is imported it's  496 it's in trial when it is good to go it changes it status to 800 and it's ready to be implemented so I need it when detects a specific value that was 496 now in 800 to change the line where it is in to the other value of the other file like so:



value from week 12: addf asdafd asds 496

value from week 24: addf asdafd asds 800  




The values that are in the SourceWb.Sheets(1) are always 496 and in the SourceWb.Sheets(2) always 800, the values that are present in SourceWb.Sheets(1) eventually will pass to the SourceWb.Sheets(2) and then I need to replace the file that is present in the main file that is 496 for the 800 one, when they pass from 496 to 800 it always occurs in another file like in week 12 file is 496 in SourceWb.Sheets(1) and then imagine in week 20 file it's in the SourceWb.Sheets(2)  and it's 800. So what I need to do is to then when importing replace the line where the information from week 12 SourceWb.Sheets(1)  and 496 to the one from SourceWb.Sheets(2). It probably is simple but I cannot do it, If more information is needed just say it.

    Sub ImportData()
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Dim Path As String, Lstrw As Long

I’ve had an internship before that was mainly front end web development work with PHP and some Javascript and I was good enough in that company to get regular freelance work.

My “problem” started with this second internship, it’s a big trading firm and I’m working as an IT developer with the .NET framework. I work with another intern and it became very obvious early on how much more competent he was than myself. The best way for me to describe him is that he seems to have an amazing high level understanding of programming and its concepts with an ability to “zoom” down into the lower levels of understanding very easily (also a lot better at googling things than me as silly as that may sound). 


We have a project to work on together for ten weeks and are working closely with two other developers. During meetings he’s able to engage them in conversation and ask questions that go completely over my head, they can easily spend a good half hour talking about things in which I’m struggling to keep up with.
At first this bothered me a lot, it made me feel useless and stupid. In the month or so that I’ve been here I’ve reasoned that the point of this internship is for me to learn and I began enjoying myself a lot learning from both the developers and this other intern who is a very nice and easy to talk to guy. 

My question to you guys is; **How can I become like this other intern?**


So far I’m looking into doing a lot more reading into the topic (e.g. the pragmatic programmer and blogs from industry experts), of course a lot more practice, but maybe there’s something I’m missing?

24 y/o Comp.Sci. student, ~5 years experience in web development at a small company (my only relevant work experience in the field, started as intern then hired full-time).

I consider myself a terrible developer, truly. I lurk around programming forums and subreddits about the subject and I feel really dumb in comparison to most people, like these people are light-years ahead of me. 

The company i work for is small and the codebase is terrible. I don't learn anything anymore and I feel stagnant. Honestly i'm really tired of my current job and need a change of scenery, I'm about to quit because of some personal issues (have been struggling with depression for quite a few years) and also because i'm really tired of dealing with REALLY shitty code. Since i've been depressed for so long i never had much motivation to study by myself and neither to put much effort into my uni studies although i have an average score of 9.1 of a maximum of 10 in my uni course (my uni isn't a top one though). I didn't graduate yet because i'm struggling with my bachelor thesis, i'm kinda stuck in this academic nightmare, heh (my depression had a big role in it too).

I genuinely think i'm becoming dumb. I mean, i was able to deal with almost all the problems that arose during my time in this company, but of course many times i had to seek help of more experienced people. I'm stressing myself out because of my current job since I can't see any improvement in my skills and i'm not learning the technical stuff i need to become a better professional. With almost five years in this field I barely can say that i've the skills of a junior level position. The system in my current job doesn't even use OO even though we use a PHP framework that was supposed to be OO. The system is so flawed and I don't wanna be around when this thing crashes (i wasn't one of the people that started it, I just gave maintenance in some modules and made new ones, etc). I can't avoid thinking that i wasted my time staying for so long in this company. I created roots in my comfort zone here and i regret it deeply. I have no future here and i don't know what to do.

Earlier this year i had an interview  with a multinational company that contacted me through linkedin and I didn't pass their technical interview. This frustrated me a lot because this could've been my dream job since i would be working in an international environment, having to speak only in english and interacting with teammates from diferent countries.

Right now I fear for my future. I'm in a very good financial situation right now (which would allow me to quit my current job without any bad consequence) because i still live with my parents and i was able to save most of the money i made during these years. But I need to get my shit together (i've been getting help for my depression) and become good at my profession asap. This is making me crazy, i can't avoid feeling like i'm a failure.  I need to become a better developer. I also dream of leaving my developing country (Brazil) and move somewhere else because of many reasons (won't go into further detail as not to turn this into a rant) and doing so as a skilled immigrant is perhaps my only way ""out"".

What should I start studying? I think i need to make studying a part of my daily routine (specially if i indeed quit my job because i will have lots of free time for a few months at least). I once in a while do some programming logic challenge from /r/dailyprogrammer and from this website called CodeEval. But i really don't know how to study a programming language in a way to reach an ""employable"" level at it. Currently I work with PHP, javascript (with jquery), html, css and oracle. In uni i had to learn a bit of java, c, c++, etc but i never got very far into any of them. For a project at work i had to learn the google maps API by myself and also at some point i gave maintenance in a legacy system written in a kinda archaic programming language that i had to learn using the inbuilt manual and using other codes as example.

I'm kinda lost so some guidance would be really really welcome. Sorry if this became so big and kind of a rant but i really have no one with whom i can talk about my future in I.T... 

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: How someone that already knows all the basics about programming becomes better at it? How does one decide in which technology he should focus his time and energy?"

Recently she's been seeing other people and seeing me less and less. I feel like it was more all okay for her to leave than it was for me. She wanted to mend things over but I've been too emotional to try to work anything out. 

I go to university, I do courses here and there, about a 3/4 to my undergrad degree. There's been some financial trouble (min wage jobs left and right) which is why it's been taking so long to finish, and I just don't feel the passion for it anymore? 

I don't feel it for my career which I'm leaning towards, journalism, either. I write sometimes, but lately I just can't be bothered to do anything because I know I won't get any satisfaction from it.

Having worked here in the past, and for the past 3 weeks, I have gotten comfortable enough with everyone to listen to music with my headphones (Noise canceling, this will come in touch later in the story). 

Today I felt energized and excited, so i thought it was a perfect time to listen to some of OG Maco's Mix tapes. As per usual, i plugged in  my headphones and commenced, at a nice 70% volume level. The music sounded much more muffled than usual, but the headphones are old so i just brushed it off as being due to their old age. This is where I fucked up. A normal person would automatically have it click in their heads that something is off. But nope, I continued listening to my music, jamming out and working (Yes i should be working right now, hopefully no ""TIFU at work by getting caught on reddit"" any time soon from me.) After, what i would say was 30 minutes, ""Big Bucks"" started playing, and if you haven't heard it, it is quite loud, and to say the least, interesting. I got up to use the bathroom, and took off my headphones. There I stood, everyone in the office looking at me bewildered, with ""Big Bucks"" playing on full blast and OG Maco announcing ""I'm talking BIG BUCKS, I ain't wasting time on you little fucks."" 

Now i'm sitting in my corner, wondering why my office of friendly coworkers said not even a word, and hoping that they are also talking Big Bucks.

Fuck. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the Headphone recommendations everyone! I'm definitely moving forward to a new, more quality-driven set of headphones, and will look into all of your recommendations.

Also an Update: One of my coworkers, who is Russian, blasted some very native music through the office and said ""oops"" with the whole office giggling. Definitely helped make it less awkward, and more of a common fuck-up type situation. "

I was wondering what you guys do when you start on a project with existing code. Do you read through all of it and try to learn what each part does? Do you just focus on the relevant code and learn more as it becomes relevant? Or do you ask lots of questions about the project and understand the code that way?

I come from Europe but have been in the USA for 7 months now. I have a work permit.

I have 2 years of experience as a project manager in a software company(Europe). At the time I didn't know any programming besides what we studied in high school.

After I quit I dedicated my time to become a web developer. I was guided by a senior programmer. A year and a half has passed. Currently I am using PHP(OOP), JavaScript(jQuery), AJAX, HTML, CSS, MySQL. Just started studying Code Igniter.

I have developed 3 projects - a CMS system(nested comments, live chat), an intro to an online game based on CSS3 animations and a PHP OOP game.

I am looking online on websites like indeed, internships.com, career builder but the advertisements are few for people who are not enrolled in college. None of the places where I applied have contacted me back.

Can anybody give me an advice please? What can I do to land an internship as a web developer?"

---

Just a little backstory about me... I've never had any tech-related jobs or cs-related jobs, etc... no internship experience. All my summer jobs have been your typical *""summer job""* style of job, so other than my professors I can't say I have any *""professional connections""* in the CS/tech world at all. 


I really just want to leave everything behind once I graduate and *""start again""*... starting fresh in a far-away city where I don't know anyone. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this sentiment, so I won't go into much more detail.

---


So if I'm looking for a job in a nearby city, I can just drive around and take down a list of the tech companies, and then look into them and inevitably find one that will be hiring students out of school for entry-level positions. 

But that's something I can do if I live in the area. What if I want to start an entry-level position somewhere that is 3000+ miles away? There is not a feasible way for me to get there and look around, and I don't know anyone who doesn't live close to me. I also don't really have any *""networking connections""* because as I said I've never done any tech jobs... I've barely ever even been interviewed for any. 

It makes me think that the only way to find these positions would be to try my luck using online search engines, and I really don't like that method. 

---

How do I know where to apply? How do I know what companies are in the hypothetical far-away city? I mean... indeed.com is like the 50th most-used website in the US, isn't it? So I really don't think I'm going to have a very good chance with those online job search engines. 

Any advice welcome! I'm going to be starting my final undergraduate year in a few months, and I want to start the job search as early as possible (even before school starts back up if that's not too early) so that I can have my job settled and not have to worry about it throughout the year. 

For me I don't care what the job is or how good it is at the moment, I really just want to find an entry-level ""official first tech job"" position far away. 


thank you!

So I just graduated college, and I am starting grad school this fall. I currently am working at an internship making decent money, so I wanted to treat myself for receiving my Bachelor's. I've used a [Fujitsu t901](http://images.hardwarezone.com/upload/files/2011/04/7dc6b8d383.jpg) for my undergrad career. I know...I was a naive freshman, and a tablet was ""required"" for my engineering school. So far it has lasted me fairly well these 4 years, and the only problem is a faulty charger connection. 

Anyways, it's can be super annoying, and I really want to upgrade to something I can game with as well as run fairly intensive Engineering software/programs. I started looking up gaming laptops, and I thought about seeing what was available for the Amazon Prime deal. Currently I could get a new [Lenovo Y50](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/) for ~$860. However, I wandered to /r/buildapc , and I am now torn. 

**Do you think it's worth putting up with my laptop for notes etc. on campus and getting a ~$700 PC? Or would it be a good Idea to go with a laptop?**




**Side note:**

If I do choose to build a PC, I would probably not prefer to build it until I return to school (Aug 18th) because travel/moving, and I currently don't have a desk. 

1. So knowing this, should I take advantage of the July 15th Amazon Prime sale, if I know which CPU/GPU I will buy? 

2. Also, I have access to a Microcenter currently (Baltimore area), but I will not at school (Blacksburg, VA). Should I take advantage of having a Microcenter before I leave the area? (Which will be the end of July)

Sorry for the wall of text everyone! I didn't want to post in the simple questions thread, because I have several. Thanks.

During this time I had a couple internships, one in South Carolina and another in Illinois. I now work and live in Illinois full time. 

In December 2013, I received an email from ""nelnet"" claiming I had student loans related to my attendance at University of South Carolina - Lancaster about to go in default. I didn't even know that school existed until I got the email so I assumed it was some sort of scam or phishing because it had no account number or anything personal other than DEAR (MY FIRST NAME) (MY LAST NAME) at the beginning. I received another email several months later. I replied to it that it was in error and tried calling. I believe they told me to register online with my account number. I told them I didn't have one and they couldn't help me so I wrote it off as some error again. 

Yesterday I received an email from the US Department of Education scheduling a call window for me to call in and explain what going on with my student loan. 

So I have no idea how or why, but it would appear that some student loan has been issued under my name. When I was in South Carolina for my internship, I looked into doing some side, recreational class in bartending or cooking and that probably led me to some of those schools. I never actually applied for anything and certainly did not apply for any loan. 

I have never received any paperwork or documentation regarding this loan. I never attended or applied to the school. My idea is to call the loan servicer and try to figure out what my supposed account number is, how much ""I"" owe, and summary info of when it was issued and the loan documentation they have. 

Should I then call the school and request proof of application and enrollment? 

If this debt is substantial I will likely lawyer up if there is a chance of getting this corrected. If insubstantial, I will probably just end up paying it off as I don't want my credit affected, but even more importantly I work in the financial industry and this could eventually screw with my employment/registrations. 

Can anyone give me some help on how to start out or proceed with this?

--------------------

Edit 1: WOW this is my first time posting on this subreddit but the feedback was extremely helpful. Based on this advice, I am going through the US department of education website and calling their listed help lines. Unfortunately their ""systems"" have been down and aren't expected to come back online until this afternoon. Sounds extremely sketchy but I'm going through their .gov website. 

I checked NSLDS and there is no loan listed to my SSN. Once they are able to access their database and help me, I will post an update. 

What REALLY scared me is that around the same time I got this email, I got a call from my mom. She owned several  shares of Pepsi (she is weird and buys them basically in bearer form, doesn't buy it through online broker) stock in my name as a custodial relationship since she bought the shares when I was a child. They sent her a letter saying that **my SSN showed me as deceased** and asked who shares should be transferred to as we had not listed a beneficiary. Turns out they had two of my digits switched so my internal identity theft alarms are fading away but scary. 

Update to follow. 

-----------------------

EDIT 2: I was able to speak with someone at the Department of Education today and they confirmed that I have received these emails in error. Per my SSD, I have no student loans outstanding and certainly nothing in default. While the woman I spoke with mentioned the likely cause is an incorrect reference to my email somewhere in the database, she just said to ignore future emails and didn't really offer to figure out how to make them stop altogether. I assume it isn't as easy as her finding it and deleting it. Thanks to all for your help - I couldn't sleep a few nights ago!! A mysterious, unknown debt is a scary thing to suddenly have looming over you, but with the advice here I got it taken care of quickly. THANK YOU!"

I was recently approached by a friend's dad offering me a job at a bank. It's not IB, it's a commercial bank but it would be on the finance side and from what I heard they created the position for me.

I love my job, but it's clear to me that the odds of being rich doing this are really low. Also, software engineering as a job isn't always fun, it's a job... Having a career in something else would let me dedicate my free time to programming what I want.

If I knew that in a few years I'd be working at Google or Microsoft I'd probably stick to software but obviously there's no way of knowing that and I live in the UK so I think it's a bit harder.

I failed to get a paid internship for this summer, and it seems like I'm going to fail to get an internship for the upcoming Fall semester too.




I do pretty well at school, but my school is mediocre. I'm tired of getting automated email saying I'm not qualified for the internship I applied for or other candidates are better then me. Out of hundreds of applications, I only got two interviews with two big companies. They wanted me to take online assessment first before moving onto the next process, which I failed to do. 







I realize I have weaknesses in interviewing, so I've started to practice more problems. Other than that, I really don't know what else to do. I don't have many side projects other than web development. Those are time consuming and I really feel I didn't learn as much. I always ended up with spaghetti code, which makes me hate web development even more. 






What I want, really, is a full time job at a big company. Doesn't have to be Big4, any well-established company that is not a startup will do. I had an unpaid internship in a startup before, and I was too dumb to offer myself for that position. I realize startup doesn't work for me. I just want to work for a well-established company and have a decent life as a middle-class family.








Another thing that is unusual about me is that I'm an International student, but I don't think that is the problem. Maybe it does affect my application a little bit, but not significantly. I'm graduating next year, and I'm really worried of not getting a job. I know CS is getting really crowded now, and it's even harder to get a job from a mediocre school. How is the chance for me to land a full time job in a well established company? 








Thanks for reading. I feel better after I write my thoughts here; I don't have anyone else to talk to.

So, I've been doing a little internship over a mortgage company this summer. I've been doing basic IT stuff, and I mean BASIC. Stuff like cord organization, and playing Town of Salem when no one is looking.  
  
This week one of my co-workers is on vacation with their family. (We'll call her Betty) Betty isn't the most organized of our group. Whenever we get a new laptop we have a specific sheet to fill out. It's pretty simple. At the top there's a spot for name, IP, office location, image date, and ship date. In the middle, there's a packing list. Stuff like box, # of monitors, and the like. At the bottom, there's a checklist. Pretty simple.
At the bottom of the checklist however, there's two VERY important steps.  
  
Update PC's inventory entry  
Move into correct GFI workstation.
  
Betty is bad about never finishing these sheets, while the guys and I get them done quite easily. So yesterday I'm making sure inventory is up to date when I notice a huge-ass stack of papers on Betty's desk. I pick them all up, and I notice. The computers these sheets are for have been shipped out, and not updated in inventory or moved into the correct remote access (GFI) work group. Fuck. So I spend the rest of the day fixing that shit plus I had to do it when I got home. SO, because none of them were inventoried or anything, they weren't registered under the company. Meaning they were useless, and couldn't be fixed, until they had been put in inventory. Some of these had been shipped out of state. I swear if it wasn't for simple scripts, and Google docs doing this shit would have killed me."

I'm going into my second year of engineering at Penn State. My first year did not go very well and I ended the year with a 2.7. Looking back I definitely see where i screwed up, mostly due to adjustment to college life and partying a little too much. Now a lot of my friends have internships or are doing interesting things while I'm regretting my decisions during my first year. This upcoming year will be decisive in my admission into my major, and I need to boost my gpa to a 3.0 minimum. I'm still a little unsure of what area of engineering i want to go into, but I don't have to worry about that for a while. My main priority now finishing my entrance to majors while improving my gpa. Thankfully I did not get anything lower than a C, so the only two classes I need are Physics 2 and Calc 3. So I'm interested to hear any stories and suggestions from people who have been in the same situation.

I am a recent computer science graduate at 31 and in considerable need of advice. Let me just give a bit of background of myself.  The first couple of years  attending university fulltime, I was working as a fulltime technical support agent and then laid off as the company decided to offshore to India. I have been told to work on side projects from the beginning but I have to say managing my time while being at school and respecting my work responsibilities made it close to impossible to do any kind of extra curricular work. 

Once I was let go I started looking for internships to gain some experience but the only offer I received from a software company was for a technical support related field as the thought it was a better fit for their company from the previous experience I had. They offered 25 dollars an hour and I was running out of savings so I took the offer. After 10 months, I put in my resignation as I did not want to stay in that field and I want to be a developer. In my final semester, I started to work on projects, ones I enjoyed at least. I solely developed a few video games in Unity3D on mobile and PC.Currently, I am reworking some of my old data structures material from school because I feel that is an area I need to improve on. 

Now I have been applying to different video game related jobs and they are mostly looking for senior developers with very different requirements in each. 
Some require along with Unity almost expert like knowledge of web development, a field which I haven't had the opportunity to study. Others require advanced knowledge of obscure tool sets. 


I am a bit at a loss here and I would really appreciate any help or advice. I feel that  my age puts me at a disadvantage against the younger crowd that the video game industry attracts.

I know I'm going to sound like a whiny baby but please hear out my rant and give me some advice.  Feel free to be hard on me because I think I need something to snap me out of this funk.

So currently I'm an undergraduate student at a pretty decent university studying computer science.  I picked my major because I wanted to challenge myself and also I thought I would like it.  I'm going into my third year and it has proved to be challenging but I'm doing well.  Unfortunately, I don't think it's where my passion lies at all.  I figure that I should just continue with it because of several reasons:
1) I've already gone this far.
2) Because I'm a girl and have a high GPA in CS, I got a good scholarship.  
3) Has good job prospects.
4) Don't have a very strong pull towards another career/major.
But last year I really struggled because I borderline hated what I studied and had to put so much of my time into these classes that it wasn't healthy.  I was stressed beyond belief and basically it took up all of my time and mental effort so I couldn't even enjoy university at all.  Because of my disdain for it, I haven't done any extracurricular computer science related projects or really tried looking for opportunities.  All around me, my peers are getting internships at amazing companies and doing awesome projects but I can't even do anything because I have no experience.  I really can't switch my major though because I have a scholarship that is really taking some financial burden off.

A few weeks ago, I came back from studying abroad in Granada, Spain.  It was the most amazing time of my life and I took no computer science courses.  I loved every second of it and realized I loved exploring new cultures.  Everyday I would go out and do something that I never thought I'd do and I really felt like I discovered a passion for life.  It scared me though, because it was then when I realized that I hated university.  When I got back, I had plans to continue this passion and I was so excited to do things.  Obviously that didn't happen.  I went back into a really depressive mood and now it's a struggle to accomplish anything.  I've lost contact with most of my friends at home and I find myself just sitting at home watching Netflix all day avoiding my problems.  I feel like such a failure.  I want to get a job but I don't even know where to start.  I don't want to get a job working at a restaurant because I will feel ashamed when I tell my peers instead of working at an awesome tech company.  On the other hand, I can't get a job doing tech stuff because 
1) I'm too inexperienced
2) There's a little more than a month left before university starts again

Also another thing, I've never been in a relationship and never been kissed before.  I don't think I'm unattractive but I think I have trust issues and I don't open up.  Also I might be scared of intimacy?  People tell me I'm intimidating :( that makes me sad because I think I'm just introverted and quiet at times but people take it the wrong way.  Also I suck at making/keeping friends.  What is wrong with me???

I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I just feel like crap all the time.  Someone please slap some sense into me/give me some advice.  Thanks for reading through all of that :)

**tl;dr** I hate my major but I can't switch it due to financial reasons, feeling way behind peers and also no friends and no life. help."
3daw1b,2,2015-07-14,How do I start making a very simple .exe with a GUI? (More specifics inside),like-a-bbas,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3daw1b/how_do_i_start_making_a_very_simple_exe_with_a/,"Hi,

I apologize if this is not the right place to ask this question. I am a new intern at a company and I've been given a task that seems fairly simple but I don't exactly know where to start. 

Last year, two interns wrote these programs that basically converted a sound recording into a .csv file. However, the way it works is pretty wonky because there is no GUI which will be pretty confusing for the technicians that have to use this program.

What I have been instructed to make a simple GUI. Now the way these programs work is you have to have the sound file under a specific name inside the folder that you are calling the program from, it takes it, does some things to it, and calls the other program. 

My task is to simplify the process for the techs that will be using this. There needs to be a .exe that opens a GUI, will allow the techs to search for the sound file that they want to use to call this program. My plan is when they select the file, it will copy the file into the folder under the name that the program needs it to be under (so this is extensible and not modifying any existing code) and have the GUI do any other tasks so the techs can just select the file and let it run then be done with it. 

My problem is I don't know where to start with this project. If possible, I would like to write this in Python but I am sufficient in many languages like C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, etc. Is there a good place for me to get started with this?

just FYI the programs that will be called are written in C++. Thank you. "

First, here is my situation:
I am 33 years old, I have a PhD in fluid mechanics and I figured during my PhD that I hate doing physics (I still love learning about it though) but I love programming. I'm also quite good at it. So I steered toward a career in programming, I was told it was easy since there is so much work there. I worked 2 years in a small company doing mostly instrumentation programming, LabVIEW and C++. Then I became a research engineer in a small french city where I have been in the past 6 years. My job consists in developing scientific software in C++. I am basically alone, I am rather proud of what have I accomplished but lets be honest, it is not computer rocket science.

Here is my anonimized resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzPTjCzKPs5rZGVzbnNld05PbHc/view?usp=sharing

Now I want to join the real players. I want a team, I want a project, I want something to code else than what I figured I could code to help my coworkers. So I have looked for a job in the past 12 years.

- I have turned down an offer in Switzerland because it meant splitting up with my wife who can't work outside France. This was an interview I got thanks to an online connection.
- I recently had an interiew that went well for a french start-up. I couldn't convince them to allow me to work part-time remotely for yhis job in Paris. Accepting to move there for the salary they are offering would mean a significant decrease in quality of life (I live right now in a big house in the countryside).
- I was *almost* hired at Google. I was rather succesful at the interviews and got the approval from the hiring comitee, but was rejected by the executive comitee, probaby due to my lack of experience in the field. I want to point out that the only reason I had the opportunity to be a candidate there was because I have participated for a few years to their coding contest, my resume alone would never have got me an interview.
- Otherwise, I have sent between 50 to 100 applications, but I never passed the first HR filter.

So now I have to decide what to do. I want to leave my current job as soon as possible, I feel I am wasting my time there, I won't make any progress anymore.

My constraints:
- My wife who I love can only work in France, but would follow me if we could afford her to stop working.
- My kids who I also love live in South of France. I spend 10kEUR/year for the alimony and the holidays/week-end I spend with them. I would accept not seeing them in the week-end, but I want to be able to see them on their holidays, and go to vacation with them.

So, basically I am wondering:

- **Where should I search?** Up until now I had only looked in France and Switzerland, but maybe I could afford to go further, in the end it's only a matter of money.
- **What should I look for?** Big company, small, start-up? I am wondering wether I could maybe find a nice internship that could be better in the long term than a mediocre job?
- **What field should I study to make myself more attractive to my future employer?** (Right now I am thinking about learning Android programming?)"

I am lost in life right now. I am going to try to make this concise so it is easy to follow and read. I can put more details if needed.
Here's my situation:
Broadly speaking, I don't know what my next step is and I don't know what path that step is in (I have an idea of the direction). I am also not sure if I am capable of making that step given my current financial situation. 

More specific:
I am a first generation college student. My grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, older brother, parents - none of them went to college. 

Ultimately it was my choice to pursue an engineering degree, but my father had heavy influence in that choice. Basically, engineering played to my strengths and was guaranteed financial stability throughout my life, something my family never had. I also enjoyed the idea of helping people in society by constructing it. Think Extreme Makeover - Home Edition. 

I graduate this December with a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Leadership with ~ 20K debt. My parents are unable to help me financially, and I have less than $3000 in savings.

I have had two internships in Civil Engineering, and I feel like it is draining my soul with every day worked. The disdain for engineering is in the details. My day to day tasks are not at all enjoyable. I do not enjoy working on a computer. I do enjoy interacting with people, but I do not like what the interactions are about (engineering problems/talk). I love engineering as a field, but unless i'm helping engineer something for people in need, and I have the reward of interacting with these folks, then engineering is not for me. 

So I ask myself, what do I care about? I care about people, the education of the populace, social issues, mental health, and solving larger societal problems (social justice, climate change, education inequalities etc). This passion comes from an innate compassion that I have that was strengthened by my involvement in service-learning trips at my university.  

What do I enjoy doing? Working with people to solve problems. Educating people. LEARNING. Thinking about why people think and act the way they do. Listening to people and trying to empathize with their situation. Giving advice if I have the experience/knowledge to do so. My core values are curiosity, and compassion.

Where do I go? How badly did I mess this up? My time is limited and I am feeling an enormous pressure. I don't want to make the wrong decision. 

Should I stick out engineering for a bit and make some money? I don't think I could, because it drains the life out of me. 
Should I pursue graduate school? If so, what field of study should I go into? Education? Psychology? Law? A social science field?

Should I apply for Americorps? Peacecorps? Teach for America (I probably don't have the skills to handle TFA). Are there other non-profits that I should research?

Should I pick up a minor to extend my stay at my university?

I want work that gives me purpose. I know it might be difficult work, but that doesn't matter. I know it might not pay well, but hopefully I'll make a decent salary. 

I wish I had more time at my university to figure myself out. I wish I would have challenged myself to go out of my comfort zone sooner. I wish I had chosen a major that developed the strengths I enjoy having, rather than developing the strengths someone else thought I should have. I could have gotten so much more out of my time in college. I messed up, and I realize that. My best option right now is to be proactive and gain perspective so I can prevent another mess up like this one. 

Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

I am currently a rising second year student at the University of Virginia and I am completely and utterly destroyed right now. Some history about me, I was a straight A student in high school, president of clubs, EMT certified, internships, and had even begun to create my own web design business, I had a fantastic resume and when I got accepted into UVA I really felt like I was on the golden path to success.

My first year of UVA was great in everyway, in the short term. I ended up living in dorms and my first semester my grades were pretty much all C's (all science and math classes) and along side of this because of my suite mates I went from non-smoker to heavy weed smoker and even had a DIP arrest (that I was found not guilty of and expunged but still) and my second semester I pulled all B and an A except for one class which was math (I got sick for the final and need to retake it). From the start I went from a bio major to an econ major (I hated my science classes and changed my mind about pre-med) and decided to take summer classes in order to meet my requirements to become an econ major. Instead I got a C for the second time in stats and became ineligible with the professor emailing me these exact words.

""I looked over what you have completed throughout the semester, and if you had done lab 7, you would have gotten a C+. Or if you had completed all but 2 of the HWs all the way along with the lab, you might have gotten a B-. So, I've come to the conclusion that I will not change your grade since you had ample opportunity to improve your grade during the summer session. I'm sorry, but this is my decision.""

Although this is a setback I am currently working towards my Political Science major and that is something that I also love.

My GPA is sitting at a 2.5 right now and I feel like an utter failure, I had a 3.87 unweighted in high school and now I cannot even get into the clubs and societies that I want to get into.

My end goal is law school and I NEED to turn my college career around. I am aiming for the political science major and I need to know how can I turn my GPA around (is it even possible), I have recently quit weed and cigs (need help staying true to the weed, cigs are not as hard) and I just need some advice in general. How do I get back to were I was and stop disappointing myself and everyone else. 

I apologize for the lack of flow in my rambling but I was not really sure where to start and I just need some advice.

In my off time I have had two internships in Accounting (public, and industry) and have found myself completely questioning a future in accounting. As a hobby a year ago I built a computer and started a real curiosity and interest in computers. I realized that my favorite parts of my job were building giant models in excel while doing everything I can to limit the size and complexity of the files so that they will run on my antiquated machine, and of course money (not that I'm making much, just obviously motivated by it). In my free time I did a quick 2 hour intro to programming exercise that I found online and I found the logic was fairly natural for me.

3dcmfd,4,2015-07-15,Did I break an unsaid law about Airbnb reviews?,alex45679,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3dcmfd/did_i_break_an_unsaid_law_about_airbnb_reviews/,"Hi everyone! I made a reddit just to ask about this, because it's causing me a bit of anxiety. I need answers about a conflict with a airbnb host from people who have been airbnb hosts themselves, or who use airbnb a lot. 

Almost two weeks ago, I stayed in an airbnb private room in Brooklyn, just to take a break from the long commute to my internship. It was as expected, and I had a pretty good experience overall. When it came time to write a review, I was positive and complimented the host and her apartment--I just had to note that the subway was EXTREMELY loud and that I could hear it from the bedroom. Because of that, I said that I wouldn't recommend the bedroom to light sleepers, and indicated that the other (2 or 3) bed rooms in her apartment would be better.

Here's the review in its entirety:
""___ was a great hostess--very helpful, ready to give suggestions, and fascinating to talk to. The apartment was clean, and I really loved its sunny Victorian living room. It's also only two minutes away from the G train. But because of this proximity, I wouldn't recommend this one bedroom in particular to light sleepers; the G train is absurdly loud and actually makes ___ rumble when it passes. (But since this is the only bedroom in the apartment facing ____, I expect that all the other bedrooms in the apartment are quiet.)""

I gave her 4 or 5 stars (but mostly 5's) on everything that airbnb asked me to rate numerically. After I submitted this, I saw that she had given me a good review as a guest, which was what I expected.

A few hours later, I received this reply from the host:

""My heart fell when I read your review. Perhaps you don't realize that living in a suburban setting like Long Island, and having such little experience in City dwellings makes you very sensitive to street noise. 
A review like that is a killer and will do tremendous damage. 
If you had come to me with the problem and said you were very sensitive to that maybe we could have found a solution, even changed your space. 
If there's any way you can retract that review that would be a really good thing - if not I might have to send a public response."" 

A few points in my defense:
1. I did tell her that the train noised were loud in the bedroom, but that it didn't bother me. I was so tired each night I stayed there that I fell asleep immediately. 
2. I'm not a sheltered suburban girl - I've stayed in NYC, in different apartments (though admittedly never in Brooklyn) many times before, and I've never experienced anything as loud as the noise from the G train in this apartment.
3. One thing I didn't mention to her was the cockroach that was chilling on the floor of the bedroom one night. The host's housemate got rid of it for me, and I didn't mention it to the host because I thought she would think I might mention it in a review of her apartment. Obviously, I didn't; I got over the cockroach incident and wrote in the review that her apartment was clean. 
4. I thought that one of the reasons that people trusted airbnb was because it had honest reviews that kept hosts and guests in check. I thought that (kind) honesty was expected from reviewers, and since I was reviewing, it was my responsibility to warn light sleepers that they may not be able to sleep. It can present a very big problem for some people, if they deserve to know before they commit to paying $60/night for this bedroom.
5. I did say that the other bedrooms in the apartment probably wouldn't be a problem. I didn't direct anyone away from the host or the apartment--just the one bedroom. 

What do you think? Should I apologize and redact the comment? This is my first time staying in an airbnb in the U.S., so I don't know the protocol for anything. Should I have censored that important part of my review? How legit is her claim that my review is a ""killer"" and will do ""tremendous damage""? 

Thanks in advance for responses, and sorry for typos or less-than-fantastic writing; it's late."

At School B I was accepted as a finance major but the business school is not as good as School A. 

The reason entering as a finance major is so important to me is because I want to be able to get finance related work/internships while in school, and I believe it will be harder to do so as a non finance major. Is it worth it to go to the less ""prestigious"" school to have a better chance at getting internships?"

I didn’t think there’s going to be a follow-up to the story I wrote three nights ago. I wrote it because I needed to reflect on some things and to make sense of the subtle but bizarre circumstances surrounding my brother Xavier who has autism. Against my wishes, I once again find myself typing all of these things down. Perhaps I’m doing it for the sake of chronicle and posterity; for therapeutic purposes; or for an outlet of confusing emotions. Regardless of the reasons, I’m compelled to tell this story.

Over the course of a few months after April 18, my family has recovered from my brother Xavier’s most recent and most terrifying tantrum fit yet and things have gotten back to the mundane as far as mundane can be defined by our unique family dynamics. Having a sibling with a severe autism disorder is never going to be a normal experience in comparison with most people’s, but it’s all the life I’ve known and I’m happy about it for the most part. We make the most of what we are given including the worst parts especially when it comes to family. I can honestly say that my relationship with Xavier was better—lighter, even. I’m not exactly sure why that is but after the strange revelations I encountered concerning the old staircase back in our childhood and the disappearance of the mirrors in our house, things just felt smooth and serene. That’s how it feels like when I’m alone in the house with him whenever my parents would occasionally attend parties with old acquaintances from their college years and whatnot.

I didn’t entertain the notion that there was something more about what I discovered last time. Though inherently curious, I consider myself having a good instinct about general things, especially when it came to the bad stuff, so I opt to stay away from situations that I know could endanger myself or others. This was why I didn’t think much more about Xavier’s fixation on the staircase and mirrors and his last tantrum fit. I already wrote it down and posted it here in Reddit and it was enough catharsis for me—

—that was until I met up with my friends from high school two days ago.

I haven’t seen Aya since high school graduation about a decade ago. On the other hand, I’ve met up with Isha last year for coffee. She’s taking her master’s in Philosophy while working as a legal secretary. We agreed to see each other next time when our schedules at our respective work don’t conflict with each other. Aya tagged along without Isha informing me about it, much to my joyous surprise. Aya recently went back to live for good in Japan and I know is working there and is engaged to a long-time boyfriend she talked about briefly in high school. But, as it happens, she had to go back here to arrange some documents about their old place. In any case, I was just happy to see a familiar face from my past.

It was during the time while the three of us were sharing a dessert (a rather large serving of banana split that was probably good for five people) that Isha started talking about her cousin Clara. She’s the only child of Isha’s youngest aunt. Isha explained that Clara has been having night terrors.
I didn’t think much about her story until I got home. As an English tutor, I work mostly with children from first to third grade and so I have developed a deep sense of affinity and obligation for kids in general. I never ever considered myself maternal or big-sisterly, though. Hell, I have made a decision never to have kids for myself and that’s probably because I don’t want anyone dividing my attention and affection away from Xavier since I’ve already had a fixed mindset when it comes to taking care of him for the rest of our lives. But I do love kids and I always get either angry or sad every time I encounter stories about mistreatment or abuse concerning a child.

Isha’s story about her niece Clara didn’t strike me as anything like that but it made me think about my own weird dreams. I thought about them as I looked up the white ceiling where different sizes of dream-catchers hovered above my bed. I stared at them and realized that there were now at least twenty to twenty-five of them just up there. I suppose I’ve been collecting them over the years and friends and relatives have bought some of them for me too for birthdays or holidays. I think I started collecting dream-catchers because of their purpose, which was to take away bad dreams or nightmares. I remember having this recurring stress dream since first year college: I would be walking down a street and as soon as I turned into a corner, a group of men would be waiting for me. They’d chase me down and, I assume, rape me. Other times it would be a pack of rabid dogs. They’d chase me down and eat me. They’re fundamentally the same, I guess. Whenever I have that stress dream, I know I’m being overworked or unhappy about something so I consider it as a sign that I should take a step back from my life and re-examine what I’m doing. 

So I learned to see that stress dream as a helpful omen, if anything.

It was still pretty early in the evening after my lunch date with the girls. Isha and Aya agreed to meet up again tomorrow. We decided we would go to an amusement park. It’s a cheesy thing to do but we’re in our mid-twenties and we feel like we’re getting old already and wanted to indulge in something that’s reminiscent of those group trips we used to have like going to the beach and, in this case, to an amusement park for some thrill rides.

I read a book for two hours in bed before deciding to call it a night. Now I like sleeping in the dark a lot so I don’t bother with turning on a nightlight even though I do have one next to my massive bookshelf. I can’t remember the last time I used that old thing. So I just lay there with my rain-scented sheets, staring up the ceiling, counting the dream-catchers hanging above me before I finally succumbed to slumber.

***

The next day I was woken up by our part-time maid who told me that my mother instructed her to clean up my room and get rid some of the useless stuff I hoarded. I knew that my mother meant the pile of boxes behind my bed which were composed of old papers from my school years since kindergarten; stuff like test papers, report cards, scrapbook projects, etc. I don’t know why I kept all of them but I’ve gotten used to seeing those boxes there (some I even painted on and put cute designs) that I was at first hesitant to throw the contents away but decided that they weren’t anything worth keeping in the first place. Still, I decided to help her sort through the mess before I leave for my date with Isha and Aya.

After eating a light breakfast (I plan on binging on fries and coke later), I helped the maid open the boxes and decide which of this stuff I want to keep and which ones should go to the trash. It was by my fourth box that I encountered some of my old comics that I personally drew as a child. I looked through them with a mix of embarrassment, curiosity and pride. They were comic strips I made based on anime characters. The papers I used came from my ruled notebooks from school. Seeing them again after all these years made me feel so old, much like meeting up with Isha and Aya last night as working women with steady jobs, and no longer as high school girls awkwardly fumbling through the troubles of adolescence. 

I flipped through the comics, occasionally chuckling to myself, when I noticed a series of sketches that stood out easily. They were the same anime characters my comics were based on; only this time I saw that Xavier’s own version of a particular drawing was scribbled on the right side of each page. Now I remember that my mother used to make me draw these and then she would give them to Xavier. He will then industriously copy them as best as he could, including the color selections of the character’s hair, accessory and clothes. There were at least five variations of these drawings and I examined all of them, taking my time, feeling rather light-headed too because of the sentimentality constricting my chest. I knew I’m going to keep these because they are special and important, just like my baby brother will always be to me.

I eagerly sifted through that box again, hoping to unearth another surprising treasure. I got a few more old drawings of mine in two notebooks placed inside a brown envelope and then a pad paper which was filled with doodles. I looked through these doodles absentmindedly. There was nothing familiar about them at first, just pencil lines drawn on the surface depicting various shapes and crooked lines. The only unusual thing about them was when I reached the fifteenth page or so. There was a series of zigzag lines which occupied the expanse of a page until the very last one. They were all in rows of three and columns of six. A part of me knew Xavier drew them. It’s not weird for him to draw repetitive images and fixate on them. It’s part of his symptom as a child with autism. Sometimes he would form an attachment or preference towards certain patterns…or objects—

Deciding I don’t want to think further about it, I cast it aside somewhere and went through the next boxes. I uncovered some journals particularly the Winnie the Pooh pink diary I had in kindergarten. The maid noticed it and asked me if I could read a few pages from it and we laughed together at my bad handwriting and grammar, as well as the mundane quality of the texts, citing what I ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner; what color are the clips I wore that day; how I think my teacher is pretty, etc.

After almost two hours of digging through the boxes, we eventually worked out which ones to throw away and what are the things I want to keep. Afterwards I showered, got dressed and left the house to meet up with my friends. The commute was longer than expected due to the occasional drizzle along the way. When I arrived at the amusement park and met up with them in one of the concession stands, I was surprised to see the two of them looking glum about something, especially Isha.

Without waiting for an inquiry from me, Isha started to tell me that her cousin Clara had another night terror last night that woke up the entire household. I was more alert and attentive of the details this time, given that I could see how much the whole thing has worried Isha.

“She was screaming like we’ve never heard her scream before,” Isha explained. “And the worst part of it all was we couldn’t wake her up. Her eyes were wide open but my boyfriend who was staying over the night (he’s an intern at a hospital near Isha’s work) checked her pupils and told us that she was still sleeping, that she hasn’t really woken up yet.” She paused, looking back and forth between myself and Aya before she continued. “It took at least another ten minutes before she stopped screaming. She screamed until she’s hoarse. She can’t speak at all after that. So we rushed her to the doctor earlier this morning, and he said that she almost ruptured her tonsils, if such a thing was even possible…” she trailed off and looked like she was about to burst into tears.

Aya gripped her hand and I took the other one. Isha breathed in and out for a few times to gather herself before she continued again. “She just sat there on her bed. We couldn’t even move her. She just kept screaming with her eyes wide open but not seeing any of us, not really awake, still having those fucking nightmares and we were all so helpless about it.”

“Is she going to be okay?” I asked.

Isha nodded curtly. “Yeah. The doctors have her under observation. They said they’ll try to figure out what’s causing the night terrors. They all seem to agree that it’s nothing they have seen before. It’s possible that the next time she sleeps, it might happen again. What if she screams herself to death…I don’t want to think about it—”

This time Isha did cry. She was sobbing against our shoulders as Aya and I brought her into our arms and hugged her like our very lives depended on it. After some time she managed to get herself together again and then Isha pulled something from her purse. They were scraps of paper. She unfolded them and gave each of us one. I looked down at my share.

“Did Clara draw this?” I asked, deeply perplexed. They were just random shapes, mostly circles in varying sizes.

“What the fuck?” I heard Aya mutter lowly next to me.

I quickly glanced at the paper she held in her hands. It was the same content: circles of varying shapes. However, this time each circle has big eyes drawn into it. Even with a little girl’s unpolished drawing, those eyes definitely look angry—even filled with hatred. Maybe it’s just me, though, noticing such a stupid thing. I didn’t want to comment about it, knowing it would be insensitive to point it out but Isha said:

“Clara can’t speak but when we asked her what was in her nightmares, she drew those. And then she started jogging from where she stood, as if saying she’d been running in her dreams. And that these things were chasing her. She began crying then and she hugged me and I knew she wanted to tell me not to let these fucking things get her…”

“Burn them.”

Those two words were out of my mouth before I even realized I was speaking them. Both Aya and Isha just stared at me, dumbfounded.

I looked back at them, just as confused. “I mean…I don’t know why I said that.” I handed back the paper to Isha who took it and crumpled it.

She stared into her fist for a while and then looked up and said. “I’m sorry about this but I really have to go and be there for Clara—”

Aya shushed her. “Of course, sweetie, of course. Don’t worry about it.”

“So are you guys going to stay here then?” Isha asked, sounding hopeful.

“Do you want us to come with you?” Aya offered.

Before Isha could answer, my phone vibrated audibly from inside my bag. I took it out, excused myself from them and answered. Apparently, my parents wanted me to come home early so the maid can clean the rest of the house without having to watch over Xavier who was awake and just playing inside my parents’ bedroom. I got back to Aya and Isha and told them the situation and they were understanding enough to let me go. I embraced Isha one last time and told her to be strong for Clara.

***

During the commute route, I kept thinking about Isha’s story about Clara, going over the details in my mind. The nightmares which were scary enough to make her scream non-stop—those awful scary circles she drew with big, malevolent eyes. They were chasing her in her dreams and may not want her to ever wake up. It all felt so surreal to me, this horrific story I just heard, like I was dreaming myself and none of what happened earlier at the park was true. Only that it was a true experience for someone who is my friend, and I could not begin to imagine what she’s going through right now. If only I could wish it all away for the little girl’s sake and for Isha’s...

I got back home safely within thirty minutes. It was only three in the afternoon. I changed clothes and then joined my brother inside my parents’ bedroom. He was by the computer, typing his name over and over in a Microsoft Word document. I was sitting on the bed, reading more of my Winnie the Pooh pink diary, chuckling to myself every once in a while. I was midway through reading my scintillating entries when I encountered a particular entry which didn’t sit right with me.

First of all, it wasn’t dated which was odd because five-year-old me seemed to be conscientious about dates every time she writes in her journal. Next, there was a noticeable hard pressure in the way I wrote the words in the page. They even left a mark on the pages that preceded it. The final thing that made me very uneasy was the content itself.



*Dear Diary,* 

*It came again. The plate. Big eyes that hate me. The smile in the face looks so wrong. It followed me around. I can’t hide. I can’t run. It came and came and came and I think I will die.*



I must have read that page a dozen times, unsure of what I was seeing, disbelieving that I even wrote this. I turned to the next pages and they were normal entries again about food and hair accessories and the new classmate and the pretty teacher I knew at this point was my first real crush. I had to get to the very last entry I ever wrote to encounter another disturbing piece of information about a childhood experience I don’t recall ever having.



*Mama was right. Papa was right. We should burn it. The fire made it go away. No more big eyes watching. The plate can’t follow me.*



I was muttering “What the fuck?” and “Don’t be shitting me now” towards the pink diary as I flipped through more of the pages after that damnable entry but there was nothing more. That was the last thing I wrote.

Instinctively, I glanced at Xavier who was still contentedly typing away on the computer. And then I hopped out of bed, leaving the diary behind to go to my room and pick up the pad paper bearing the strange zigzag patterns Xavier drew himself. I can’t tell you why I did that. I don’t know what I was trying to do and why I felt this nagging compulsion to show my brother the stuff he drew when we were just children. I don’t know what I was expecting but I don’t want to freak out and I need to make sense of things that seems to me would never make sense in a million years. But I still tried.

“X,” I called to him, touching his arm lightly. He kept typing.

I leaned closer to take the mouse from his grasp and minimize the document he was typing on. He jerked away from the monitor and then rocked back and forth, smiling blankly. 

“Okay, X, pay attention,” I said as I clapped my hands together once which made him look at the source of the sound. He was absolutely still now. I took the pad paper from under my armpit and asked him. “Do you remember these?”

His mouth was half-open as he stared into the paper I was showing him. Nothing registered which was expected. I began to flip through each page, showing him the perfectly aligned zigzag lines in rows and columns of three. He still said nothing; just stared and rocked back and forth some more.

“Xavier,” I sounded more serious now as I crouched closer to where he sat. “You drew these. What are they?”

He was laughing now and making popping noises. He was clutching and un-clutching his long, sinewy fingers in the air. I waited for his excitable state to calm down before I asked him the question again.

He turned his head from left to right in a repetitive, almost dizzying motion. I told him to stop and to pay attention.

“What are these?” I was getting a bit frustrated. “Look at them. Why did you draw these fucking things?”

My change in tone made him echo my last two words. He said “fucking things” in his baritone voice and then laughed.

“X, look at me.” With my other hand, I tipped his chin up to meet my gaze but then he jerked away and clutched and un-clutched his fingers again, a stupid, careless grin still on his face.

“X, would you answer me, please!” Again, he echoed my last three words.

“Answer me please!” he almost shouted but he was giggling uncontrollably.

I waited for two minutes to let him calm down and then I asked again. 

“What are these zigzag lines?”

“Zigzag lines,” he echoed mindlessly.

“Yes, these lines,” I traced them on the pad paper. “You drew them, remember? What are they?”

Xavier was rocking back and forth again as he stared at the paper. After what seemed like forever, he finally stopped. He ceased all movement. Now he moved his face closer to the pad paper as if it was the first time he saw me holding it in front of him. From this angle, I could see him narrow his eyes and for a moment I saw a flicker of recognition.

He gazed up, surveying me blankly. I made eye contact with him and did not look away. From the corner of my eye, I saw him lift one hand and then he pointed his index finger on the paper and said with a flat, low tone which contrasted his energetic way of speaking minutes before:

“Stairs.”

***

As soon as my parents got back home, I retreated back to my bedroom. I left Xavier typing on the computer. I was in the middle of my big bed, my chin resting on my knees as I examined the zigzag lines. If this was the staircase at home then it could only mean one thing so I had to be sure. 

I started counting. *One, two, three, four…*

I reached the number fifteen. I tried the next line and then another until I managed to count six pages of the zigzag lines all in rows and columns of three, all drawn to have consistently fifteen steps each. Again, such microscopic attention to detail is not unusual for a child with autism. 

But knowing what I know now and in the light of recent events, I knew there was something else at work here.

Even though I figured out the basic math already in my head, I still counted to myself as I pointed at each step.

*Oro*, I began, *Plata, Mata, Oro, Plata, Mata, Oro…*

I knew it was going to end up in *Mata*. Our old staircase used to have fifteen steps after all. In theory, having the last step of the top of the stairs mean *Mata* opens your household to bad luck...even death. I wonder if it also means inviting unwanted entities in...like whatever my brother saw in the mirror, if there ever is such a thing. And what was that ""plate"" my five-year-old self was talking about? Are these all separate incidents? Are they *connected* somehow?

I honestly don’t know how I feel. A sense of dread and urgency mingling with a crippling moment of fear? Yes. But I felt sad at the same time, and extremely anxious about some things I couldn’t bring myself to name.

After we ate dinner, my parents have to discuss about the chores the maid will have to do tomorrow so I was left in their bedroom with Xavier. I watched him as we sat across each other. He was pressing the keys of the cell phone in his hands without a single care in the world. 

“X,” I called him. He didn’t look up.

Making a decision then, I took my father’s pen and some newspaper from the corner and began to use the free space in the corner of a page to doodle on it. What I drew were three circles. I didn’t dare put any eyes on them. After I finished, I made Xavier look at it. He was so engrossed with his typing that it took another few minutes before he paid attention.

Finally, he did. He pressed his face close to the paper again. I was about to open my mouth to start with my questions but his response was quick.

He said. “Miyoy.”

“What?” I answered just as quick.

He made a motion with his hand again, a gesture he uses when he’s asking for something. “Miyoy.”

“Goddammit, Xavier,” I said as I picked myself from the position where I was kneeling in front of him. I crumpled the newspaper in my hands as I walked out of there, adding. “We have no more mirrors in the house.”

I shut and locked my door. I leaned against its wooden frame, comforted by its sturdiness behind my back. I had my eyes closed. When I opened them, my gaze fell upon the shadowy figures of the dream-catchers hovering together like one giant, multiple-legged mass in my ceiling. My mind was blank for a few seconds before my gaze lowered and rested on my bed.

I sighed loudly, reaching for the switch to turn on the lights as I took a few steps closer. *Oh,* I thought, *there you are*.

The metal frame peeking out from underneath my bed.

Two black bags were on top of it but I could discern the faint glint of glass from the moment the light illuminated my room and made transient contact on the exposed small corner of the fucking thing.

I just stood there, frowning.

I sighed loudly again.

It looks like my inherent curiosity has gotten the best of my good instincts.

“Well, fuck me,” I muttered under my breath.

I knelt down and crouched under the bed, allowing my fingers to fumble through the metal frame to seek a gap from underneath that could separate it from the cement floor so I can pull up the mirror slowly from its resting place. It slid out from under the bags and into my nervous arms, and I clutched it protectively as I unveiled the rest of its form.

Hey comets! I'm a UTD alum from 2003 and I am in need of two UTD interns (if you can use this for credit, even better as I will assist in forms or any reviews needed). If you don't fit what I'm looking for, forward this on to someone else.

I head up the IT &amp; Digital Marketing staff here at CoVerica, a local insurance company. By local I mean we're 7 minutes away from UTD at Preston &amp; Campbell. I'm flexible on time off for school but I do need people to be here about 25-30 hours a week during our core business hours (8am to 5pm).

##IT Intern

I need someone to help me with IT support duties for a 60 person company. We use a helpdesk system and it ranges from ""My phone isn't working"" to ""I need my hard drive replaced"" so we would need to have the OS reimaged. We have remote staff that occasionally have VPN issues but I need someone that has some strong Windows desktop knowledge and doesn't mind learning some Microsoft Active Directory and possibly some Microsoft SQL for data pulls.

##Social Media Marketing Intern

In the grand scheme of things, we're a large, small company (or maybe that's a small, large company). We're the 3rd or 4th largest insurance brokerage in Dallas. We're almost at the point to where we could bring someone on full-time for a Social Media Marketing position but I'd rather start small and bring an intern or two in. I need someone to help me with this as I'm great at coming up with the direction we need to head to but I tend to get pulled a thousand different ways and our social media is the first thing to get neglected. I need someone that can dream up ideas and help us implement ways to engage with first, our existing customers but second, prospective customers across social media platforms. We're dipping our toes into all social platforms as well as video and (for another business we have) podcast production. We will be creating content together as well as editing so anyone with writing, illustration, and video editing experience would be amazing.

For either position, please email me directly at leif.hurst@coverica.com."

Quick background - 18 years old rising senior, will be 19 when I graduate, black male, PA.

I want to keep this pretty short and to the point but in freshman year of high school I had a pretty bad medical emergency and almost died. Recovery took a while - first year of high school I failed every class because my school wasn't exactly the most understanding and didn't arrange for any kind of ILP or homebound instruction or anything. I transferred in sophomore year to an online school but health problems were still plaguing me. Things were better and I actually passed the year, though my grades were still bad. I mean sub 3.0 the whole way down. At this point my total GPA is something like 2.2 unweighted.

Fastforward to this year, the junior year - this is the first year I've actually been healthy. I finished this year with a 3.20 GPA with a disproportionately large courseload (caught up on extra classes so that I could graduate on time in 2016). I was on the honor roll for two out of the four semesters, was in the school's Model UN and School Newspapers, and played hockey at a club/travel level. My problem is, that's it. My cumulative GPA is still bad and will take something like a 4.0 the entire year for my 4 year transcripts to have a good enough weighted/unweighted GPA total to even break 3.0, and it's not like I've done a whole lot of extracurricular work either. One winter I did community service for a religious organization and this summer I've been working as an intern for a magazine based in NY. I'm pretty proud about landing the internship, but it's still only one thing.

I took the SAT in June without much prep (exams happened at the same time) and finished with a 1780. I'm not sure if that's completely accurate because [my SAT test was the June 6th test that had a timing error](https://lp.collegeboard.org/information-regarding-the-saturday-june-6-sat-administration). I might have scored a little higher/lower but some scores had been thrown out. I'm planning to take the SAT again in the fall, and after looking at my scores I'm pretty confident I can get them up to 2000 or higher when I actually prepare for it. 

I know colleges look at circumstances out of a student's control, but I still feel like the fact that I only really had two ""real"" years of HS is going to work against me. 


I've sent my SAT scores to Temple, Hofstra, Syracuse and Penn State (hoping to get into University Park or start at another campus to transfer there), as that score right now puts me at least above the 25th percentile of people that get accepted at some of those schools and then in the 50th percentile of people that get accepted at places like Hofstra. Other schools I've been looking at are Maryland, Seton Hall, Rutgers and GWU, which I guess would be my big reach school. If I needed to declare a major right now, I'd say journalism. 

I guess I wrote all of this because I want to get honest feedback on whether or not any of this is realistic considering that colleges will look at my application and see only junior/senior years with good grades and weak ECs. I know kids with 4.0 GPA all four years who have done everything short of cure cancer in their extracurriculars and they are being waitlisted at best at the colleges they thought were safe for them. I'm just incredibly worried that things are out of my control here no matter how well I do in senior year. If I have to do CC I will, but there's been kind of a huge pressure on me from my family (immigrants from Ivory Coast) to get into a ""real university"" and it would upset them and stress me out to not be able to do that. 

I'm sorry if this is a rambling or hard to follow post, I'm about to leave to do something in a moment and just wanted somewhere to vent and clear my thoughts."
3de46p,3,2015-07-15,Is it too late for me?,boredatwork216,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3de46p/is_it_too_late_for_me/,"Hello all,

I am about to enter the senior year of my undergrad. I'm graduating early in December with an Accounting degree.

Bottom line is, I don't love it. My parents did. I didn't know what major to pick. Here I am. Sitting at my tax internship dreaming about a computer-based career instead.

I've always been decent at figuring out/researching computer-related issues on my own. I'm the go-to person in my friend group and family for things of that nature. I feel like I picked the wrong major. I was intimidated by computer science because of the calc/physics requirements, so I stayed away.

My original plan was to graduate in Dec with my 120 credits, and enter a masters program in accounting to obtain the other 50 credits to sit for the CPA. My parents are all for it/I'm not sure how they'd respond to a complete change in plans should some sort of career switch be possible.

I do not want to do IT audit. I want a stable work/life balance, and do not want to travel much. And I also feel that its so specialized it would be difficult to find a job in the location that I'm living.

Is it too late for me to pursue a career in IT? Would my BSA be useless if I did? If it is at all possible, where would I even start?

I wouldn't be heartbroken if its too late, and would just continue with accounting because I know it is a perfectly viable/stable option, but I just want to explore this idea while I still may be able to.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you."

What can I do this year to make that happen?",_omicron,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3dekfr/have_good_gpa_decent_scores_in_biochemistry_but/,"Here are my stats and then my story:

3.89 GPA in Biochemistry at a middle-tier private university; finished in 2013

Did a summer internship in Materials science at my university; presented to peers, but no paper

GRE Verbal: 166, Quantitative: 165

GRE Biochemistry 580 (71st percentile) 
	Biochem 57 (66th percentile)
	Cell Biology 54 (55th percentile)
	Molecular Biology 59 (77th percentile)

Prepared solutions, supplied reagents for a lab course for two semesters

Did 2.5 years of Biochemistry research. Presented to peers, but no paper. Got some work done, but certainly did not reach my potential. Senior research project (supposed to be honors thesis) was a bit of a flop for a combination of reasons.  During this whole experience, I was experiencing severe depression, in part because of my lack of social support at school. Though I tried to work around this, I ran into other roadblocks. For instance, I was very naïve and confused about research in general. Starting out, I didn’t realize that it would be a good idea to read journals/papers in the field. No one had explained this to me, and it simply never dawned on me. For the majority of the research period, I had not learned the necessary material from my classes that would have allowed me to succeed in the laboratory. Once again, in my younger days, it simply did not occur to me that a person should or could find resources on their own to supplement what they learned in the classroom. I acknowledge that some of these issues were my fault and that others were caused by things like my lack of an academically minded social circle to reach out and seek help from. I almost didn’t finish the senior project due to the depression and even had to get an extension into the summer. This one bullet point on my list is my main source of worry and embarrassment. Otherwise, I did well in the Materials Science summer internship (though it was not as difficult or rigorous as the Biochemistry research). In my academic classes, I had great grades and teachers who were impressed with my performance. I suspect this lab experience was simply a product of a poor fit or my profound ignorance and confusion mentioned above.

Moved back home following my miserable college years. Was a teacher for two years (2013-2015).  I’ll be able to get a very nice recommendation from this job, for what it’s worth. Will not be teaching this year, but instead looking for a job opportunity that will put me more in a position to get into a PhD program

I would like to get into a PhD program dealing with non-coding RNA for Fall 2016, and I would prefer to be at a higher-tier university. While a have taken all necessary classes and have the GPA, etc, I know that my research experience probably won’t cut it. I’m desperately trying to figure out what I can do in this intervening year that will allow me to get my foot in the door. However, it is really pushing the clock considering that many of these jobs will align with the academic schedule (i.e., begin in mid-August). 

I did find some open lab tech positions at prestigious labs that would put me on the right track to getting into the PhD program I want. However, I don’t even know if I’ll be able to get into the lab tech position with the experience I have! Should I email the intended professor to ask him “How can I become a better candidate to get into your PhD program?"" Or is that too presumptuous/forward?

Some other possibilities include just going work for a chemical company closer to home for the year and still seeing if I can get the PhD position. At this point, I’m just trying to beat the clock. I’m trying to make the 2015-2016 year really count so that I can get the experience needed to get into an ideal PhD program. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.

I have everyone to thank. I am now choosing between two IT positions both service desk.

Both are state jobs, one has a lot of VDI and uses AD a lot. Which is good experience. The people there are very nice, I shadow in a lot of troubleshooting tasks, except I fear that if I continue to ask questions and watch behind their backs for another month they may start getting annoyed, and or too busy. I'm with 3 other interns and a future full time job is there but I have to stand out. The demographics of my clients are 60% Indian programmers, so I am a bit intimidated. I'm also feeling that the tech team is close, and sometimes I feel left out of my work place if I don't make friends. Which the other offer seem to be easier on.

The other job, judging from the interview this morning and my interactions, the tech team all seem a bit awkward, which I feel helps me stand out and be more comfortable. I'm less afraid to be myself. The demographic of this state building is mostly women, which is less intimidating. They don't seem to be running VDIs but has an exchange server, AD etc.

Which one should I take? The slightly more future proof hire with easier to stand out, or the more hip more technology, social skills required one?"

I'm currently interning at a decently sized MSP with a bunch of clients we offer services for. We offer both in house tech support as well as a helpdesk with a ticket system. I came into this internship with pretty much zero IT experience, so I've been working my way from the ground up. It's been very educational. But, on occasion, I get calls that make even me want to faceplant on my keyboard.

It's been fairly busy for a Wednesday. The morning was filled with some rough tickets, on top of which we were having technical difficulties with our phone system (individual machines, needed a reset via pulling out the ethernet cords, yada yada). In the afternoon the calls started to slow down like a usual day in July outside of the ongoing problems from the morning.

I'm busy not doing anything in particular when the phone rings. My first ticket in three hours!

&gt;$FrontDesk: Hey, $Customer at $Client is having issues with his outlook, can you take the call? *I accept the call* Thanks, transferring now.

I pick up to the guy on the other end. We exchange pleasantries before getting to the meaty goods.

&gt;$Customer: So I have two hard drives here with two monitors and my outlook on one is working fine, but it's not on the other one and I don't know why.

&gt;$migbits: You mean a dual monitor system?

&gt;$Customer: No, I mean I have two hard drives.

Deciding this is already looking like one of **THOSE** calls, I remote in to the machine with the outlook that isn't working. Upon starting it up, I get

&gt;**This name does not match any entries in the address list**

Well then. I click OK and a dialogue box comes up with a change names option that doesn't do anything. I decide to take things slow and start with a profile repair and see what happens. While I'm navigating through the control panel, $Customer is answering my questions.

&gt;$migbits: Was anything done to this account since the last time you used your outlook?

&gt;$Customer: Well, there was one thing, where one of your rep guys came in to fix things when the server went down last week - *I nod absently, I remember the incident* - and he came and did a bunch of stuff on it, maybe that has something to do with it?

One of our guys huh? Something pings, but I'm not sure what yet. I take another look at the check names option. It's set to the account $CustomerAdmin. When I look at the profile repair that's started, it's waiting for me to enter an email address to match the account for...$CustomerAdmin.

Waitaminute.

I hop down to the start menu and check, and...Sure enough, this is an admin account. I didn't notice before because I was more focused on getting to the mail options.

&gt;$migbits: Um, are you supposed to be on this account?

&gt;$Customer: Well, now that you mention it, I don't think that's the same one on my other hard drive...Let me double check. Oh, yes, it's not the same, I wonder if that's it.

&gt;$migbits: *yes that's totally it why on earth are you on the admin account* Okay, let's try logging off and switching to your account then. Do you mind if I close these? *mouses over his open software*

&gt;$Customer: Uh, why, are you gonna shut it down? Or restart it?

&gt;$migbits: ...Er, no, I was going to try to get you on your personal account.

&gt;$Customer: Ohhhhh, okay got it.

He shuts down his software, I have him login, and boom, a working outlook that is already open on his desktop.

The thing that baffles me is how, even if our guys were working using his computer on the admin account, how he would have been able to login again. We don't give out that information. Or, you know, since he would have to login with his own credentials you think he would have been rejected...A mystery.

TLDR: Customer gets himself onto an admin account that he shouldn't have been able to get on to in the first place."

I will graduate with my BA in sociology in December. I've been in NYC for the past month and change and haven't been able to find a job or internship. It's not a major big deal right now, as I have the comfort of going back to school soon. However, I'm admittedly a little worried about being able to find a full-time job in the nonprofit sector once I graduate in December.


I want to make the transition from school to work as smooth as possible and I'm wondering if you folks have any advice for me in terms of what I should be doing in the next few months. Would anyone be willing to speak about the nonprofit climate in their local areas and what the best ways are for a recent grad to get their foot in the door? 

Also, would any social science majors have any advice about best marketing the skills gained throughout college?


I know ""nonprofit"" covers a wide span of jobs and occupations. Currently I'm interested in affordable housing and I have experience with a nonprofit education organization. Additionally, I'm mildly interested by HR, but have no experience at this point.


TL;DR: Can't find job/internship for summer in NYC. Graduate in December and getting worried about finding job upon graduation. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

As a result, I graduated early with a non-clinical Masters degree in Speech and Hearing Sciences. In looking what I could do and what my past experiences and interests tailored most to, I found academic advising. 

I had always wanted to be a psychologist/counselor growing up, but my father had a giant influence on pushing healthcare, which although I did well in the coursework, did not enjoy the clinical practice. 

Anyways, I managed to send an email and land a 2 month full-time academic advising internship at my alma mater (a large big ten university). I advised over 100 students in the division of general studies during the 2 months (including international students) and led daily small group meetings with the students. We did everything the actual academic advisors were doing so it was a great experience. 

I also managed to land a job with the title ""Registration Advisor Representative and Career Services Representative"" at a very new, very small, private non-for-profit college. Now, I have been with my current boyfriend for a long time and although not engaged, we are serious, and right now the plan is for me to work this job for a year and then relocate to another city after he gets his PhD next year. 

I would like to think with a MA degree and one year direct advising experience, I should be able to get an academic advising job at a university, but I looked on linkedin at advisors in that area before they landed their current positions and A) they all seems to have relevant MA degrees (in Higher Ed, counseling, etc) and a heck of a lot of experience or experience at the university they got their higher ed degrees at. I'm beginning to think that if I relocate.. will I not be able to land a job? This is my only niche (and I have a weird degree for it). I also have other ""somewhat related"" experience working with undergraduate students (as a research supervisor of undergrads and as a grad assistant supervising undergrads in the health ed department putting on health programs on campus). I also worked as a student success mentor in my undergrad for 1.5 years and did a summer of campus tours for undergrad residence halls. So not really advising experience, but relevant. 

Basically, I'm scared to relocate and not be able to find a job. What do you think? Am I worrying too much? I can try to search out of state for a bit and keep my current job, but eventually I'd like to move out there so we are not SO long distance. I struggle with uncertainty a lot, so I also don't like the idea of moving out there and not being engaged... we are in a serious, committed relationship and he clearly loves me (and me him). My mom says not to worry, but that's my middle name. I'm worried he'd leave me if I couldn't find a job (even though he said he would support me any way he could and as long as I was looking, it would be fine). He also is optimistic I'll find a job though. "

As such, I have no workplace experience in tech at the moment.

I have a 3.4 gpa, and I'm a major in CS and Math at a pretty competitive school. The name of the school is strong but its engineering department is pretty so-so; nonetheless, CS grads are paid on average $80k starting.

I have gone through 3 interviews and they have requested my clearances, transcripts, degrees, and a copy of my professional license - which I take to be a positive sign. They, however, also want 3 letters of reference from former supervisors or professors written on letterhead. 

My current job is my first job out of graduate school and without a concrete offer from the job for which I have been interviewing, I am not comfortable jeopardizing my current job by asking my supervisors there for a reference. I have my independent licensing supervisor and one of my supervisors from my current place of employment (who I trust and who is also my friend and has known about this new opportunity since it arose) writing me letters but I am totally stuck on the third.

I put in a call this morning to my supervisor at my most recent graduate school internship. I did well there, but I haven't kept in touch for the last 2 years. It's been almost an entire day and I haven't gotten a response to my voicemail. Should I assume this avenue is closed? Or try again tomorrow?  

Professors from graduate school are also accepted, but I wasn't particularly close with any of them and don't believe any of them would remember me. 

Can anyone help me think of other resources for supervisor reference letters than the ones I have already tried? I'd hate to lose out on this job opportunity because of this.

I'm going to be building this in late September/October, so I still have time to watch out for sales, buy parts, etc. I also don't have a budget limit, but I don't want to waste money on anything superfluous. 

I currently have a GTX 980 and all my peripherals (4K 27"" Dell P2715Q, etc.). I'm looking for recommendations on the following parts:

* CPU: I can get processors for half off via the Intel intern discount. For example, i7-5960k for ~525, 5930k for 300, etc. Most likely, I'll get a Skylake version of one of those - is a 5960k overkill? What would be more appropriate? The Skylake versions of  5930, 5830, or 5820? I plan on keeping this processor for 4-5 years. As is, I'll only be running the GTX 980, but I plan on adding more/better GPUs in the future. I'll also be getting a MOBO from Intel.

* Case: I've heard good things about the Fractal Design R5 and Phanteks Enthoo Pro. The former is smaller and quieter, while the other has better cooling and modifiability. Which one should I get? It'll be sitting in a college dorm room for at least next year.

* PSU: What are some good, right-size PSUs that power between 800 and 1000 watts?

* Cooling: I'm kind of lost as to what kind/brand of cooling I should get? Are fans enough? Should/do I need liquid cooling?

Thanks!"

3dhcil,2,2015-07-16,Wife cannot advance in her career after receiving a bad performance rating.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3dhcil/wife_cannot_advance_in_her_career_after_receiving/,"Hi Reddit. 
  
My wife has been struggling to advance her career after receiving a ""needs improvement"" rating. I've tried giving her advice on what she should do but, at the end of the day she just wants me to listen. I'll try to give as many details as possible but I need keep a lot of info general, I cannot be specific about the job or its duties (it is a very small field). Its wordy and lengthy so be prepared. I am trying to paint a picture of the here big boss Steve as he pretty much holds all the keys. I know how I would deal with him but my wife is a little less direct and respects him. I am looking for some advice about how to move forward here. 

  
Wife has a BS/MS from a good university. She has worked in the field or a closely related field in pretty much every arena(academia, private industry, public/govt employee). She has publications and patents in areas that are 100% applicable to her day to day tasks.
  
She is currently working for the state as an employee in a lab setting. This is a  good job and it took quite some time to land this job. She has been at this job for about 5 years, she has been with the state for about 8 years total. She has 2-3 years or experience outside of the state. She also spent about 4 years doing her MS work (shitty advisor for those of you who know the feels), again all lab work. In total she has somewhere between 10-14 years of direct lab experience  (We're in our mid 30's, I feel this is important to note, we're not 26 with 15 years of experience)

  
So let us start with the juicy details
  
My wife gets hired on about 1 months after another new hire, new hire was there as an intern, new hire is the golden child. The work has a LOT of training required. New hire is trained on methods A, B and C, new hire is trained by Dora(this becomes important later).  My wife is trained on method A and is given some other work that needs to be done (follow up on this, call them, do this other clerical job because we are understaffed). Wife is trained by soon to be big boss Steve. Steve is too busy to train my wife and too busy to be bothered with answering questions about the training.(If you're thinking, its training, I've had to train people, it's horrible.. I know.. But after completing this training you are expected to perform certain tasks flawlessly, mistakes are tracked in the lab and are not tolerated, training is expected to take 6-9 months). Training goes slowly but my wife finishes and is certified to begin lab work. Steve complains that it took too long questions whether wifey poo actually has the knowledge necessary to do the job, says this to her face. Steve is one of these on again off again  types, he suggests that he can help and that my wife should ask more questions followed up by you ask to many questions. Wife freely shares accurate direct info on all the issues with Steve, her mentor (dishonestly in this job would get you fired, lying or manipulating data -fired, lying by omission - fired ).  This goes on for the first 2 years. Wife pretty much does the same type or work for 2 years (remember wife was only trained on method A)
New hire is doing great, excelling in her career, training is done (2 years of training ), Dora has done a good job training her employee. Dora and Steve are married BTW (for now…) 
  

Some minor errors happen, mostly grammatical, transposes a number when writing a report (lots of paper work involved with this job). Steve implies these are not tolerated. Wife gets her eyes checked, gets glasses to ensure that periods, commas and page numbers are all correct.  Wife makes a transpose on 2 numbers twice in a row. Steve suggests/asks if my wife is she has a learning disability and is this why she has so many grammatical errors. This obviously pisses off my wife, she comes home crying that day.  Within the next two weeks a big error occurs (no injuries or damage, a mistake happens, mistakes arent tolerated ), it is a big deal, wife cannot do lab work for a while.  Wife needs to write a report to the big big boss Conrad, explaining why it happened, wife adds in some factoids about how her mentor essentially suggested she had a learning disability and that had distracted her a fair amount. Conrad suggests that maybe she shouldn’t put that in that detail, that isnt what was meant, that could cause trouble etc. 
  
Things calm down a bit, wife is put back onto lab work. Somewhere in this time frame Steve is appointed to head of the lab.  Shit starts to go down hill after this. Im just going to give brief snippets to avoid another 19 paragraphs. 

  
There is a type of issue that can happen in this work, it cant be avoided but they don’t like it when this happens. Another employee has this issue and it comes up in a staff meeting, steve suggests that these things happen just be sure you didn’t change any habits. This error happens to my wife and big boss goes on a rant about how some people are more error prone and should be more careful. 
  
Steve suggests that wifey poo is already working on the most trival work they have and if she cant handle this work, then there is nothing for her to do in the lab. Wife still has not been trained on the other methods. Promise training is floated out but never realized. Work outside her main tasks is assigned pretty consistenly mostly office tech work roles are rotating but my wife  is assigned a brunt of it because she is not trained in xyz methods. 
  
Wife is continuing to do work, quality is improving. Wife gets pregnant, cannot do some of the lab work, the people who take over her work make a mistake, Steve insinuates that this looks bad on her

  
Wife is assigned tasks to prepare lab equipment and lab material used by this and other labs while pregnant, lab experiment is not working out, the unavoidable error has happened again and my wife is the culprit. (this is 100% unavoidable unless this work was done in a clean room or by machines, neither of which is industry standard. )
  
Steve and Dora divorce, Dora leaves.  
  
Wife goes out on 8 month maternity leave…
Wife gets an email while she is out that her yearly review is ready but he wants to do it in person when she returns….
  

Wife gets a ""needs improvement"" performance review and is presented a list cataloged by project of issues. You missed a page number, you opened a box of supplies when one was already opened, you duplicated a reference number… A fucking really long list of 10 mundane issues and 1-2 moderate issues. Steve makes the case that there is a pattern and feels my wife will continue to have issues, She is not allowed to do lab work for ""some amount of time""
  
There is an option on the review to indicate that you don’t agree with this assessment which means it needs to be reviewed by upper management. Our buddy Conrad essentially suggests that maybe this work isnt for you. But we can provide you some counselling for your issues in order to reduce job stress. 
  
Wife is again assigned the mundane work, wife notices that something regarding a piece of equipment has been done incorrectly, wife points it out, Steve asks my wife to fix it. Then, several hours later, asks wifey poo to prove that was really the issue. Wife has to dig through the trash to find the ""proof"". 
  
It has now been about 8 months since this occurred, wife asks Steve when she will be getting back in the lab, Steve says that she is doing great where she is now but he will work on it. Steve acts like a ""person"", lets wifey know that he has gone to the same job stress counselling. This is another recurring theme, Steve acts like a decent human being and is nice just enough to where my wife sees him as a person and not the animal he is. He is a very smart guy but should not be in charge of other people or their careers. 

Wifes career is essentially on stand still. I would love it if she could quit her job and stay home with our baby but we want to have some freedom later in life which is going to require about 5 more years of working out of her. Ideally these next 5 years would not be complete dogshit. If my wife doesn’t get back into the lab, her career/job title has essentially plateaued. 


Any suggestions on how we should deal with this? Comments ... questions. "
3di2qq,5,2015-07-16,Going a bit against the grain here - how to set myself up for a career in Corporate Finance (preferably FP&amp;A)?,ShayWhoPlaysAllDay,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3di2qq/going_a_bit_against_the_grain_here_how_to_set/,"I am a rising junior at a well known state school who just switched my major to Finance, with a 3.4 GPA.  Because I switched late, I have to stay an extra year and so technically I'm going into my 4th year atm.  Last summer I had an Client Strategy internship at a well known company - but no direct finance experience to speak of, and this summer due to a family emergency I had to go overseas and wasn't able to secure an internship.  So I'm trying to set myself up as well as possible this summer to secure a relevant internship in FP&amp;A (what I'd like to go into), preferably at a F500 (at minimum) company if that is realistic, so I can get an entry level Analyst position at graduation and down the road hopefully follow the hierarchy to Director.

Based on research I see that a huge amount of FP&amp;A is Excel work - what specifically should I focus on and how can I present this strongly in an interview?  Are there any reputable Excel certifications to put on a resume?  What are some CONCRETE steps I can take this summer to increase my value to companies?

This sub and the internet focuses so much on ""how to get a job in investment banking!"" that there's not much concentration on how to get a job in FP&amp;A haha.  I'm not sure where to go - I just want to increase my chances as much as possible.

Also as a side note - I see that some sources tell me to get that breaking into CF is more difficult with a Finance degree than an Accounting.  How much truth is there to this and how will it affect me?

Thank you!

EDIT: Also, I was going to learn Financial Modelling but it's a large field - things like LBO models are more suited to M&amp;A so I'm assuming it wouldn't help much with Corp Fin within a company?  Or am I off base?"

In our company $SmallCloudServicesProvider ($SCSP for later), we use zabbix as a monitoring tool.

Now a while ago, a former intern set up a new server as a final project. This server then was around 3/4 of a year just lingering around, until I got the project of getting the server live.


We worked out a plan, which has a month of parallel use, where we check whether the new system monitors all the systems we need. This is where the tale happens.


A newer coworker of me had the task of setting up some systems and sending those to the customers. This included adding those to the zabbix, which I showed her how to do. I then pointed out, that the system also need to be on the new zabbix server.


Now the way we have it set up is, that the old server is reachable over zabbix.$SCSP.TLD/zabbix/index.php. The new server is configured the same way, so I tell her to simply switch the FQDN with the internal IP of the new server, as the new server will listen on the same address as the old, as soon it goes live.


But then something unexpected happened:


&gt;Not Found

&gt;The requested URL /zabbix/dashboard.php was not found on this server.

&gt;Apache/2.2.22 (Debian) Server at 192.168.xxx.xxx Port 80


Well goddamn, I already had this when I started working on the server and a restart usually was able to solve it. But not this time.


I start looking at it on my own workstation and also cannot access the server with the URL's that I had in the history of my browser.


&gt;Well that's strange...


...was the thing I thought to myself and start googling after ""zabbix 404"". Looked a few stackoverflow and zabbix forum articles and most were talking about switching the directory of the apache.conf or zabbix.conf files. Before I start changing something about the backend, I of course make a snapshot, just in case the server becomes FUBAR and/or I lose oversight about what I switched to where.


But this wouldn't use anything or the file or directory in question didn't exist.


&gt;Maybe something's wrong with the site it self.


Again thinking to myself, so I switch into the /etc/apache2 directory and look at the sites-enabled. Now the reason I didn't do this earlier, was because they were still named default and default SSL.


What I've seen in there made me facepalm hard. We switched the document root from  ""/usr/share"" to ""usr/share/zabbix"", which makes sense right? Now everyone who remotely worked with websites should already see what happened.


I forgot we changed the document root and still tried to access over /zabbix/, while this folder was the document root.


Yeah, I'm not a very smart man.

**TL;DR: Changed document root and still tried to access the site over the same URL and got an 404, was already expecting the backend being broken.**

Programming practices are poor, no senior devs, only a ""contractor"" who never graduated with a Bachelor's in Engineering and a Manager who does not know how to code.
There have been previous programmers who have quit due to burn out and work-related stress. It's not so much the people but the methods and choices they make with regards to how they want to go about developing things.
Our contractor does not document or comment codes and does not run proper code testing. 

I've worked on the intranet portal web applications and am the ""lead"" Dev for the company website (pretty much self taught the whole time). I don't know what to do, we recently hired two new full time programmers and I'm supposed to ""teach"" one of them on how to develop something that we've done before, in a matter of just a week when the forms we developed before took forever to create.

I just don't get how me, an intern is supposed to do that. I feel like I should quit and just focus on my upcoming senior year for college. (Will be graduating next Spring).

They want things in a rush and there's a huge technical debt, previous problems arise every month and issues consistently pop up. 

I want to learn new technologies and frameworks. We are still just stuck with JQuery. No new things. I'm not even excited about developing a website that produces knobs, hinges and latches, etc. 

Please share any advice or suggestions. Thank you.

3dit4z,2,2015-07-16,TIFU by taking a rest stop in SF,GrizzlyDrew,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3dit4z/tifu_by_taking_a_rest_stop_in_sf/,"This happened about about 3 months ago. 

I was on my way home from northern california to southern california, a 13 hour drive from my school to my childhood home where my parents live. I decided it would be a good idea to visit this girl I started to date the prior month in SF since it was about 5 hours into the drive it would give me a good place to relax and get some rest, as well as see her for the last time before the summer break happened and I go off to my internship. I met her parents the week prior and figured they were cool so it would be okay. I get to her house and noticed immediately something seemed off about her. I asked her what was up and she said it was a little soon for me to be going to her house and staying there for the night since we just started dating and apparently she was nervous to have me around her parents. I did the first logical thing I could think of and told her if she wasn't comfortable with it, I could just be on my way. It isn't like I haven't done the 13 hour drive before multiple times alone. She seemed to brush away her nervousness at the thought of not being able to hang out for awhile and told me none sense, just come in. We end up having a great time just hanging out and spending time together. Her parents and her made a bed for me downstairs(in the basement), to sleep in and I graciously accept. Her and I are hanging out downstairs and we are just enjoying each others company and her parents say they are going to bed. 

Here is where the FU is... Her parents go to bed and I end up getting pretty sleepy myself and start to get cozy, she joined me to cuddle up, and as I begin to fall asleep I realize her parents may not be cool with us sleeping together. Though we had been doing that for the past month that we were dating basically. I asked her if her parents would be mad, she responds with a ""Meh, I guess we will see."" I tell her I don't know how I feel about that and maybe she should sleep upstairs, but she insists on keeping me company and sleeping next to me. 

I begin my regular sleep routine by brushing my teeth, then stripping down to just boxers. I slide into bed where she slides right next to me and we doze off into a comfortable sleep snuggling close. 

I am abruptly woken up, nothing touched me or anything, I just opened my eyes... and her father is standing at the end of the bed, silently, with his eyes on his daughter. 

At this point I am so sleepy, I almost completely shrug it off, but I give her a nudge and whisper, ""umm, your dad is here."" To which she immediately springs up and out of the bed(thankfully clothed) to head upstairs where they ""talk"".

At this point, it is so early and I am so tired, I just roll over and go back to bed. She comes back about an hour later and slides back where she was and we continue to sleep for about another hour. After I wake up, she is normally fully awake, I ask her what happened. Apparently her mother came in and tried to shake her up twice and she ignored it, at which the mother sent her father down to wake her and that's when I awoke. Her mom was extremely disappointed and wanted me out of the house immediately. She didn't force me out, instead she went to work and said as soon as he gets up, get him out. 

Her mother had a huge talk with her about being a virgin and all this crap, I wasn't even her first, and she told her mom that and they had a huge talk about not knowing me long enough and what not(Which we have known each other for about a year and a half through friends, but never pursued one another). We didn't even have sex in their house, which I almost regret because it was awhile before I saw her again. I am patient and can wait, but now her mom has been trying to convince her of not dating me, for no good reason might I add, and instead asks her to go on a date with some creepy guy from her church that her mom has known since they were little. 

Is it just me or do her parents seem way overbearing? It's not like it is her first child, her first one ran as far away as possible and lives in Japan teaching kids english. I see why she got out of there and doesn't come to visit often.

What really bothered me was that she told her not to date me and to date some other random dude, when she doesn't even know me or the relationship/connection her daughter and I have developed..

She is a really good girl and the type that I would want to see myself with in the future, not those part-timers who come and go for fun or lust. Something much more sustainable. 

She now has her heart set on moving out closer to me so we can be together and my internship has turned into an actual job that I may have around a year. Her parents will hate her forever if she moves to Vegas to be with a guy that they do not want her with... Any Suggestions?

TL;DR: Started a relationship with someone sweet, met her parents, slept over at her house, got woken up by father in the morning standing over the bed, mother now hates me for no apparent reason and wants her to date some creepy church boy from back in the day.

For those who haven't worked with law firms, during the summer months, newly minted lawyers-to-be are generally treated to fun-tastic internships during their last year of law school.  And every year, the new crop of graduates bring with them wide-eye innocence and general techno-blundery:

We head to his office and I walk in, seat myself in front of the monitor, push the power button, and it turns on.  Looks fine to me.

I turn off the monitor and let him take the chair.  He then proceeds to quickly push the monitor's power button twice, turning it on then back off again.

Proceed to slowly explain that, no, you don't have to ""double-click"" the power button.

I graduated 2 years ago with a B.A. in Radio, TV &amp; Film from a school in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Upon graduation, I interned for a summer at Sirius XM in Los Angeles working for a radio show.  Upon finishing the internship I was actually offered a 1-year contract job as a show producer.  It was a great opportunity (seeing as how it isn't really an entry-level position)  I was offered the position because I worked hard and was liked among the staff (difficult to do in said environment).  However, with little to no experience in radio outside of college, I was in way over my head.  

For a year I toiled away in a harsh, abusive environment.  I received no training.  I worked for a complete psychopath shock jock who took every opportunity to abuse and embarrass me on and off the air.  I was the whipping boy. I was constantly being told I was stupid and useless, although this is hardly the case.  Upon completing the contract, I was let go and replaced by someone making 3x my salary to do the same job.  

Having failed, I moved back in with my mom and had a really tough time finding a job for 6 months in anything relevant to my degree.  Eventually, I settled with a gig as an office assistant for a video game developer here in the Bay Area. It is also a contract job with little to no chance for full time employment.  I feel like I have taken a step back in my career: I am making less money and don't do anything of real substance at work. I don't garner much respect from my coworkers (I am seen as the guy that stocks the kitchen), and I am stuck cleaning up after people's messes.  I feel I have much more to offer.

I didn't expect to have to work a job like this after college and especially after having a ""real"" job.  I am stuck living with my mom because I don't want to sign a lease when I don't have any job security beyond a year. (I have 6 months left on my contract).  

I spend my free time at work looking for a new job.  My experience in radio left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the industry, however I am not ruling out trying it again.  My experience in the video game industry has shown me that it is tough; very high turnover rate with most employees working on short contracts.  I am told that it is the standard of the industry.  I would like to find something a little more reliable, but again, I am not ruling it out.  I am open to pretty much anything in the media industry, but searching often I find very few opportunities that I am actually qualified for and have received zero responses in my applications.  Working for free is out of the question.

I feel my strength is also my weakness: I am good at pretty much everything I try, I am great at nothing.  This has always been the case with me.  In school, I felt my strengths were in my writing and communication abilities, I could have taken this pretty much anywhere.  I picked the major I did because I had the biggest personal interest in it.  I studied photography, audio &amp; video production, broadcasting and am pretty knowledgeable in these areas but have no ""advanced skills"" in any.  I think the lack of ""advanced skills"" has prevented me from being considered for even entry level jobs in these fields.

In short, I feel completely stuck and go through the motions every day.  I find happiness in my personal life outside of work but just want to be doing something at work that I don't hate and is actually part of a 'career'.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading.  "

I've recently started interning as a security intelligence consultant and have been mainly doing SIEM related work. I have an undergraduate in computer engineering and master's in IT Management (recent graduate). The job is just an internship for now with a good exposure and I have no relevant work experience in the field of security apart from this year long internship.
I've been thinking of getting a certification to get a better foothold in the security industry as a whole. I've been thinking of getting a SSCP or a Security+- though of what I've read one a few posts on reddit is that security+ does not add a lot of leaning value except for being HR friendly. I'm not lookig for something to be HR friendly but to add value by learning. Any other certifications you think would add value, please let me know.

P.S.- I've taken computer networks and advanced computer networks classes in my undergraduate so I'm not a complete newbie, I do have familiarity if not expertise of most terms and concepts I hear on the job."

Alright so things have always been a bit sour in my family. I have a twin brother, and we both graduated high school to go into community college for two years. At first I kind of agreed with my parents in thinking that we were failures because we didn't get into famous/respectable universities, but that changed as time went on. The last two years have been amazing and full of self-discovery. The people that I've met and the environment that community college has offered me has helped me to discover myself and what I am passionate about. Next fall (Fall 2015), we are finally transferring to a top public university in Southern California. Problem solved right? Nah.

Nowadays my parents, especially my mother, will find anything to poke and prod my brother and I with to bring us down. Two months ago it was not finding a job for the summer. A month ago it was spending too much time at work in the summer (I got a internship at a small tech firm and also work part-time a a drugstore/pharmacy chain). This week it was having a ""filthy"" room. Her definition of ""filthy"" - not having an absolutely clear desk, having folded laundry in the open, and having my work things on my table. She went as far as to say this: ""If you can't clean your room don't bother going to work!!!"" A day or two passed, and during that time I chose to absolutely minimize contact with her at home. I thought it was over since the ""filth"" was really just an in-between day where I was doing laundry after work, but nah. She sends me about 3 texts and WeChat messages during my work hours the following day saying the same shit; threatening me and saying I need to stay home and not go to work if I can't do so-and-so chores. And so I do what I need to and continue minimizing communications with her. Any conversation with her is either hellish chicken-like screaming or constant questioning. It drives me and my brother insane.

Fast forward a couple of days, I get my first paycheck from the drugstore place that I work part-time at and I had a question - so I go and ask my dad, since he's been pretty chill this entire summer. He tells me what I need to know and all is well. She asks me quickly - do you need me to deposit your check for you? And this is where I communicate with her politely - no, ___ and I will deposit them ourselves, we need this experience handling situations like this (with an emphasis on it being a EXPERIENCE that my brother and I needed to go through).

An hour later, while I'm in my room writing code and goofing around on reddit, she sends me a WeChat message, 20 feet away from me in the living room.... and here it is.

""I know how happy when recieved first pay check, but you do not worry I won't take your money, I won't ask you for any favorite. Do whatever you like. You do not like talking to me does not matter, even don't call me Mom. Do not ask me any money. I believe your tuition, room and food cost you can look out for yourself in the future.""

WTF??????????????????????? How the fuck do I respond to this? Why is she taking the ""my brother and I want to deposit our own checks since its our first check thing so personally""? Is she really fucking threatening me, cutting us out from financial help with tuition over this small shit? Well maybe I'm not 100% surprised since this is the same woman that always says she would have rather given birth to a piece of BBQ pork than us. 

What do I do, and if it comes down to it, how can I afford myself through ~2 years of University? I get around ~10.1k in grants/aid and 2.5k in work study, but will need someway to pay for the remaining ~18k in tuition. Send your advice this way, please!"

Maybe due to me thinking this could fuck up everything for me, or that I feel like I've let down my awesome boss and amazing coworker. 

In my head all I can do is replaying the scene in my head and hating myself for it. I keep saying hateful things to myself. I keep squeezing and pinching and rubbing till it hurts me. And it fucking scares me. I've never been like this before and I don't actually think I'd kill myself, but I would never have guessed that I would try and harm myself to feel better. I keep getting thoughts of wanting to just disappear. I can't handle all the feelings of causing all this disappointment. 

When I'm hurting myself, it helped for a while to focus on my breathing to calm down and keep my palms open, but then I start hating myself for even needing to calm down. 

I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I've told a few people, but they have jobs and can't do much for me in the day. I am afraid of telling more people right now for fear of more disappointment and rejection.

Using Google I was able to find a function that worked, and modified it to my needs, answering the problem. My problem is this though: while I understood it enough to modify it, I don't feel I understand recursion enough to write my own functions, and i'm very worried for when the time comes for me to go in and have an interview in person. I'm sure they will have me answer questions on a whiteboard, and where I'm at now, I'm not ready. While we do have programming courses in IS, it doesn't go into the theory like CS does.

3dneg1,4,2015-07-17,Possible Immigration scam,scamthrowaway89,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3dneg1/possible_immigration_scam/,"I had posted this on /r/scams[1] but only posters with a certain karma limit are allowed to post there pending mod approval. This is a throwaway account and I was hoping someone would advice me. What I posted is below:


This is my first time posting here and I don't know if this is the right forum, but I needed some advice. I was speaking with some international students who are visiting my home town for the weekend. They are friends of my coworker. They arrived to the US only recently and I was making small talk, asking how they like the country and college life so far. From what they described of their program and college it seems like a giant immigration scam. I know this because I have dealt with international students before when I was at university and know the paperwork they require to be legal students.

1. They claimed that their program allowed them to complete 50% of their coursework in 8 months! And that they would complete a semester's worth of coursework in a single course in a month. This would be for one computer science course. So a semester's worth of coursework in a single course over a month
1. They were promised that after completing the first 8 months they would be given curricular practical training (CPT) privileges. Now CPT, for those who that don't know, is actually for students to have internship experiences to count towards their degree. But this 'university' would allow them to work on an 'internship', and take remote online classes for the rest of the program. The placements for these 'internships' is arranged by this 'university' through shady agencies. All this is done with the promise of a job. In fact students are brought over from South Asia with the explicit promise of a job after graduation.

1. The students then have to pay off their tuition ( which they haven't been paying for) and other expenses with interest after they find a job.

This entire process seemed like immigration scam to me because the school seems to be misusing the F1 visa program for international students, promising them jobs after having them complete a fake ass degree. It is a money making scheme misusing the immigration rules we have place in this country.

 The 'university' I am speaking of is based in Fairfield, Iowa (easy enough to guess from this) and I live in another state. I checked the USCIS website about reporting a scam and it took me to the following link.
 http://www.uscis.gov/avoid-scams/report-immigration-scams[2]
 So I was hoping if someone could tell me how to proceed and whether I should report it at all. Some of the links for the state of Iowa seem to be outdated. I wanted to leave an anonymous tip for USCIS but at the same time I want them to look into this university.

I'm graduating sometime next year and would really like to get a return offer for full time. 

Last week one of my best mates and I got into a pretty bad car wreck. I managed to wake up in the ER with some moderate injuries, but my best friend did not survive it. I spent about a week and and a half in the hospital and just got out. On doctors order I can't go back to work for at least another 2-3 weeks depending on how my follow ups pan out. 

I'm still pretty shaken up about the whole thing. Everything feels unreal, like I'm living in a foggy hazy world. My boss has been pretty supportive regarding the ordeal. I told him I could be back at work following a week's leave from the hospital (but this was before I received the doctors new orders). I'll have to update him on the new orders, but I'm worried he won't take it well as I've been assigned a pretty big project to finish this summer. Can I be fired for having too take so much time off? 

More so, I'm not even sure if I'll be able to preform at the same level I did before the accident. I was doing pretty well at the internship before but now I'm on a lot of meds and have trouble thinking about anything else besides the accident and death. I can't shake the feeling that I don't deserve to be the one who survived. I have a history with depression and worry that things will just go down the drain once I go back to work, but I also don't know how I'm going to survive weeks of bed rest without work to occupy my mind. It's a no win situation.

So far my boss doesn't know that much about what really happened, only that I was involved in a wreck. I'm not sure how much information to divulge. I don't know whether I should tell him about my friends death. I would rather not have my whole team knowing what really happened. I hate being seen as the ""special"" or pity case and I'm not trying to seek sympathy. But then again, everyone will ask when (if?) I come back what had happened, and I don't know if I can lie... :( I feel defeated.

Tl;dr Need to take min 4 weeks off of a 12 week internship. Am I going to get canned?

(Update)Thank you for everyones kindness. It is true that I am feeling a little anxious to speak to my boss (but really just anyone at the moment) regarding the ordeal. I've never been good with talking about my emotions and I've always been too afraid and anxious to seek actual mental help so it will be difficult, but I will try my best.

When I was a naive 17 year old I decided to go out of state to a top 30 university for cs. Pretty rad. Anyways I got my bill for college today and its more expensive than last year by a lot. I will have to take out 25k in loans if I want to continue going here. Bills are due soon. 


What should I do? Should I drop out and go to a cc? I would feel like a failure there since I didn't start that route in the beginning. Plus, most courses already filled up so I wouldn't be able to take probably any cs or math courses which sucks.. I don't even have that many gen eds left either. 


I really just don't know what to do. If I finish this year I will probably have close to 45k in debt, not including interest, and that's depending on me getting a specific job I applied for on campus which pays a lot of money. I plan on getting internships during the summer this year and the summer of junior year but I don't know realistically how much I can bring the cost down. 


And again, my cc has very limited course offerings and the classes they do have fill up quickly. I would transfer somewhere but people keep telling me that transfer students don't get as much financial aid as regular students. And I'm at a complete loss of what to do. And I don't know who to go for help. 



I plan on discussing this with my parents later to get advice from them since they're cosigning my loans. But I feel like a failure before even graduating college- before even finishing sophomore year. My efc is low and my gpa is high and yet I still feel like I'm going to end up in a bad place no matter what path I choose. I don't even know how much financial aid I'll get from cc if they don't pay the full cost would it even be worth going there.


Please help? I can't sleep at night because of this. I wish I could backtrack. Everyone just calls me an idiot for already taking out ~23k in loans for freshman year. "

* Past experience: Took two C++ courses in undergrad, used C++ to do a math research project in grad school, tutored many students in AP Stats.

* Recently: Watched the MIT and CalTech ML lecture series. Taking MIT MOOC in Python. Working through Project Euler in Python. Working through an R-based statistics book.

* Goals: I'm moving to Boston at the end of the summer. I really want to start up a CS career. I'm open to options, but I find data science and ML interesting, and they seem like good ways to leverage my math degree.

* Problem: I don't have a ton of experience and I'm likely to be up against math PhDs and people with CS degrees/experience.

* Possible Solutions: One of my friends took an unpaid internship and then impressed them enough that it became a paid job. Another of my friends works for an insurance company and said that he would recommend me for one of their data analytics teams if I were to learn enough of the relevant statistics.

I was hoping for some feedback:

1. What would a potential entry level job look like for someone with my background? What would be a fair starting salary? Should I be looking at internships (most of 'em seem to want people still in school)?

2. What would you spend the next month(s) learning or doing to prepare yourself?

3. What projects are good enough to include on a resume? For example, I wrote a genetic algorithm that's about 200 lines long to solve a Project Euler problem (just for the experience, didn't need to). That seems kinda short and frivolous, but I don't have a lot of projects right now, and it's a kind of proof of concept.

Thank you for your time!"

I'm kind of desperate at this point.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3domoq/is_there_any_surefire_way_for_me_to_get_a_job_in/,"I have a CIS degree from a school that's well known in some circles but not in others, but because it's not a ""big name"" school a lot of larger companies haven't heard of it. I'm looking for a job in my area, which is a decently sized city with a big tech component. I have been applying for work every day for the past year with no responses, and now I have a yearlong gap on my resume. I don't want to hold out for my dream job or even my halfway dream job. I want to get some experience under my belt. 

How do I get a job? I've sent out my resume to tons of companies, and I've had it looked at by several people and they've all said it's alright given that I've never had a real job or internship in tech, although I did some web development for a local startup. I couldn't even get a response from Staples or Best Buy. My original dream was to do Web Dev (RoR or JS) but seeing as that's not happening, should I just get some certs and apply for every IT job I can find?

I don't want to waste any more time or money. Is there some kind of apprenticeship I could do that would catapult me into a position? 

**Edit**: [Here is my anonymized resume](http://i.imgur.com/4eJupZu.png). Given this information you could probably find me, but I'm going to request that you don't. I've already posted this on r/resumes, and this is the improved version of my previous resume. The blacked out parts are locations and company names, as well as my name, phone number, and email. Under projects: 

The first is a database/admin setup for a social networking application I re-created with RoR under contract, as it was originally made without any framework whatsoever because the team who originally made it ""didn't believe in them"" and it didn't scale properly with thousands of users. My improved version scaled much more efficiently. I didn't include this information because the company was sold less than two weeks after I finished it and my project was scrapped after being online for less than a week. 

The second is a crappy map made with Google Maps, CSS, and MS Paint, as was requested by the professor I made it for. Is no longer up and I'm working on a new version now with ArcGIS and RoR. 

The third is the same project I've listed under Experience. 

The fourth is a computer game I made with some friends before I really knew what I was doing and my involvement in the project boils down to ""screwing around with C# and debugging other peoples' code having never programmed in my life"", but the finished game is really cool looking, mostly due to the fact that we had a senior animator and a game developer/project manager who was really dedicated to it.

I just found out about this subreddit after cowering the internet with no type of guidance whatsoever to begin with. I am currently in my 3rd year of college and had recently made the decision to pursue a BA in Psychology, taking classes specifically related to Industrial/Organizational Psych. To help you all understand the scenario better, majority of the funding isn't in the relevant studies generally associated with HR work so majoring in something like HR isn't possible. Along these lines there aren't that many courses specifically designed for such a field either. I cannot change my major or transfer since I have financial aid for 4 years only so I am locked into this major.

The first thing that I need guidance in is if being a Psych major would hinder or even nullify my chances of finding work in a Human Resource department and being able to complete my tasks. As of now, if I knew I wanted to pursue HR, I would've transferred to the appropriate college but it's too late for that.

The second thing I really need to know is where I should start or where should my eyes be looking in this year of college in terms of having the best shot at having the best possible resume I can make for myself. What I do know is that work experience is key and getting relevant internships is a vital step in landing an entry level position and working your way up. 

The last thing I can think of right now since its really early is if graduate school necessary to have a stable job that pays decently. My concern for this mainly roots from how expensive graduate school is for me and my family currently.

If you read all this, I am seriously thankful and would really be grateful if you guys can provide any type of insight. It is likely that I may have left out things that some might need to help properly so if that's the case, feel free to ask. "

I got a job through a family connection at a large (multi billion $ revenue) business software company and am doing a lot of impressive work there - I wrote a couple of papers to be presented at a user conference later in 2016, and wrote stuff on my own for internal company use. (Edit:) I've also started a company in my hometown implementing language generation solutions for a variety of groups and it's been doing pretty well I think - I have clients with national name recognition.

I'm a rising junior in high school in a large (top 10 nationwide) city with a good tech scene at a very competitive private school. I know that I can contribute elsewhere - as I am now at my current job, but I'm trying to get around my young age. I've taken the data structures courses and feel like I have a good resume (attached below on imgur).

Some options I've thought of are working at a local (very competitive) university in their CS department as a research intern, or reaching out to one of the small tech startups or government agencies around town.

I just feel that my age is going to overshadow my substantial work - thoughts?

3drn9o,7,2015-07-18,Networking in the startup scene as a junior dev,lingual_panda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3drn9o/networking_in_the_startup_scene_as_a_junior_dev/,"I went to a startup hiring event yesterday and I realized I like the vibes I was getting. I'm looking for advice on how to approach networking so I can land a position in the next few months to help me reach some of my goals.

About me: (I don't usually brag this much...)

- I have my B.A. and I'm working on my B.S. in computer science (online classes)
- I'm tired of taking out loans and living with my parents. I want to work.
    - I can probably balance 30-40hrs/week while taking one or two classes online each quarter
    - Two classes a quarter means I graduate December 2016
- If I had the opportunity to plan ahead a bit, I'd happily move close to work
- Before studying CS I worked as a bartender and as a teacher. I'm noticing that I'm a bit better at networking than a lot of my peers. Assume I'm fairly nice, funny, and that I make friends easily
- On my second internship. I've worked with Ruby, Python, Java, several interesting libraries. I've gotten very positive feedback from my coworkers and devs overseeing my work. I have several references I'd be happy to provide to someone in a hiring role
- I've been tinkering with Rails projects in my spare time and one of my friends wants to build an app together as a proof-of-concept. So I have projects I can talk about outside of my internship projects (which are pretty cool themselves)

Goals include:

- Landing a paying junior/intern dev role in Los Angeles starting in September
- Staying in the position at least 6 months so I can actually learn and contribute to a project
- Working on a team of mid-senior devs I can learn from
- Avoiding corporate vibes and red tape. People don't want to hire me full time because I don't have my B.S. It's super frustrating
- I don't need medical or retirement plans or equity or any other benefits. I'd be happy to have a discussion with whoever's hiring me to make sure I'm being compensated fairly and legally. I'm not trying to get rich, I'm trying to develop my skills and actually contribute on an exciting project while I'm in school.

Luckily I have a bit more autonomy now that I have a car that starts when you turn the key. I'll definitely be hitting up networking events in Santa Monica, etc. But when I'm there, **how should I pitch myself to founders and CTOs?**

I get that I need to meet and make friends with more CTOs/founders to see if they'll take the risk with me. **How do I build my network without seeming pushy?**

Finally, after yesterday I realized it might be beneficial to order a handful of business cards, maybe some normal ones and some with a mini-resume on the back. This is in case I stop by an event after work and meet somebody awesome and I want to give them a way to remember me. Is this dumb? I won't be carrying my resume around everywhere so this seems like a good alternative. I wouldn't hand them out willy-nilly (wow I've never used that expression before in my life)."
3drnlu,2,2015-07-18,Having a bit of a near-grad crisis. How do some people develop so much in such a short time period?,csthrowaway11011,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3drnlu/having_a_bit_of_a_neargrad_crisis_how_do_some/,"*After writing it all out, it turned into a bit of a panicked rant, so here's a fair warning that it's a long one. I added a TLDR at the bottom, if it helps*

I am close to graduating, and on paper, I think I have a very attractive CV. I have a 97% average at a University ranked in the top 25 in the world for both CS and Math (I'm majoring in CS but minoring in Math), where averages are consistently maintained at 67-73%, and yes, we always have recruiters from the big tech companies at our school. I have an 8 month Internship at a maturing tech startup where I wrote production level code (Java) in both enterprise software and some open-source work that I can share with recruiters. I have several projects that I've worked on in my own time (I have two significant apps, one in vanilla JS, and one using the MEAN stack) because I truly love to build things. 

I'm not saying this to gloat at all (this is an anonymous account, after all), but I'm saying it because it adds to my actual crisis. I am terrible at joining other projects midway through development. My internship is the closest thing I have had to that experience, and it took months before I finally became marginally comfortable committing code. Even then, it was more like I was getting comfortable with the idea of discomfort and uncertainty in a large project and I was still making only one commit every 3-5 days (aside from a one line correction here and there). 

Yet somehow, there are developers out there that just get it. You look at their commit history, and it's like they lace their coffees with cocaine and pump out 10 significant commits a day. I'm talking about the TJ Holowaychuks that are in every office and every classroom and every open source project. What is it that these developers know that makes them able to join a project and start committing substantial amounts of clean code? And why after all this hard work and validation do I still feel like I'm not even in the same league as those people? How do I be one of them?

My point is that if I try very very hard. I've worked my butt off to create this resume (and it helps that I really have a passion for this work), but I am still at a point where joining a project in progress overwhelms me. I am pretty comfortable with Java development, so I recently joined the OpenMRS community (an open source medical records database for developing countries) and I don't have a clue where to begin. And they even have a very welcoming and supportive community with tutorial videos and everything. They use Spring MVC, Groovy, JSP, and I've never touched those frameworks. Do other coders actually pick frameworks up easily? When I wrote my MEAN application, it was because I read through two books (one on Node and the other specifically on the MEAN stack) over the course of two months *after* knowing Javascript itself fairly well. 

Are these feelings natural? I feel like I'll sneak into a decent company with my resume and then completely underwhelm them when I can't keep up with their project development. Also, for the record, I have read and done my best to internalize many of the recommended books on coding: Pragmatic Programmer, Effective Java, Code Complete, Design patterns, etc. but none of them really help with understanding and becoming fluent with and contributing to a new and large application.

**TL;DR** I work very hard, yet still feel utterly inadequate when I attempt to contribute to large projects. Is this feeling normal. How do I get better?"
3drpu2,0,2015-07-18,[RANT] Microsoft HQ interns from TOP CS schools,FUCK_TOP_CS_SCHOOL,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3drpu2/rant_microsoft_hq_interns_from_top_cs_schools/,"Before I go on my rant, I would like to talk a little bit of myself. I'm a 19 year old CS student from a **non-top** university for CS. My school is not ranked anywhere (in terms of CS at least). Through extremely hard work and dedication, I managed to snag a Software Development Internship at Microsoft. With about 3 huge projects, 1 which is doing really well in the App Store, 1 of which is a website which made it to the front page of a VERY popular subreddit today, and 1 team/based project which is decent. All that along with finishing high in my school coding competitions.

Anyways, the reason I needed to brag about all of this is actually relevant to my rant. Right now, at Microsoft, there are a lot of people who don't know how to code at all (or are not at my skill level). These people should not be here. For fucks sake, I'm getting questions on how to do things that you can easily google and figure out from the first link of stackoverflow. Of course I will answer them, but I really wanted to know where all these people are coming from. I asked a ton of people and they all were from top, top schools. There has only been a few (less than 5) alumnus in the past 5 years who have snagged a FT job at Microsoft. These people cannot code, and I have no idea how they even got in. I mean, the interviews were hard as fuck. IMO, they are very, very intelligent people. They know so much damn stuff, and have really good common sense, and all, but when it comes to real life coding, you aren't good. You only know some data structures and algos to pass the interview. It just really pisses me off that I worked so damn hard to get this job, going to shitty school while others have the fast/easy pass into a good job without even knowing how to code. A lot of people ask me where I'm from, and I fucking hate answering the Uni I come from because I have schoolophobia.

Anyways, **TL;DR**, Top CS schools get you in Top companies, but you won't know how to code. (unless of course, you work hard)

Also, I just want to mention that my internship so far has been exceptional. The people are really nice, young environment, and FFS THERE'S INDIAN FOOD! The prices are actually pretty high for what I'm used to but that's ok. And Also, is that elephant supposed to be representative of India or something? I don't really follow stuff like this so if someone can clarify, that would be cool! Later in the evenings when a lot of people are gone, I like to chill in commons, maybe make some friends or something. One day I saw people playing cards and they looked like my age. All from UW/UofT (surprise surprise), I talked to them and we got along pretty good. Also, is it normal for interns to come home like at 8PM? A lot of youngsters are always just chilling past 6PM."

Well, ok, let's see. I turn the computer on. All good. Windows 8 boots up. When I take the mouse to go to the wifi icon and try to connect to my network... it was on airplane mode. A few clicks and everything's done. Drivers were there.

The team is composed of about ~18 very intelligent and approachable coworkers, the team chemistry couldn't be better.

The money will be a huge help for paying down school costs, so I'm pretty excited to being going into my Junior year with this. My only fear is that I have no idea how to make sure that I'm still a quality contributor to the team when I'm working remotely and part time at that. As an intern, I've been no stranger to asking questions when appropriate, and my team was always there to help me. We use slack (a chat tool) so I'll still be able to ask these questions during the day using that, but I'm curious to know how lack of face time will change my relationship with my coworkers.  

I'm helped by the fact that a lot of what I did over the summer was develop a new system that will need some support in the coming months, and I'm probably the best suited employee to provide that. Its a full-stack development gig. How do I make sure I'm pulling my own weight? And should I make sure my working hours coincide with the working hours of my team?

3dtbfe,1,2015-07-19,How difficult is it to get a hadoop-related job after graduation?,makeswell2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3dtbfe/how_difficult_is_it_to_get_a_hadooprelated_job/,"I'm studying computer science at the University of South Florida. I have a low overall GPA, 2.8, due to some classes I failed long ago, and a decent departmental GPA, 3.4. I have also been helping a professor in my department recently with some MySQL and PHP stuff, hopefully to be published soon with my name on it, and hopefully he will let me help him build a cluster on a supercomputer with an NIH grant he got. My understanding is that the cluster-building project will involve hadoop. In addition to this project I hope to take several electives in subjects an aspiring data scientist would need.

My understanding is that there is a large demand for people competent in these 'big data' technologies. Searching for hadoop on indeed.com I do indeed see lots of job posts, but the posts do not say what school they require, and they all seem to require years of experience or an advanced degree (though there are so many job ads it is difficult for me to generalize about them in a more than anecdotal way). A related issue is trying to find an internship... Though I'd prefer an internship using a hadoop-like technology, I assume I need to take whatever kind of internship I can get in the broader software development field. Is that pretty much accurate? 

I wonder if I'm going to also need to take a job in software development, or if there will be companies that want me to play a data scientist role. If the former is the case then perhaps I'd be better off over the next year and a half before I graduate taking courses to develop my skills in software development, or in a related field like app development. Thanks for any ideas.

edit: Should also mention that by the end of my undergraduate I will have taken Hadoop and Big Data, Scientific Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics with R, and Python, and helped my professor build a cluster on a supercomputer. I will also have the option to get a Master's and write a thesis on the work helping the professor build the supercomputer cluster."

Would it be wise to go with React Native as it will strengthen also my web development skills?

I was accepted to medical school last year but decided I want to program instead.

I took AP Comp Sci five years ago. I’ve been teaching myself HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript for a few months at home, but I believe I would be more motivated if I were working on a real product or in a real company setting. I’m currently taking a freshman level C++ class at a CUNY school, but I already know the material.

Having studied only biology and history in college, I know I have a LOT of catching up to do, but I learn quickly and will work my butt off. I’m willing to work 20-30 hours/week unpaid. As long as I’m coding and learning, I’ll be happy. I can bring my own laptop to your company/office. 

I can send you my resume and would be happy to meet for a cup of coffee.

3dvqcd,19,2015-07-19,A post for undergrad students - A conversation on tips and observations based on my experience.,ccxxcc,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3dvqcd/a_post_for_undergrad_students_a_conversation_on/,"I'm writing this post to share some of my thoughts on the undergraduate engineering experience that I hope might be helpful to other students out there. 

I was just an average student, and these are simply some of my opinions and ideas that may or may not apply to everyone’s current situation. Quick background is that I recently graduated from the MechE program at a University of California school and have accepted a very well paying job offer from a large consumer tech company.

This is going to be a list of a few things that I not only found to be helpful, but found that people around me were not necessarily taking advantage of. I don’t want to sound overly instructive with this. I really would like to have an open conversation about everything I’m putting down here.

So, here we go:


**1) GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE**

This is in all caps for a reason.
I watched *many* MechE and other students graduating with frankly little to no real, hands-on engineering experience. My school was known for not providing much in the way of lab courses that covered practical aspects of engineering.
Curriculum was focused more heavily on theory, and until senior year, labs were primarily on physics and data collection. This seems like a common issue in that these types of universities are looking to prepare students for getting into grad school, rather than a career in the industry. Nothing is intrinsically wrong with either approach, but my point here is that you have to make some personal efforts to augment your classes if you are not getting enough hands-on engineering experience, otherwise you will be graduating with a resume that only lists your class projects and the odd jobs you worked to get by. Sorry, but your ""A"" in Solid Mechanics I can't really be put under the ""Skills” heading unless you had an exceptional project-based class situation.
This phenomenon ended up directly affecting several people I knew, who got stuck with some very inexperienced students on their senior design projects, and had to shoulder the hands-on work as a result. 
In one memorable example, we could not help but make fun of the girl on my buddy's team who asked quite sincerely ""if solder was conductive"" as the were wiring up their senior project.

*How to fix this:*

Join a club that builds things. Participate in undergraduate research through professor sponsored projects or school organizations. Use university resources to help you find an internship. Whatever you do, once you’re involved I would recommend that you focus on the thing you have chosen just as much if not more than your classes. I really believe that there are a million students graduating with great GPAs and minimal understanding of engineering design, the industry, hands-on machining processes, etc. That being said, I understand that everyone goes to school for different reasons, and not everyone has the goal of jumping into the industry immediately, but if that is your goal, understand what it takes to stand out, and takes steps in that direction!

*On internships specifically:*

I got my first internship after my sophomore year. Yes there are plenty of companies looking to hire 2nd years.
The following year I began interning for the company I now work at full time. I interned there for two years; full time during the summers and around 20hrs/week during school. This allowed me to be financially independent during this time (with loans and parental support covering tuition). Another great thing about this is that in many cases you can count internship toward years of professional experience when applying for jobs after graduating. This means you could describe yourself as an engineering professional with 2-3 years of experience if you interned consistently in a particular industry.

Also, when you’re applying for internships specifically it is important to understand that from the hiring company’s point of view you are competing against a pool of other students with VERY similar levels of experience. That is, everyone in their 2nd or 3rd year of your major has taken more or less the same classes. Since you're going to be there for a limited time anyway, they know that much of this time will be spent learning, rather than putting in large amounts of work for the company. So in the cases that I’ve seen, what makes a candidate stand out to them is honestly more about your attitude and how you work with others than anything else. They want someone who is teachable and adaptable, and someone who shows a genuine interest in their industry.


**2) Take your time**

You might be thinking, ""I am already so stressed and buried in my coursework, how can I volunteer or get internship experience?""
My advice would be to slow down a bit. Drop a class. Don't take summer classes. Graduate in 5 years if you have to.
What will end up on your resume are all your awesome accomplishments from working with clubs/teams/companies, but what WON'T go on your resume is how long it took to graduate. I never took summer classes, and took two extra quarters instead, bringing me partially into a fifth year of school. Over those summers and my two final quarters I was able to work in the industry and develop great professional relationships that ended up getting me into a full time job.


**3) Choose sanity and be effective**

We can all agree that engineering school is hard. Don’t let it consume you on a personal level.
I think there is a mentality that time spent during college is time spent ""paying your dues"", and as a result it is OK that you are constantly stressed out, and not doing the things you want with you personal life. I don't believe that this is a healthy mentality. Never live like you are ""just working for the weekend"", especially when that weekend is your graduation, 4 years away. This goes hand-in-hand with taking your time. There was a point sometime during my 2nd year that I decided I was simply not going to graduation with a 4.0, or even close to it. This was not at all because I didn’t feel like I could do work at that level, but it was a conscious choice that came as a result of understanding of the amount of stress and time commitment required to produce “A” work vs. “B” work. I chose at that point to make more time for my hobbies, my personal relationships, and my physical fitness. I sincerely felt that I was a happier person throughout college as a result. For a large part of the school year I would make sure to  take at least one entire day off with absolutely no homework or study (usually Saturday). Of course this may not be possible when approaching tests and big projects, but if you can pull it off I would recommend it highly.  In a bigger picture context, if you think it's possible to put off having a balanced life until after school, it may be a rude awakening when greater challenges lie ahead. I’m sure a lot of you don’t need to be reminded of this stuff, but at the same time it’s easy to forget in the midst of stress.


**4) The little things**

Don't get suckered in to paying full price for a bunch of textbooks. There are a million resources out there, the best of which might be your school's library. For many of my classes, the library had multiple copies of last year's edition of the textbook, which worked just fine and were free to check out for the entire quarter. For the rest, there are a lot of PDFs and free shit you can find online. For the rest of the rest, there are sites like bigwords.com which provide comparison shopping, often for extremely cheap international editions of books which contain the same content.

Don't get suckered in to bad study groups. Sure, having nightly study sessions with 12 of your friends can lead to fun times, but when you've spend 4 hours around the table, everyone is playing YouTube videos and eating, the homework is due in an hour, and nobody knows what to do, it was probably a waste of your time. Go put some headphones on and work alone, get it done early, and have more time to socialize stress-free afterwards.

On the same token, surround yourself with great people. Find at least a few people who you can count on to have the same goals as you. Hold on to these relationships, because you will all be going separate ways after graduation, but the power of networking is very strong.. I have seen several people I know start successful companies that got several of their friends involved, as well as provide recommendations at larger companies that proved effective at getting people jobs.


Anyway, *please* feel free to add any of your tips and comments to this. Or critique it to hell if you think I’m full of shit. I honestly just wanted to get this out there for the sake of helping people out if only a little bit.

I'd rather rant and get some advice anonymously for this.


I'm doing my second summer internship in the aero industry for a company as an intended mechanical/aero engineering major. I initially did an internship on the mechanical engineering side of things which does a lot of analysis and component design, and was asked if I wanted to return and even consider trying a different department to see another area of the company. I had a lot of fun the first summer, so I naturally accepted this and was excited to start summer #2.




My internship this summer focuses on taking designs from the mechanical engineers and figuring out how to manufacture and test these designs. In my mind I expected this could involve some machining and R&amp;D testing which is really cool. However, I've now (5 weeks in), realized this isn't the case.




Whereas I was working with mechanical engineers my first summer, every single person I'm working with this summer is an industrial designer. I'm not ripping on industrial designers, but aeronautical engineering vs industrial design are two completely separate things. I'm not doing anything engineering related. I'm modeling in SolidWorks, things which require nothing beyond basic understanding of fasteners. Hell I haven't had to even determine hole spacing because everything is non-structural or so light that it doesn't even matter. I don't get to do any manufacturing myself because there are guys explicitly paid to do it. I know this is usually the norm, but I felt misled when they asked in the interview ""are you comfortable machining your own parts?"". I haven't even gotten to do basic statics. No free body diagrams, no material analysis, no FEA. Nothing. Solidworks and cleaning stuff in the shop. It's not like this is just intern work either, I've watched the full-timers and they do the same thing as me, but with more salt. Outside of a couple solidworks tricks and how to do things specific to this company (paperwork etc), I've learned nothing of use for my engineering degree.


To make things worse, in the small group I'm in there's two employees I work with on a daily basis. One guy and one girl. The guy is really laid back, does great work and is really happy to show me the ropes, help me find things in the shop, and decide what fasteners to order... that sort of thing. The girl on the other hand. I'm not sure why, but she seems to go out of her way to rip on me every chance she gets. The moment I get visibly upset as a result (I seriously almost cried at work a few days ago, it was pathetic), she turns around ""hey no negativity we all make mistakes blah blah"". Some examples were me getting assigned to get patterns cut out on a router in different sizes which we would use to down select to the best fit. So, I do whatever solidworks magic, but have to switch to Rhino to fix a surface. I  barely know any rhino, but knew how to do this specific thing. So I pull it back into SW, finish the patterns, she looks over it, says ""looks good, send it off"", and when I get them back, they're all too small. ""Well I don't know why you had to have such a hard time with this it was a very simple task"" (this is where I started to get upset, as referenced earlier). When I finish the new part, I told her I was going to run out and compare SW's measurement to the old pattern to make sure and she literally told me ""this was supposed to be a very simple task and you're making it hard, you don't have time to go do that."" What??? That's just one example of the shit I have to go through for the rest of the summer. This isn't something to talk to a manager about when it's 20 year old intern vs employee recruited from Europe... Outside of this, my manager has told me that I've been doing great work and he is impressed so far. But, I'm burning myself out over this.


So, with all that bitching out of the way, let me explain what I'm trying to get at here. I'm almost at the end of a long road. The university I go to has competitive upper division admissions, and within the next 1-2 weeks I will find out what major I am accepted to (it could be multiple, and I get to then choose, or it could be none, who knows). So, for the last two years it has been non-stop stress and worry trying to get into my major. Now that I've done all I can, I'm finally sitting back and thinking about the direction I want to go with my major, whatever it may end up being. I'm sick of being a SolidWorks monkey, and I want to get off my butt and do things at work, *engineering* things. I love aviation, but I also love helping people, so I may even consider a switch to civil engineering if it means getting away from the CAD-slave 40 hrs a week work-life. That being said, I know that of all the summers to have an internship, junior year is arguably the most important for its potential to lead to full hiring and over-all making it easier to get a job after senior year. I'm realizing that after two years of non-stop studying and internships, I've forgotten to have fun. I haven't taken many ""fun"" classes, and never got a chance to study abroad. My senior year (I'm going into my junior year now) will have a ton of open space for electives, and I'm considering taking a year of japanese for no reason other than I think it would be *fun and cool*. Even 1 year down the line, it feels empowering to plan that out. So I came to the idea, ""if interning sucks this much, why do it for another summer?"" Why not spend a summer studying in Japan or Europe? The aero industry is a hard cookie to crack, and I don't want to see my wanderlust ruin my momentum. But who knows.


**TL;DR** internship blows hard, and I'm dreading the thought of going tomorrow, let alone getting another internship next summer.


My questions to you, reddit friends: 

* How to put on my happy face and keep going for 6 more weeks at a shit-internship?

* Am I putting myself at a disadvantage for getting a job by having 2 internships but doing something for my own sake (not engineering related), during my third summer?


Thanks ♥"

There are a number of compliance requirements that need to be completed by the end of the year, or it will likely be removed from production (and I really doubt they will be able to find someone else to take over this work). It's an internal tool, and we just branched out to a new internal customer. They are really excited to work with us, and have been actually pulling strings to get us resources to work with them (even though the company is downsizing). They are funding us to hire an intern who also will be started shortly after I plan to leave, whose job would be entirely to work with me. By quitting, I am actively screwing over the internal customer, the intern, and ultimately our old customers when the project gets killed at the end of the year.

I want to believe that all these things are technically my manager's problem, since I have at will employment and can leave any time. I've also been pushing to get the compliance stuff done for nearly a year now, but it keeps getting scheduled later. I still feel guilty about leaving though. Should I?"

3dx1nk,8,2015-07-20,Something is rotten.,confusedeerintern,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dx1nk/something_is_rotten/,"Hi. I don't know where else to look for help. I've seen some of you come up with some great explanations for the unexplainable. Maybe one of you has encountered something like this before.

A little bit of background about me; I'm currently working as an unpaid intern on a deer farming ranch. The hours are long, the pay is, well, non existent, I’m on a ramen diet all day every day because it’s all I can afford, and the ""intern quarters"" are really just a glorified closet with a bed in it. Anyway.

I woke up this morning to my alarm at 5am with a hangover, and dragged myself out of my sad excuse for a bed; time to feed the deer. I rarely interact with anyone else unless I've seriously screwed something up, so my days are lonely, except for the baby fawns, and peaceful. My morning passed, slowly, the only major complication for today being the fact that one of the nearby buildings had a leaky pipe somewhere and now the straw shed is full of some seriously gross mold. It was thick and grayish green and kind of nauseating, and as the only intern on staff, I had to pick through the bales bit by bit, because we're winterizing the enclosures, which means adding straw in the lean-tos for the deer to bed down in. Moldy straw = sick deer, and that's something nobody wants to deal with. I cleaned it out myself, trying not to vomit, my hangover raging in full, angry force.

Other than that, everything seemed normal, until I went into our ""break room"" (which is a kitchen, sort of, in the fawn building, which is pretty much unused at this time of year), and smelled something odd. It was a familiar smell; the last time I caught a whiff of it, I found an enormous dead rat in the back of one of the cabinets. Oh, intern life. I let one of my favorite fawns out of his pen to hang out with me while I ate my lunch. He hadn't wilded up at all so far and still viewed me as his mother (I'm the giant hulking thing that brings milk to him, anyway). But today, he hung back, gleaming white sclera looming in the corners of his eyes. I let him out into the ""big boy"" pen with a sigh. They all have to grow up some time.

In the meanwhile I searched for the poor dead rat and couldn't find anything. Before long, my break was over and I put it out of my mind and went back to work.

Later that afternoon, towards the end of the day, I sat down in the break room to have a drink of water before I closed up, and I smelled it again, only this time, it was stronger. I thought maybe it was coming from my boots (wearing muck boots nearly 24/7 does that sometimes...), and kicked them off and took a whiff. Really unpleasant, but not unusual, and not the source of that rotting smell. I asked my boss who came in a few minutes later if he smelled anything over where I was sitting earlier. I hadn't seen him in a while, and he looked more haggard than usual (which is an accomplishment for him, honestly). He grunted and waved a noncommittal wave before leaving.

I got off in the evening, after dark, got back to the intern quarters which currently housed only me, fed the old as dirt, shy dog that lives around my building, and sat down to browse the web on the slow connection, and I smelled it, again. At first, I just thought maybe the smell had snuck its way into my nose and stuck there, so I stripped my filthy clothes and jumped in the shower. The smell disappeared, which relieved me, but my hair began falling out in thick, heavy clumps as I shampooed it. Slightly less relieving.
I got out, lit some candles, and came on here. My stomach is cramping now, bad, but whether that’s from smelling that awful smell all day, or my hangover, or something else, I don’t know. I think I’m running a fever; my face is flushed and my head feels hot, but I don’t have a thermometer.

Something is happening and I am worried."

* Country of purchase: I'm a student (Process Operator) with a budget around 1K and I am looking for a laptop 

I am looking for a portable laptop I can use to type out assignments for my internship while allowing me to play some hearthstone and browse the web during breaktime. 
I have a key for Windows 8.1 lying around but I doubt that a lot of laptops come without a preinstalled OS. 

Gaming requirements: Hearthstone, maybe some indie games. I do not plan to game extensively on this laptop, it's for work and travel. 

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I am leaning towards the Asus ZenBookUX305 series for it's weight, quietness. 
It's just  really depressing to have to pay 999 euro for a laptop that goes for under 700 dollars in the US so I was hoping you could help.

Also the [HP Spectre 13 x360](http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/436748/hp-spectre-13-4031nd-x360/specificaties/) sounds like it's in my pricerange, it definitely has the performance and size I am looking for but I think it might be too loud. 

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Long battery life and low weight are musts, I need to carry this thing around a lot at work and sometimes we work very long days. 
Performance can be lowered. It doesn't need to run The Witcher 3 but I'd like to be able to run maybe Hearthstone and Chrome with several tabs open.  

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:
I'd like it to make little sound.

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

8 gigs of RAM is a must

* High resolution screen:
Would be nice so I can watch some videos/movies.
* A great keyboard:
I usually type on a mechanical keyboard so going back to rubber dome is going to be a bad experience anyway.
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: It has to not be finnicky
* Great audio: I'll probably be using headphones so speakers will rarely be used.


**List any features that are critical:**

8 gigs of ram, portable, I have an external harddrive (WD My Passport Ultra) so having a single SSD in the laptop would be great for sound mitigation and weight reasons. 

Thanks for helping out, I appreciate it."
3dxgdd,2,2015-07-20,Fifteen-year veteran and I can't seem to make the regular world work,WestAve001,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3dxgdd/fifteenyear_veteran_and_i_cant_seem_to_make_the/,"I’m stuck. Professionally jammed. I have had several dreams and ambitions, and not only have none of them been realized, I don’t even think I have even progressed the slightest bit toward them. This is long, so tl;dr follows.

I am 15-year military, 10 of those as part-time Air National Guard. I completed college with a finance degree from a large but unremarkable state university. My GPA was 3.19. It would have been higher, but I incorrectly figured that my military experience would make up the difference to a 4.0 and get me all kinds of job offers. This turned into a deflating year-long job search after I graduated, that finally led to my current job, which is pretty terrible.

I currently have a retail financial services sales job. It is 100% commission and I haven’t made any real money in months, despite having some amazing cases and setting up new markets (everything has fallen through, crawled along at an untenable pace, or just vanished). I am extremely personable, and I get along great with people, but I am NOT good with sales. I hate the thought of going into a conversation and trying to get an outcome from it — I am just friendly and deeply caring. I dislike cold-calling so badly that I have physical anxiety attacks when I am about to do it, and my natural market is pretty much worthless. My boss is six years younger than me, a sales powerhouse, and is literally one of the top performers in the entire company. He made nearly $400k last year and the year before. I began sending resumes out to contacts and job postings a month ago, but have received zero responses. It's a good resume too. My girlfriend really helped me out with it, and she's fantastic at things like that (more on that shortly).

I have probably $7000 of negative net worth, no car of my own (I am driving my mom’s car after losing my beloved 1998 240SX to a collision), and my shared card with my girlfriend is almost maxed out. The one case I have in my pipeline at work will take care of the debt and that’s about it. The card is, at this point, the only source of money that I have. I have about $300 in checking. The only thing that’s keeping me from sinking below the surface faster are my National Guard weekends which net me about $300/month. My mom has given me a credit card that I can buy gas with as well, but that’s approaching its limit. She has a small pension, and my dad’s retirement is pretty bleak, but they’re my only other source of money. I am slowly draining their retirement and I’m not happy about it.

My girlfriend is an absolute professional success. She is 22 (10 years younger than me), has an amazing job, and has done seemingly everything right since she was maybe 8 years old. She comes from a fairly broken family, dislikes her parents, and figured it out on her own. Now when she applies for a position, she usually gets a call the very same day. She literally feels anxiety because she’s not sure she will get enough pay or title out of her next position, exactly the opposite problem that I have. She went to the same school I did, but got a 3.92, and filled in all the experience and internship blanks perfectly (I went to internship interviews with bulge-bracket investment banks in college and got nothing). She offers advice freely, but it is very tough-love, and I usually dislike myself more by the end of it. She has recommended seeing a therapist, which I’m going to explore through the VA tomorrow as I cannot afford one on my own whatsoever.

Tonight we had dinner with a very nice young couple she met through her office. They both went to amazing colleges, prep schools, and now have fantastic jobs here and plenty of money (fantastic engagement ring, german cars etc.). I have never seen so directly what could have been had I just done things a little better, or had things just worked out a little differently. It was equally inspiring and depressing.

What is it about me that is keeping things from working?? Why do I seem to be so unlucky? My girlfriend thinks that there is just something about me that people see that makes them not want to work with or hire me, and it comes through everything I do. I *desperately* want to change this. I am an extremely good-hearted, compassionate, caring, and intelligent person with proven leadership ability, but I feel absolutely worthless and powerless to change my professional luck and success. All I can think of now is that there is some systematic mental discrepancy that I have that my girlfriend and other successful people don’t have. If it doesn’t change, I’ll lose her and myself and who knows what else. I am not suicidal, but I am certain this helpless feeling I have is how it starts. I so want things to work out and work out well, but it’s like no matter what I do I’m just punching a brick wall.

Please help.

*tl;dr I am a 15-year military veteran, professionally unlucky, in debt, and nothing I do to reverse it works, in spite of there being some very successful people close to me. Fairly sure I have some type of mental disorder or defect, so seeing a counselor tomorrow. What is it about me that’s broken?*

My school requires the internship to be IT related, so I went to their web department.

&amp;nbsp;

 After I got my ID card and was introduced to everyone my supervisor looked for a pc for me to use and told me to set it up in an empty room in the office. 

Once I had my login credentials, I logged in and changed my password as prompted. After lunch, when I tried to log in again with my new password, I was met with the invalid credentials screen. Try again, no luck. Check username, check caps, try again, locked out. Thus I call the helpdesk and ask them to unlock my account. 

&amp;nbsp;


But the issue still persists, my password doesn't work. I go tell my supervisor and after I convince him that I'm sure this is the password I chose I try to log in on his workstation and it magically works. So the two of us head to my workstation and I try to login with the same password again, doesn't work. He tries to login - no issues. We do this for a while, heading back and forth between our workstations trying to log in here and there. At some point we thought it might be the keyboard so we tried using another one, still doesn't work. My supervisor grabs his own keyboard which I used to log in on his workstation. Still does not work on mine tho. 

&amp;nbsp;

When he tries to log in on my workstation again he accidentially enabled caps while entering his username. Usernames are something like ""XX000000"", where XX are letters and 000000 are numbers. When he enters the numbers I notice that a 6 turned into a ^ and a 3 turned into a # - on the qwertz layout we use in germany, the 6 is supposed to turn into &amp; and the 3 a §. I hit alt+shift and try to log in again and it works like a charm.

&amp;nbsp;

As you might have guessed, my password contained a y which turned into a z. The computer changed the layout back to the qwerty one every time you restarted it. My supervisor and me both laughed about not thinking of it and got back to work.

Last year as a sophomore I interviewed with Google and Microsoft but got rejected from both for the internship (I interviewed for the SWE internship with Google, but did not get an interview for the engineering practicum). I had not done any sort of coding interviews or problems outside of classroom before I did those interviews so I know I didn't do well. 

This year as a junior, I will again be searching for internships. I am wondering if it is even worth it to reapply and put in all the significant effort required to successfully pass these interviews if I won't even get an interview in the first place. In other words, would the fact that I applied previously but did not do well hinder my application the second time around? I have tried finding an answer to this online but I have find little-to-no stories about people who have been rejected from Google or Microsoft getting an offer on the second time around unless they did extremely well the first time around but just weren't a fit. 

I understand that some of the answers will say that it is beneficial to put in the effort just because it will make a better programmer overall, but unfortunately I can't be satisfied with just this. If I put in a significant amount of effort in something, there needs to be a clear goal in sight, otherwise I will get highly demotivated.

Mondays are terrible. I hate them. Today is no different. But, instead of getting a swarm of tickets through the helpdesk like a usual Monday, instead we've a select few that are company wide issues. I don't know which is worse.

This is the first call I picked up this morning:

&gt;$FrontDesk: Hi, $Customer at $ShadyCo called in, can you take the request?

&gt;$migbits: Sure. *Uh, who?*

Here's the thing about working for a MSP: some of our clients call more than others, and the ones that do we are more familiar with. Once in a blue moon we'll get a call from a client that doesn't often rely on us, but even those we can recognize because they'll come up in conversation with someone else.

I have *never* heard of this company. But, not one to fear the unknown, I answer the call.

&gt;$migbits: Hi this is $migbits at $MSP, how may I help you today?

&gt;$Lady: Hi, I think our email is down.

I take it back. I fear the unknown.

&gt;$migbits: I understand. Do you mind if I put you on hold for a minute while I look something up?

&gt;$Lady: Sure.

As an intern, the MSP I work at is kind because they don't expect us to know everything (mostly because it would probably mess up their services). If we have no idea what the problem is, we're allowed to ask for help. So, I stand up and glance at my coworkers sitting next to me.

&gt;$migbits: Hey, $ShadyCo's email is down, I haven't done anything with servers before. What should I do?

Immediately, both of my coworkers (one a workaholic intern, the other a newly hired senior tech) on either side look up at me with open mouths and raised brows.

&gt;$Workaholic: ...Did you say $ShadyCo?

&gt;$migbits: Uh, yes, why -

&gt;$SeniorTech: $OnsiteGuy told us they filed for bankruptcy last week. They shouldn't be using our services anymore. *($OnsiteGuy is one of our techs who goes to help clients directly)*

&gt;$migbits: ...Wait, seriously!?

&gt;$SeniorTech: You sure it was $ShadyCo?

&gt;$migbits: Yeah, $Lady at $ShadyCo...

&gt;$SeniorTech: Okay, gimme the phone.

I silently hand him the receiver.

&gt;$SeniorTech: Hi, is this $Lady? Yes, hello, $migbits just passed this on to me. So we may have been misinformed, but I was told that you guys had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and that you had closed your doors?

$Lady tried spouting some nonsense about how they were *in the process* of closing, but they weren't actually closed yet. In the end, $SeniorTech had to go to our director as well as $OnsiteGuy to double check that she was telling the truth. She wasn't, but all the server needed was a bounce and it worked, so he fixed it and billed them for his time.

I guess it's going on their credit.

TLDR: I get terrible calls. I got one while typing this up."
3dzk24,0,2015-07-20,College senior looking for a little guidance,sir_dancealot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3dzk24/college_senior_looking_for_a_little_guidance/,"Background:
I'm an Industrial Engineering student at a top 20 US university. I always knew I wanted to do engineering, and IE caught my eye when I got to school - we have a top 10 IE program. I love team projects, process optimization, and the whole general engineering design/user-oriented design process. My experiences have only reinforced this. My school's IE program also emphasizes management skills, and service industry analytics, which I really like; I'm not planning on using an IE degree to optimize an automated assembly line or something. I want to work with people to some degree.
Experience:
Freshman year internship:
Random warehousing operations job at a cement company. Half of it was tracking parts records down in a poorly maintained SAP database, half of it was actually tracking down the physical parts in a warehouse. Re-organized and mapped the warehouse so everyone knew where things were. Super rewarding.
Sophomore year internship: where it gets a little hairy
Business Analyst role in the tech arm of a major insurance company. I was put on a big, multi-year project with lots of visibility to leadership/upper management. I learned a ton, just attending meetings and soaking up how an enormous company operates. Worked with business partners, contractors, tech people, legal dept, etc. Had my own aspects of the project ( a few business processes) to do research on, talk to people, and present and defend my recommendations. I believe I found the simplest, easiest, and cheapest solution, and I was proud of this work.
Here's where it got interesting though.
While I was talking to different people in the tech department, I was frustrated when I had no idea what they were talking about. I had a minor freakout that I was so interested in technology but I didn't have any idea what the guys in my own department were saying. Started looking very seriously into a major switch to Computer Science. Talked to a CS adviser and it became clear that in order to finish a CS major in my remaining two years, I would basically be locked in a room without friends doing homework all the time. Settled on a CS minor.
Entered junior year, with a standing offer to come back as a BA the next year. At this point I was a IE major and CS minor. Tried to do a hackathon with a couple CS friends and was in so over my head that it was really depressing. I had gotten into an upper-level CS (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) class because it supposedly didn't have an prereqs and I had gotten locked out of the lower classes. Insanely hard class - got my second C ever. Almost killed my interest in comp sci because the instruction was so poor. Next term I got into a lower level CS class but it was like boolean logic, basically a math class. Boring. As. Fuck. I wanted to code and build websites and shit. In the meantime I expressed to the insurance company that I had this burning CS interest that I wanted to explore. I had been going through coding interview prep books, but I knew that my resume (lacking the ""Computer Science Major"" line) wouldn't even get me to the interview stage pretty much anywhere. I knew the company liked me from before, so I told them I was applying for the Application Developer internship, and that I hoped that if I didn't crush the technical interview, they could push me through on good faith that I would work hard to get where I needed to be. They called me back and offered the position with no interview &amp; I accepted.
In the meantime of that meantime I dropped my CS minor. Through some more research and talking to people, I found out that my school's CS program is actually for shit, especially for such a high-ranked school. it's aimed toward academia and CS research rather than employable skills and doing cool shit with websites or anything like that.
So here I am at my summer internship as a Java dev for an insurance company website. There are so many damn pages to this website that it's overwhelming, but I guess that's to be expected from enterprise software. All the database requests and connections and configurations are super intimidating especially because there's no documentation. At the same time, I think it's pretty damn cool, and I really don't know if a normal CS student would be overwhelmed too - they also go from single-person class projects to enterprise-scale software when they get an internship, so I'm assuming they have a pretty big adjustment as well
My work has been super slow - 3 weeks to set up my local environment, and then I got a few basic project tasks, but I'm still trying to figure out Java, the IDE and its tools (logs, Unit testing, debugging). It's somewhat frustrating but I find the stuff super interesting - I don't particularly want to stop/leave work at the end of the day (although I do so I can beat traffic). I heard a coworker say on the phone that it can take 2 years for a developer to become autonomous here because of the complexity of systems and the applications. I'm also on a support team, which means we don't create the original product - another team does, then hands it to us and says ""here maintain, update, and debug this until kingdom come"" which makes it way less interesting to me than actually being part of building something new.
So here's where I'm at I love technology. Either way I want to work in the tech sector. I have a very good IE program that I've enjoyed and learned a lot from. Also, I think I'm really good at this stuff. I get a lot of enjoyment of brainstorming business ideas and processes, etc, and then tearing the bad ones apart. If I go work in operations for a tech company, I can still be part of an awesome industry and probably advance much faster and play to my strengths.
On the other hand, I have the chance to stick around here and keep being an app dev. Programming is so cool to me, but I know I'll never have the fundamentals and background that CS majors have. it'll take me a few years of hard work to even get up to speed, and then I'll just be another pretty good dev in the world of talented devs. I'm scared I could set my career back a few years and not have a whole lot to show for it on the other end. On the other end, programming is really fucking cool it me and I would love to do it for awhile before moving into product development management or whatever. I just don't know if I'll be good enough at a young enough age to get involved in the kind of cool tech sector shit I'm interested in.
TL;DR So... there it is. I could play to my strengths and formal education right out of school and still be involved in the tech sector, or I could follow this itch that won't go away to try my hand at software development and risk setting my career back for a chance at being in on some really cool shit."

This seems like the perfect opportunity to go to SF and get to know the startup scene. This would be from February '16 up until the end of May.

I've been contacting companies for a few months now, but the response has been minimal. My cover letter and resume has been reviewed by professionals. The administrative requirements are minimal. As a last resort, an unpaid internship could be an option because I really want to go to the US, but on the other hand I feel that I can be a great addition to a marketing team and an unpaid internship would cost too much (especially in SF). 
 
Has someone here done an internship at a startup? Do you have any tips and tricks? 

Or do you work for a startup that had some international interns? Any tips you can give me?

Thanks!"

Just a little background:

I'm 25 years old, about to finish up grad school and am in the process of searching for jobs. I've been employed throughout my college career, but have never been on a full-fledged job hunt like I am now.

Currently, I have what you might consider a 'dream' internship with a big oil and gas company. I'd like to stay on full time, but I know that that is far from guaranteed, especially with oil prices as low as they are. So obviously I've been looking for other positions and have had decent luck so far.

I interviewed with a staffing agency and was told that on paper, I'm a top candidate for this opening. I'm interviewing with the actual company (an investment bank) this Thursday. Here is where I am seeking some help.

My internship isn't over until the end of August, meaning I won't know about a full-time offer from that company until mid August (hopefully).

I doubt I'll be offered a full-time position after my Thursday interview. *If* however I get offered a job soon after my Thursday interview, what is the best way to go about telling the bank that I'm unable to accept/decline their offer without first hearing if I'll get an offer from the company I'm currently interning at? ie, I want to be able to hold both offer letter in my hands and choose which one is more lucrative without offending anyone and I want to do so in a timely manner. Part of the issue is timing. If I receive a full-time offer from the bank, I would think they'd want an offer in about a week or so, likely before I know even *if* I get an offer from my current company. 

I hope I was clear about everything, any advice is greatly appreciated."

What to do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3e0cj6/low_amount_of_university_work_for_the_next_9/,"I've just recently changed my education from IT to CS but since I have already completed some of the first year CS courses during my time with IT, I will most likely only be attending one third of the curriculum for the first 9 months. I'm not sure what to do during this time. These are the options I have considered:

Part time job: There are quite a few CS-related part time jobs in my area. They are just 20 hours per week jobs and consist mostly of remote work so I'm not sure how much I would actually learn from them. The money wouldn't hurt though and I get some experience working with production code.

Self-study: I'm doing this all the time already and I learn a lot from it, but it might get a little dull if that's all I'm going to be doing for the next 9 months, since I spend most of the time writing my own code for my own projects and not working with other developers (right now I just cant seem to get excited about open source). No doubts I'll be doing it to some extent no matter what
but I'm not sure whether it should be 80% of the time for the next 9 months. 

Drop out and get a full time job: I feel like I could easily work full time with the amount of knowledge I have right now, especially if I dedicated 2 or 3 months to learn datastructures/algorithms thoroughly and get ready for interviews but it's sort of a risky strategy and I kinda want to get a B.S degree (which is 3 years here), since I have this dream of moving to the US eventually and as far as I understand doing a Master's degree there would probably be the most realistic way to achieve that dream. 

Internship: Would delay my studies and the tech scene is not very advanced here so not sure how beneficial that would be right now.

3e0i92,0,2015-07-20,My mother's a mess and I lost the ability to deal!,cbross9481,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3e0i92/my_mothers_a_mess_and_i_lost_the_ability_to_deal/,"So, I've been having this problem with my mom and it's starting to become crucial as the years go by. 

A little background on myself. I'm M/22 recently graduated from college. I got a job out of state and will be moving away soon, so within the last year of preparation I've been trying to get my shit together mentally and physically.

Since I graduated in December, I spent the last 7 months at home living with my mom, and let me tell you it has been a disaster. Granted this is the longest I've been home for a while.  Usually spend a few months home in the summer; but even last summer I was away on an internship, so it's been a long time since I spent so much time at home. 

Now a little info on my mom. Brilliant, smart, beautiful and an all around Superwoman. She has given me the world. Unfortunately being home has left me to see some behind the scenes look at some of the sadness that goes on. My parents divorced when I was 12. My mom got remarried and she is currently going through her second divorce. Now I know, that alone explains a lot. But there have been resurfacing issues I've experienced even before the second marriage took place. 

Now for the rest of my family. I have two other siblings; a little brother and an older sister. We're all about 4 years apart. Unlike me however these guys are extremely extroverts. A little more outgoing, won't necessarily consider them more social however. But I'm the middle child, thus prone to be somewhat different. They don't seem to see what I see when it comes to our mom. In fact they tend to get along better with her, laughing and enjoying themselves. Of course they also do a better job at ignoring issues where I find it to be more practical to be direct. But recently I've found some of the things they laugh at to be a bit weird and inappropriate. Usually a cruel joke/not a joke concerning someone else that, to me, comes off a little narcissistic at times. But moving on, I do have a father. He remarried as well and still together with his wife. My father and I are very much alike, we seem to have very similar personalities. Or maybe I'm just trying to flatter myself because he is easily the smartest person I know on this planet.

Back to my mom and I. We have always had an interesting relationship. She use to call me her ride or die. But that was normally due to the immense amount of patience I had with her. I was more of the ""go to"" child. If she needed something done she knows I'd be the one to do it. Unlike my other siblings, who she barely asks to do anything. But keep in mind these are the guys she has the bigger laugh with. Some part of me has always felt bad for her and made it my duty to support my mom in her time of need. The way things went down after the first marriage, it was nearly impossible to get her back to a happy place. Crying constantly, hating the responsibility, embarrassment and the overall divorce process. But I was her rock.  

Now a days times are different. I graduated from college and got a great opportunity to look forward to in just one month and counting. But now, I'm back home dealing with the same issue second time around. But I don't have the patience I had before. She goes back to her same style sadness and I don't know what to say like I did before. I spend so much more time appreciating the people in my life I use to consider a reason for why my mom was so sad. These people being family and friends of both hers and ours. All I can do now is look at her and feel things are the way they are because she made them this way. In comparison to my other siblings, I made a complete 180 in attitude since I've been home; they like to treat everything the same, where I just don't see things the way I did before. I have so much resentment for her taking advantage of my patience when I was younger and can't tolerate it when she does it now. She acts as so, out of all three children,I am the one who has to be at her back and call, I'm the one with no life of my own that needs considering; But I just treated it as the norm back in the day. I understand she is going through a tough time, but I'm moving away next month. And quite frankly I don't know why I need to pretend like I like the way she treats me and other people when I really don't. 

Overall it's been difficult. I've had to do a lot of growing up. But being at home with my mom makes me feel like an insecure teenager again. Mostly due to the rudeness and hatefulness she exemplifies to me and other. I wish I would have stood up for myself more when I was younger, I wish I had expressed how unhealthy it is to let her children see her cry so much, I wish I felt as if I could trust her. But I can't bring myself to do it. Living with her makes me feel more vulnerable and angrier than ever. The crying, the negativity, The energy itself doesn't match the one I'm use to being around amongst my own friends. I feel so uncomfortable even being in the same car at times. In fact, it got to a point where my girlfriend wanted to break things off with me because she said I didn't seem like the same person I was after returning home. I have no idea what to say anymore. I use to spend so much time worrying about her life in the past that the minute I returned home mine crumbled before my very eyes, gasping for some relief. It feels like I'm treading water, it just never gives up.

But like I said before, I love my mother to death. I'd do anything for her, she has given me every opportunity to seize. I take some responsibility for how I feel now, I should've had more confidence in myself years ago. But now that I am older, I am having a harder time handling her narcissistic ways. I finally realize it is not the norm, and something is seriously wrong. And I fear this being her way of coping with everything going down with her, it might just be here to stay. I only have a month left to set things right with my mom. Talking to her about my feelings towards her is off the table because she can not take personal talks regarding herself. How do I make things better for the both of us?"

Startup/Big_comp, software_eng/data_eng.",spyissappin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3e0p03/choosing_between_2_internships_startupbig_comp/,"Long story short, I am looking at 2 internship offers for this ~~spring~~ fall (my bad). One of them is a small startup in their 2nd round of funding atm. I like the team and how everything is very lax. Majority of the stuff is android, and I am ok with it. They are located in a hip startupy place, so the atmosphere is according. The only problem is that they can't tell me how much my pay would be until the current round of funding is over (early-mid august), but they assured me I would be paid, and it is not a min wage. I told them I would be keeping in touch with them, and I am, but I told them I will decide as soon as they give me the number.

Another offer is the one i got very recently from an extremely big non-tech company, but not with their general devs. The offer is in their big data dept that is located separately from the rest of the company even physically, and it is the big data aspect is fascinating to me. I am not a complete noob to hadoop/spark/etc., so I somewhat know what I am getting into. I checked out the place, and it is a true dev environment, no ""data analytics"" powerpoint building bs. The place is slightly less lax that the startup, but fairly relaxed (flexible schedule/willing to work with my schedule/work from home/etc.). They explained to me the exact tech they are working with and the exact details of the work I would be doing, and it is pretty new, a lot of stuff they are developing with is only a year-two old. The position itself is for data engineering. I know their pay already, and it is acceptable for my area (not west coast, so); not high, not low. Also, while not really a dealbreaker, it has a nice perk of being in 5 minutes of drive from my apartment and my college where I am planning to take a class or two part-time.

So a few questions:

1) Will an internship with a title ""Data Engineer"" hinder my future software dev perspectives? I am stressing it again, it won't be excel sheets/powerpoint/occasional scripting. It is all direct distributed computing, so lots of algorithms/big data stuff. Also, would tech companies I would want to apply to in the future (Big 4, hip SF startups, etc.) hold it against me that I interned at a big, but a non-tech company rather than a tech startup?

2) If I haven't made my choice, is it fair of me to drop the startup offer? The offer wasn't in paper yet because they can't give me the pay, and I haven't accepted it even verbally. We literally agreed that I will make the choice when they will work out their funding round, but now I am somewhat braking that by considering ending things prematurely.

**tl;dr**: internship. Big non-tech company vs. a small startup. Data engineering vs. software engineering. East coast."

Just finished my freshman year of engineering at a top 20 public university.  I am very conflicted with my major and could really use some help so bear with me!

In high school I got a 4.0 and barely had to try.  Although math classes always gave me the most trouble, I decided to give engineering a shot since I enjoyed most sciences.

I worked my ass off this year (at least 5-6 hours in the library every weekday).  I barely got a 2.0.  While I am not too discouraged since I know others who struggle just as much, I am rethinking my major.

I have realized that I lack a understanding of math and it would take many many days to go back and fill the holes that I do not understand.  I enjoyed basic math, algebra, and geometry, but calculus seems impossible and stupid.  

The engineering classes themselves weren't too bad.  They were hard but I really didn't mind them too much.  I enjoy all sciences with the exception of chemistry, but it isn't unbearable to me like calculus is.  I really enjoyed environmental science classes in high school but realize that any field I work in will make less and have less job security than engineers would.  

Some say the first 2 years are just rough, and it will get better and be worth it.  But to be honest, I am miserable taking these math classes, and I have 4-5 more to go.  I might be able to go back and catch up with the help of a tutor but I feel like the whole situation isn't worth the effort anymore.

I guess the question Im trying to ask is should I stay in Engineering even though I'm going to hate the next few semesters and have a bad GPA by the time I'm a senior?  

I have a decent internship right now(not engineering but looks very good on a resume) and a good bit of connections.  I just don't know if its worth my time and effort.  I want to be an engineer, but don't want to waste my college years being miserable.  Any input or help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I originally started with the intent to apply to a master's program but changed my mind once I started taking pre-reqs and realized how many undergrad credits I would need. My first degree, despite being from a pretty good school, was in English so obviously I'm hoping for better career prospects. Unless I slow things down, I'll be finished in May 2016.

I'm not enjoying it all that much. I liked my intro classes - I sailed right through them, it was exciting to be good at coding after thinking I'd fail, and it was fun to build things. As I get further into the major, I've kind of hated my classes. Nothing but coding itself is remotely interesting to me and even that has less and less appeal. I get decent grades but it's something I have to slog through. I hate all the math a lot and I have no interest even in fundamentals like analysis of algorithms, even though I can understand the importance. 

Even worse, after the first couple of semesters I kind of lost interest in coding. I still enjoy any work involving writing code more than anything else but it's not as exciting to me as it was in my first couple semesters. I'm beginning to think the only reason I liked it then was because it was something new that I didn't think I could do before so there was a sense of accomplishment there.

I feel like I really need to be working on side projects or contributing to open source contributions but my Github has remained completely dead since I created it a a couple years ago. The last thing I want to do after working all day and then working on school work in the evening is sit down and code but I wonder if that's just an excuse and that I just don't want to do it period.

I've been applying for internships for 6+ months now and haven't had any luck. Part of that might be because I live in a smallish town in the midwest far from any major tech job markets, part of it might be because my lack of enthusiasm is bleeding into my cover letters, it might be my age, it might be my lack of any side projects. The worst part is that this doesn't even bother me at all. I've realized that I actually dread getting a call from a company since, even if I passed the interview, the thought of going somewhere and trying to convince a bunch of people that I'm software developer material is completely unappealing. I can't stay at my current dead end job forever but I've don't want to leave to go write code somewhere with a bunch of people who are good at what they do and have actual passion.

Basically, I don't feel like a ""real"" CS major. I feel out of place in all my classes (and not just because of my age) and I feel like I've just been trying to make it work to atone for the sin of my previous poor degree choice. My naive idea of being a developer and making more money and being in a respected profession has kept me going. I don't really want to let go of that but I'm beginning to think that I've chosen the wrong field and wasted a bunch of time and money for the past couple years. I'm planning on finishing the degree (since I've come this far already) but I'm not sure at this point that I'll ever do anything with it.

So, be honest with me. Is this just normal burnout/impostor syndrome or am I just not suited for this field? Should I just forget about a serious career in software? Assuming I even finish the degree, is there anything else I can do with my combination of BA/BS? 

tl;dr former english major goes back to school for CS, ends up not really caring for it all that much

I liked the people and the environment but I felt that the work was getting monotonous and I would learn more elsewhere. I then stated working at the college I was attending as a printer support tech with my manager saying they would shift me to more of a system admin intern, which I was interested in. Due to restructuring they informed me that I would not be able to shift jobs. 

This summer I applied for many different internships, and I ended up with a internship at a software development company. 

I am thankful for the opportunity and I feel that I am learning a lot, but I feel that I might be painting myself into a corner career path wise. I am not sure if I want to keep working with software or if I want to shift to a more System administration based job in the future.

I feel that there is no ""right"" choice, which is most likely the case.

Ultimately I am writing this to try and get an idea of what you think of your careers, your take on my situation or any advice you could spare. 

Thanks!"

Have good grades, extracurriculars in good shape as well, taking all the Comp Sci classes I can at my high school, but very lacking in any experience in internships so far. I think based on how I have done in Comp Sci 1 in highschool I can consider myself competent enough in what I have learned and my passion exists in technology and computers.

So that's my situation right now and in my mind I think I am set on pursuing a computer science-related major and career path but what really gets me going is the opportunity to travel and go to new places. Honestly even if the pay isn't the very best compared to a sedentary lifestyle I would find more enjoyment in the experience itself. Working remotely is definitely something I consider but I'm afraid that I can't really get that top position or job security by not being able to interact as normal with co-workers and such.

Really any advice is greatly appreciated, I've also explored (lurked) /r/digitalnomad and a great shoutout to them but it seems this is the place to get more focused in the area of tech.

Thanks and I think this could really have an impact as I'm at a point where I can really start to make decisions."

The task consists of calculating summary statistics for a fleet of hosts. Each host has a fixed number of slots in which virtual instances can run. Each host can only run instances of a particular type, e.g. M1, M2, or M3. You are provided with the file “FleetState.txt” that contains the state of the fleet. Each line in the file represents a single host in the following comma-separated format:


&lt;HostID&gt;,&lt;InstanceType&gt;,&lt;N&gt;,&lt;Slot1State&gt;,&lt;Slot2State&gt;,…,&lt;SlotNState&gt;

where

&lt;HostID&gt; is an integer
&lt;InstanceType&gt; can be M1, M2, or M3
&lt;N&gt; is the total number of slots on the machine
&lt;SlotjState&gt; is 0 if slot j is empty and 1 if it is occupied by an instance



Write a program that loads the state of the fleet from the input file “FleetState.txt” and then computes and writes out the following summary statistics to the output file “Statistics.txt”:



For each instance type, the count of empty hosts (all slots empty)
For each instance type, the count of full hosts (all slots filled)
For each instance type, the count of the most filled hosts (having the smallest number of empty slots &gt; 0). Both the host count and number of empty slots must be written out in that order.



The output file must have the following format:



EMPTY: M1=&lt;count&gt;; M2=&lt;count&gt;; M3=&lt;count&gt;;

FULL: M1=&lt;count&gt;; M2=&lt;count&gt;; M3=&lt;count&gt;;

MOST FILLED: M1=&lt;count&gt;,&lt;empty slots&gt;; M2=&lt;count&gt;,&lt;empty slots&gt;; M3=&lt;count&gt;,&lt;empty slots;


My question is, what is the data in the last line of output? What does the count refer to? Does it refer to the number of filled slots in the most filled host, or the number of hosts with the minimum empty slots? And what is the empty slots? Also, since it says to get the host with the most empty slots &gt; 0, that then means that completely full slots should be left out?"

&gt;$migbits: Okay...Uh, wait, is that it?

&gt;$FrontDesk: Yes, I'm sorry it's so vague...I didn't know how to describe it.

Well, the front desk not knowing how to describe a problem is always a good sign. I take the call and exchange introductions with the CEO's secretary.

&gt;$Secretary: Yes, so what's happening is nothing is opening on his computer, it comes up blank.

&gt;$migbits: *(wondering what 'blank' even means)* All right. Are you at his computer right now?

&gt;$Secretary: Actually, let me just transfer you over to him, he can show you, I don't really know how to describe it.

No, please don't, I really don't want to be responsible for the CEO, I'm just a measly intern -

&gt;$CEO: Hello?

Oh god.

&gt;$CEO: Ah, good, so I'm having this problem and I don't really know how to describe it - 

&gt;$migbits: Of course.

&gt;$CEO: - but every time I try to open anything it comes up blank.

&gt;$migbits: *suppressing the urge to sigh* So what exactly do you mean by 'blank'? 

&gt;$CEO: Well, that's just it, it's blank.

&gt;$migbits: I understand. Do you mean it's freezing up, or it's slow, or you're getting an error message?

&gt;$CEO: No, the wheel just keeps spinning and then it closes. I can't open my outlook or Powerpoint or the internet or anything. I started it up in Safe Mode and tried to look at the settings and restarted but nothing's changed.

&gt;$migbits: And did any of those applications open while you were in safe mode?

&gt;$CEO: Oh, you know what, that was the one thing I didn't try.

\*presses mute button\* **FACEPALM** \*unmutes\*

I have him start up in safe mode again and he manages to open Powerpoint. Success! ...Until I try to get him to open IE, and then it just crashes again. At this point I suspect something nasty is on his computer, while my coworkers think it could also be hardware failure. Either way, not much we can do remotely.

&gt;$migbits: All right, it looks like we'll need to send someone in to take a look at this. Do you mind if -

&gt;$CEO: Wait, let me just try something. I'll see if I can open outlook in protected mode.

&gt;$migbits: I don't really think that will -

&gt;$CEO: *opens outlook* Oh, it's spinning...It opened!! ...Oh, it stopped. It says, ""Outlook has crashed because [insert some error message here]"".

&gt;$migbits: Right, it seems this is probably a larger issue than we can fix remotely. Would you -

&gt;$CEO: Wait, let me just try one more thing. I want to see if I can open the internet in protected mode! :D

This continued on for about fifteen minutes until I convinced him that we needed to send someone in, at which point he complained that he had too much work to wait and his spare laptop was at home. One of the senior techs had to switch with me to explain that we couldn't just magically fix the problem.

TLDR: CEO thinks if you butt your head against a wall repeatedly, it will eventually fizzle into bubbles and rainbows."

The problem is, the background check takes a really long time. Its been about seven months since I accepted the offer, and they told me it takes from 9 - 12 months for them to finish the background screening process. My application may take even longer because I immigrated to the US, I have a lot of foreign national family.  

So while I do need a job for the remainder of the year, I'm not really comfortable with making long term promises that I can't keep.

I'm not sure what the result would be if I simply did not inform them of my prior engagement, but it seems like a bad move.  I'm seeking work I can do for just a few months.

3e461d,8,2015-07-21,Baffled with the whole dating concept in Germany,Joanna8o,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3e461d/baffled_with_the_whole_dating_concept_in_germany/,"So I started doing my Master's thesis about 4 months ago at an Institute in Baden-Württemberg. The kick-off was pretty amazing; friendly people and high tech labs. 

about a month into my thesis I started to like this guy and notice him around the place. He has this really goddamn sexy dark brown beard and hair and these gorgeous pair of dark green eyes (yeah and don't even get me started on his figure!). So I think it was me who started saying hi and I was ok with initiating a conversation between us(which is not generally my style) coz he really didn't look German and I thought a foreign guy might be able to click faster than a german(I've had experience in that department). 

So at first he seemed quite self-conident and focused on work. We work in the same unit (but in two almost separate groups)so we would met every Wednesday for unit meetings and I think that was where I started noticing him (not sure, maybe in the lab). anyway, we started running into each other more often and usually he would greet me first (especially the way he used to say ""hey"" could make me lose my knees I swear!) and so I rightfully(or not) concluded he liked me.

tbh I think at some level i acted a little bit distant which may have put him off.the problem is after some time when I finally admitted to myself that I liked him he seemed to have backed off a little bit and wouldn't even bother to come forward and say hi anymore. 

in the meantime two french interns entered the unit (boyfriend and girlfriend) and I could see the girl asking him to join them for lunch, also spotted them talking so comfortably. The girl bakes cakes/cookies every other friday for their group and they seemed to have become more or less good friends.

so after trying to ""accidentally"" work longer than usual where he was working (hoping he would start a conversation) for such a loooong time I decided to bust a move. The problem was about a month back when we were in the city for a seminar he and his friend asked me and my office mate to go for a beer and well I said no because I thought I looked extremely tired that day.So to be on the safe side,last friday I asked my Chinese colleague to ask their group out for a drink. 

we sat down at a table and to my surprise he was avoiding eye contact in a weird way. like he would start off a conversation by asking me a question but half way through averted his eyes and I'm like what the hell?! his friend seemed to be more willing to have a conversation with me than him as he was talking to my chinese colleague for the most part, until the beers kicked in for both of us and we started to look at each other more often and have actual real conversations (which would be politics for germans). 

afterwards,they took us to this light show in the city centre which was not really amusing and he kinda sensed  i was bored to hell and so offered to leave and go for an ice cream but the other two guys wanted to stay so we stayed. I guess to make things better he started joking around about random stuff with me in a low voice. When the whole light show ended they offered to go for an ice cream but my chinese colleague was feeling all dizzy and heavy and proposed we leave (I live a few blocks away from him and since it was dark i had no other option but to leave with him). 

before we leave they asked me to go to a lake close by my village on Saturday and I was like yeah why not. again to my surprise i didn't hear from them on saturday but I thought it would fine since we were supposed to meet on sunday at my boss's place for a late afternoon barbecue. so i dressed up carefully and felt like a hard eight, hoping he would finally show some major signals. He sat right next to me(at a big table with like 5 more people) and talked to me the whole damn time (like 6 hours!), made some jokes about my diet and asked me once if i wanted to go for another beer. But then that was it and at the end of the day i was like really?because the only intimate thing he told me was that he got two other siblings! is there something I'm doing wrong here?? I mean I saw him talking to that french girl today quite normally. 

I really really can't tell if he likes me or not and if yes why do you think he's not making a move? I know germans take their time when it comes to asking you out and all but he gotta know i don't have till forever! 
On the side note:1. I'm 100% sure he doesn't have a girlfriend. He's not on Facebook or any other social networks. 2.He's also doing his master's thesis."

I'm personally wondering when recruiting system for the big companies start and end, because my academic schedule seems to put me ""a leg behind"" each recruiting season. To explain, I'm going to take a Data Structures course in spring, and this is the most important class for internships. However, I feel like I won't know enough about Data Structures in time for the interviews, which I'm guessing is going to be wrapping up by the middle of Spring while the semester is chugging along.

Not only that, I heard that full-time recruiting season for most colleges happens in Fall, and unfortunately I'll be taking a very important algorithms class DURING that semester, and I feel like I won't know enough for interviews cause I'll still be just fresh into the material.

Is there a lot of flexibility in terms of when tech companies hire software engineers/devs? It seems like there's a limited window of time when the MAJOR companies recruit students straight from college.

Difficulty choosing what to learn in free time (second language or data struct/algo).

Hey all. 

I am going in to my fifth year at university and just recently switched to CS. I was almost finished with a biochem degree when I realized (through a research class) that I did not enjoy the work that came with the material.

 Given that I am changing majors so late, I am having some doubts about opportunities for internships and co-ops. I am able to fit all of the required CS classes into 3 semesters and graduate, but I feel it will be hard to get an internship because I will be going through the program so quickly. I am at freshman level knowledge currently, but by next year I will be junior/senior level. I feel like a time frame this short will cause companies to have a difficult time classifying me (not enough knowledge now/too close to graduation in a year). Is this assumption way off?

Also, I could use a little guidance on what to learn. My intro class was learning python, and next semester I learn c++. After that is when I start getting in to data structures and algorithms, compilers, and more advanced courses. Would it be wise of me to spend free time learning c++ or data structures and algorithms? I know that data structures and algorithms are more helpful in landing an internship, but c++ is the route laid out by the school. Which would be better for developing more impressive personal projects for my resume?

I just feel like the whole degree is being rushed for me. I know that I can effectively learn the material in a short time frame but I'm very scattered on what to learn and where to put my priorities. Sorry for the wall of text and thank you for reading!"

He's applied for hundreds of jobs, but he doesn't normally get called back or when he gets super close they find someone with more experience. His schools rules when he attended didn't let students intern at private practices and make the connections they would need to have a job after graduation, his internship was with the navy. I'm starting to worry about him, he's still sweet to me but he's becoming more and more dejected as time goes on and I don't know what to do or how to help him. He's such hard worker too so I think its a major blow to his confidence to not have a job. What can I do to help him?"
3e4qpx,9,2015-07-21,Think I just had a reality check... need another opinion (Long post),_throwaway4dayz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3e4qpx/think_i_just_had_a_reality_check_need_another/,"Hey guys,

So I'm currently 9 weeks into my 10-week internship as a software development intern at a well-known company that's known to give full-time offers after internships. I am placed on the product management team for the product that my company is making. I'm essentially the sole intern on the team and also the only current developer, while all the other CS interns are placed in development teams that work on the actual product (think web product with full-service api essentially). Me? Well I code too, but I work on apps that will log metrics for the product management team and automate them (data visualization of defects, matrices with filters and drilldowns, automated burndown charts, etc) that are extended from project management tools. Let's call these apps PMTOOLS development just so you guys know what I'm referencing to later. I don't really get to see into the code base of the actual product because of PMTOOLS development, so I take up shadowing opportunities on the development teams occasionally (Front-End UI/Component Design). 

Anyways, the whole work environment and culture is pretty chill; optional business casual attire for dress, casual Fridays, you fill out your own timesheet, make up your hours as you go, free food in the kitchen from catered luncheons, nice intern events.. no complaints whatsoever. My manager as well is really chill, but obviously as a project manager, wasn't really much help for me on the development side, so I feel like there is somewhat of a disconnect between how helpful of a mentor he can be to me. He usually just gives me tasks to work with, I work on them, if I'm stuck I'll go to him and he'll get another person that I can link up with to hopefully help, and I eventually get the task done. We do some small talk about what we'll do over the weekend, but nothing too substantial. Obviously we say hello when we see each other around the office, which actually isn't often, he's quite busy and not around much, but again-- nothing substantial. 

All the development teams have standup meetings and sprint planning meetings, but management teams have review meetings and sprint reviews, etc.. obviously for management things. I used to go to some of them in the beginning of the internship, but I was on read-only mode the whole time and could never follow anything or contribute so I stopped going around week 3. I thought that spending more time on my actual development work would be a better use of my time. It didn't really seem like it mattered much either to them, and my manager never said a word about it (I don't even think he went to them all, which I believe is where I got my initial impression that it was okay). About halfway into the internship my manager assigned a time for us to meet in the morning and have a standup meeting just for me. These were somewhat inconsistent, so he ended up cancelling them after like 3 weeks. I wasn't phased at all because this meant I didn't have to wake up so early to make it to the meetings anymore. This inevitably led to me coming in a bit later each day.

Anyways, I finished up PMTOOLS development last week, and now they tasked me with a new project to work (wayyy too many tools for me to learn on the spot with only 1 week left-- RESTful API, Database implementation and interfacing, learning Groovy, etc.) PMTOOLS development was also a completely new thing for me to dive into at the time, but I ended up getting the hang of it after doing lots of research and experimenting. This on the other hand just seems so impossible to me for some reason. Then it started to hit me-- shit, what if not being able to complete this task before finishing the internship negatively impacts their decision to give me a full-time offer? And then I started to think-- aside from that then, am I even deserving of the full-time offer? And I said yes-- I've done everything that they've asked of me except for this and I've been friendly and not caused any problems. But then I thought, well who isn't like that? Could it be that not going to those management meetings, not being intentional with the relationship of my manager and I, not knowing everyone on my team as well as I could have (if I'm the only intern, shouldn't it make sense that they all know me?) and coming in later each day at my own is indicative of being a bad worker? I don't know if I'm having an epiphany that I fucked up, or if I'm overanalyzing things. I heard managers will often be very vocal about a full-time offer if the internship is closing out and they want you to stay, but my manager hasn't said anything like that, and also the whole manager dynamic at my company is different. Also just to clarify here: The manager I have been referring to this entire time is somewhat of a project manager specific to me, and I have a different manager that signs my timesheets. If anything, I'm inclined to believe that my project manager doesn't have influence to bring me on board or not. I also kind of get sketched out by comments like ""while we still have [myname] here, we should get him to ____"", or ""document everything you've worked on so that it can be maintained"" instead of alluding to a future at the company (i.e. ""you'd be great to have on to teach this to someone"", etc... idk if I'm expecting too much. I'm just in a rut. 

So here's where I turn to Reddit. What do you guys think? Am I just freaking out? Any advice on how to move forward and close out the internship strong to secure an offer? Should I take my manager out to lunch and just talk about life and career choices? Would he think that's offputting if it's the week that intern evaluations are due? I really need to secure this full-time offer... help me out guys!"

3e5pue,106,2015-07-21,I'm Never Going Back to the Evening Shift.,Droopuno,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e5pue/im_never_going_back_to_the_evening_shift/,"Hi, sorry if this is a little long -- I'm new to this.

My story happened two years ago when I was working as an intern part-time at a large theatre company. I was only 19, and still pretty naïve. My job was to work the reception desk of the offices adjacent to the theatre itself. To give you a little background on the theatre, it was  very grand but kind of dilapidated. I heard the architecture was at least 170 years old, but at present it looked like it had seen better days. However, compared to the offices attached to it (the ones i worked in) the theatre was in mint condition. You see, this office building was not just old, but also it had had few renovations over the years and piecesof it were literally falling apart. The floor plan was essentially a ground floor where visitors were buzzed in from street level, 14 offices and a reception area on the second floor, 21 offices on the third, and a bunch of abandoned vacant offices on the fourth floor -- which had been occupied by a halting, poorly-managed series of renovations for at least 3 years. At the time construction was on hold and no one ever went up there as far as I knew.

Make no mistake, I had been warned about the building's eerier traits. When I got the internship the head of marketing, under whom I worked, warned me that the building was ""haunted,"" and explained that just about everyone who worked there had at least a handful of paranormal stories to tell. I'm superstitious to a degree but also believe in a healthy dose of skepticism so I really did not take her seriously. 

However, after just a few shifts from 1-5pm two days a week, I realized she was just being honest. Objects would move, lights would flicker, doors would open on their own, etc. It was creepy at first but fit surprisingly well in the office environment. For instance, you might hear at the water cooler, ""OMG the freakiest thing happened to me when I came into the office this morning..."" or ""I can't believe how strange this place gets sometimes, just the other day..."" Somehow this creepy stuff was always taken in stride, because it happened so often, because there were 50 of us bustling around, because it was day time and we were in well-lit rooms in the middle of July, and because no one was ever seriously hurt. People just seemed to be used to it.

Anyway, The first few weeks of my job went smoothly but I started to feel like it was too easy. I sat at a desk for hours and only answered a few quick calls and emails and every now buzzing a visitor into the building. In short, I really was not too useful to them, nor was I profiting from the experience. Soon, I went to my boss asking for additional ways to help out around the place. This is when I first heard of the ""Evening Shift."" 

The Evening Shift was not an official shift; you couldn't find it on the website, not to mention its duties were very broad and largely overlapped with the janitor's. From what I understood it only existed to give eager interns something to do for 3.5 hours a week. The responsibilities of the shift itself were simple: one precocious intern (me) would come in around 6:30pm (everyone else leaves by 5:30) and visit all 35 offices restocking printers, emptying wastebaskets, tidying desks, and performing other little tasks. The shift went until 10 pm but you leave at 9:30 if you finished early, which most interns did. Soon after the shift ended the janitor would come in and clean up, darken, and lock up the building by midnight. It sounded so simple, even redundant, at least at the time.

I showed up to my first Evening Shift with no small amount of mental preparation, especially considering I was a guy who was not fully convinced of ghosts' existence. I reasoned that although the building was creepy, especially when empty, 6:30-9:30pm wasn't exactly the Witching Hour and that most of the lights would be on. I planned to clean things up for 2 hours, dick around on my phone for a third, and then hit the road. 

And those first two hours went as smoothly as planned. Smoother, even. I bustled from room to room organizing, cleaning, and resupplying the already tidy offices. There were no unexpected sounds, no changes in temperature, nothing the least bit paranormal. It was just as I was tidying the last office suite on the third floor that I became aware of a noise somewhere in the building. Strangely, I couldn't tell if it had just started or if it had been going on for a while. At any rate, it made me jump but I then recognized it as the trill of a phone ringing through old, muffling walls. I looked at my watch. 8:35. It made no sense for someone to be calling at this time -- we'd been closed for hours. What's more, I couldn't pinpoint the location of the ringing. It sounded like it was coming from above me, but that was impossible because I didn't think there were any connected phones on the fourth floor. But sure enough as I listened more closely I realized that's exactly where it was coming from.

Guardedly, I stepped out into the stairwell and now heard distinctly, without a doubt, the echo of a shrill ring from the floor above. Now I wasn't about to go up there (keep in mind the fourth floor was kept completely dark at all times) but I figured I might get a little closer. I started up the stairs and turned to face the door to the fourth floor just in time to see it slam shut. It was as though something had been holding it wide open and had just then let go when I turned to face it. I froze. I could still hear the phone ringing. Slowly, not taking my eyes off the door, I backed down the stairs and then dashed down to the second floor, down to my cozy reception desk. 

I was shaken, but simultaneously annoyed with myself for getting so panicked. I realized that from the reception desk, as I had done countless times during the day, I could monitor and pick up any calls going on in the building. As I looked at the phone lines I saw that sure enough a vacant office, one of the ones of the fourth floor, had an active line. But then I noticed it wasn't the only one. Other vacant offices, all on the fourth floor began lighting up the phone lines. As the lights flicked on one by one on the phone system, I heard far above me a cacophony of ringing from EVERY PHONE on the fourth floor. I knew these couldn't be 'real' calls, only the paranormal presence of the building playing tricks on me. So I quickly connected to each active line and instantly dropped the call. One by One, the ringing stopped. It was over.

By 9:10 and with only 20 minutes to go, I was feeling pretty good, if a little jumpy. After dealing with the mystery calls I had surfed the web on my phone in the well-lit reception area for 30 minutes and adrenaline had ebbed from my body. All of the sudden something caught my eye. To my right, by the door to the stairwell, there was a monitor displaying security footage of the entrance to the building where visitors would be buzzed in. Right there, framed by the security monitor, in a hard hat and reflective vest, stood a stout, bearded construction worker wearing sports sunglasses. He hadn't hit the button on the intercom, he was just standing there, motionless. I found this very odd but wasn't creeped out because the guy looked very normal. In fact, he looked completely un-spooky. So I picked up the phone and talked to him on the intercom.

""Sir, can I help you? Are you looking for something?""
He turned Silently to face the camera, so on the monitor he was looking right at me.
""I'm here to replace the lights,"" he said in a far away voice. 
Wat. That didn't make any sense, the place was closed.
""I'm sorry sir but the building has been closed for hours, everyone's gone home.""
""I've been working on the renovation of the fourth floor.""
Alarm bells went off in my head but I ignored them, fear wasn't going to trump my responsibilities.
""Well it's pretty late and I didn't think there is any renovating going on at the moment. It's been put on hold.""
He didn't respond. He just stared at me trough the monitor.
""Do you need to be buzzed in sir??""
""Yes, I'm here to replace the lights.""
Sigh. Jesus this guy was thick.
""Ok, does it have to be done now?""
""Yes.""
I buzzed him in. At first he just kept standing there like he wasn't going to open the door but at the last second he grabbed it and slowly ambled inside. 

I met him on the second floor landing and shook his hand. He seemed normal enough up close, he certainly wasn't a freak show. But his mannerisms were bizarre, as if he wasn't all there. He stared at me vacantly through his pitch black sunglasses and barely spoke. When he did it was as though he was trying to recall a distant memory or a fading dream.
""Do you know... where the fourth floor is?""
""Yes, this is the second floor it's just two flights up and it will be on your right.""
He just kind of cocked his head at me as if I was speaking another language. I was getting irritated.
""Do you need help finding the fourth floor?!""
""Yes.""

Christ. It felt dumb to go back up there but now it was part of my job to do so. More importantly though, I now had a big burly construction worker backing me up, even if he was a little slow. We trudged up the stairs and I felt his footsteps and heard his labored breathing behind me. 

""Here we are,"" I said shortly. We stared at the deserted hallway, littered with step ladders, paint cans, planks of wood, tarps, etc. It was so dark you couldn't make anything out if it weren't for the light shining in from the stairwell. The construction worker walked into the darkened hallway without so much as looking at me. Just then, loudly, a phone rang from one of the vacant offices adjacent to the hallway I was now facing. Nope, still not going in there. My companion seemed not to notice and continued trudging down the blackened corridor.

""I've got to take that at my desk,"" I said nervously, but more as an excuse to get back to reception than anything else. I walked slowly back down the stairs to the second floor. As I was seating myself at the reception desk, I noticed the line for the phone that was ringing had gone dead. That could only mean the construction worker, who seemed so stoned and unhelpful, had also decided to pick up calls not meant for him -- even if they were from phantom callers. 

Annoyed, I connected to the dropped line to see if a conversation was going. As I expected it was silent; the guy picked it up, heard silence, and hung up.

But then I heard his voice. The construction dude, he was murmuring something on the line. It was completely indistinct to me but it sounded like he was in conversation with someone. Not that I heard someone else, but the guy would pause, listen, and then start murmuring again. I kept listening but could only really pick up fragments.

""Be back soon--""
""I'm here--""
""The lights--""

Hearing this odd snippets from the unsettling construction worker and this inaudible, maybe non-existent caller sent a chill down my spine. I started to consider that maybe this guy, whoever he was, was not what he seemed. But the realist in me thought better of it, I mean I'd seen the guy, talked to him, touched his hand. He was a human, albeit a creepy one.

I glanced at my watch. 9:29. I decided the best course of action would be to just go talk to the guy, make sure he was just doing what he was supposed to and then get the fuck out of there. I'd check in with my boss about it on the way home but for now I just wanted to make sure he wasn't robbing the place or something and then leave.

As I climbed those stairs for the third time I noticed that I saw a light shining in from the Fourth floor hallway, just as it would from the second or third floors. He fucking did it, I thought -- feeling simultaneously relieved and foolish for getting so worried. I dashed up the stairs and rounded the corner to the fourth floor landing.

""Hey good job with th--"" I began. 

But I stopped. I saw before me bathed in the newly lit, white light of the the corridor, nothing. It was completely empty. In that second, without warning, the silence became very loud. It was as though my ears started from a sudden, deafening explosion. And then just as suddenly, the newly lit light flickered and went out -- leaving the hallway in total darkness. That was the most frightening moment of my life. I was no longer concerned with the construction worker because something told me that as real as he seemed there was no construction worker, no phone calls, no lights, none of it. They were all illusions stemming from and perhaps luring me into the hallway that no one visited. And I should have known better. I tore down the stairwell and out of the building like it was about to explode. 

I called my boss on the way home and said I wouldn't be doing any more Evening Shifts. She wasn't mad or even surprised. She said just about every intern who had done it complained about the Evening Shift being a little too 'intense.'


****************Continued (?)****************

There is a short afterword I could include here that I think sheds a lot of light on the situation, the nature of the hauntings, and the history of the building. Of course, this only really make sense if you guys think the account itself is interesting. So for now I'll wait for feedback before posting.


AFTERWORD (glad people are liking it so far).

Fast forward about a month and a half. By this point Summer vacation was winding down and I was only going to be interning there for about another week. At that point I hadn't told anyone the details of my night on the evening shift in part because it still frightened me to think about it and in part because I worried people (who didn't work in the building) wouldn't believe it. So I just kept quiet.

But by that point I was liking my regular work a lot more and felt the internship had been a success. One of the best parts I found was that for about 45 minutes at the end of my shifts I would actually have company in the form a the janitor, Fernando. He was an older (but robust) Portuguese guy who had worked there for a long, long time. Normally he only showed up at night but for a few weeks he was helping repaint an office on the second floor -- he was an old school handyman type and would do things like that. Anyway, he would frequently lean on the desk and shoot the shit with me for a bit. 

Needless to say, when it came to spooky accounts of the building, Fernando was the archivist. He'd basically seen everything, and even though he would say that all things paranormal ""scare me half to death,"" in reality, he seemed completely unfazed. In fact, he didn't just like to recount his own stories but he loved to hear and collect those of others. Mostly when you told him this stuff he would kind of just chuckle and nod knowingly, having witnessed the same thing many times. It kind of made you feel better about all the unsettling shit in the building. For this reason, on that Friday afternoon in mid August, I decided there was no better time to get this story off my chest and no better person to relay it to.

I was expecting Fernando to have seen all this stuff I'd witnessed and already know how it ended. And as I was describing it he seemed on board, at least initially. Up until the point when the door to the fourth floor slammed shut on its own. Frowning he said, ""I always keep fourth floor padlocked, are you sure you saw it open?""

""Yeah,"" I said, a little surprised. I was taken aback somewhat because I figured that even that sort of thing was par for the course in a building like this, no cause for alarm. I went on with the story but now Fernando seemed as serious as he was intrigued. When I got to the part about the construction worker his face tightened.

""You should not have spoken to him, you should not have let him in,"" he said gravely. ""It is one thing for them to bother you but you don't ever want to start contacting with -- those people.""

""Why is that?"" I said, a little frightened. I found it odd that he said ""those people."" It sounded like a euphemism.

""I have only met a few of them in this building but they were always very frightening. They seem so real at first you believe maybe they are but something in your gut will tell you otherwise.""

""But, I mean, it's not like they can hurt you"" I said hopefully.

Fernando raised an eyebrow. ""True, if you leave them alone and don't try to talk to them. Then they will just stare at you for a while and eventually go away. But the places they want to go, and want you to go are never good, never safe.""

I sighed. Maybe telling this story had been a bad idea. I felt stupid because I went in thinking it would make me feel better about the whole thing. ""Well as you might imagine, this guy wanted to go to the fourth floor.""

""But you said no,"" Fernando said without hesitation.

""Umm... not exactly"" I said, feeling stupider by the second.

Fernando gasped and stared at me like I told him I took off my harness on a rollercoaster.

""I mean I never set foot on the floor but I led him to the door on the landing,"" I said hastily. 

Fernando didn't say anything for awhile. So long that I just assumed story time was over and started cleaning up my desk. I looked at my watch and began to worry about train schedules and walking distances. As I stood up Fernando said ""You know you're very lucky. I'm not trying to scare you but the last place you want to be is all alone on that floor at night.""

""Why? Because it's haunted?"" I asked, a little exasperated with all the crypticness.

Fernando gave me an almost sad look and said slowly ""Son, this whole building is haunted. That floor is also very dangerous.""

""Dangerous how?""

""Exposed wires with no insulation, a crumbling ceiling, lights that explode, a floor that breaks (I assume he meant it was structurally unsound), and the door can lock you in there on its own.""

I shuddered. It did sound dangerous. ""But the place is being renovated, it probably can't be that bad if people are working there.""

Once again he looked at me like I was an idiot. ""Are you kidding?! No contractors will even finish the job up there, it's not worth the risk to them. Not after those two trained repair men got electrocuted just putting in a few new bulbs.""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well that's about it, I haven't spoken another word (literally) on the subject of the fourth floor to anyone else because frankly I didn't (and still don't) want to know more. I'm still not sure what Fernando meant by ""those people,"" I mean it's probably some sort of ghost but if anyone knows more about them please share. There are one or two more REALLY (creepier than mine I think) spooky stories from the building I recall but they aren't mine so I would have to call a friend who is still there to get all the details. 

Anyway, hope you guys liked it. I appreciate any feedback I can get.

I'm not sure if I will either because my school work is time consuming enough and I'm worried that if I take on an internship I'll just stress myself out. 

So are they any other things I can do to fill up my resume? I've been thinking of working on some projects by myself at home (programming ones). Does anyone have some good ideas of what projects I could do that would look impressive to employers?"

Question is below bullet points, but the bullet points include very relevant info.

* CS major at a mediocre state school (Not terrible, but far from prestigious)
* Entering my 6th and final year of college (changed majors + dropped out multiple times due to depression, which I've made major strides in dealing with)
* GPA should be decent upon graduation assuming I make no major errors (total: 3.7+ , major: 3-3.5 range)
* Have been woefully apathetic about my coursework/personal development up until now, and haven't done a good job looking at the end goal. This is bearing down on me now as I look at my empty CV

**The question: I have no significant programming projects under my belt (although I am addressing that now as best as I can), no internships, and am slated to graduate next spring (which will require me to take two heavy 21 credit courseloads for the next two semesters). My plan was to graduate and seek out a summer internship (post graduation) while continuing to build my skills and apply for jobs. It will be both emotionally and economically challenging for me to stay in school another semester. Is it foolish to rush towards graduation like this? I truly hate the idea of taking another 7 months to graduate (especially since I'm already 6 years in), but I feel like my job prospects are dismal even if I manage to put together a small portfolio come graduation.

3e7gwi,3,2015-07-22,Is it weird to network with someone who rejected you for a job?,amiawkward,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3e7gwi/is_it_weird_to_network_with_someone_who_rejected/,"So about a month ago I interviewed for a Canadian S&amp;T desk in Toronto.  I didn't get the job although I didn't really get any ""auto-ding"" type vibes from the interviewers.  My guess is that given my lack of experience in finance and lower grades than my competitors (I know some of them) I was probably compared side by side to other candidates and rejected that way.  Or at least I'd like to think anyways...

Fast forward to now, and I got a job at the same bank but in their asset management arm.  I'd be doing a lot of portfolio analytics/risk type work (including the product for the S&amp;T desk I interviewed for) and wanted to also start networking at the firm to move into S&amp;T.

Would it be weird to contact my old interviewer (he's the VP of the group) and ask him about my interview and what went wrong (and thus how I could improve)?  I mean there is always the chance he will have forgotten who I am, but if he does recognize me would it come off as desperate or awkward?  I do genuinely want to work for this desk, and was pretty devastated when I didn't get the job lol, but figure this could be the best way in for my next internship.  

I appreciate any advice, this sub has always been helpful to me :)"

Will do anything for a good company.",[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/3e7slm/for_hire_central_nj_graphic_designer_renaissance/,"Hello,

My name is Frank and I am currently working as a graphic designer at a small sign shop in Central NJ. I love the work I do, but my current job environment is not great. I feel like I'm on a sinking ship - all of my co-workers come into work on edge, grumpy and hating life. My boss comes in late and mostly just cares about what's for lunch and his own projects. He's a boss, not a leader. What's keeping me sane is that I care about my clients and work towards their happiness with their design projects. I need a change though.

**Graphic Design:** I have designed banners, business cards, posters, flyers, magnets, decals, t-shirts, vehicle graphics, logos, etc. I'm a people person with great communication skills. I love interfacing with clients, figuring out how to best suit their needs, and building relationships with them. I handle designs independently from start to finish through all rounds of revisions. I do all of my own billing, invoicing, filing, file organization, etc. I even work on production of said materials. I'm highly proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I've done Flash in the past. I'm currently familiarizing myself with InDesign and CorelDraw. 

**E-Commerce/Advertising/Marketing/Merchandising/Social Media:** I have been creative director and merchandiser for an online retail company. I put thousands upon thousands of products online ranging from power tools to luxury home goods. I have excellent grammar and communication skills. I have created landing pages, banner ads, promotional images, and company blogs. I have promoted companies on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest. I have assisted with and written copy for advertising campaigns for high end home goods. 

**IT/Networking/Office:** In high school I had two years of Cisco Networking Training. I have done IT and network support for my town's entire school system. I can set up and network your office equipment and troubleshoot your PC software and hardware problems. I'm proficient with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I like to keep office environments organized and make sure things are running efficiently. 

**Maintenance:** I was a maintenance superintendent for four years. I've done light plumbing, electrical, and carpentry. You want proof that someone can strive with a fast-paced, high-stress environment? Give them 175-500 apartments to maintain, including all emergencies and making new units ready for rental. 

**Why you should hire me:**I strive in fast-paced environments. I like to keep active and learn as much as I can. I want to be able to assist in any job function when I am employed at a place. I'm highly organized with an eye for detail. I will go into any position learning everything I can and doing anything I can to grow the business and help make sure things are running efficiently and smoothly. I'll wear as many hats as you need as long as I feel rewarded and that what I am doing matters. I want you to be able to depend on me for anything. I'm there to make your job easier and reduce your stress. I'm sane and intelligent, and pick things up quickly. 

**What I need:** I need a place where creativity and productivity is rewarded. I'm not looking for a temporary, part time, or internship position. I want full time with decent pay, health benefits and a chance to save for retirement. I want to be at a place where employee input matters and where fun and creativity are encouraged. I would highly prefer to do something creative with graphic design, art, or writing. 

If you are interested in an employee that wants to make a home for himself at your company and help it grow in any way I can, please get in touch. I provide my resume, online design portfolio, and references upon request. Thank you!

3e7t7r,3,2015-07-22,Getting an internship/job as a highschool graduate,MCBeathoven,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3e7t7r/getting_an_internshipjob_as_a_highschool_graduate/,"I recently graduated from a highschool near Berlin, with an Abitur (German A-Levels) of 1.3, which is apparently about equivalent to a GPA of 3.7 (edit: not quite sure about this, might also be 4.0 according to other sources).

I created my first HTML pages at the age of 10 and loved programming ever since.

Since I skipped a grade, I'm only 16 years old and would like to take a year off before starting to study CS. I'd love to spend it abroad, but that's pretty much impossible in my situation. So I thought I could maybe try and get a job/paid internship as a programmer for about 7-9 months and then use the money to travel Europe (I have basically no living expenses).

I've programmed in Python, PHP, HTML+CSS+JavaScript, RoR, Coffeescript and Node.js before, but I wouldn't consider myself experienced in any of them (maybe Python and JavaScript, but I know next to no frameworks for them).

I've also contributed to a few OS projects on GitHub, but nothing too big. My most popular own project is a simple extension for the Atom editor with 4 stars.

Is it realistic to think I could get hired? If so, how would I go about that? Where should I apply, and how many rejections should I expect before just enlisting at a university?"
3e7ugx,6,2015-07-22,Can I tell my ex-girlfriend not to enter my (formerly our) apartment?,legal__throwaway__,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3e7ugx/can_i_tell_my_exgirlfriend_not_to_enter_my/,"State: Maryland

My then-girlfriend moved to the other side of the country for a research internship for the summer. We broke up shortly after she left in June. The original plan was for me to be gone for two weeks when she returns in late August so we wouldn't have to deal with any emotional awkwardness while she moves out.

However, recently she's displayed some concerning and unstable behavior (including getting engaged to some dude she's known all of two weeks), and I no longer trust her to be in the apartment when I'm not here.

She is no longer on the lease as of August 1st. She signed a form releasing herself from it that the landlord sent her. All of her stuff is still here.

Here's my ideal plan: I still go on my trip (I'm seeing family in another state), but I put her stuff in storage and tell her not to enter the apartment and maybe even change the locks. Then, when I get back, we negotiate about the larger furniture items that we both paid for. 

Can I do this legally? I'm not getting my hopes up because I know this is a tricky area. Thank you.

EDIT: I will give her access to the storage unit so that she can get her stuff when I'm gone."
3e8b44,1,2015-07-22,"[Personal projects] What is considered better - a few small projects, or one large project?",CS_noob_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3e8b44/personal_projects_what_is_considered_better_a_few/,"Going into the 2nd year of a CS programme and looking to get an internship in Summer 2016. Currently I'm at the stage where I'm struggling to make my CV more than half a page long, but starting in August I will have time to build some personal projects before the internship application process starts and school begins (that's 2 months time).

I have a whole bunch of ideas for things I want to make, the problem is the 2 months time limit. If I were to try and build all of these things in that time span, I would not be able to develop any of them to a nice polished state. Alternatively I could limit myself to one project and go ham at it for the full two months. The question is - which approach do I choose?

The way I see it is doing many projects will give me greater breadth of knowledge. My projects could be narrowed down into three categories - android apps (experience with Java &amp; design patterns), websites (webdev experience) and electronics stuff with arduino (lower level systems programming). It will also help in filling out that blank space on the CV so as to not look completely incompetent. The drawback is that considering my current skill level and the time limit, I doubt I'd be able to any of these projects really nice and polished.

Doing one project also has its merits. As I said, I could probably make the project quite nice and polished in this amount of time, which means it's more presentable and there is more to talk about during an interview. It could also be argued that developing what is essentially a complete product is more impressive than a bunch of random little coding curiosities, because it more closely mimics what you're actually doing at a real job. The negatives of this (the way I see it) is that first of all it limits my abilities in interviewing. What I mean is if I get an interview for some kind of more systems based lower level work (which could happen since I plan to apply to as many places as I possibly can), I doubt I'd be able to impress them by talking about my wondrous android app. A similar thing could happen if I were to focus on a systems project and get an interview for an app developer position. I know that at this stage it's more about showing that you're interested, but let's agree that having something relevant to talk about is a plus. Another drawback is that since I am just starting, I have a hard time predicting how an idea might end up. For example I might choose some app idea to focus on, work on it for 1-3 weeks and realize the idea was crap, or that it's actually way more complicated than I envisioned, or find out that someone has already done it much better than I could ever do etc. So I've kind of lost that time, and the probability that I'll end up with a nice polished product by October starts to diminish. Last drawback is that one project only takes one space in a CV, and while I could try and add a bunch of bullet points to it, but from what I've read on the resume critique posts around here, that is not advisable.

So, what is your advice? Should I go for breadth or depth? Or should I just get started on something and make up my mind as I go?"

The work I'm going to be given deals with HTML but I've been told coding assignments are also possible since I'll be working from home. There was no posting for this work and I wasn't told it would be an internship either. I have personal connections with the manager so there are no concerns about legitimacy.

If I do work for this company and mention my work in my resume I don't want to say it was an internship if it doesn't classify as one or if it would be lying to an employer. Should I go on to work for the company and label it as an internship? I'm willing to take any experience with a company in my field, especially since I'm a rising sophomore.

Economics major, Chinese and Computer Science minors. I'm going through Chandan Sengupta's VBA/Excel financial modeling book right now, and also a MOOC on using Excel and R for financial modeling. I'm taking the business school's official Excel course in the spring, so I hope to be passably proficient by the time summer rolls around. If there's one thing I've learned lurking on this subreddit, it's that Excel is incredibly important. For the past two summers I've been interning with a state senator who can give me a great recommendation. I have been studying Mandarin for the last six years, and earlier this summer I spent a month in SW China, which is how I realized that I want to work there after I graduate.

**Interests:** Equity research, debt capital markets, whatever will get me into finance in China

**My question(s):** I have seen all sorts of advice on how to network and use your contacts, but I have no clue on where to even start with China.

Should I try getting a good US-based internship for the upcoming summer after junior year, and then  use that experience to transfer to China later? Would it be better to look for an internship in China this summer? Where should I start looking for contacts in China? I don't see a lot of references to American banks interns' going to China.

Also, my mandarin is only at the intermediate level, and I don't know any finance-related terms whatsoever. I have thought about working as an English teacher in China to boost my fluency, but I don't know if it would be better to try and get an internship with my current language skills or wait until I have a better knowledge of industry terms.

What do you think my best move would be?"

A little backstory: I graduated from the U of MN in 2013 and accepted a job a few months later in a field I wasn't in love with (but it was the most grown-up job offer at the time). I left after roughly 9 months and spent the next 5 months unemployed and (for the most part) actively searching. I accepted a job in the legal realm and while it is not entirely soul crushing, I just cannot see myself working there much longer. I've worked there for roughly 6 months (3 months as an intern and 3 as a full-time employee) and as it turns out, I'm not that interested in the legal world. I still have 3 months left of probation before I become an official employee and lately I've been wondering if it would be best to make a transition elsewhere before everything becomes official. I don't want to come off at flighty or unreliable but I also do not want to get sucked into a job that I will hate for the rest of my life. Here's where your lovely advice comes in and if you could provide insight into even a few of my concerns I would be forever grateful! 

* On an application or even in an interview, how would I answer the questions about why I want to leave? 

* What do I say when a prospective employer asks if they can contact my current employer? 

* Does it reflect poorly on me that I'm looking for a job after only being employed a short time, especially since I was unemployed for so long? (I should say, prior to my unemployment I had a very stable work history and spent multiple years at my jobs)

* How should I (or do I) bring up my departure at my current job to my coworkers? I will obviously give a two weeks notice but I am worried about springing it on them suddenly. 

I think those are my major concerns at the moment. So like I said, I would appreciate any insight into these topics! Thanks in advance!"

3eafaf,1,2015-07-23,Should I Leave My Internship?,Darth_Drogo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3eafaf/should_i_leave_my_internship/,"So I got the opportunity of a lifetime in May: interning for three months over the summer in a natural paradise. This is the type of program that other students (and other people in general) keep telling me sounds amazing. However, I didn't really want the position. I already had a part-time job for the summer that I was doing online (my research assistantship that is paying for my education in the fall and spring and also employing me in the summer) and I didn't want to go add a full-time job onto that. I had only applied for the position because I have been applying to every position that I could for the last year (I was hoping for a different position, but was employing a shotgun approach to internship hunting). But I decided to take the position since if I refused it; I worried that I would regret that decision.

After some paperwork issues my arrival was delayed a month so the program is now 2 months. As soon as I arrived though I didn't think that this place seemed for me. I was under the impression that things in the community would be different. I probably should have thought deeper about it because it makes sense that the community outside of a natural park would not be in the best shape (like the trailer parks I have seen outside of Yellowstone). I just thought that this was a touristy area and so that wouldn't be a problem. I have been in third world fishing villages before and I didn’t like it then either. I thought this would be a tourist place and would be different. I tried to give the place a chance, but after being here 3 weeks I still am having trouble sleeping, I keep encountering bugs everywhere (and not just ants, but large bugs, and even geckos, in all my stuff), I can't eat anything due to what I was told not to eat while here and the diet in this country (the venn diagram of what I was told I could eat, and what the places here serve is fried fish), no one will speak English to me (I was told that people would be speaking english. This was important because I don’t speak Spanish. I don't have a problem with people speaking spanish, but it's very frustrating to go through weeks without understanding a word that people are saying), there aren't really any activities to do here except go to a beach, I’ve had bad personal experiences (so not getting sick. I haven’t gotten sick yet thankfully) at some restaurants (the only places that I can go), the internet here (so I can do stuff online and perform my part-time job) doesn't work outside of the office (which is only open 9-4 monday-thursday, and 9-1 on friday), and there are a myriad of other little things.

To make matters worse, there is absolutely no reason that I need to be here. I am doing all my work on the computer (just using Excel, R, and willow), and since I can't communicate with people I try to only email people (so I can use the translate feature on email).

I asked people back home if I should ask to come home (I have an unpaid position but am receiving a daily stipend for food. I would return the money for the stipend if I left), but they said I should only come home if it is interfering with my part-time job. Before I accepted the position I had asked my part-time employer about leaving for this internship and how it might affect my work (I was hoping for a way to not take the internship). He said that if I was unable to work over the summer, it was not a big deal and I could just catch up when I got home. Therefore, this internship is technically not affecting my work so I can't leave for that reason.

This internship is also not a set-date one (as evidenced by it going from a 2 month internship to a 3 month very easily just because of a bureaucratic issue), it just requires me to complete a project (which I could do anywhere). I also was recently reviewing my contract with the internship organization and it goes to great pains and lengths to describe within it how neither party (so neither me nor the organization) have any obligations.
     This whole experience is very frustrating that I am basically giving up the one time of the year that I get to go home in order to do something that I don't need to be here to do, and am not enjoying.

I asked some people back home about offering to leave early to the program and they said that I should tell the internship program how I feel and talk with them about it. I would, but I worry that they would be offended. I am basically saying that I would rather work for free from home than spend any more time where they live (since they live in the area). That seems like it would be offensive to them. It would also probably strike them as odd because this is technically an unpaid position (less the travel costs they paid, the stipend, and free housing they provide); I suspect their whole appeal to getting people to work here is their location, which I am saying I am sick of.

I've been tired of this place for weeks now and each day I am unhappy (especially on the one day this weekend where I got lost and ended up briefly being attacked by a dog (luckily I was wearing long pants and the owner was near enough to get the dog to leave me alone)). All-in-all it just seems illogical to stay here when I could work from home and be in a place that makes me happy, but I don't want to potentially burn any bridges (I am not planning on working at this company or another like it, but who knows how word gets around) or be a quitter.


So after a very long story, I was hoping for some advice.

What should I do? Should I talk to the internship coordinator?

Should I make up an excuse that would require me to go home but would not affect me working on the project from home (I've had a lot of time to think about this and I thought that if I really got desperate a faked sprained ankle could work for that purpose)? This idea seems crazy, but I don't know what to do and each time I have a bad experience somewhere I get desperate.

Should I just suck it up and stay for the next 6 weeks?
Is there some other option that I’m not considering?

3eaftu,126,2015-07-23,I had 2 internships this summer. Last week my boss from one internship told me I was doing really well and offered me a full time position. Today I got fired from my other internship for underperforming.,CEE-ESS-Throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3eaftu/i_had_2_internships_this_summer_last_week_my_boss/,"This is more of a story and not really a question. I hope it's ok.

This summer I ended up working 2 internships. Long story short: I got desperate about finding an internship and took an unpaid one at a very early stage startup. A week later, a well-established company offered me an internship that pays pretty well. 

So at company A (the paying one), I work a typical 9-5 and at company B (the not-paying one), I would work from home and meet with one of the founders 3 times a week. 

At company A, the environment is really laid back. My bosses are cool and I enjoy the work I do. 

At company B, it was a much smaller team, which I typically like. However, I really disliked the person I reported to. Unclear deadlines, unclear instructions, etc. Every time I came home from company B, I would complain for ~30 min to my roommate about this guy. Not only that, but I really disliked the work I did. Although it was very simple, I just couldn't bring myself to do it in time. Working at home also contributed to me being very distracted. Understandably so, the guy I reported to got mad at me, but he never told me. Finally today, we had a pretty big argument and he told me to not come back for the few remaining weeks. Although I'm glad that I don't work there anymore, I wish it ended differently and I'm pretty disappointed about my performance.

Ironically, last week, one of the higher ups at company A told me he got great feedback about me and offered me a full-time position which I declined since I still have a few years of school left. 

It's crazy how much a good working environment will contribute to getting work done. Although company A is really laid back, I'm way more productive. Another factor that contributed was the compensation, or lack thereof. Sometimes, it's really hard to convince yourself to do work for a guy you hate when you're not being paid. 

However, paid or not, I still should have gotten the work on time if I said I would so I'm kind of mad at myself for that. 

I guess I just wanted to write this since I can't get it off my mind. I didn't like the job but it still sucks getting fired. 

Thanks for reading.

Quick question: should I still put my internship at company B on my CV? It lasted 3 months. If I do, what do I say if an interviewer asks me for references?

3eag9c,4,2015-07-23,"I'm interested in the program, but I have some questions about it and CS as a whole, and would love some input.",sfe_dog,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/3eag9c/im_interested_in_the_program_but_i_have_some/,"I think it's pertinent to begin with some background. I'm currently working for a health science advising firm as an entry-level assistant consultant. I have a B.S. in Biology and Environmental Science, which I received in December of 2014 (GPA was like 3.6/4.0, and I’ve had calc and some other minor math and tech stuff before). I've only been in the workforce for a few months, but when I was job searching early this year, and over the past few months, I have had some time to reflect on what I want out of a career and the path I want to take with my life, and have found that I strongly do not think I belong in the field I'm in, or the life sciences as a whole.  

Don’t get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed what I studied in undergrad, and worked several internships that I thought were alright. But when I really tried to find related work, I realized that a lot of the careers I was eligible for weren’t really how I imagined them being, in terms of both day-to-day work and long-term career options. I’ve spoken with a number of working professionals since then who have given me positive pitches, but their negative criticisms have more or less strengthened my previous suspicions.

I’ve been thinking for a while that a tech career like software engineering or might be a better fit for me, both in terms of day-to-day tolerance and overall fulfillment. I only know a little about programming but I feel like it excites me more overall, and a career where I can hands-on build and edit things that matter in real-time is something I think I want to shoot for. Plus, I wouldn’t be above doing stuff with networks or security either. I’m learning Python right now from places like Coursera, Codeacademy, etc., and so far I like it a lot, but I feel like it probably barely scratches the surface, so I shouldn’t take that at face value, probably.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Getting to the main point, I have a few questions about the program and maybe CS as a whole.

•	First, I noticed the program doesn’t really have a lot of math where a lot of other CS degrees require linear algebra, stats, a year or two of calc, differential equations, etc. Is that going to be a problem? Or do employers really not focus on that kind of stuff if you have solid programming knowledge and expertise? 

•	Second, from an employment perspective, is it a bad idea to get a second bachelor’s versus a master’s degree? I’ve heard bad things about heading back for another bachelor’s level degree, but I’ve also heard that it really doesn’t matter nearly as much in the tech world. I’ve been looking at the online MSCS from University of Illinois at Springfield (http://csc.uis.edu/academics/grad.html) which I think, all things said and done (extensive pre-reqs), it would actually be a bit cheaper than the BSCS from OSU; however, it would probably take me a year or so longer to complete than OSU’s, since I won’t be paying for any of this stuff unless I can keep my full-time job and take classes part-time. However, I’m fairly confident I’d be accepted to OSU easily, whereas UIS could quite possibly deny me entry based on my lack of education or experience in the field, even though it isn’t required.
 
•	Third, on that note, does OSU provide any financial aid opportunities or am I boned in that regard? I read in another post to apply for FAFSA, but I’m fairly positive I wouldn’t qualify for much if anything at all (I personally make a low salary, but my family makes enough money that they didn’t offer much of anything during my first undergrad).  So, any little bit helps, of course.

•	Fourth, is it a good idea to try and do this program part-time along the 2-year track? What’s the relative course load like, if you know?

I think those are the most surficial of the concerns I have at this point. Thanks for any and all feedback, I really, truly appreciate it.

TL;DR: Does the lack of math courses in this program set its graduates at a disadvantage in the job market? Would I be better suited to go for a master’s degree (MSCS or related) if it’s ultimately slightly cheaper or even would take me longer to do part-time with extensive pre-reqs? Any financial aid options available to students in this program? Bad idea to do it part-time with a fairly demanding full-time job, or doable? 

EDIT: Formatting and, also, I'd love to hear anyone's experience, thoughts, doubts, triumphs, etc. with this program and switching careers to CS/tech in general, if you're willing to share.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Can you share any of the difficulties and challenges (cultural, environmental, construction, etc.\) of working on the Shanghai project? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcgbnm?context=5)|Sure.  Language was a big one.  We had to design in millimeters, which most of us weren't used to.  Also, we shipped all the construction drawings to China to have them translated and sent back.  But as anyone who has worked on an architectural project before knows, nothing is ever done changing, so there were endless revisions to this.  Environmentally the soil was not great for building and so there was a LOT of additional thought that went into that.  The availability of landscape material that met Disney standards was huge.  They traveled ALL over China buying up nursery material, trying to find what they needed.  Also there are a lot of different engineering practices that created difficulties between the construction drawings and the way the Chinese were used to building things.
[Can you elaborate more on the way Chinese built things as opposed to the normal way ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctd9zoc?context=5)|The one thing that comes to mind is that they wanted to use a spread footing for everything, which is unusual for the US.  Consider a lightpole in a parking lot.  You can usually see the cylindrical concrete footer sticking out of the ground.  The footer is probably 12"" diameter x 3' deep, allowing room for plants, etc. around it.  Well in China they wanted to use a spread footing which means that the footing may have been under the soil but it would be maybe 12"" thick and a 3' x 3' platform.  It creates lots of conflicts with wiring, landscape, etc. as you can imagine.
[Can you describe how an attraction gets pitched, built, and tested? It seems like a very expensive R&amp;D process.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc76hi?context=5)|Once a project is thought up by an executive somewhere it enters what Disney calls ""blue sky"" which is essentially the brainstorming or conceptual phase of the project, maybe it gets scrapped here, maybe they find a direction and move forward.  Then a team of architects, engineers, modelers, set designers, etc. will be assembled to begin planning the ""land"".  Think Tomorrowland, several buildings, rides, open spaces, restaurants, menus, everything that goes into it.  Architects design buildings, open space s are designed along with theming and set pieces, just like a normal architecture project.  Things move forward over the course of a year or two until construction begins, then another year or two of construction depending on the size.
[Have you ever read Devil in the White City? It sounds like the process is similar to planning a Worlds Fair, except without all the dead bodies in local hotel(s\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc95is?context=5)|I have, great book!  Especially for architecture nerds.
[Do the architects and engineers also work on the blue sky process? Or is that a separate group of people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcd7ow?context=5)|Some of both.  Key people from different departments will be in during the beginning of the project and then as the project fills out, they will continue to bring more people on.  
[How would someone apply for this job?  What are some skills/qualifications they're looking for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc8dmg?context=5)|Here are the three ways I know to become an Imagineer.
 |There is an internship program that is popular and some people get pulled up from that to become actual employees.  [Link to disneyimaginations.com](https://disneyimaginations.com/internships/)
 |Work at a design firm (engineer, landscape architect, architect) that regularly does work with Disney and you might have the chance to work on a Disney project whether its at your office or at the Imagineering offices.  This is how I was able to work for Disney a few times.
 |Apply/Network.  This is a little tougher, but it happens.  I also know some people who worked on the same project as me from a temp agency. 
[What was the most outrageous idea that was presented while you were there that was actually implemented?  Was the end result anything like the original idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc84sk?context=5)|Honestly the engineering for the castle its self is pretty incredible.  There are multiple stories underground, tunnels connecting to other areas and a ride, its also the largest castle disney has ever built.  Also, when architects design buildings on unstable ground they have to sink ""piles"" into the ground similar to the way you might think of a dock in a lake.  Well the castle has 100+ piles that go over 100' into the ground, its an incredible piece of engineering.
 |[Link to www.insidethemagic.net](http://www.insidethemagic.net/2014/04/closer-look-at-enchanted-storybook-castle-with-ride-restaurant-shows-in-biggest-ever-theme-park-castle-for-shanghai-disneyland/)
[I want to start my own theme park. What should I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctckr67?context=5)|HAH!  Best question.  Well, acquiring any type of IP is going to be prohibitively expensive.  You're not going to make a DC comics land or a anime land.  I think your best bet is to have no theme at all and purchase old rusty rides that have been decommissioned from other parks, repaint and profit.
 |Option 2: Only use properties that aren't licensed like Fan-fic or Shakespeare.
 |Option 3:  Buy a bunch of land NEAR Disney Shanghai and build a knockoff park and set your entry fees to have of Disney.  It's China after all.  Profit.
[What designs did Disney specifically look for in the landscape architecture? Was it symbolic of something or was it just another regular design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctd2w4t?context=5)|Some of it was regular design and necessary.  Everything was extremely detailed though, because it would later be art directed in the field by one of the art directors, as opposed to a contractor.  So every panel of fencing and railing was designed by hand, if you had a piece that was going to be a little short, you designed that too, rather than just let the contactor cut it.  We even drew moss on the rockwork in CAD so that it followed the intent.
[Is upper management good to you as an employee or are you constantly pushed to be creative in a way that is similar to rushing art? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc8x5g?context=5)|Honestly they are great to work for.  Things you might be expected to design or figure out in a normal architecture office in a day, you might have a week at Disney.  They move slowly and think things through to make sure its really the best and most creative design it can be.  They build things to be there for 60 years.  If you're working for a developer they just want to make a profit and get out, so its a different mind set.
[Not sure if I'm gonna word this clearly...  What is your favorite Disney property (Mickey, Star Wars, Frozen, etc.\)? And were you able to work on projects related to it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc97dy?context=5)|Standard answer Star Wars or Marvel.  Unfortunately no, but it was great to get to be a part of a park that will make thousands of people and kids smile and have a good time.  Its incredible just to be part of the tradition.  No matter what part you play everyone has a deep respect for the brand and what the parks have meant to so many over the years, its a great environment.
[While working on the fantasy castle in Shanghai, how was it like fitting cultural elements into it? For example are the designs more Asian as mostly the Chinese are visiting this Disney park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctca9jv?context=5)|The tagline is ""Authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese""
 |So they really tried to make it authentic and not some offensive, cheesey version of China that would offend.  There are a LOT of Chinese people that worked on the project.  Here is an article about some of that. [Link to www.latimes.com](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-shanghai-20150715-story.html#page=1)
[When working on the Shanghai project what were some demographic related decisions that were made that may have been different if the attraction was considered for a park in another part of the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc9s6f?context=5)|Great question!  Yes, smoking is much more prevalent in China than in the US and so there was some planning for that.  Also the typical family that might visit would be 2 parents, 2 grandparents and 1 child.  Compared to a typical American family which might be 2 parents and 2.5 children.  Also, some thought was put into how they sell tickets because of this: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXaxGB9CBcE)
[So what were the changes for the greater adult skewing of guests? Different rides, more benches? How did you handle queuing as China doesn't really have a tradition of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctciwrw?context=5)|Much larger smoking areas that they don't have in the US, I think the lines remained the same.  I remember hearing an interesting stat that they expect 40% of the park to be in a line at any point in time, in fact if they weren't in line the park wouldn't really work because its almost like human storage, so that everyone else has room to move.  Definitely more benches and more ash receptacles.
[Wow, that sounds like an awesome gig! Can you give us a specific example of a project you worked on? Also, is there a certain project that you always wish you could have been a part of? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctc7pfq?context=5)|I worked on the Shanghai Disney Resort.  Mostly on the fantasy castle and fantasyland.  [Link to micechat.com](http://micechat.com/forums/shanghai-disneyland/198854-themed-mock-ups-looking-good.html)

 |I would love to work on the rumored Star Wars land!
[What design inside the Disney scheme do you admire the most? And what about outside of Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcd4e4?context=5)|Honestly I love the new entry to California Adventure since they redesigned it, its gorgeous.  Pirates of the Caribbean speaks for itself as a great ride because it consistently has a long line.  Outside of Disney I'm a big art deco fan or Santiago Calatrava.
[Who was the GC/Construction group for these projects? Is it like a top 10 ENR design-build firm like DPR or a local company?  Did you get to work on-site at Shanghai?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcanap?context=5)|I don't remember at the time.  There were stipulations that most of the construction companies had to be Chinese locals, which is pretty typical in a project like this.  Unfortunately I didn't get to go to Shanghai.  I think about 200 families relocated for 2 and a half years.
[What are the secret tunnels like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcg5qv?context=5)|I wish I knew.  I just know they exist and are built in so that staff can get from their car to their shift without having to cross a bunch of customers dressed like something that may not fit in the land they need to walk through.
[What do you do when not imagineering? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcgovt?context=5)|Now I work in the film industry, no longer for WDI.
[How long do you have left to live before Disney's special forces team busts your door down and shoots you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3e7i0z/iwasan_imagineer_amaa/ctcbg7m?context=5)|Hopefully I haven't given away any trade secrets, I'm trying to respect my NDA and link to information that is already out there.  That being said I'm actually typing from Disney Studios right now (different branch).  So they shouldn't have any trouble finding me.

3eayev,2,2015-07-23,Train Tracks,ceebee6,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3eayev/train_tracks/,"This happened to me a few years ago when I was 20 and in college.  While some of the details have become blurry with time, I still shudder when I think about it.  I haven’t told this to anyone, but I figured I’d post it here since no one knows my reddit account.  Sorry for the length.

I went to college in a small town.  Overall it was a peaceful community and I always felt very safe.  It was definitely a college town, though--while there were plenty of people around and things to do during most of the year, it was a bit too quiet in summer.  Most students would go home for the summer or have internships somewhere else, but I always stayed to do summer classes so I could finish my degree faster.  Those of us who stayed didn’t have much entertainment, so of course we’d party a lot.  

I was out with my friends Susie and Trisha at a house party that summer.  We were all underage, but of course no one really cared and there were plenty of other underage drinkers.  The house was a ways past the furthest edge of town and a bit remote which made it the perfect place to have parties.  We’d been there a few times before because the older guy Trisha had a crush on lived there and would invite her, and it was always a blast.  

This time though things got a bit out of hand.  We had all been drinking quite a bit as the evening wore on and were dancing when we heard shouting from out front.  We ran outside to see what was happening and saw a few guys fighting in the front yard.  It was dark out and hard to see exactly what was happening, but I could tell they were hitting each other pretty hard, and people started getting loud.  I was standing off to one side of the circle formed around the guys fighting, when someone cried out, “Police!  Police are coming!”  Everyone started grabbing their shit and running and jostling me as they pushed past.

I looked around me and, in the chaos, Trisha and Susie weren’t there.  I then noticed them running with Trisha’s guy towards his car.  Susie looked around and shouted out for me, but neither of them saw me, and they got into the car and pulled away just as police lights started flashing down the road.  

I wasn’t quite in my right mind at the time, but I sure as hell didn’t want to get caught, so I turned and ran towards the back of the property.  I didn’t have my purse with me, and there was no way in hell I was going back for it then.  I figured that I could just walk home--it was probably a half hour to forty minute walk tops.  

Now, running along the far edge of town are railroad tracks that trains use a few times a week.  The house we were at bordered these tracks, and if you followed them east they eventually curved around and went through the center of town.  I knew that if I followed the railroad tracks I could find my way to town and then back to my apartment.  I’d have to wake up my roommate to let me in, and she’d be pissed, but she’d get over it.

I quickly found the tracks and started walking east.  The tracks loomed over me, situated high up on a hill.  I was reassured by this, because they were impossible to miss so it’d be hard to get lost.  The night was dark and I could barely make out the trees to my right waving their branches in the slight breeze.  The leaves rustled and my feet crunched along the rocks at the bottom of the hill, making me aware of how silent it was.  All I could hear were crickets and cicadas sounding in the night.

I must have been walking for about ten minutes, crunching along my path in the blackness, when I first heard it--a sound coming from the other side of the train tracks.  It was soft and I couldn’t quite make it out.  I strained my eyes, but I couldn’t see over the top of the hill to the other side.  I paused where I was and listened closely, but I didn’t hear anything else.  After a few minutes, thinking I had imagined it, I started walking again.

*Crunch, crunch, crunch.*  My feet made their way closer to home with every step.  I started thinking about how angry I was at Susie and Trisha for leaving me, when I heard it again-- a soft, scattering sound like a bag of marbles being emptied.  I stood still, confused as to what I had heard, when I heard another noise, softly:  *Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

“Hello?” I tentatively asked, my voice coming out shakily.  The noise stopped.

Listening for a few more minutes I didn’t hear anything else and, figuring it was just an animal, I started on my way again.

By this time it was getting quite late out, and I started to hurry.  As I picked up my pace along the loose rocks, I heard it again from the opposite side of the hill: *Crunch, crunch, crunch. Crunch, crunch, crunch.*  This time the noise seemed to be a bit closer.  

I froze, and called out, “Who’s there?  Whoever it is, I’ve got my phone with me and I’m going to call the police!”

No response.  Silence.  Then: *Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

The sound was coming towards me, and I realized what I unconsciously knew all along-- the noise I was hearing was footsteps.  

I pivoted and started walking rapidly along my side of the hill.  *Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.*  The pace sped up faster and faster, matching my own.  Pretty soon I was in a jog.

*Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

Every step reverberated distinctly in the still night.  I would have thought I was imaging it but for the fact the sound rang clear in the beats between my feet hitting the ground.  The air pressed heavily with humidity and fear.

*Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

The night around me started to get brighter, almost as if the sun were rising.  It took me a moment to realize that I was seeing the distant lights of the town.  Relief flooded me, because I knew that if I could get there and get to someone’s door, then I would be safe from whomever was stalking me.  I turned towards the tracks--and stopped cold.  

Illuminated by the faint light, I saw a strange silhouette perched on the train tracks.  The figure was tall--impossibly tall.  Its limbs hung long and low and its fingers were twisted and long, like an exaggerated pianist.  Its shoulders heaved with heavy breath.  With the swiftness and grace of a deer, it rotated--and started coming down the the side of the hill.  *My* side of the hill.

I ran.  

The noise of the footsteps raced behind me, louder with every passing moment-- *Crunchcrunchcrunchcrunch!*

Frantically, I pressed on.  The lights of the town came closer, but they were still too far.  The shadow behind me was gaining.

*CrunchcrunchCRUNCH!*

I felt my adrenaline start to drain and my pace started slowing.  Every breath was fire and my legs burned like someone had stuck them with a thousand needles.

*Snap!*  I went sprawling over a broken tree branch lying in my path.  My hands hit gravel.  My body tensed, waiting for attack.

Silence.

I unclenched my eyes and forced myself to look behind me, expecting to see the face of my stalker peering down at me through the darkness.  

There was nothing there.

I jumped to my feet, and pushed myself faster towards the town when the sound rang out once again in the night: *Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!*  I tensed, but realized the footsteps were just my own.

Eventually I made it to the nearest row of houses that signaled the start of town.  I rotated and gazed back at the blackness from where I had come.  The horizon was empty, but the feeling of something watching pressed on me.  The feeling didn’t leave until I was surrounded by streetlights.

I did make it back to my apartment, and when my roommate let me in and she saw my appearance she immediately asked me what happened.  I told her about Susie and Trisha leaving me at the party, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell her about the figure following me at the train tracks.  I haven’t been able to bring myself to speak of it to anyone until now, even though I think of it often.

There are just some things that never leave you."
3ec013,1,2015-07-23,Chances for top schools? Not sure how I should improve ECs.,[deleted],chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/3ec013/chances_for_top_schools_not_sure_how_i_should/,"Hello, I'm a rising senior, and a Korean male international student living in Asia. Due to pressures from everyone I am currently trying to aim for top colleges in the US or UK, but I feel that my extracurriculars are my weakest aspect (can I compete with other top-level students?) Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated.

**Intended major:** I'm currently aiming for a Computer Science major (or a Game Design and Development major, although I feel that is narrowing my scope too much).

**SAT I:** 2390 - 800 CR, 790 MA, 800 WR

**SAT II:** 800 Maths II, 800 Chemistry, 760 Chinese with Listening. Need to take Physics in October.

**GPA:** 3.94 unweighted, school does unweighted only.

**AP:** 5 Chemistry, 5 Calculus BC (5 AB subscore), 5 Computer Science A, 5 English Language and Composition, 5 Macroeconomics, 5 Microeconomics. Waiting for Chinese Language and Culture (late-testing.) Doing Statistics, Physics C (E/M &amp; Mechanics), and Gov next year.

**School related ECs:** 

* School Digital Organization (digital service both inside and outside of school, initiative of new technology in school, and regulating the digital presence of the school), 3rd year, president role.

* Programming club, 3rd year, creating programs for school or personal use, teaching programming to the student body.

* Amnesty International (service through various means), 4th year, leader role.

* Community service, both locally (Red Cross) and abroad

* Forensics Speaking, 4th year, went on two international competitions, awarded finalist on one

* Band program, 4th year, went on two competitions, gold on both.

* Starting a Quiz Bowl Club this year, leader role, hosting competitions and emphasis on tutoring other students (there are no quiz bowl competitions in this region for some reason, we hope to kickstart that.)

**Non-school related ECs:**

* Self-programming on interest (games, websites, etc.) 

* Creating &amp; managing websites for personal use and non-profit organizations

* Participation in Robocode Competition

* Summer internship at a game development company, learning both game-specific software and the game-development process

* Taekwondo, 3rd Dan, went on two international competitions as national representative, scored gold on both

* Participation in math-modelling competition, awarded highest award

(Unfortunately, there is no ""AP Scholar"" or ""NMSQT"" because I'm not a US citizen. Not sure how important those are, though.)

**Schools:** I'm aiming for a school with a good engineering / computer science program. Top schools within that requirement would include Stanford, Caltech, MIT, Cambridge, UC Berkeley, CMU, etc. but I'm not sure which schools I can realistically be a solid applicant in (given ECs.) Other school ideas are welcome.

Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated.

**Intended major:** I'm currently aiming for a Computer Science major (or perhaps a Game Design and Development major; although I feel that is narrowing my scope too much, it is nonetheless my passion.)

**SAT I:** 2390 - 800 CR, 790 MA, 800 WR

**SAT II:** 800 Maths II, 800 Chemistry, 760 Chinese with Listening. Need to take Physics in October.

**GPA:** 3.94 unweighted, school does unweighted only.

**AP:** 5 Chemistry, 5 Calculus BC (5 AB subscore), 5 Computer Science A, 5 English Language and Composition, 5 Macroeconomics, 5 Microeconomics. Waiting for Chinese Language and Culture (late-testing.) Doing Statistics, Physics C (E/M &amp; Mechanics), and Gov next year.

**School related ECs:** 

* School Digital Organization (digital service both inside and outside of school, initiative of new technology in school, and regulating the digital presence of the school), 3rd year, president role.

* Programming club, 3rd year, creating programs for school or personal use, teaching programming to the student body.

* Amnesty International (service through various means), 4th year, leader role.

* Community service, both locally (Red Cross) and abroad

* Forensics Speaking, 4th year, went on two international competitions, awarded finalist on one

* Band program, 4th year, went on two competitions, gold on both.

* Starting a Quiz Bowl Club this year, leader role, hosting competitions and emphasis on tutoring other students (there are no quiz bowl competitions in this region for some reason, we hope to kickstart that.)

**Non-school related ECs:**

* Self-programming on interest (games, websites, etc.) 

* Creating &amp; managing websites for personal use and non-profit organizations

* Participation in Robocode Competition

* Summer internship at a game development company, learning both game-specific software and the game-development process

* Taekwondo, 3rd Dan, went on two international competitions as national representative, scored gold on both

* HiMCM (math modelling competition) Outstanding Award

(Unfortunately, there is no ""AP Scholar"" or ""NMSQT"" because I'm not a US citizen. Not sure how important those are, though.)

**Colleges:** I'm aiming for a school with a good engineering / computer science program. Top schools within that requirement would include Caltech, Stanford, MIT, Cambridge, Cornell, UC Berkeley, CMU, etc. but I'm not sure which schools I can realistically be a solid applicant in (given ECs.) I'm all-ears for other school ideas as well.

3ec2kv,0,2015-07-23,Offers from Facebook and Twitter.. not sure if it is right for me?!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ec2kv/offers_from_facebook_and_twitter_not_sure_if_it/,"
Hi All! 

Through some miracle I have managed to get an offer from both Facebook and Twitter for a software engineer role. I also have 2 other offers from smaller start ups which look really cool.

Facebook is where I would like to work the most, however I have been looking at current employees.. and well everyone seems super human! I am guessing it is the same for Twitter.

I have a degree in Computer Science from an unheard of university which only had a single maths module (Discrete maths) but did cover algorithms. I have never studied any physics and only have very basic maths skills. I have 2.5 years development experience and have worked on a few side projects.

Nearly everyone who interviewed me and other devs I found on Linkedin who work at Facebook/Twitter have studied at top US universities, have at least an msc if not a PHD, publications and multiple internships at one of the top 4 companies. I have none of this, I got though the interviews by studying like mad! and just generally working really hard. I love programming, but have never programmed anything that complicated, mainly basic web apps. I am creative and entrepreneurial though and have started up load of small projects. 

I really want to accept one of these offers, but was hoping to hear from others with similar backgrounds. Would someone like me have any change of succeeding at a large company? or would I be better of accepting the offer from a start up?

Would be great to hear form anyone who works at Facebook or Twitter!"

I graduated with a bachelor's in English 8 years ago and I'm finishing up a bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm on my first internship right now. 

I am interested in relocating to Germany once I finish my degree. I've read a little bit about the Blue Card and it seems like this is not nearly as difficult as I thought it was. I've been learning German for about 6 months now but skills are still nowhere close to passable so I'd be limited to positions where English was the working language.

My biggest questions are:

-Will it hurt me that I'll be just getting started as a developer despite being in my early 30s? My work experience throughout my twenties is mostly as an administrative assistant so nothing before my current internship is going to do me much good.

-I'd prefer to have a position lined up before I move. Is this realistic? If I'm just going to be wasting time trying to get an offer before setting the rest in motion 

-My CS degree is an online post-bacc program through Oregon State. It is a fully accredited, legitimate bachelor of science degree and the diploma I receive will be identical to the one on campus students get. Is this potentially going to cause problems?

-Is there any way I can leverage my previous degree in English to my advantage? Is it actually going to hurt me?

I've also considered doing a master's degree in Germany, since I want one anyway and I think it would help with my long term employability, but ideally I'd like to get over there and work for a while first. Would it be odd to be studying for one in my early 30s? I don't think I'd feel terribly out of place in a similar program in the US but I worry that, with lower tuition fees, students over 25 might be a lot rarer in German programs.

Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated. I'm not desperate to get out right away so if there's anything I could do over the next year or two to increase my chances I'm open to it."

I currently work for the IT dept at my university. I make 9.50/hr. Min wage here is somewhere around 7.60. The position is on campus which is very convenient, and it's entry level. I've been working here for ~1 year.

 Although the pay is not the best I spend most of my time doing homework, browsing Reddit, watching videos. Hardly working. It's a really chill place, and it is very flexible with my school schedule. I also really like my managers and co-workers. 

I applied for an IT internship at the beginning of the summer (I know IT is different than software development). The reason I went with an IT internship as oppose to software development is because I didn't have enough programming knowledge/experience at the time.

This was 3 months ago. They originally hired someone else who recently ""fell through"" and want to interview me now, except for a part time position, not as an intern. The company is well known in the Midwest. I won't disclose the name. It has potential for growth. I would gain experience in web development, server/network management, and scripting. 

The downsides are that I'm not sure how much they pay, it's a few miles off campus, the workload will be more strenuous (especially during the school year), and the work environment probably won't be as chill. I'm not sure if I can handle it with my school schedule. I also feel like I'm betraying my managers because they really seem to like me.

I also participate in CodeWars.com quite often. It's basically a website that lets users create programming problems for other users to solve.

I'm a sophomore and plan on attending my school's career fair in the fall. I hope to find an internship for the summer. This will be a career fair specifically for cs/ece/cse/math majors to attend and is hosted by the computer science college/department. I have a few questions just so I can mentally prepare myself before I attend it:



* What should I wear


* How do I interact with the recruiters there. What should i say/ask and what should I expect them to say/ask me? 


* They say career fairs are great for networking. How exactly does one ""network"" in a career fair? 


* I keep hearing people saying that companies give out swag and I have no idea what the fuck they're talking about. What is swag. 


Just to elaborate on the first question some more: I hear some people say to wear a full out suit and tie for career fairs. I personally don't have the money for it but would find a way to get one if necessary. However I came across these pictures from a career fair at my school from 2013 and it didn't look like there was a strict dresscode. I was thinking of wearing khacki's with a button down shirt (no tie) and some dress shoes. Will that work? Here are the pictures: 

[Pic Album](http://imgur.com/a/lUNw9)


Would it be better to just ask my school what to wear or ask them if they know what the companies would prefer me to wear? Idk I just feel so overwhelmed and don't know if I'm worried too much about appearance. And I don't know if they made a harsher dresscode since. I tried to find information online but it seems a specific dresscode isn't specified anywhere. 



Only tech companies will be attending. Like the ones in the pictures in addition to google, hp, etc. "

I'm a junior level Mechanical Engineer at the University of Washington. I just got an internship ( started last Mon.) and I am almost done with my first week. Just wanted to share the experience and tell you about what I did so far.

So, I was pretty aggressive about getting an internship, I started applying for internships/jobs online. I went to job fairs, and I also walked in on random companies and handed in a resume. Eventually, I got an internship at a Computer/Electrical company. I did not hesitate when I was offered the job and I immediately said yes despite having no idea what am I going to do over there. After going through all the paper work and drug test, I started on Monday, July 20th. 
The job is basically an office job, I sit for 8 hours a day, just moving data from one Excel file to the other. It is basically copy/pasting. It gets really tiring after a while, but hey, I gotta start somewhere. The people I work with are really nice (they can be a little introverted), most of the engineers in the department are at least 50 years old. And a lot of them (if not all) are out of shape, not a surprise...
This internship will last about 2 months. I know it's earlier to judge but it made me reconsider what I wanted to do for living for the rest of my life. Do I really want to sit +40 hours a week in an office facing 2 screens ? Do I really want to miss out on going outside and enjoying the summer ? Yes it pays well but it does so for a reason.. There's always a catch ;)

Please let me know what you think, if you ever got an internship? if you want to get one ? whatever u wanna do ?

The job is actually pretty nice, I like my supervisor, I get good projects, and make decent money (19/h). Having proven my skills on small assignments I am now entrusted with designing projects from the ground up, which I really enjoy. It's not a major powerhouse in the software world, but it's a well known company for electrical engineering (not a household name). They will almost certainly hire me when I graduate, but that's two years away.
I am concerned that at a certain point this internship will no longer be adding much to my resume. How much do companies value solid years of experience if they are internships? Should I be trying to move on to big-shot software companies even if it's only for summers? I'm going to apply to them anyways because it can't hurt, I'm just looking for insight into what employers find valuable. Thank you.

My boyfriend (of three years) might possibly be getting a job offer in Amsterdam through someone he has connections with over there, and we're seriously considering the move. It would be a hefty salary bump and since we live in downtown Toronto currently, I would like to think the cost of living would be a *little* bit better. Money is the least significant reason behind us moving there though. He wants to travel and I am passionate about learning languages, and Europe is the best place for the both of us.

Now the problem is that all I have is a high school diploma, embarrassingly. I can immigrate with him because we are under a common law marriage, but do I really want to do it? Learning Dutch isn't an issue (it is a perk for me actually). But it's going to take a long time before I get proficient enough to do anything with it. So question number one is: 

1) Without knowing Dutch, is there any kind of job I could get without a degree? What about a legitimate start on a career? Internships?

If there is no way of getting a job, then the only choice is to get my degree. I am not part of the EU as a Canadian citizen, therefore I don't qualify for reduced tuition fees in the Netherlands. Tuition for the University of Amsterdam is around 14k euros a year, and that is not feasible for us. My grades in high school were low 90's, so I wouldn't have a problem getting into most schools (hopefully). So my next question is:

2) As a non-EU citizen, what sort of things could I do, or help I could get, that would make my education affordable in the Netherlands?

I would go for a degree in International Business if I were to go to school. By the end of my degree I would expect some proficiency in Dutch as well. As I said I am passionate about languages and I would actually like to do translation work, but getting my degree would open up opportunities elsewhere if I decided to choose a different career (and let's face it, I definitely will at some point). My final question:

3) Will a degree in International Business actually get me started in a career? What sort of career?

Sorry if the last question is so broad. I'd really appreciate your advice!

I still learn a lot during my daily job, which I've been doing for about 2 years. But I feel like my learning is being done in a bubble. I don't really have anyone to bounce ideas off of or talk through issues with.

Another gripe is a common one: I can't really take more than 1 or 2 days off at a time (honestly it's just stressful taking 2 days off). I lose vacation time at the end of the year guaranteed. Oh yeah, I wouldn't mind making more money either. 

I feel I could easily get ""stuck"" in this position, and it could be hard to break out of. I think working alone like this will make it difficult to get a job in a ""team"" environment, which is one of my goals. Ideally I could surround myself with seasoned pros who I could learn a lot from. Even more ideally, I would be able to focus on one area of IT, instead of having to know a little about a lot. 

So you've read this far and, like me, don't know the point yet. I suppose I'd like to know if anyone has been in this position? Did you get out? Got any pointers?

Missing a semester complicates quite a bit in terms of scheduling (will push my graduation back by at least a semester). Also, I have been saving up to move out to the city my University is located, so of course not being able to work for 4 months is problamatic. 

Everything involving the trip is covered (flights, room and board,etc...), so theres that. There are apparently a few excersions planned into the internship (sight seeing type things) but mostly I would be working 9-5, Monday-Friday, then would have to follow the house rules/schedule of my host family. Although, they say that we're encouraged to explore the communities we're in (but swiming, hiking, biking, driving, drinking, and a bunch of other stuff are all not allowed according to my contract).
The only communication I would have with my family and SO (of 1 year) is through a team cellphone or by heading to the nearest internet café with my phone. Also worth noting there would be one other intern with me, though not living in the same host family, and we would be working with different youth activist organizations on a variety of projects for youth in and around the community. Oh, and I speak no spanish. 

And I have to decide any day now (found out a couple weeks ago out of the blue that this was a possibility), then will have to be ready to leave either August 15th or August 29th (not decided). If the 15th, I miss out on about 3 weeks of my pay (as my work contract is until the 28), which is actually quite a lot.

I know its a great oppurtunity, but I'm just not sure if its whats best for me at this time. I feel like I should be more excited than I am before I commit to something so extreme for four months. I keep telling myself how great of an oppurtunity it is (will look great on a cv, good for grad school, free travel, life experience, etc...) and feeling like this is some kind of ""character defining moment"", which is adding a lot of pressure...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

I started programming a couple years ago and majoring in CS at school. Basically everything I've ever done is OOP. 

I've gone off and taught myself new tools to try to make things more interesting. The farthest I've gone is doing a GUI project that was just a couple thousand lines long to organize everything school related for me (assignments, grades, etc.). I hated the GUI stuff and don't want anything to do with front-end ever again. I am really organized in real life and for a good while OOP was very satisfying, since everything was so organized and easily maintained.

Well come to now and I go insane because I feel like I just do the same thing over and over and over again when I do something OOP related. I've spent the last 2 months reading CLRS and T&amp;K and those are super interesting so far, so I started implementing a lot of the data structures and algorithms as generic C++ templates (read: basically implementing STL).

It still bothers me because I feel like I'm not doing a real project, and every time I try to start one, I quickly realize it's a super simple OOP system with getters and setters and all that crap.

I look at ""project ideas"" online and they're all basically the same thing. I think the main thing holding me back is I hate doing front-end stuff, so I don't want to do a lot of the more advanced projects people recommend like games and stuff. I really enjoy the analytical, back-end, ""mathy"", data-related, etc. kind of stuff, but I don't know where to go from here. I just love sitting down, putting on headphones, and going to town for hours on stuff that requires a lot of programming and thinking.

I've been contemplating starting to learn Haskell in the last month of my summer to spice things up, but I'm also really trying to focus on the algorithms and data structures stuff since I haven't taken courses on them yet and I want an internship for next summer.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm hoping all the details will help me find someone who was in a similar situation and found their way out. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!


P.S. If it helps, my main (favorite) languages are C++, Python, C, and Java, in that order."

3ehq42,30,2015-07-24,DigiPen: The Game School I Went To,Allen_Chou,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3ehq42/digipen_the_game_school_i_went_to/,"[Original Blog Post](http://allenchou.net/2015/07/digipen-the-game-school-i-went-to/)  
  
Disclaimer: This post is all about my personal experience with DigiPen and is in no way intended to represent anyone else's experience or opinions.  
  
I went to [DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://www.digipen.edu/) to learn how to make games in 2011, and graduated last year (2014). I graduated one year earlier than my fellow classmates in the same year, because I transferred in some credits I had already earned at my [previous college in Taiwan](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html).  
  
I have written one post about my life at DigiPen every year on a [game design forum in Taiwan](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/GameDesign/index.html). Also, many of my DigiPen friends just graduated and have started their jobs in the game industry. So I thought, why not write a dedicated post about my experience at DigiPen in English on my blog?  
  
  
**Finding &amp; Choosing DigiPen**  
  
When I was almost done with my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at my first college in Taiwan, I blindly followed what most of my other peers did: looking for a master's program in the US to advance further in academia. As I was combing through the overwhelming amount of resources on the internet over a few days, an idea deep in my mind struck me: I chose a program in Electrical Engineering because it had always been my dream to make games, and Electrical Engineering was the closest I could get in Taiwan (next to Computer Science). So why on earth was I blindly searching for a path confined within academia, just because everyone else was doing the same thing? After four years of college, I numbed my senses and got lost a little, forgetting my original dream. Hadn't I played the [Jak &amp; Daxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter) trilogy and made [Naughty Dog](http://www.naughtydog.com/) my dream company in high school? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!  
  
So I threw away all my research on master's programs, and simply started Googling ""game school"". Several results turned up, and DigiPen was among them. I did some research and comparison on different curriculums and programs. As I learned about the vast number of various game-related courses there were, I became more and more convinced that a 2-year master's program would not be long enough for what I wanted to learn. I ultimately chose DigiPen, which provides several 4-year undergrad programs, a learning environment exclusively for making games, and a large number of students in each year, which is a big enough pool to look for people to form a game team.  
  
This wasn't an easy decision to share with my parents. One stereotype about Chinese parents is unfortunately true: many Chinese parents expect successful academic progression from their kids, so they encourage - sometimes even force - kids to pursue higher degrees in academia. As far as I know, going for a second bachelor's degree after already having earned one was unheard of in my circle. Fortunately for me, my parents are very reasonable people. After confirming with me for probably the fifth time that I was determined to do this, they finally said: ""If going to this game school is really what you want, then you have our full support."" And I am forever grateful for their generous support.  
  
  
**DigiPen Is A Very Hard School**  
  
I will never forget the opening speech given by DigiPen's president, Mr. [Claude Comair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Comair), at the orientation.  
  
""Look to your left. Look to your right. You won't be seeing at least one of the people you just saw when you graduate...or not.""  
  
This, as I learned later, is a very true statement, and he says it every year! Learning to make games at DigiPen is much more demanding than many people think. A quarter of freshmen can't finish the first semester every year, and only about half of the students graduate on time; it's worth mentioning, though, that some students choose to drop out because they have accepted job offers before finishing school.  
    
Students are expected to attend classes and finish assignments just like regular college students do. However, on top of that, students need to use their own free time to work on game projects with a team. There are two game projects in the freshman year (one per semester), and one game project per year after that. Students can opt to intern at game companies instead of participating in student game projects in the final year.  
  
Based on my experience, the things you learn from school, only account for 20% of the basic knowledge you need in the industry. What about the other 80%? You learn by forming study groups, conducting personal research and projects, attending club lectures, going to workshops, and last but not least, meeting with peers and professors. I learned about [game physics](http://allenchou.net/game-physics-series/) and [game engine architecture](https://www.youtube.com/user/GameEngineArchitects) mostly through club lectures and research with peers.  
  
    
**Various Programs at DigiPen**  
  
When I started at DigiPen, there were 5 major undergrad programs, listed below. DigiPen has since added several new programs, including two sound &amp; music programs for games.  
  
 * **Bachelor of Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation (RTIS)** - This is basically a standard Computer Science program, plus extra courses focusing on game technology. The name of the program was changed during my sophomore year to Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation, shortened BSCSRTIS, which is still quite a mouthful.  
 * **Bachelor of Science in Game Design (BSGD)** - Game design techniques, focusing more on the technical side of game design, e.g. scripting, gameplay programming.  
 * **Bachelor of Art in Game Design (BAGD)** - Similar to BSGD, but focusing more on the art side of game design, e.g. level design.  
 * **Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)** - As the name suggests, game arts.  
 * **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE)** - Electrical engineering. Hardware stuff.  
  
I was an RTIS student, so I have a better understanding of the RTIS program.  
  
  
**Environment**  
  
DigiPen is a 3-story building. On the first floor, there's a cafeteria, some classrooms, including several bigger lecture halls, and a library (although not very large) full of books about making games (programming, art, game design, game history, you name it). You can also borrow games and various gaming hardwares from the library (for research purposes of course). On the second and third floors, there are more classrooms and the most important space of the school: the open lab.  
  
The open lab consists of a big open space with tables and hundreds of computers. Students can use these computers to work on their assignments and game projects. Most game teams would stake out team spaces and use them throughout a game project cycle. In my first two years at DigiPen, I went to school at 9 in the morning and left around 11 at night almost every day. When I wasn't in a class, I would be sitting in my team space, working on assignments, game projects, or conducting research. Good times.  
  
  
**Game Projects**  
  
Game projects account for special ""game credits"". Throughout each project cycle, students have real milestones (Engine Proof, Prototype, First Playable, Alpha, Beta, and Gold), just like the industry. Upon each milestone, DigiPen's game professors gather and sit through milestone presentations by every single team, usually non-stop throughout a couple days. Presentations are scored, and projects are also rated based on completion of Technical Certification Requirements (TCRs) and Design Certification Requirements (DCRs), all based on common industry standards.  
  
These are very solid practices for presentation skills. During my first milestone presentation, I was so nervous that I sweated and trembled ridiculously. During my last presentation, not to brag, I was as calm as a pro.  
  
We also learned to scope our games, as well as making the hard decision of cutting features before milestones.  
  
In order to let students get a better taste of the industry, students are allowed to jump from one team to another; on the other hand, teams can hire or fire students. Students also have the option to go solo. If the game professors decide that a student has spent too much time without a team or a solo project, they can fail the student for game credits. A game team can also fail game credits if their game ends up incomplete.  
  
A typical student game team consists of programmers from the RTIS program, a couple game designers from the BSGD or BAGD programs, some artists from the BFA program, and a producer. Producers have weekly meetings with game professors to learn production skills and discuss progress on the game projects.  
  
Game teams can schedule a ""team-on-one"" with one of the game professors. A team-on-one is a 4-hour session with a professor, where everyone sits down, eats snacks, and talks about the game project casually. This is sort of like a reality check for the game project and a good chance to fix communication problems within the team, utilizing various team exercises. After every session, I always felt like my mind had been refreshed and my motivation rebooted.  
  
  
**Clubs**  
  
Unlike ordinary colleges, most of the clubs at DigiPen are either about playing games or making games: Board Game Club, Shooting Game Club, Fighting Game Club, Game Graphics Club, Game Physics Club, Game Engine Architecture Club, etc.  
  
Among them is a special club called the Playtesting Club. They hold playtesting sessions twice a week in the afternoon, setting up games on the computers in the open lab. Game teams can participate by putting up their games and let other students play. Playtesting sessions are valuable time spent in getting precious feedback on your game from fellow classmates. By the way, you can get a voucher for a free entree from the cafeteria if you playtest three games. Why wouldn't you participate?  
  
  
**Integration with Industry**  
  
DigiPen has a very tight relationship with the game industry. Many of the faculty are industry veterans; some are still in the industry and teaching at DigiPen part-time.  
  
Spring breaks and fall breaks are always aligned with the [Game Developer Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) (GDC) and the [Electronic Entertainment Expo](https://www.e3expo.com/) (E3), so students and faculty are free to attend these important industry events.  
  
I cannot stress enough the importance of attending GDC. You can make professional connections there, and it is a great place for job hunting. My current job at Naughty Dog would not have been possible had I not [run into Naughty Dog's recruiter at GDC](http://allenchou.net/2014/02/joining-naughty-dogs-kennel/) in 2013. I also write down some GDC social tips; if you're interested, you can check them out [here](http://allenchou.net/2013/03/meeting-people-at-gdc-2013/) and [here](http://allenchou.net/2015/01/gdc-social-tips/).  
  
  
**Career First**  
  
If there’s one thing at DigiPen that is more important than preparing students for the industry, it is putting them into the industry. This is a general consensus among faculty. A student’s opportunity to break into the industry takes top priority.  
  
For instance, my on-site interview with Naughty Dog coincided with a midterm. My professor thought the interview was much more important than her midterm, so she let me go to the interview and take the midterm another day without penalty. I also missed some other classes that day, and all professors were totally fine with it.  
  
  
**Career Services Center**  
  
In my opinion, the Career Services Center is one of the best resources DigiPen provides.  
  
You can schedule a meeting with a dedicated professional at the center. During the meeting, you can discuss how to write your resume, design your website and business cards, practice interviews, and so much more. I went to over 20 meetings before I finalized my resume, personal website, and business cards.  
  
When I had my [phone interviews with Naughty Dog](http://allenchou.net/2014/02/joining-naughty-dogs-kennel/), they kindly let me borrow a meeting room. They also helped me draft a very professional-looking turn-down letter to a Microsoft offer I received.  
  
Almost every week, the Career Services Center would invite a game company over to the school's biggest lecture hall for a ""company day"". They would talk about the company and what they look for in job applicants. Sometimes, companies even hold interviews right on-campus!  
  
The school holds various workshops, some designed for current events. For instance, most DigiPen students are quite shy; in one of my years at DigiPen, a few weeks before GDC, where people get socialized and make connections with people from the industry, they invited some people from the industry and held a miniature mixer to let students practice having conversations with professional game developers. Every now and then, they also hold workshops focusing on self-presentation, helping students understand how to appear more professional with their social skills, resumes, websites, business cards. I really learned a lot of great tips from these workshops, including how to tailor resumes to specific companies, and what to look out during interviews.  
  
I recently learned that the school has started officially offering [classes dedicated to professional communication](https://www.digipen.edu/coursecatalog/?c=SG#COM150) taught by [Sonia Michaels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soniagmichaels), including everything from resumes to business cards to professional networking and, of course, conference behavior.  
  
The Career Services Center is also responsible for DigiPen's annual career fair, which is famous for being quite different from regular colleges. Instead of having students walking around company booths, students set up booths and recruiters walk around to hunt for prospective hires. It is not uncommon for a student to end up with multiple job offers after the career fair.  
  
The placement rate of the RTIS program in the past four years ranges from 84% to 90%, i.e. at least 8 out of 10 RTIS students graduated with a job offer already in hand in the past four years.  
  
  
**The End**  
  
These are the things I have to say about DigiPen off the top of my head.  
  
I'll end with a list of my friends from DigiPen, most of whom recently graduated and got jobs, in case you would like to follow them. Of course, I have their consent to share this information.

Need advice please,Foxeslovesboxes,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ehvq3/trying_to_switch_careers_from_financial_industry/,"I'm a late 20s female finishing up a degree in Public Affairs and Policy studies. I have 3 more classes to complete and I will be doing them online. I have always found PR, especially crisis management, extremely interesting and I would like to make a switch in my career. Recent events have put me in a position to explore this option.


For the last 6 years, I have been working in a financial institution. I've held different positions including a management position. For the last couple of months, I have been on a leave of absence to finish up some bigger classes and move to another city for personal reasons. I now live one of the biggest cities in Canada. This is great for the career path I would like to take but job hunting has become discouraging and I am terrified that I will remain in the financial industry.


My issue: all jobs are requiring 3-5 years of experience. I am looking into doing an internship but I am terrified I won't get a decent one since my GPA isn't outstanding and I feel like my resume is lacking experience with PA/PR things. It's pretty much all financial experience. Also the majority of internships for PR are geared more for 'fashion' PR or event management. I am not looking into getting into that branch of PR. I'd like a more 'serious' career and have no interest in becoming a stereotypical PR Girl. A saving grace of mine is that I am bilingual and this is a major leg up in my new city.


Things that people have told me to help me switch careers:

1)Networking : Great! Let's do it! I love talking! But how on Earth do you start networking in a brand new city? 

2) Get on Twitter : I am on twitter....this has not helped my situation. 

3) Connect with people on Linkedin that work for companies you want to work for: does this really work? Should I be adding random people in the hopes they like my Linkedin profile?

4) Find a mentor: I would love a mentor but finding one is easier said than done. I know no one in this field. 

5) Volunteer: The majority of volunteering posting I've seen are asking for office work help or needing you for your car. 


**My question:** What can I do to start spear heading my career in the direction I would like it to go?

Any advice would be helpful!

3ei1s1,10,2015-07-24,Experience - All the Different Kinds,curiouscat321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ei1s1/experience_all_the_different_kinds/,"I've seen a lot of misconceptions on this sub about professional experience and I've seen a lot of great people try to fix those misconceptions. This is my attempt. 

In most fields, professional experience is the absolute best resume booster you could ever have. Plenty of news articles talk about the importance of jobs in college(1). For many college students, you need some kind of professional experience. Many people take unpaid internships just to get that experience.

Computer Science jobs are completely different. There's so many different ways to gain experience. Not professional experience, just experience. You could build a project, contribute to open source, blog, write StackOverflow answers, etc, etc. You can also get an internship, which many students.

Not all experience is equal. An internship is just one of many avenues to getting experience. If you can only find a crappy, unpaid internship with boring work, don't take it! Even though it's ""professional experience,"" it is in no way better than working on open source or your own project.

There's a reason that people on this sub, including myself, don't like unpaid internships. The company only values you as much as you're getting paid. If you're not valued, you're not getting assistance and you're probably not doing important work. Why not contribute to the community where smart people are willing to mentor you for free?

3eifgn,4,2015-07-24,Some real interview advice needed: Dead scared of CS interviews.,jackdorner1983,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3eifgn/some_real_interview_advice_needed_dead_scared_of/,"I understand that this may come off as a generic interview preparation advice question, but hear me out.

I study at one of the top-4 CS (MIT/CMU/Berkeley/Caltech) schools in the US and have taken up most of the challenging systems coursework that my school has to offer. Not so many courses in algorithms and CS theory (actually, pretty much none at all, apart from the basic data structures course). I am proficient in C and picking up Java solely for the purpose of interviewing. I graduate this year and plan to interview in the next couple of months when my school career fair kicks off.

I am absolutely terrified of interviewing. Interviews for internships were nightmarish because I never seem to get the ideas to solve the questions or think out loud when the interviewer is in front of me/breathing over the phone. Even if I do get the initial idea right, coding it up without bugs or taking care of all edge cases is like a lucky strike - I barely ever get it right. I just scrapped through with my current internship interview just because the interviewer asked me a few simple questions related to systems.

I have never shied away from major projects at school and have been good at them, although the design and implementation is a very cyclic process (get a rough idea designed and coded, fix bugs, change/optimize it later) which takes time. As a result, I guess I have unfortunately 'trained' myself to be bad at thinking in pressure situations like interviews or in terms of algorithms (systems courses mostly don't need a lot of hardcore ones).

* How do I train myself to be better at giving interviews? I am aiming for top companies like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, etc..
* How do I keep my cool during these interviews? How do I gain confidence and lose my self-doubt?
* How do I 'get' the answers to the questions right the first time? I am talking about the idea and the coding/implementation as well.
* What books, resources and timeline of action would you suggest since I plan to interview soon (~2 months)? Would 'Cracking the Coding Interview' alone suffice?
* How did your interview preparation go? And most importantly - **what worked the most for you** in cracking your interviews? Some people are so natural at it and I am at a loss to understand if I am doing something drastically wrong.

I would really appreciate it if you had *any* advice about this. I am quite lost and any step in the right direction would make a huge impact for me. Any personal/first-hand experiences would help a lot !

No good fits in my office.",csadviceplease,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ej2xy/i_recently_started_my_first_job_as_new_grad_my/,"Hey so this may get long and will probably be venting more than anything. TLDR at bottom.

I interned at a remote office of a large tech company last summer. At the end of the internship they made me a return offer and I gladly accepted as it was well above market for my city and I learned a lot. A few months ago I find out I'll be joining a team that got split off from the team I was on last year. After starting I find out that they split mostly due to team member politics.

I started about 6 weeks ago, everything's good, I like the feature, a bit more front end heavy then I'd like but not too bad. I should mention that the team is small, 2 other devs and me plus managers who are at HQ. One dev (my mentor) is in my office and the other one works from home. 1.5 weeks ago, I find out that both my team members are leaving my team after this release which is over in a few weeks. Management and execs freaks out, can't have a new grad be a solo team :D It's decided that my team's feature is being put into maintenance mode and the team is evaporating. I pity the sole that get's assigned ownership of our feature.

My mentor and an old team member from the internship urge me to find a different team in our office, otherwise I'll be a lone wolf in the office on a team based out of a different office. Tell me to do it behind my manager's back. Meet with manager for regular meeting. Ask him what's up, what to do, what to expect, etc. Tries to gloss over it at first, is mostly concerned about getting features/bugs out for release. Eventually after pushing him for conclusions, he assures me many times that I still have a job and he caves and recommends I reach out to other teams in my office so I'm not a lonely team member. Yay! Don't need to go behind his back.

The problem I have now is most teams in my office are heavily UI focused, which I have little desire for and slightly less experience with. There are a few other teams less UI focused but they don't have budget for new members. With the help of my mentor and old teammate, I've reached out to a couple teams and have set up some meetings with developers and managers about switching to their teams but I don't feel confident about any of them.

One of the managers asked for my resume so I started updating it and realized this is ridiculous. I might as well start applying to other companies if they want me to apply for a job again...

Should I reach out to my college recruiter for suggestions? HR? Anyways, I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this other than some outside opinions. I've talked to my mentor extensively about it all and he's been great. To be honest, I don't really even blame anyone for this shitty situation it's just an unfortunate place to be. It's added stress on top of starting a new job and release deadline coming up.

**TLDR:** New grad recently joined large tech company at remote office. The other 2 devs, on my team are leaving said team. I need new team. Other teams in my office that are looking for bodies aren't great fits. What to do?"

I am very eager to get an internship because I feel that there are a lot of things that I'm not being taught from my classes that I'll need to know when I begin to code professionally. I am also a bit anxious that I will have a hard time finding a job if I graduate without an internship or two to prove that I have some experience. 

To be honest I have not been spending any time working on personal projects or contributing to open source projects, but that is going to change. I was wondering if there is anything in specific I can be working on? Right now I am planning to play around with making some simple games in java. 

Is there some kind of resource that I can reach out to that can be of help? I live a little bit away from Silicon Valley. I am really clueless about the tech world, and I want that to change.

I would really really appreciate any advice and help that I get. Thank you"

I'm currently a Junior at a satellite campus for a top university in the Seattle area. I will be graduating next summer with a BA in Communications and a minor in IT.  
My current work experience is 5 years at a movie theater, 3 of those 5 years as a manager(still on going). I will also be an RA(Resident advisor) for the upcoming school year. Random, but i have a certificate of proficiency in Japanese. it's basic understanding and no where near work proficiency yet.  

Obviously my IT minor isn't going to get me any where too far, so im banking on my 3 years in entry level management to count for something. I've been interested in computers and technology for a while, and I feel like I would be most happy in the IT field or programming(More so IT) maybe in networking or database stuff? (ill be taking a database class in the winter so we'll see if ill be interested). I have been building computers for about 4 years, for my self and my friends. I take care of my home network (No server stuff yet) and other family members. I even do routine upkeep and maintenance of the computers at work.    

I will be talking to a career councilor pretty soon but I thought I would start rolling the ball around here so I can bring in more information during the career counseling.  
There are IT positions at my school for students, but because of my RA job I wont be able to take it. On top of that, with me graduating in the summer im thinking internships are out of the picture. I also plan on (hopefully) creating a team to develop a mobile app for our schools radio station.  

My questions are:  
What certificates should I be looking at to land my first interview/job?  
When should I look at earning these certificates?  
What is Homelab?  
Anything I should be learning specifically?  
  
Thank you! and sorry for the wall of text ._.;;
  
tl;dr: Junior in college going for BA Communications and IT minor. 3 years entry level management experience, going to be an RA. can't take IT job because of RA job. Likes building computers interested in IT. networking/database maybe? or even management. planning on developing mobile app for school radio. Certs: when/what? Homelab?? What should i be doing right now?

My question is, is it possible to negotiate the full time offer, and if so how would i go about doing it. There have been other questions like this on the forums before, but mines a little bit more specific. 

1) Prior to this internship, i was in interviews with some pretty big names , Palantir, and Google (and a few smaller ones). I had passed their initial interviews and coding challenges, but had to turn down further interviewing because of this Microsoft Offer. 
2) a couple of the recruiters have added me on linkedin and asked to reconnect with me towards the end of the internship, however... I don't think its ever possible to interview with them and get an offer in-hand that i can negotiate with because i will most likely get the offer towards the end of my internship (and therefore not have time to interview after the internship).
3) This is an internship to full time offer, can i negotiate at all? if so, what can i base this off if I have no other offers in hand? work performance? manager appraisal? what can I do?

Has anyone been through this with Microsoft, or any other big software company? if no, does anyone have any general advice on this topic?

I scored an 1800, but I think I can do much better as I take it again and be more serious about it. I also think that I will score well on the ACT because I am more of a science student. I take HL Chem, and 2 other sciences. I scored a 6/7 on my IB ITGS exam and a 4/7 on my math exam. I do not love Calc too much. I am ranked 10 out of 350, and my class is extremely competitive.

I want to go into computer science and business. I know 3 programming languages as of now, including python, html, and css. I will be learning about 2 more. I really want to go into programming. I code websites as of now, so that is my business in the summer. Currently, I am developing a social network, to make myself stand out. I am the leader of a small team of coders.

I will be focusing a lot next year, and working on achieving my goals. Can anyone provide me any tips for getting into higher-rep schools and being provided scholarships while doing so? My family is not too well off financially, but I have no problem doing paid internships or even working during college (preferably in a field of my major.) Can someone help me? Thank you!"

""Cloud Point of Sale

This project will include research and practical work to create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Cloud Enabled, Mass Market version of *company name* Enterprise Point of Sale.

The focus of the project will be:

* Assessing compatibility of Java based application on Linux and Android

* Assessing compatibility of peripherals e.g. Printers, Bio-metric Scanners, Proximity etc on Linux and Android

* Performance Testing

* Stability Testing

* Optional ability to code new user interfaces including gestures etc should the successful student have these skillsets.

* Optional ability to code new feature sets required for commercial success of this product.

Mentoring from *company name* Senior Developers and Technical Director will be provided. The project will form the foundation of the next wave of *company name* products.

We have had great success with this program in the past and students have found the projects extremely engaging. Past students have been hired when proving their value and this will be an opportunity should the successful student be a very capable developer.""

I'm just wondering what to expect since I've never really been in Industry before, I did a gaming internship when I was 13 but obviously they didn't expect much of me then. Now that I'm about to graduate things are obviously quite different. What kinds of things should I expect to be doing every day (since 9 hours a day for the rest of the year is a lot of time). Will they likely have a list of things I am to complete each day etc.

3ejvho,3,2015-07-25,Screw you for giving me hope!,Onja_,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3ejvho/screw_you_for_giving_me_hope/,"What's up /r/Rant? Get ready to hear some bitchin'

Last spring I was given an internship from a nice small programming company. I did well there and was given excellent reviews afterwards, also they said they would hire me for this summer. Well fuck me sideways with a cactus they kept promising that they would have work for me but it always went to ""another company"" or ""the client wouldn't respond to emails"".

I had to go back to my old job as a cafeteria/bar worker to do a nightshift. You know, clean the place up after it closes and get it ready for opening and then do the normal stuff cafeteria workers do. But the reaaaally fun thing is: everybody hates everybody there and I basically work my shifts alone. So I have to listen to the bar workers rant about the morning/day workers and vice versa. 
The bar time workers are mostly cool, nice young people who lack some work ethic but other than that they treat me well. But I rarely get to see them because the bar is closed for like an hour after my shift starts. 

But the morning workers are sometimes a pain in my ass. There is this one woman, this real ""go-getter"" type you know? She's always really cheerful and kinda fun at times but talks shit about everybody who works there. Even more if they are young and I'm 22 so I fall under that category. And since I work alone I don't have any real friends to have my back so I wouldn't even know if (and probably when) she talks shit about me behind my back. I've seen how she treats people she says she ""hates"". Her normal self and maybe even a little happier. I would like her if she would for once go through a whole shift without talking shit about other employees. She works overtime constantly so nobody gets to say anything about her.
My bosses also hate each other and I get to be in the middle of this. It has been a bad and very rainy summer so there haven't been many customers and they are both really stressed out.

All the morning shift workers (around 50 y/o all) want to talk about is sex or alcohol. I mean fuck you I don't want to share my personal sex life with everybody, let alone with people who are old enough to be my parents. Also I don't drink that much so if you're hungover at work I feel fucking zero empathy. Get your shit together and lay off the bottle.

For the past two months I have slept like 3 hours a night because I can't sleep that early. My shift starts at 4 am and I just CAN NOT go to sleep at 19.00 no matter how hard I try and how tired I am. I am constantly tired and that makes me edgy. I also DOES NOT HELP that those 50 y/o morning shift workers life to go to sleep as early as possible apparently and are laughing about ""young people problems"" and how I've been ""partying all night"". And if I say any negative comments to that hyper-energetic bitch anyway she's just going to run off to my boss to tell how I don't have the motivation to work there, this is 100% certain.
And the customers, oh the fucking old geezers who throw their funny jokes at me. I'm always baking the pastries for morning and I'm usually covered in flour. ""I'd love to fuck a woman as dirty as you"". Oh fuck off you're old enough to be my grandpa. ""I'd love to lick the sugar off your fingers."" I just want to throw up when I hear these. I've lost my ability to do a genuine smile with this job.

And they put me to the bartender duty, prices for the drinks are listed nowhere and nobody will help me with that. I have 0 experience. I am a fucking programmer. I do not possess a skill to be a bartender and know shit about alcohol just because of my age.
So to wrap this rant up fuck you small, awesome, friendly programming company for giving me hope. If I knew I had no other possibility I'd just be able to suck it up for the money, now I just cry because I can't sleep and this summer never ends. "

I have studied at a university but dropped out in my senior year. I have worked as an intern at several companies, but at only one I have worked as a serious front end developer, which I really enjoyed. 

Now that I'm not studying anymore, I am looking for a junior front end developer job, but with the companies I met up, they were looking for people with more experience of 2+ years or a leading position. There aren't really any companies looking for a junior front end developer or at least I can't find one.

I might have been too nervous during the interview and didn't really communicated that well. I'm a bit of a shy person, but I did show my portfolio and the several websites I have made for diverse clients. And I know HTML/CSS, JQuery and basic Javascript. Nowadays AngularJS is really populaire and more companies are using it. So at the moment I'm learning it.

But still I can't really find a job as a junior front end developer. Could someone tell me how they started as junior front developer?

I have thought about to start as an intern again to gain more experience, but the travelling expenses might be a bit too much. I live in the Netherlands and it cost about €20,- a day to travel to Amsterdam. So if I work 5 days a week it cost €100,- a week, so €400,- a month. I don't know if a company would cover that (and maybe a paid internship) for an intern. 

So what can I do to get a job as a junior front end developer?

I'll start my story of with my motive. So when I was 19 I met a girl from the US and dated her for about 18 months. She was sadly taken from me in a tragic way. This was about 6 months ago and I've recovered from my post break-up(off) depressions and such. But one feeling remains and that was that dream of adventure and going over to the US and maybe moving there or her moving here. The idea of that life is the foundation of all my dreams. I want a life where I didn't stay at one spot for the entirety of it. I want to make another place home too and with the Netherlands being as small as it is it makes it impossible to do within it's borders. Other motives for wanting out are: Political(The Netherlands is too liberal), Economic (*Not getting eaten by taxes*), Purchasing power (*Rediculous VAT'S*), Culture (*the niceness, the non binge drinking culture, etc.*) and many more. 

So now about what I need help with. Currently my plan is as followed. Complete my BSc in logistics in January *(I'll earn good during*). After the BSc I want to try and get an internship in the US(JAN-JUL) to kinda test what it's like, to make sure I didn't over romanticize it. During this internship I'm going to soak up the culture and experience as much as possible. I hope to possibly let this internship flow into a job or possibly find a SO during my stay, which of course can happen (*FYI it's not my goal to use someone, I meant legitimate love)*. If this fails then so be it. This is not my main push to become a resident. 

Upon return in the Netherlands (AUG) I will go into academics and get my Masters degree in Supply chain management, this will take 18 months. Assuming my mind does not change in the meantime nor would have a SO I will then try to attempt to immigrate by finding a job. I will then have the following qualifications: 

- Fluent in German, Dutch and English

- Self taught programmer in 2 languages(*c++ and python*)

- BSc in logistics

- Masters in SCM

- A grand total of 9 months of internships in the Netherlands working as a logistics project employee.

- A 3 month gig as a logistics project manager at a port

- (*Insert american internship*)



 **My questions:**
What's a(*re*) good area(*s*) to find this internship?
What things do i need to take care of to make this internship a succes?
How realistic is me getting a job as a consequence to the internship?
How realistic is me getting a job from my other qualifications after a masters?
What should I be asking myself or you guys too?

To most, it seems like I have everything pretty well figured out. I'm eighteen, two years ahead in University, have a 4.0, and a summer internship at an Asian consulting firm. I hold a top position of student leadership at my college to the point of where I manage a multi-million dollar endowment and determine, as a singular example, whether/which graduate students receive large-figure research grants (with little more than my signature). 


This is why I have a hard time talking to anyone about personal issues faced; I think that life is made up of traditional success and social/personal success, and if I talk about my difficulties with the latter, it jeopardizes the former. Even if I wanted to talk to someone on a professional level (therapy), it would be on my permanent record, and I would not be able to enter the line of work I truly hope to one day. 


Being ahead came at a cost. I was educated in a non-traditional method which, when combined with being an only child, utterly demolished my social skillset. I'm only starting to learn that back now. But the damage is done to the point of where I've permanently missed out on human 'rites of passage' such as 'young love,' the type where you can get out of school at 3PM with no responsibilities and just share a genuine connection with someone you care about (or, at least, you think you do, because y'know, you're in high school). 

So, I'm a bit behind. It's fine, you can't expect to have found 'the one' at eighteen. But that's not what scares me - I truly don't think I'll ever catch up. 


I'm someone who is devastatingly bad at earning the interest of the opposite gender. I'm not a terrible looking guy - I groom myself well, average face (my features would make me a really attractive female, but the Y chromosome fucked me over), average-to-meh body, perfect skin/hair. But I'll never, ever be anyone's 'sexy' - I fit into no niche (unless semi-nerdy white guy with distinctly non-testosterone-driven features counts), and I utterly never have my (admittedly few) advances accepted. Nobody's going to eye me up as that night's hookup, and I've accepted that as just a fact of my life.  

Physically, I'm convinced that I'm really quite unattractive, and feel that even if I were to find someone on a long-term basis, I would feel bad; as if she could do way, way better. But that's thinking a few too many steps ahead.

But that's only the first half of the problem. I can't engage in conversation with people my age, which I blame my upbringing for. I come off as aloof, overly-professional, and pretentious - even in daily conversation (I've had foreigners tell me that I should drink to be less boring, and my staff mentor at University is entirely convinced I'm robotic, if that gives context). Hey, imagine that, a guy has issues talking to girls. But women who have already dated multiple men just will never find me interesting enough in comparison - my 'flirting skillset' is so insanely far behind because I've never had the chance to use it throughout my youth, it's almost a hard discouragement from trying in the first place. I feel more comfortable giving a speech to a thousand than making small talk with one, because I can guarantee how my interpersonal communication will go - poorly. 

The thing is - this is something I need. I know, barring vast circumstance, I'm going to have an upper-middle class life at least, and I will be comfortable. However, I can not go through any sort of life alone - I need someone to share it with, I need someone who actually fucking cares about me instead of just wanting to use me to their personal ends, someone to talk to at the end of a shit day.  And I am entirely convinced that I can not, and will never, find that person - the one thing that, as pathetic as this sounds, I've wanted since I was really young. I will be graduating before I am twenty, and I will be in the 'real world,' alone, when most have been developing relationships over the period of four year's time. For someone who everyone finds robotic (the amount of times my friends have half-jokingly shredded that into me is becoming painful), I really, really need people - and I would trade every single thing I've worked for over the last few years to have that sort of connection.

I don't know why - I've convinced myself that I'm entirely unlovable. I know that doesn't help, but when you see eighteen straight years of evidence in one direction, you don't find much else to go on.

Tonight, I probably would have tried to kill myself - it's something that I've thought about a bit before, but I really do think that my chances of ever being happy are permanently leaving. I can't do it overseas, because it'd complicate things too much for my family, and demolish too much of what I've worked to build for my University. I find myself caring less and less about my life, though - I do really, really stupid things, almost intentionally, with the hope that one dark alleyway is more than it seems, or that my footing will slip pointlessly scaling a rocky cliffside.

In times like this, I might turn to my family, or to standard comforts of home. But I won't see any of that for months more, and I don't think I'll be able to survive that long in this state of mind. 

I'm not sure what I need to hear right now, but I need to hear something. I really appreciate you listening; this really is the only way I can get out how I feel. "

I'm hoping that this is in the correct subreddit, and I apologize in advance if it's not.

 I'm very excited and grateful to be an incoming freshman at UNC. It has always been my dream school and I've loved the campus growing up. Over the summer, I've been struggling with choosing a major. However, in the past month, I think that I've decided to go with Computer Science.

 I've done some research on UNC's program, and it seems that it is well ranked, but not necessarily in the elite tier of programs. US News ranks it (at least the graduate school) at 25th in the country. What I need to know is this: 

*  Will a CS degree at UNC make me competitive in the software development job market? Will I have lots of opportunities, such as internships and interested employers upon graduation?
* Will I be able to competitively pursue an elite level grad school in the CS field? (Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, etc.)



I feel that I should also elaborate on why I am leaning towards Computer Science, so that you guys can get a better idea of my motivations. This part may be a little jumbled and rambly, so if you've gotten all you need to know, feel free to skip this section. This may not be pertinent, but I feel extra information can't hurt. I've always loved computers, I've been building them for about 5 years. My friends and family look to me as a ""tech savvy"" guy. 

All this being said, I have only recently gotten my feet wet in the world of programming. I'm taking a rudimentary course on Ruby, and so far I love it. Again, I am only at the absolute basics. What I'm trying to say is: I'm not 100% sure that programming is the best fit for me, but so far I am really enjoying it.

 I want the best opportunity that I can get coming out of college. One HUGE reason I'm picking CS is because of the freedom that it presents. I have always wanted to work for myself. I relish at the idea of not having to go to a 9-5 job and to be free to my own devices and creativity. My ideal scenario would be to start up a small company (perhaps developing apps or maybe even indie games). If not my own company, I would at least love to work for a company that allows me freedom of movement (both geographically and corporately). I don't strive to be rich, just comfortable enough to enjoy my life. I'm willing to put forth the work, I just need to know if I am approaching this in the right way (going to UNC for Computer Science). 

WOW. This has really turned into a wall of text, and I apologize for that. My mind is pretty scrambled right now, so if anyone needs any clarification please let me know! Thank you guys so much in advance!

3em0n3,2,2015-07-25,Is learning two languages at once as a beginner counterproductive? (Please help me with my goals),cryogenics12,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3em0n3/is_learning_two_languages_at_once_as_a_beginner/,"Hi everybody.

I'm a beginner and still in school. Throughout my program I will be exposed to a smattering of languages but Java is probably the one that is used the most.

I have nothing against Java. It's a fine language. Like any other, it it yet another tool with its own strengths and weaknesses. Java seems like a good choice as there are a good amount of jobs (at least in my area) that want some Java skills. 

My immediate goal is to become proficient enough at one language and perhaps get an internship or junior developer position while I'm finishing up my degree.

With that in mind, I'm very interested in C++. From my perspective at least, it just seems like there are a lot of really fascinating jobs that use C++. Robotics, computer vision, video games, embedded systems, etc. I recognize that there are not as many as these types of jobs and that most will require a significant amount of professional experiences. This is my end goal. I would be ecstatic to have a job like this.

However, I feel like I should focus more on simply getting experience of some kind *regardless* of language before moving on to that. So, I'm thinking in the more short term I should get comfy with Java.

Should I wait before moving on to some C++? Will learning both at the same time be really confusing? 

I've taken about 3 semesters worth of Java including some basic algorithms and data structures so I'm not totally new to it. C++ on the other hand.....

Opinions? Thoughts? Am I making sense?"

Not in the sense that I'm having a hard time with the major, I'm doing fine in classes and everything but I just feel like I don't really *KNOW* anything. Like all the people around me are always working on personal side projects or have internships and things but I don't feel like I know enough to work on any kind of side project and I also don't even know what it is that I don't know that's keeping me from doing anything. Also a lot of internships I see require experience with random things that I don't know about. I tried to join Terrapin Hackers at the beginning of my first semester and went to a few hacktorials but I felt like I was just copying down code and not really learning anything, and I've heard people say that hackathons aren't really that beginner friendly and I don't know anyone that goes to them that I can tag along with.

All I really know is Java(which I haven't touched since 132/high school) and C which I started with in 216 in the most recent semester. How do I go about getting to the point where I know enough to qualify for internships or work on things on my own or just do things outside of classwork in general? It seems like most of the people in my classes are infinitely more experienced than me and have known way more than me since before they even got to UMD. Right now I feel like more of a person that takes CS classes than a ""CS major"", any tips?"

I was never able to take any internships during college, but I was President of an international student organization and took up sales/marketing/operations roles as well. The lack of ""professional"" work experience worries me about my chances for employment.

The company I plan to apply for is still finalizing role openings in the next few weeks. I know that the job interview/selection/assessment process takes even longer (1-2 months based on my past  failed job applications), I planned on taking up an internship with another company first. I'm not so familiar with the selection timeframe for internships but I assume they're far shorter than normal.

I'm worried though that an internship might restrict me from applying to other jobs. Will a company even allow me to take days off for job interviews elsewhere, if I'm just an intern anyway?

My biggest concern is: should I still even bother getting an internship or should I just focus all my efforts on getting a regular job? I know the added experience will help, but I don't want to hurt my chances as well.

P.S. I'm trying to get a sales/marketing position in a tech company if that helps with anything.

Much thanks in advance!"

I'm a software engineer who works for a very-well-known software company. I'm on about $150k (Australian), and I'm about 4 years out from university.

It's an awesome place to work, but I know I'd be happier as master of my own destiny. Working salaried as a developer I very quickly got to a level of income that I feel really lucky to have, but now I'm getting to the point where if I want to continue to grow then I've got to really start something myself. I'm not sure on the best way to go about doing that, though.

I've got a wife and mortgage to match my salary, so I'm a little restricted. Whatever I do needs to be something I can moonlight on for an initial few stressful months so I can build it up before taking the plunge and quitting the day job.

There seems to be a certain risk/reward spectrum that looks like this:

                          | Probability | Potential |
    Job                   | of success  | income    |
    ----------------------+-------------+-----------+
    Salaried developer    | High        | Okay      |
    Freelance/consulting  | Medium      | Good      |
    Small business        | Low         | Great     |
        software company  |             |           |
    Startup               | Minuscule   | Billions  |

Clearly that's oversimplified, but I hope the concept makes sense.

So I'm currently at the safe end of the spectrum, and I'd like to take one or two steps further down. I'm not keen on the startup scene, I'd rather grow a business from seed on the back of its own success.

My problem is that I don't know where to begin. I have lots of ideas but it's very hard to know whether any of them would actually be successful, so I usually end up being pessimistic and discarding them as probably a bad idea. Analysis paralysis. I can't find the intersection between my own skills and what the market needs.

As for myself, I'm currently quite a generalist because that's what my company tries to foster. I feel like while I'm not an internet-famous über developer, I wouldn't be let down by my technical skills and - this awful ramble aside - I have good soft skills too. So I think I could make a good go of whatever I set my hand to. I'm also certainly very privileged with my education and current position.

I'm looking for advice from anyone who has made the leap away from 9-5 corporate work to doing their own thing. How did you decide what to do? How did you start and find clients or customers? Did/how did you manage to juggle your day job and starting a business?

Thanks everyone :) I promise I do hang around here on my main and help answer questions about internships, interviews and recruiting at my company!"

So I'm in California for a summer internship. 20 years old, have the whole city at my fingertips... except that I don't know anyone my own age, can't legally drink, and only have enough cash to cover public transportation and frugal grocery shopping.

My social interaction comes from coworkers (30+) and the slew of awesome international tech developers I live with.


The story begins when I'm getting dinner with my mother's friend (My mother was worried that I never go out and just work all day, and it's not like I'm going to refuse a free meal). I realize that the place is a few blocks away from a donuts shop that a girl from Tinder recommended for their apple fritters. I fucking love apple fritters... 

But after what happened tonight, I don't think I'll be able to eat one ever again. The shop was out, but they gave me a time for a fresh batch. I would return after dinner.

Minor fuckup at dinner: we were seated at the bar and weren't carded for drinks by super cute bartender. Naturally, I mention that I'm not 21 and ask for a glass of water. Dinner was good.



I return to the donuts shop. Fucking delicious. I had to wait an extra 20-30 minutes since they were behind on the fritters, and got something to snack on. By the time they start glazing the fritters, it's about 10pm. Just about the time that social people might be getting ready to go out for a night at the club. Donut maker personally selects the two best fritters, thanks me for my patience. I leave to catch a bus.



It's a pretty long bus ride to get from where I was to the subway station, so I settle in my seat and look at my donuts, waiting for the right moment to strike.

After a few stops, a massive group of tweens--mostly girls--get on the bus. There isn't room for them to sit together without me getting up, so I surrender my seat. One of the girls says ""Oh, you don't have to get up!.""

""No, haha, it's fine. I'm too old for this shit.""

**Wait.**

**These aren't tweens.**

This is a group of 8-10 ridiculously hot girls who are all at least 19, probably heading to a club, and I am going home at 10pm on a Saturday night with a box of steaming apple fritters. Hot Blonde, Hot Brunette, and Hot Black-Hair are sitting where I had just gotten up.

* Blonde: ""We're not that young!""
* Me: ""In my experience, 'not that young' is usually too young.""
* Blonde: ""Guess how old I am.""
* Brunette: ""Yeah, we're not young at all. I bet you can't guess how old we are.""

I'm very good at guessing ages, and get all three of their ages within a month. They ask me how old I am, and tell them I'm 20.

* Brunette: ""You're barely older than us! You aren't too old for anything.""
* Black-hair: ""Yeah, but you look older than that.""

They're all in town for a summer ballet Academy, and are going to some 18+ club that I've never heard of.

* Blonde: ""You should totally come with us!""
* Other girls, in unison: ""Yeah, totally, come!""

Blonde makes eye contact with me and takes a swig from a shooter of some variety of pink alcohol.

**""But what do I do with the donuts?""**

The conversation dies down a bit. We talk about school, where we're all from, one of the girls went to a high school in my home town, they all get excited, I brush it off with some jokes, and wish them a good night as I get off on my stop.



While I wait for my train transfer, it suddenly hits me.

I have an unbeatable job offer at a company in Silicon Valley. I previously worked at this company as an intern, and I love the projects, the people, and the ability to grow and learn there.

My other option is to stay home or close to home, and start my own gig or take-up a job there. Why would anyone ever consider doing this? Let me explain.

Moving across the country and away from everything I've ever loved is very difficult for me. It also means I lose my SO or at the very least a long distance relationship for a while ( which doesn't work ). There are complex reasons based around her certifications that don't make sense for her to move. She has been a life changing person for me, and is truly someone I want to have a future with. For context, we have been seriously dating for almost 2 years. 

On the other side, I feel like I'm throwing away everything I've worked for. I spent my entire childhood, college, and free-time working towards an opportunity like this. I would be throwing away a huge compensation package, and the ability to learn things and meet people that I could never do anywhere else.  When I was at this company as an intern, I had all of these same perks, but I felt so empty not being able to do any of the things I loved growing up. 

The advice that I'm seeking is about how crazy it would be for me to throw away this offer. The reason it scares me is because if it weren't for this girl, I would be on a plane tomorrow. I don't want the relationship to go sour and be kicking myself in the ass in a year or two. My hometown has opportunities for me to do very well, but it's not even on the same scale. 

TL;DR: I don't doubt my ability to be successful in either location. I feel that I've worked my whole life for something and now I'm considering throwing it away over a girl ( whom I truly love ). "

On average, 22 people die in the US each day waiting for organ transplants due to the paucity of donors (organdonors.gov); shortcomings in medicine such as these have given rise to my passion for contributing to the medical field through engineering and technology. The coalescence of chemistry, biology, and engineering principles has led to boundless opportunities for improving healthcare and quality of life; whether through bionic implants, neural interfaces, or artificial organs, biomedical engineering offers the future of medical technology and advancement. In the past five years, I have become endlessly fascinated by the use of biomaterials and automation to increase the efficiency and viability of tissue growth. Due to my ardent desire to contribute to medicine through engineering, I am applying to the Biomedical Engineering graduate program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in order to earn a Masters of Science with an emphasis in Tissue Engineering. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Oregon State University (OSU), obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Chemistry.  At OSU, I studied a broad course load including Mechanical Vibrations, Experimental Techniques in Material Science, and Measurement Systems. For my senior CAPSTONE project I designed, built, and tested the hull of a pendulum wave energy converter. The project required extensive research and application of composite materials in order to attain the necessary structural characteristics and durability for marine environments. In addition, I augmented my engineering coursework with a myriad of life sciences and chemistry courses such as Organic Chemistry, Medical Ethics, and Genetics in order to gain medical knowledge and later apply to biomedical engineering graduate programs.

Furthermore, while at OSU I actively participated in the Mechanical Engineering Honor Society, Pi Tau Sigma, and volunteered in the emergency room at a local hospital. During my junior year, I was elected President of the honor society, as I excel in leadership roles and resource management. As President, I led student and faculty meetings and events, including open houses and award banquets. Along with participating in and leading the honor society, I volunteered in the ER of a local hospital in order to gain exposure to the medical field.  I observed the current state of medical technology to be both impressive and lacking, with areas in need of vast improvement. I found volunteering in medicine to be exciting and enthralling, further substantiating my desire to continue edification within a biomedical engineering graduate program.

Between sophomore and junior years at OSU, I participated in a valuable internship at Intel Corporation, gaining exposure to research and development and finite element analysis. I independently researched the effects of loading on the mechanical and electrical properties of computer processing unit socket contacts, which resulted in a successful correlation between empirical data and model behavior. Additionally, I conducted research on the thermal properties and flow impedance of mobile keyboards, the results of which were used to design the ventilation system and physical chassis of the Intel Ultrabooks. The R&amp;D experience I gained at Intel will prove to be a valuable asset in my future academic research.

Along with having experience from multiple internships, I worked for the last year and a half as a Design Engineer at Valin Corporation. At Valin, I have designed a variety of complex automation systems, hydraulic power circuits, and structural assemblies. I worked on a particularly challenging project involving the research and design of a custom cable winder that utilized rotary encoders, tension control systems, and motion controllers. My expanded knowledge of electromechanical devices and automation will provide me with the tools necessary to design and utilize equipment in academic and industrial research.

I am highly interested in employing my skills in academic research and find the Tissue Engineering research at University of Wisconsin-Madison to be exceptionally interesting. In particular, I find the research conducted by the Ashton Group on the stimulation of pluripotent cells to direct cell differentiation to be extremely fascinating. The development of tissue engineering techniques is, in my opinion, one of the most important and enticing fields of research within medicine. 

After completing the MS program in Biomedical Engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison, I plan to pursue a career in research and development within industry or continue my education to earn a PhD. In either case, my ultimate goal is to develop tissue engineering techniques in order to grow viable organs with efficiency and practicality. Through my education at OSU, internships, and design engineering experience, I have built an excellent foundation of knowledge and tenacity that will prove to be a valuable asset in research at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I strongly believe that my passion for medicine and technology will allow me to make a contribution in a field that ultimately impacts the lives of our global community.

Hey guys. I'm a Computer Science student who's taken two programming classes thus far. They were both in C++. The first one was very, very rudimentary, whereas the second one got a little more advanced. I didn't have a problem with either, but I fear I didn't retain any of the knowledge since the semester ended.

I'm a junior in college, and I definitely won't finish in four years, but I'm still concerned about internships and when is the ideal point in my college career to start applying for them. I definitely feel as if I don't have enough knowledge under my belt, and I haven't done ANY side projects as of yet. I'm taking discrete math next semester and the next programming course in the winter semester, though. I'm just perpetually scared of falling behind and never being able to catch up.

tl;dr:

1) How should I retain knowledge from previous classes? 2) Any REALLY, REALLY, REALLY newbie friendly projects to work on to add to my resume/build experience? 3) Any really good books for a C++ newbie? Discrete math? Algorithms? 4) At what point in my college career should I start applying for internships? I definitely don't know enough to apply this summer."

I'll try to make this as clear as possible, but I'm not in a great headpsace at the moment. I'm a rising senior about to enter my 10th week of a 12-week internship at Microsoft. Due to a variety of factors, including a lack of proper communication between my mentor and me, my poor memory, my inability to learn quickly, and my lax previous semester (I was abroad), I have not been performing well. I've been told that it's not likely I'm going to receive a return offer, which to me is a fate worse than having been rejected by this company in the first place--it feels like they had faith in you as an individual and you let them down. My competence as a software dev, and more importantly, as a problem solver, has really been called into question: my mentor has basically been babysitting me because I'm so incapable of coming up with tasks for myself. Despite the cushy Microsoft perks, the awesome friends I've made here, and the interesting realm of problems I'm dealing with, my recurrent depression, which was last present over a year and a half ago, has now resurfaced. I genuinely fear going to work every day and I'm not sure how I can possible improve myself in these last three weeks while I'm the psychic mess I am right now.

I'd like to make it clear that I'm not some ungrateful bastard. My having gotten this role in the first place was an amazing opportunity, but the feedback I've been getting makes me feel that I cheated my way in somehow (I go to an Ivy League school, I've been on award-winning hackathon teams without having contributed much to the core of the project, etc.). I've voiced my concerns to my manager and his only feedback was that I ""need to give myself more credit."" He, however, has almost no interaction with my project--my mentor has been the one I've been directly dealing with, and once my manager asks him for feedback at the end of the summer the truth is going to come out. Obviously I'm going to try to tough it out but I'm not sure how much progress I can make in these last few weeks. I also don't know how I can possibly advance in my career or even make any sort of progress as a human being if I lack the problem-solving skills or need the amount of oversight that I've needed these past few weeks. I'm thinking that even if I were to receive a return offer, I'd reject it because my incompetence would get discovered somewhere down the line.

Does anyone have any advice? I'll try to respond to comments asking for clarification."

Extremely confused about starting out?,turtleman312,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3eqybc/been_out_of_school_for_years_and_finally_starting/,"Whats going on Reddit? Sorry if I ask some dumbass questions but I really need some help right now y'all. 


A little quick back-story. I’m 22 and live in Colorado. I graduated high school almost 6 years ago. Never attended college until now (I’m starting in august at a community college). I have no IT experience other than doing family, friends and neighborhood computer troubleshooting and some fixes if that counts. I never did any internships or anything like that. 


I want to work in the world of IT and my goal is to become a computer systems administrator then move to IT manager or an IT analyst and keep on progressing and advancing. My problem is I don’t know how in the hell to get there! From what I researched about becoming one of these I need at least masters in computer science. My college/career advisor literally told me “oh a career in IT? Just get a masters in CS and you’re good to go” It can’t be that damn simple? 


What I don’t understand is doesn’t CS focus more on the programming and software side of things? I know that I should be knowledgeable about programming languages but how is that helping me obtain a job as a system admin if it isn’t teaching me the server side and whatnot? Would I be better off taking a course this fall in Computer Information Systems instead of computer science? Would having masters in computer information systems be better for me or is computer science the way to go? Are there any degrees and courses that I should also avoid while in college? I don’t want to waste my time on a run of the mill degree that would get me laughed out of an interview. 


I can only take two classes this semester (the other class I’m thinking of taking is a computer technician course because it said it will help with preparing for certs) and I’m trying to decide between taking the CIS course or CS course. Whichever one I don’t end up taking now I would love to take later on but I want to know with the career I’m planning for would doing one or the other just be a waste of time? 


My other question is about certifications. How do I get a certification? Can I obtain a certification in something without any experience by just studying material? Would you recommend I try to obtain certs now or later after these classes? 


My final question is what should I be doing in my free time to train for a career as a systems admin? Like a programmer would study coding in their spare time to improve their skills. For system admin should I screw around with my own server or something? How would I even get one? Are there any books or resources that you’d recommend I read up on? I can’t just sit on my ass not doing anything I gotta be training for this and evolving everyday for this you know. 


If there are any questions you guys got for me please let me know. Thanks for all your help Reddit.

3eqz3y,2,2015-07-27,Career questions for those ME's out there.,kakakaaka,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3eqz3y/career_questions_for_those_mes_out_there/,"Background: I'm a rising sophomore mechanical engineering student at a school famed for computer science. I know I would want to eventually work and live in SV in California and need help understanding the (low) mechanical engineering market there.



Questions:

What's the difference between mechanical and hardware engineering? Could ME's be hardware engineers? 

What about product design engineering? What's the difference between that and R &amp; D engineering? I heard R&amp;D engineers get a lot of flak-why is this?

What are some companies in the SV that have good internship programs? 

Should I pursue a double major in CS? I do enjoy CS, but the classes are pretty challenging and jobs that incorporate ME and CS are pretty scarce. I'm hesitant that CS would complement my ME background since I would be better off finding a software engineering job. My school also offers a robotics double major, which seems like a good balance. 

How are the technical interview questions for ME's? There's a lot of resources for coding interviews etc but not so much for ME's.

Any help would be much loved :)"
3er1rk,3,2015-07-27,Functioning well at work but not at school,iamcathyy,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3er1rk/functioning_well_at_work_but_not_at_school/,"So I recently just finished a 3 month internship with a software development company. Initially I was terrified of screwing things up because of how badly I messed up my Final Year Project. I could sit down at a table for the whole day and at times I wasn't even able to write a single page. I was stressed day after day thinking about how I'm running out of time, and yet I'm still not doing anything.

Surprisingly, internship went well. When they assigned a project to me I was excited to work on it. I'd write a list of things I need to get done and found so much satisfcation clearing them off one by one. On days when I had quite a bit of work to get done, I'd leave for work early and get started on it first thing in the morning. I guess part of the main difference between schoolwork vs actual work is that actual work has a fixed time dedicated for it. I can't go home, I can't relax, I can't meet my friends, so might as well start working on it right now since I can't do anything else with that time. Work was surprisingly....fun? It kept my brain thinking throughout the day and I felt alive.

So, internship ended and I had to write a report on it. Here's where shit starts happening again. Thursday night, I feel sleepy IMMEDIATELY after dinner. Friday night, still sleepy. Saturday I'm out with my friend. Sunday, sleepy the whole fucking day. Finally I get up about 2am and I spend the next 5 hours doing absolutely nothing before feeling tired and heading back to bed again. It's Monday now. It should've been handed up already, but I've been procrastinating getting started on it the whole day.

Can anyone else identify with my experience?"
3er318,5,2015-07-27,My Journey &amp; What I Learned,preciseman,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3er318/my_journey_what_i_learned/,"Hi Guys -

Long time lurker in this sub, received a lot of quality info and felt like it was time to get back. I felt like it may be beneficial to share my shortened journey and what I learned from it.

I'm a recent grad from a public school in the south, and like many others, had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do when I first arrived at college. I majored in Finance because I liked numbers but absolutely hated engineering. Joined a bunch of clubs on campus, and very quickly learned about how crucial it was to get internships. Started applying for as many internships as I could during 2nd semester freshman year (after I got settled into the college lifestyle) and got absolutely nowhere. Spent almost my entire sophomore year trying to get a internship, when finally a small shop (sub 500 people) decided to take a chance on me. It was a commodities analytics shop (think Bloomberg/Thompson Reuters but for commodities). At this internship, I learned a good amount about the energy business and how commodities were sourced, traded, and consumed. There were actually quite a few people who were ex-energy traders working at this particular shop, who told me about their careers in that particular business. Naturally, I got interested, and tried to get a internship at that industry. Received a few offers that following fall, and decided to join the trading group of a supermajor (think BP, Shell, Chevron).

Holy hell, I absolutely hated that business. It was honestly the worst 10 weeks of my life. I was getting hazed constantly, and I was extremely scared of asking questions. As you can imagine, traders are not the friendliest of people. Every question I had was met with rolled eyes or preceded by ""Well, if you actually took the time to think"" or ""Its actually quite easy if you think about it."" Ended up receiving a full time offer, but declined it swiftly (against the wishes of parents) to pursue something less hostile.

Ended up making the switch over to management consulting after going out for full-time recruiting my senior year.  I have currently been working in consulting for a month and a half, and I absolutely LOVE it! The environment and culture at my shop is absolutely fantastic. I don't feel scared or doubtful asking questions because the person might not have time, and I definitely don't get yelled at for being confused at a specific concept. This is extremely close to a university classroom setting (which I excelled at) and my co-workers are very similar to the best professors that I've had. I've learned that culture and fit is the most important thing in a job. It can make 10 weeks either hell or an amazing experience. So for any rising seniors who didn't like their internship, don't be afraid to look elsewhere!

So what did I learn from in my 4 year experience &amp; what would I recommend someone in college to do?

1) Join a random club (even if it may seem useless &amp; outside of your comfort zone). I joined the powerlifting team my freshman year, and it has given me so many stories to talk about during my interviews. There have been interviews where I literally talked about powerlifting for 30 minutes, and got called back for the second interview, which leaded to a offer.

2) Spend your time evenly between networking and academia, beginning as a freshman. It is extremely easy to play the ""student card"" while networking, and odds are, people will want to help you. Make a linkedin account, add alumni who are in the industry you are interested in, send a personalized message, and follow up for coffee or a phone call. MAKE THE DRIVE/FLIGHT to the city you want to work in! My school was located 2.5 hours drive away from the city, and I made the trip pretty much every weekend down there to meet with alumni which got me my sophomore internship that was intended for juniors. If you start early and develop a relationship, this will allow for your resume to be placed on top of the pile for competitive jobs such as consulting, sales and trading, or investment banking.

3) Focus on fit &amp; culture, not the $$$. Management consulting is a lucrative career, but the potential payout is nowhere as high as a career in trading. I could have stayed in trading and just ""toughed it out,"" but I honestly didn't want to hate going to work every single day. The people you work with are a large part of your overall well being, especially if you work 65+ hours weekly with them, so find a job where you truly fit in.

Hope some of that helped! 4 years of life condensed into one reddit post. Feel free to ask questions below!

Asked if I could use the bathroom in the lobby. They said yes and I found a two stall, one urinal BR. Not the nicest, but not horrible. A sink was running and the first stall looked gross. I picked the second and relieved myself of the BCC from the night before. I felt so much better after that and went on to ace my interview despite the morning of stomach pain.

My girlfriend and I moved into a shared house at the beginning of the summer so she could be close to her summer internship. We shared the house with 3 other people, (I'll use fake names) the landlady Tina, a girl named Susan and Tina's daughter Sara (who is in her late 20s/early 30s and pays rent to live there).

This was a short-term lease (4 months) and we were supposed to be moving out at the end of August. Around June Tina tells us that she will be moving to Hawaii to live with one of her daughter for a year. She tells us we will be fine in our room but there will be some changes, she moved everything out of the house that she owned and left a big mess in the common area. (which has no furniture in it now). She tells us so many different things we have no idea what to believe. At one point she was going to rent out the whole house (except our room), then she was going to let her other daughter and her 5 kids move in, then she was going to kick everyone out except us, then nothing happened until July 5th.

We got a call from her asking to talk to Susan and Sara, who weren't answering their phones (they worked night shifts) so we woke them up and I'm not sure what was said but Tina definitely kicked out Susan and I believe Sara was kicked out too. Susan is pregnant and is struggling to make ends meet. She knew that Tina couldn't legally kick her out with a 24 hour notice but decided it wasn't worth fighting. So the next day I drove her to a halfway house about an hour away. Sara never left, in fact she moved her boyfriend in. Susan came back one day to meet with the ""property manager"" to return her keys and do a walk through but she never showed up and said she forgot, so Susan wasn't able to get home that night and decided to sleep there. She left in the morning.

Thursday, Susan comes back and tells us that Sara was robbed and isn't able to buy food. So Susan was over to make everyone dinner. She made us all dinner and then Susan came into our room and hung out with us until about 11pm when again, she wasn't able to make it home so she slept there. 

Friday morning my girlfriend gets a text from Susan (we are both at work) saying ""Heads up, Tina is home, don't call me"" so we don't know what to think, Tina came back from Hawaii 11 months early completely unannounced, hadn't heard from her in 2 weeks.

We don't hear anything until around 1pm or 2pm when Susan calls my girlfriend and tells her that Tina came home and found her sleeping and beat her up and threw her backpack down the stairs and broke her phone. So she filed a police report for assault and bought a new phone. 

We were worried so we both left work and went home to get valuables and pets and we went to my girlfriend's parents house. Tina was not there. On the way Tina calls and denies everything until she found out we knew the full story. Then she started acting very petty and telling us that she has the right to travel and we need to get out of her business. She started being very rude to us (which was very out of character from former interactions) and we ended the call. About 5 hours later we call back to basically just apologize and let her win so we could live in peace. She wasn't having it.

When we came home last night, she literally ignored us and did not respond when we spoke to her, she just walked away. She has taken everything out of the kitchen (table, chairs, coffee maker, dish towels, pots, pans) and locked them up so we can't use them. 

The way she has acted has made me very uncomfortable in our room. I feel unsafe and I worry about my girlfriend being there, along with our small animals in our room. We are in the process of finding a new place to live for the last couple weeks but I need to figure out how to get out of this house. 

I think it's pretty clear she doesn't want us there but I don't know how money hungry she is and if she'll allow us to leave without paying for rent in August. I'm willing to surrender our security deposit (which was $360, rent is $650 if that matters at all)but I can not afford to pay August rent and find another place to live for a couple weeks. 

Do I have any legal reason to end my lease and move out on Friday? How screwed would I be if we just packed up and left Friday night if she denies us?

I apologize for the novel I wrote but if I can find any legit legal reason to leave, I need to take that opportunity. Thank you.

TL;DR: Landlord moved Hawaii, came back unannounced 11 months early and physically assaulted a pregnant ex-roommate. I need out. 

EDIT:

Not that anyone will read this but after speaking to Tina last night she agreed to let us out of lease early, we gave her paperwork to sign but she's ""reading over it"" and we will hopefully have something in writing before Friday. I do have an audio recording on my phone of the conversation and I have my laptop set up with motion sensor software to make sure she isn't entering our room. "

During this year, I had lend my dad some money from my income ($10000), which was not a big deal because I was living in his house, and he needed the money for this business. He gave me the money soon within the same year. My dads income tax lawyer regarded the $10000 as additional income while filing the taxes for the year.

Later that year when I went back to school and applying for OSAP, I did not add the $10000 to my income because it was not money I had earned. I received the income discrepancy form and was disqualified from taking OSAP for the next five years. I asked my income tax lawyer to redo my taxes but he said that if I did that, my dad's business and I would both be 'randomly checked' for the next 5 years whenever we file our taxes, which would be a major hassle for both of us. I was curious as to the consequences of redoing my income taxes. Does it get you into trouble with the CRA?"

Started when I was a Sophomore and they kept me on throughout college.  Over the last year I took over the job role of an employee that was let go, but remained an intern.  15 minutes ago HR contacted me saying they are going to make an offer and asked me to drop by in 45 minutes.

What should I expect from this conversation?

Here are some things on my mind:

- I don't know what the previous employee was making
- As long as i've been an intern i've been doing half that persons workload.  Over the last year I have taken over that job completely with no help.
- I require no training as I now know the job and company as well as any employee who's been here for a few years
- I am more efficient at this job and people have noticed and commented on that
- As of now I have no college degree ( they know this, and know i will have a CS degree in January)
- Do I deserve the perks of a more seasoned employee ( more vacation time etc.?)  I'm an intern but have been fulfilling a full time job for over a year


Sorry this post is scattered, but I just figured i'd ask for a few tips before walking into this.

So, do you think I should be worried and start getting better with the systems area? I have already started studying a book called ""Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"", and I might even finish it in two months, but that seems like an introduction and being able to answer the system design questions seems to demand a lot more.

I should emphasize that this is a question regarding the fancypants companies - big4 and the like. And yes I am aware it's not the end of the world if I don't get accepted in there and that it's still a good idea to get some experience at a smaller company, but hey, I've got to at least try :)."

3eszft,1,2015-07-27,Stuck on project for internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3eszft/stuck_on_project_for_internship/,"Hey guys,

I'm currently in the second-to-last week of my internship and I've been tasked with a project that involves capturing metrics regarding test passes/failures from a continuous integration tool (Jenkins) and storing them somehow to be preserved historically. This data will then be available for viewing by whoever needs to gauge the metrics (most likely by storing the data in some sort of database and interfacing the data). 

I could get really into the technicalities of the task and what has been a particular blocker, but the bottom-line is that I am extremely overwhelmed by the complexity of it all. It involves me handling a bunch of technologies that I've never even touched or seen before (i.e. Jenkins, authenticating a client, using Restful API, Groovy, Grails, Gradle, MongoDB, dealing with JSON), and whenever I get started on my ""first step"" of learning something, I end up reaching another ""first step"" in something else until the entire project just becomes too complex and hard to conceptualize. There is just no way that I can understand and learn everything this project involves in time (or at least that's what I think). Now this wouldn't be an issue to me if I had some sort of exposure to this before or an active point of contact for help, but my whole internship has been me programming and learning new technologies that I am not interested in / never had an understanding of. This makes it incredibly hard for me to have motivation, because when I'm stuck, I spend almost 3-4 of the next work days on Google, YouTube, and Stackoverflow trying to find a solution. It usually ends up working out, but for this project in particular, I've made no progress even after intensive research. 

My questions for this subreddit are:

1) Am I rightfully overwhelmed? How am I supposed to get through this if I come in to work days on end with the same problems to research? Every resource either seems outdated or doesn't provide enough documentation for me to use.

2) How do I bring this up to management? I've sat down with my manager one time for a check-up on the project and I explained to him that I was at a pretty bad point and didn't understand a lot of the things. He told me that I probably won't be able to get it done given that there is only a week left in the internship, but that I should keep working on it. That's the problem!! I don't want to give this another look, it just stresses me out and ruins my entire day. How much longer must I ""just keep looking at"" my ideas on how to make this project work without an understanding of the involved technologies, and of course, without the time to learn such technologies?? He's pointed me to a couple of people that I can ask for help, but these are just SMART programmers that don't have the EXPERIENCE with the technologies. They would just know the steps to take to achieve the result programmatically, which is already something I've figured out, instead of being able to answer the questions regarding the technologies that I need. There's also a lot of ""play around with it and see what you can achieve"", except... there is no way to ""sandbox"" the environment... Breaking something on the actual project would actually break something...."

I've never been the jealous type before now, but now I really need advice on how to stop being jealous. He has group chats with the three of them and they all sit together at their desks and eat lunch together. They've also been to work functions together that are outside of the office (pool party, etc.). It started out as giving him a hard time about having friends as girls, but it slowly turned into jealousy. I live an hour away for the summer and only get to see him on weekends. Today he brought up to me that he wanted to have a going away party for one of the girls who is leaving the internship early. He wanted to have a party with the three of them and some other interns. He invited me but I am working and can't make it. He then said he didn't want to have it if I couldn't come, but I felt he was only saying that because he didn't want me to get upset. It just makes me uneasy for him to be hanging out with girls and drinking around them. I trust him, but it still makes me uneasy. I can't wait for the internship to be over so he won't be around them everyday. I also mentioned to him that when we're older I'm not sure if we'll be friends with our coworkers, but he responded that he wants to be friends with coworkers and not just hang out with ""me and the kids"" all the time. I just hope that his coworker friends someday will be a group of all guys. His career choice is going to be in computer programming and I'm going to be a nurse.

I have some questions that I've been stressing about lately, if you could please take your time to answer some of them I would be very grateful!

1). I have a 2.8 cumulative GPA because of a rough first semester and transition into college. How bad is this/will it set me back? This semester I'll be taking Calc II and Software Design II so it's definitely not a GPA boosting semester.

2). Internships: Do I try to find one for summer after Sophomore year? Or wait until Junior year? Also what time of the year do you start applying, like January/May?

3). Summer projects: I have 1 month left. I've spent sometime messing around with Swift to learn how to make iOS apps. I created a basic soundboard app, but probably can't upload it to the App Store due to copyright reasons. Is there anyway I can put this app on Github/a portfolio as something to start building up my resume? Otherwise what else can i do with my last month that is productive and will prepare me for my next semester or possible internship?

4). Finally:

I am taking Software Design II next semester, but I am worried whether or not it will be in a different programming language. In SW design I we used Java but I have a different professor for next semester for the 2nd version. On my schools site it says "".....using a modern programming language"" for both classes. Should I email my professor for the fall and just see what language of will be?

I've been undecided on my major, going from Biochemistry to Electrical Engineering, but now that I had some taste of the parts of major, I'm having second thoughts. Here's what I believe I can do:

-Love Math (Finished Calculus 2, thinking about going for Calc 3, and so on)

-Love/hate on Sciences (I like Chemistry way better than Physics: Aced my introductory Chemistry class, currently in Physics with Calculus this summer semester with a grade of B- so far)

-Never taken any introductory engineering classes, but now that I have realized that I don't like physics, engineering might not be for me

-I was a Pharmacy Intern for Kaiser Permanente last summer before my first semester of college; Loved what they do, fascinated about helping people through the language of medicine, BUT pharmacy school will be VERY costly (loans &lt;/3) and saturated job market. 


Right now, I'm thinking of going back to Biochemistry since a couple of my friends and family told me it would fit me perfectly since I had an internship already.

Im not sure if IB is for me as I really do enjoy AM but if theres a way to get Natrual Resources IB without losing my tie to Natural Resources that would be suitable as well.
Long story short- Looking for advice on NatRes AM firms or IB groups that are looking for someone with my background"
3evcyr,1,2015-07-28,Need advice on settling for a job offer or not.,allydaniels,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3evcyr/need_advice_on_settling_for_a_job_offer_or_not/,"I'm about to go through a final interview with a reputable Japanese technology/electronics company tomorrow, and I feel pretty confident about getting an offer for a sales position.

Unfortunately, the job requires a lot of traveling by car, which I don't like (even if the package includes a car).

I happened to contact my dream company and turns out they're opening new roles soon. But it would probably take at least 3-4 months before any talks of offers, with no guarantees whether I get the job obviously.

Now, my problem is whether I take the current job offer or not. If I do, there's a chance I may have to job hop after 3-4 months for another opportunity, which will make look bad.

But if I don't take it, I'd risk being unemployed even longer. But my alternative is to take internships while waiting on the other company to at least build up some experience while waiting.

Should I just take the offer for the sake of having stable income, or take the riskier, more righteous path and turn it down with no guarantee for another possible job?

i am working as a company intern asp.net / c# developer and am cofounder of new web app startup.

Bootstrap is must have, I think.

3ewg3k,2,2015-07-28,Information Systems Management Major | Looking to add extra semester to add a compsci double major. Thoughts?,superman522,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ewg3k/information_systems_management_major_looking_to/,"Hello all, first of all...let me know if I'm in the wrong subreddit and I will quickly delete this and post it in the proper place. I looked for about 20 minutes to make sure I didn't screw this up so I hope I'm right. 

I'm currently going into my senior year fall semester at a school in TN for information systems management/web development. I've done a little bit of coding and taken precalculus and passed fairly easily with a B. Fortunately I will graduate with college without any loans but I may have to add another semester and graduate next December 2016 if I add a computer science degree. I'm already considering just adding another semester anyways because I really want to study abroad in England next spring.

As far as jobs go, I'd really like to get in on the programming side for the first 5 or so years of my career to gain a good knowledge  in programming and then go into more of an entrepreneurial/technology management role possibly get my CISM. What do you think my best option would be as far as classes to take? Should I do the double major in ism/compsci with my web development minor or is it safe to do disregard the compsci major and do a second business major (ism is in the business department in our school) like finance, economics or management and just really crank out some codeacademy/lynda in my free time and pick up an internship to learn how to code? I guess maybe what I'm asking is what does the computer science major offer other than just learning how to code efficiently? 

Also another question to add on, I have some experience in IT (internships etc) but it feels very scattered if that makes sense. I know a little about a lot of subjects. Where and what kind of positions/internships are good to look for to get a solid foundation in IT and beginning programming?

Sorry if this all sounds a bit nooby too...I switched majors last year and it feels like I'm playing catch up in some ways :/ 

Thanks all, I appreciate your help!!"

I have been lurking here for a while now as I plan to attend graduate school for Information Systems Management in the fall. I have seen that many of the people who graduate from my program who end up going into the tech industry after graduation have strong undergraduate CS backgrounds, which is to be expected. I have my undergrad degree in IS also, from a state school. I feel like this puts me at a pretty big disadvantage, particularly when looking for jobs in the Bay Area (my goal). I have been working really hard, especially in the last few months, to prepare myself for the daunting interviews that I know will be coming this winter.

My questions:

*1. Other than the typical things that an engineer would need, such as personal projects and a great working knowledge of data structures and algorithms, what would a wannabe product manager such as myself need to show?

*2. Is my knowledge of DS and algorithms/personal projects that I show expected to be engineer level? 

*3. How will the interview differ from that of a standard technical interview?

*4. If anyone here is a PM, what do you wish you knew/did when you were in my position?

*5. Lastly, if it turns out that I am just not able to get my technical prowess up to snuff in time, how is an internship at a major consulting firm viewed? Will this be a ding? Or can I turn it into a boon as long as my personal projects/technical knowledge continue to improve?

[Who gets to use these book for research if they can't be checked out? Also, I've heard stories where books unavailable for check-out made it into the hands of some researchers who are nice and bring brownies or something to the library workers. Does this ever happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthtsyd?context=5)|We try to debunk the misconception that these books are unacceptable. I was hoping someone would ask this!
 |All someone (anyone!) has to do is come in, sign in, and tell us what they'd like to see. We grab the books and put them in the reading room where they can handle the books, take pictures, basically do whatever they want.
 |We are working on outreach to local high schools and grade schools, and recently had a group of 4th graders flipping through the old Bible that everyone is talking about here. It made me cringe at first too.
 |Some researchers come in more than others, but there isn't any bribing that I know of. We will hold books for certain researchers, but that only makes it easier to find (we put the materials they want on a shelf with their name). We will still take the books out for other people who want to see them.
 |The books are accessible, touchable, photograph-able, and study-able, you just can't take them home with you and leave them on your coffee table to get spilled on.
[What career/educational background led you to your job? (What you are doing is pretty much my dream job as an English undergraduate!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthzpg5?context=5)|I have a Bachelor's in English (: and I am getting a M.Ed in young adult education. I recommend going to your archive at your school and asking for an internship. I started as an unpaid research intern and earned class credit. Now I work full time and get paid a little bit whenever I'm not in school.
[What's the strangest book you've ever gotten to interact with and what made it strange?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthzpg5?context=5)|The strangest book was a handwritten history of the world from one grandmother to her grandchildren. It was handwritten start to finish with almost no erasing and editing. Just a perfect history of the world seemingly from the top of someone's head, painstakingly written down for a target audience of two children. That is strange to me.  We also have a book that is literally a plastic peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a story about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches written on the various parts.
[How do you try to preserve those rare books? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthsqu6?context=5)|We keep the books cool and dry; The Vault is temperature and humidity controlled.
 |Hands must be washed before handling any material to avoid contamination or damage from oils on the skin.
 |Books or other materials that need special homes (as in the case of a broken binding or other similar structural issue) are kept in special acid-free boxes.
 |On the larger scale, the whole notion of having an Archives and Special Collections Rare Books Vault is for the purpose of preservation. We keep these books out of circulation as an act of preservation.
[I know museums and art galleries do this with their various pieces and artifacts, but do rare books vaults exchange/loan their books to other universities or museums for display or research purposes?  How much of a sharing network is there in the rare books world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthy597?context=5)|This is kind of a ""who you know"" issue. For example, we are about to borrow an old Alice in Wonderland book from another school. Since my boss knows their fine arts librarian through networking, it's only a matter of an email and an address.
 |There is a lot of sharing amongst museums. In fact, museums often borrow from libraries. We keep the books in a boring looking shelf space, and they can display them better.
 |Another major part of my job is curating displays, but whenever I need a book for a display, we usually just buy it.
 |With art and museum pieces, they are usually 100% unique. If a library has a 100% unique book, they use it to generate interest in their collection, and likely wouldn't share very often. However, even most rare books have hundreds of copies out there, so buying/borrowing isn't an issue.
[Any experience with books being stolen from the collection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthv9f6?context=5)|There are some books listed as ""missing,"" but they may just be shelved wrong or something like that. In the year that I have been around, there hasn't been any actual theft.
 |The books are kept behind two passcode protected doors, and each employee has a unique passcode, meaning they know who went in the Vault and at what time.
 |The only way to look at the books is in our Reading Room, where backpacks, coats, and other things people could sneak a book out in are prohibited. We ask that people put them in lockers that we provide.
[Which book or books caused the biggest excitement in terms of being acquired or nearly being acquired -- are there rivalries with other book collectors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cti01wx?context=5)|""The bible, the bible the bible."" It was our millionth volume and the most rare book to date.
 |The thing is, record keeping was pretty bad here when the university was founded. Part of my job is to allow myself to get distracted by all the cool books and learn about them as much as possible.
 |I was surprised to discover that the contents of the Vault is essentially unknown. The librarians don't get time to fully explore books. Entry level employees like me are encouraged to take frequent breaks and just peruse the Vault shelves and have fun learning more about the books.
[That sounds awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cti2fjm?context=5)|It's easily my favorite part of the job. Re-shelving books is a tedious process, but what I usually do is re-shelve a few books and then explore the shelves around them, learning their context, contents, and just generally looking at old rare books. Today however, I am re-shelving, doing a little research, and in between that, answering your questions!
[Do you ever find things inside books? I remember reading a story about my University's rare book room where someone found a ticket stub from the 1893 World's Fair (big event in Chicago history\) inside a book that had been used as a bookmark.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cti2hg0?context=5)|Yes we do! Usually they are related to the book, such as a letter from a previous owner or something like that. The coolest thing I have personally found in a book is an old Victorian-era advertising pamphlet that had been glued in. It turned out to be extremely rare since most people just threw them away. It's actually on display in the library right now.
 |This stuff (unfortunately) typically got removed and put into random boxes when the books arrived. One of my recent side projects has been to pair previously unread author letters with the books they arrived in.
[What book in the vault has the most interesting back story unique to that particular copy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthzwnf?context=5)|A Charles Dickens book that was owned by Charles Darwin's wife.
 |Or A leaflet from Shakespeare's First Folio (the real thing)
 |Or, the manuscript journal of the first woman to graduate from this university. Reading it gives great insight into university life back then.
[Where do your books come from? How does the university acquire them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthsid1?context=5)|Some books are purchased, usually individually to complete a collection, or as a group to start a new one. This shopping can usually be done online, but sometimes we go on trips to look at personal libraries.
 |Most of the books in our current Vault have been donated by Alumni or ""Friends of the Library"" members. However, sometimes people will just bring in old books and ask us if we want them. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.
[What University do you work at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthv6oh?context=5)|I'm not sure if I can answer this. I'd like to be able to answer all questions honestly, and if I'm worried about my employer seeing this, I might be tempted to obscure the truth about some of the inner workings or my personal behavior at work.
 |That being said, there is only one University with this 13th century Illuminated Manuscript Bible that was owned by William Morris, and you (and especially my boss) might be able figure it out.
[What is the oldest book that the University owns and how good of shape is it in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthtbi7?context=5)|That would be the 13th century Manuscript Bible. It has been kept in great condition. This is partially due to the fact that is was lost for a few centuries and reclaimed by William Morris, bookmaker and Sci-fi/utopia author with a passion for crafts and books. The binding is later (16th century I think).
 |We tell people that are handling it not to touch any of the ink or illustrations, just the corners, and that should keep it alive for a long time.
[Are there special gloves for book-handling -- if not why would washing hands be considered sufficient for fragile paper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthyhem?context=5)|We do have special gloves, but they are rarely used. Hand-washing removes bacterial and oil from the surface of the skin, which can be chemically damaging to old paper. Paying attention to what you are doing when handling the book is often enough to prevent further damage. Not that handling the books in general doesn't slowly damage them. For instance, the corners of the pages of ""the Bible"" are darker than the text. That's from oil.
[How do those books smell? I'm sure it's kind of unique with the old ones thrown in the mix. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/ctht2km?context=5)|The Vault itself is virtually odorless; it's a pretty sterile environment.
 |Individual books sometimes have unique smells, mostly the traditional ""old books smell,"" if you've experienced that.
 |I just ran into the vault to smell that old Cicero book that I used for my proof to give you an example. It smells like grandma's basement and bitterness toward Roman councils and political betrayal.
[How often do you get additions to the rare books collection?  Does someone at the Archives actively seek rare books to add to the collection, or do you rely on donations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthx5i2?context=5)|My direct supervisor (She's the Rare Books Librarian, I'm her assistant) does this. She will actively seek interesting material and mediate discussions with donors. We acquire something (even if it's just one book or pamphlet) just about every week. I help catalogue and shelve and make decisions about condition and storage options, you know, the boring stuff.
[Have you ever seen a book that depicted the future pretty accurately? Perhaps about machines and the advancement of science that no one would have imagined could be possible at the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3eryp8/iama_rare_books_assistant_at_a_university_ama/cthsjcz?context=5)|We have and entire H.G. Wells collection, and although a lot of his stuff is fiction and over-the-top, recent advancements in AI technology and weaponry (see Steven Hawking's AMA) are taking us closer and closer to a *War of the Worlds*-style battlefield. He also wrote in some science and technology journals, and those can be pretty interesting. Want more on this?

3exhgs,3,2015-07-28,Difficulty with little to no background in CS??,FinanceStudentN8,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/3exhgs/difficulty_with_little_to_no_background_in_cs/,"Hello all,

I'm looking into beginning the online CS program in the Fall of 2017. I'm just finishing up my finance degree. I was able to land a decent internship as a financial analyst, where I learned quickly that being the end user with little to no knowledge of how or why the systems work will not benefit my career. It seems that the entire department expects me to know some of the backdoor practices like VBA for Excel (I wish) but my finance program didn't teach me much to preapre for a corporate career. It seems more geared towards financial advising! So I guess I'll offer free consulting on the IT floor in the future.

So I have decided to take on the two year track CS Post Bacc to move me from idiot end user to the magical IT floor. At my company, the IT floor has unlimited free coffee, donuts and the best views in the building... I see where the companies priorities are!!!!


I am fully aware of the difficulty of the program, that's what attracted me to it. There is a barrier to entry, unlike the idiot end user, the CS graduate has been put through the test and is rewarded with better jobs! However, is this degree nearly impossible for the idiot end user like myself? 


Also, career question, I am curious if I will just be trashing my undergrad in Finance? Or is there a position for me that would utlize both degrees? For example, one of the BSAs at my work has a finance degree, so when his help is requested he knows what's being asked of him from the manager, but the manager doesn't know the technical details on how to fix the problem. It's a perfect fit! "

3eyexv,0,2015-07-28,Help planning a CS career,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3eyexv/help_planning_a_cs_career/,"I know, CS Career Advice is a thing, but I never get many responses there.

I'm a recent liberal arts graduate, and while I somewhat enjoy the field I'm in (paralegal, and was previously planning to go to law school), I just don't see myself having a broad future in it.  I've come to accept that law school wouldn't be smart for someone in my personal/financial situation (in other words, I don't have rich parents and don't want to be in terrible debt), and I don't want to be a paralegal for the rest of my life.

I've been learning programming through Code Academy the past few months, and really am enjoying it.  My friends (and even lawyer colleagues) tell me how much better the CS field is than law right now.  I'm thinking of making a switch to it, and want some help making an attack plan.  I have two options in mind:

1.  Apply for Master's Degree programs.  Some schools, such as UPenn and U Chicago, are pretty friendly towards applicants with unrelated undergrad degrees.  I'm sure I'd do fine on the GRE, I aced the ACT without really studying.  My main concern, however, is getting good letters of recommendation.  The only professors I'd feel comfortable asking are some music and comparative literature profs, and I don't feel like they could convince grad schools that I'd be a good fit for CS.  I also am a bit skeptical about going for a Master's right away because my undergrad college was worthless for my career search (and I went to a top state school).  Perhaps it's like that for all liberal arts majors, but I'm worried going back to school without any CS experience won't actually help me get into the field.  Pros: Great in-demand degree.  Might be easy to find a job with the degree alone (but that's a question I want YOU to answer, reddit).  Cons: No work experience, 1-2 years without income, might not even be accepted.

2.  FDM Academy.  I almost took an offer from them a few months ago, but had no way of supporting myself in NYC for 6 months of unpaid training.  I come from a lower middle class family who never could just send me off to unpaid internships or anything like that.  However, having a 90% chance of being placed into a great company is quite attractive.  So I'm thinking of contacting FDM sometime in the future; I've been saving about 80% of my income from my current job and could certainly make 6 unpaid months of training work now.  Pros: Learn CS skills super fast, high chance of getting work experience and placement with blue chip company.  Cons: Unpaid training is abusive and would make me feel like a chump, no degree, would have to take a big standard of living decrease for 6 months, might not be placed.

/jobs, what do you suggest I do?  Thanks in advance for the help :)."
3eyfg4,4,2015-07-28,Coding Evaluation via HackerRank - Square Internship,spectre0x0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3eyfg4/coding_evaluation_via_hackerrank_square_internship/,"I'm an undergrad student entering their junior year. I was contacted by Square via email about 5 days after submitting my resume online.

This is my very first invitation to participate in any type of screening in my CS career, and so I have some questions about the coding evaluation process via HackerRank for an internship position with Square. 

Details about this challenge:

* Two questions
* 120 minutes
* Can be taken ""at any time""

Has anyone had experience with these types of coding evaluations in general? Coding evaluations with Square? What's it like, especially for internship positions?

An hour per question sounds a little intimidating for me as a first timer - what type of questions can I expect to see? I'm currently going through my [CLRS](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844) and [EPI](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836/) books, as well as open problems on HackerRank.

Since they claim I can take the test at any time, how much leeway are they really giving me? Can I wait about 1.5 weeks?

Is there anything else I need to know?

Thanks for your time.

I've been learning programming through Code Academy the past few months, and really am enjoying it. My friends (and even lawyer colleagues) tell me how much better the CS field is than law right now.

1. Apply for Master's Degree programs. Some schools, such as UPenn and U Chicago, are pretty friendly towards applicants with unrelated undergrad degrees. I'm sure I'd do fine on the GRE, I aced the ACT without really studying. My main concern, however, is getting good letters of recommendation. The only professors I'd feel comfortable asking are some music and comparative literature profs, and I don't feel like they could convince grad schools that I'd be a good fit for CS. I also am a bit skeptical about going for a Master's right away because my undergrad college was worthless for my career search (and I went to a top state school). Perhaps it's like that for all liberal arts majors, but I'm worried going back to school without any CS experience won't actually help me get into the field. Pros: Great in-demand degree. Might be easy to find a job with the degree alone (but that's a question I want YOU to answer, reddit). Cons: No work experience, 1-2 years without income, might not even be accepted.

2. FDM Academy (boot campy place that offers job placement). I almost took an offer from them a few months ago, but had no way of supporting myself in NYC for 6 months of unpaid training. I come from a lower middle class family who never could just send me off to unpaid internships or anything like that. However, having a 90% chance of being placed into a great company is quite attractive. So I'm thinking of contacting FDM sometime in the future; I've been saving about 80% of my income from my current job and could certainly make 6 unpaid months of training work now. Pros: Learn CS skills super fast, high chance of getting work experience and placement with blue chip company. Cons: Unpaid training is abusive and would make me feel like a chump, no degree, would have to take a big standard of living decrease for 6 months, might not be placed.

3eyzbr,1,2015-07-28,Statement of purpose critique for biomedical engineering graduate programs,MechE00,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3eyzbr/statement_of_purpose_critique_for_biomedical/,"Hello,

I'm currently working on my statement of purpose for biomedical engineering masters programs. Specifically, I am going to be applying this fall to programs that are conducting tissue engineering research. It would be great if anyone could provide me with a critique!

**Statement of Purpose:**

On average, 22 people die in the US each day waiting for organ transplants due to the paucity of donors (organdonors.gov); shortcomings in medicine such as these engender my passion for contributing to the medical field through engineering and technology. The coalescence of chemistry, biology, and engineering principles leads to boundless opportunities for improving healthcare and quality of life; whether through bionic implants, neural interfaces, or artificial organs, biomedical engineering offers the future of medical technology and advancement. In the past five years, I have become endlessly fascinated by the use of biomaterials and automation to increase the efficiency and viability of tissue growth. Due to my ardent desire to contribute to medicine through engineering, I am applying to the Biomedical Engineering graduate program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in order to earn a Masters of Science with an emphasis in Tissue Engineering. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Oregon State University (OSU), obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Chemistry.  At OSU, I studied a variety of subjects including Mechanical Vibrations, Experimental Techniques in Material Science, and Measurement Systems. For my senior CAPSTONE project I designed, built, and tested the hull of a pendulum wave energy converter. The project required extensive research and application of composite materials to attain the necessary structural characteristics and durability for marine environments. In addition, I augmented my engineering coursework with a myriad of life sciences and chemistry courses such as Organic Chemistry, Medical Ethics, and Genetics to gain medical knowledge and later apply to biomedical engineering graduate programs.

Furthermore, while at OSU I participated in a number of extracurricular activities. During my junior year, I was elected President of the Mechanical Engineering Honor Society, as I excelled in leadership roles and resource management. As President, I led student and faculty meetings and events, including open houses and award banquets. Along with actively participating in the honor society, I volunteered in the ER of a local hospital to gain exposure to the medical field.  I observed the current state of medical technology to be both impressive and lacking, with areas in need of vast improvement. One of the alarming shortcomings I noted was the inability to test pharmaceuticals and other substances before administering them to patients—a problem that could be remedied through methods such as testing for compatibility with organs-on-chips. I found volunteering in medicine to be exciting and enthralling, further substantiating my desire to continue edification within a biomedical engineering graduate program.

Between sophomore and junior years at OSU, I participated in a valuable internship at Intel Corporation, gaining exposure to research and development and finite element analysis. I independently researched the effects of loading on the mechanical and electrical properties of computer processing unit socket contacts, which resulted in a successful correlation between empirical data and model behavior. Additionally, I conducted research on the thermal properties and flow impedance of mobile keyboards, the results of which were used to design the ventilation system and physical chassis of the Intel Ultrabooks. The R&amp;D experience I gained at Intel will prove to be a valuable asset in my future academic research.

Along with having experience from multiple internships, I worked for the last year and a half as a Design Engineer at Valin Corporation. At Valin, I designed a variety of complex automation systems, hydraulic power circuits, and structural assemblies. I worked on a particularly challenging and rewarding project involving the research and design of a custom cable winder that utilized rotary encoders, tension control systems, and motion controllers. My expanded knowledge of electromechanical devices and automation provides me with the necessary tools to design and utilize equipment in academic and industrial research.

I am highly interested in employing my skills in academic research and find the Tissue Engineering research at University of Wisconsin-Madison to be exceptionally compelling. In particular, I find the research conducted by the Ashton Group on the stimulation of pluripotent cells to direct cell differentiation to be extremely fascinating. The development of tissue engineering techniques is one of the most important and enticing fields of research within medicine. 

After completing the MS program in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I plan to pursue a career in research and development within industry or continue my education to earn a PhD. In either case, my ultimate goal is to develop tissue engineering techniques to grow viable organs with efficiency and practicality. Through my education at OSU, internships, and design engineering experience, I have built an excellent foundation of knowledge and tenacity that will ensure my success in research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I look forward to exploring my passion for medicine and technology and making a contribution in a field that ultimately impacts the lives of our global community.

I believe I am going to be a tech risk intern in the Advisory group. I don't want to rush and just accept the offer yet, given the fact that this can ultimately lead to a full-time offer in the same group. So here are some questions:

1. What does a tech risk consultant really do? The recruiter told me that I would likely be in the cyber or strategic risk market offering because I am minoring in information systems (my major is finance/accounting).

2. It seems like the firm's advisory group is nothing like its consulting arm, and I do wish to do strategy/management consulting rather than just ""risk"" consulting in the future (don't we all?). Also, I heard that any kind of tech risk is essentially IT audit. In this case, should I decline the offer and go through the interview process for the firm's consulting group? Or should I try to switch the FT offer from advisory to consulting (a.k.a network my ass off and hope for the best)?

I am a consulting intern at a very small firm (10~15 people), and I have been working with some market sizing as well as coming up with recommendations. This experience has given me an interest in strategy / management consulting.

Although I was very happy to get the offer at first, the more I research about the different service lines, the less attractive the advisory group in this firm sounds. I would love to know what people here think. Thanks in advance!"

I got the position because my past internships have been this stack, however after taking a week I've discovered that their processes and codebase is a little terrifying and I feel like I'll end up in more of a mentor position. 

Today I just received a competing offer from a larger company (80-100 employees) which is similar in terms of salary but has many more perks: In house bar, fully stoked kitchen, free gym passes ect. Typically I'd jump at this however the stack is .net something that I'm not familiar with and am not to excited about as I'm not a big fan of microsofts history with their paywalled garden.

What I'm really struggling with is I would like to be in a larger company where I can grow more as a developer but I'm wondering if it's worth it enough to sink my time into a .net stack especially when I want to be moving onto the west coast in 3 years.

I've always pursued Engineering, I was successful enough to get onto a good Engineering course and have currently scored a first in my first year. I don't want to be an engineer, but I really enjoy studying it.

I've always had an interest in Law, and my mum has worked in the field her whole life so I've grown up around it. 

I wanted to get an engineering internship this summer, but the pay was too low and I don't come from a wealthy enough background to be able to earn very little money and rely on my parents to support me. I got a job in a London law firm this summer because the pay was great.

I've been able to speak to lawyers and I've fallen in love with being one. I think I've finally found what I want to do. However ideally I want to live in America as soon as I finish my degree and I know that's not an easy thing to do.

The American culture in law is fascinating to me, and is definitely something I could do. The long hours, hard work, and stress I am all aware of. 

My question is, how do I go from being a first year engineering student in the UK, to a lawyer in the US?

I have a plan, but I need advice/criticism/alternatives:

In two years time I'll finish my bachelor's in Engineering ideally with a first

Transfer to a different university nearby (I can meet entry requirements) (top 100 law school), to study for a Juris Doctor.

After Juris Doctor (3 years) try to secure a work visa/sponsor in the US.

Take California bar exam.

And finally cry about student debt.


Honestly any thoughts/advice would be much appreciated!"

3f1vfp,1,2015-07-29,Current job wants me to get a certification but I am most likely leaving soon for a better opportunity. Not sure how to handle.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3f1vfp/current_job_wants_me_to_get_a_certification_but_i/,"I have been at my current job for about 10 months.  I like it and I have learned a lot.  I am 27 years old and it's my 3rd job out of college; it is in a new field so I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow in this industry.  A few months ago, I ran into a guy that I had an internship with in college, and we got to talking about what I'm currently doing.  Long story short, he said he'd like me to work for him, since one of his employees is going on disability.  We have gone to lunch and talked these past few months, and at the end of August the job posting is going up (had to wait for FMLA period to expire; big company so they have to post according to protocol).  It is pretty much a done deal, I just have to wait to go through the process since it's at a national company with their own procedures.

The new job is better in every way.  My new boss would be much cooler and laid back than my current boss (I know, since I interned with him in college).  Job security at the new place will be much higher, and I will get benefits (currently have to go through the marketplace since my job doesn't offer them).  Also, the pay would be better (slightly higher base with much higher bonuses).  To be honest, my current boss is an arrogant dick, and he is terrible at managing people.  I'm tired of coming in every day wondering what mood he's in.  He creates an unnecessarily chaotic environment, since he changes his mind constantly and can't stick to anything.  He also makes terrible hiring and business purchasing decisions (3 people have been fired since I started here, and I can't even count the number of things he's spent money on but never uses).  All this while undervaluing his most important asset, his employees.  I came to the conclusion months ago this current company will never be great-my current boss's personality and way of doing things will always hinder it's potential, so I don't see much of a future here.

*Just to clarify, the new guy I would be working for is a financial adviser, and also one of my father's good friends (and my dad recently decided to have him manage his finances as well).  So we have had a relationship for years and years.  He told my dad just a few weeks ago that he is definitely hiring me, as long as everything is good with the company's background check, etc., which it will be.  I include this because I know some people may be concerned with his seriousness about hiring me and that he may be promising things he can't deliver.  Basically, it would be a shitfest if he fucked me over, and honestly I can't see him doing that.  Although I do realize that there are always unexpected things that happen (like what if he got hit by a bus tomorrow?)

My question concerns my review next week at my current job.  I was just informed that I am having a review (for some reason at 10 months?) and that's all I was told.  They have been talking about me getting a CFP certification, which would require taking a course and test to pass (I got licensed in insurance for this job already, about 3 months ago).  I am almost certain that this will be discussed.  I could also see them giving me a raise as well, since I have contributed a lot to the company, but who knows.  For the insurance license course, they had me pay out of pocket up front, and then reimbursed me when I completed it, and I have a feeling they will want me to do the same thing this time.  Problem is, I don't want to front the money (it's super expensive) and then leave in a few months (around end of Sept/early Oct) and be stuck taking a course I don't want/need, and/or being out so much money.

So I guess my question to you all is: how do I delay signing up and starting coursework for this certification until the hiring process at the new company starts up and finishes?  Any other general advice given my situation?

*Also, I think it goes without saying, but I don't want my current job to know that I am most likely leaving soon."

First, I would like to detail what motivated me to make this post. My current opportunity has become rather stagnant in helping me grow. While I have appreciated the time there, through management changes, I have not been given the same opportunities I was when I started. I long to become a System Engineer and, for the past several months, I have been doing nothing but front line software support and bench work. While I don't mind doing the work, when 40 hours of every week is doing this, the only thing I am gaining is experience in the industry and not the knowledge I desire.

Here is a little about my education and experience: I am a college graduate with a Bachelors in Information Technology Service Management. In that degree was a lot of business classes mixed with project management and service management classes. However it also included the classes that, for the most part, were Network+ and A+ certification classes (And a little bit about Linux as well). The only other certification I have is the base Exin ceritification. Otherwise I have no formal certs, but I am currently working towards CCENT and MCSE. Also, during my college years I worked at a certain Game Retailer for over 6 years which did include some over the phone and in store ""tech"" support from time to time.


&amp;nbsp;


Since graduating, I have been working in the IT field for a little over two years now in some very quick growing circumstances. My first job was an internship for a little less than a year where I was the only help desk technician for a company with over 80 nodes. Here is where I began my sprint in to IT where I took on Active Directory and Group Policy management, SCCM, Software Deployments, I regulated Java and Adobe updates company wide (remotely), learned a lot about Networking via Meraki equipment and even got to mess with VMWare and Exchange 2010/2013 a little bit.


&amp;nbsp;


After my internship ended, I got a job for an IT service provider and, while initially I was hired on as a technician, was offered an opportunity to participate in a project where we took two physical servers and turned them in to three physical servers running VMWare with multiple guests per host, to help separate the roles. Even though I barely had any VMWare experience prior to that, I ended up doing about 80% of the project (Not counting initial planning) and basically set up Physical Server #2 on my own (Backup DC and File Server). That project impressed the right people and from there I began working on Remote App deployments from both a Cloud environment and locally hosted. I did several AD DS deployments and migrations and quite a few mail migrations to Online Exchange. 


&amp;nbsp;


When there are no projects, my day to day operations include systems and software support and monitoring of those systems along with backup management and monitoring.


&amp;nbsp;


**Here are my questions:**

What does being a System Administrator entail? 

Do you find that networking or phone systems management is a big part of the day to day for a SysAdmin? 

As a SysAdmin, would someone with the experience that I have yet lack of certifications even be considered for such a position?

What suggestions would you make for someone in my position?


&amp;nbsp;


I want to thank you all for the opportunity to ask for advice here and appreciate any and all help!

Need some advice on a few different paths I'm considering",MauPow,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3f3ktl/27_directionless_need_some_advice_on_a_few/,"Just like everyone else, I also have no idea what to do with my life. I'm still living at home after a year and a half and I'm growing more depressed/apathetic by the day. 

I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors in Journalism, minor in Multimedia. I wasn't really passionate about the field, but it was my junior year and I needed to choose something. I'd always found journalism interesting, I had some photography and writing skills, and I sure as hell wasn't going to be a business major, so I went for it. Didn't know what to do after college, so I went abroad and taught English in Spain for two years. I don't regret it, but I definitely didn't progress myself in any kind of career there. 

I came back at the end of 2013, after getting homesick and feeling like I wasn't doing anything with my life except smoking spliffs on the beach all day and occasionally teaching a class. Decided to come home, did an internship at a big local magazine and volunteered for the public radio station hoping to get some connections. Well, nothing came of that or the subsequent job applications or temp agency interviews. I got a job driving restaurant delivery at my old high school job. It's not the worst job ever but I sure as hell don't want to stay in this. 

On a depressed whim a month or so ago, I bought a ticket to Europe, thinking I would sell all my shit here and go back. It's for next Monday. I'm reconsidering my decision right now, though, as I have money problems, terrible credit, and I think that I would just end up in the same place I'm at now (or worse) in a year or two once I get tired of the lifestyle and start wanting to prepare myself for the future again. 

I'm thinking of doing a post-bacc in Computer Science through Oregon State online, as I've always found programming interesting, and have always been a techie. I have tried to teach myself in the past but I have terrible focus problems, and the depression saying ""you can't do this"" didn't help, either. CS is obviously a good career, and I was always fairly bright and able to figure things out, with a good GPA in college. The structure would really help me, as I feel like my current lifestyle is making me dumber. 

I really feel like I need to move out to progress myself and break myself out of this funk. If I try and pursue a degree, though, I don't know if I could afford it. It might be worth my mental health, though.

Kind of freaking out right now.

So I've always been interested in CS and computers in general. I original wanted to make games, but then thought Network Security would be a better career choice.

At some point I became confused. I honestly don't know why, but I thought a CS career would be too saturated so I tried to work towards a trade that traditionally is always in need. First I was pre-law, but I couldn't stand the lawyers I worked with during internships (and all of them told me becoming a lawyer was the stupidest thing they'd ever done) so I decided to switch to something else. My wife was pre-med, and I was always good at biology and the sciences, so I thought I'd try that.

I graduated with a Bio Major and a CJ minor, but since I didn't really like either I'm kind of burned out, and don't want to do either for the rest of my life.

So lately, while applying to biology research positions (which is laughably saturated) I've been trying to teach myself programming. But as this point it seems like my best bet is to join a PhD program (which pays a stipend in exchange for doing research towards your thesis, as well as paying for a Masters and the PhD) this seems the most economical, as not only do I get money and an education, I also get an extension on my loans.

Okay, that is my background. On to my question. 

I want to move into the CS field. Is a PhD program available? Should I get a masters? Or should I teach myself? Or would I just not be accepted anywhere due to my lack of knowledge and my background?

Should I aim for a middle ground with bioinformatics?

My end goal would be a decent career in CS with having the ability to create games in my free time (as that is my passion but probably not a viable career).

Any advice at all would be very much appreciated. 

I kind of rambled this information due to my stress, if any clarification is needed, please ask."

Long story short, I'm going to be wrapping up my degree soon and could use some serious advice on where to go next.

Okay, long story long now I suppose. I'm coming on my last semester of my current degree in Business Management with a concentration in Information Systems. Frankly the concentration is meh, but I've taken some intro programing, networking, and brief commerce subject courses.

In this past year I really ventured out of my comfort one and started getting involved with the cybersecurity community and team (don't be fooled I'm rather novice). I've discovered this as a real passion of mine, unfortunately this didn't happen for me sooner.

Although I love it, I am not a born natural at it. I pick it up at a decent pace and do fine, but I wasn't one of those kids programming at age 10. My coding skills are average in a novice way. I really like networking and would really like to dive more into that if I could. I was studying for my Certified Ethical Hacker, but after some research saw it was much use without any prior knowledge / experience to back the cert up. (I was excited to be able to follow all the material competently though.)

I have a few prominent options at this point:

1. Stick with my current Management path (have a successful internship) - Honestly this path is really unappealing to me as it's pretty dull, but it is technically an option so I'm listing it.

1. Get my second undergraduate degree in cyber security - This would really suck to go back to undergrad again. I think I would only need (on average across institutions) 35 credits so it would be expedited, but expensive and still kind of degrading to feel like I've wasted the past 4 years on this last degree. However if this is what it takes I'll accept that. I currently got into an online school University of Maryland College which is actually supposed to be pretty good for cybersecurity (maybe I'm wrong on that, don't think so though).

1. Go to grad school for cyber security - I would love to do this, after some searching though I don't know if I qualify. My GPA is a 2.9ish (not 3.0) and I don't believe I've done all the pre reqs, however I might be able to find an institution that would take me. I've heard grad school isn't much worth it though if its not from somewhere with a decent reputation though so that might be a bad idea.

1. Other, hopefully there are options I'm just not seeing that are out there.


Well, figured I'm pretty puzzled so maybe I'd turn to the internet for some ideas to go in the right direction. I'm very open to really anything, will go anywhere or am willing to consider doing anything for what it takes to get to a proficient level of practicing cybersecurity (thats a pretty broad term but I think i've gotten my point across).

If you made it this far, thanks for the read through."
3f4kyv,5,2015-07-30,Put my life back together after many failures - Are my MBA hopes realistic?,mba-throwaway-202,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/3f4kyv/put_my_life_back_together_after_many_failures_are/,"Hi,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I was hoping the community would be willing to provide some feedback on my development.

To provide a bit of background, some general information is listed below to help you understand my demographic:

- Sex: Male
- Current Age: 29
- Undergrad University: Top 50, Northeast public institution
- Undergrad Major &amp; GPA: Communications, 2.02/4.00 GPA
- UG Business Courses Only GPA: 3.1/4.0 GPA
- Graduate School: Small private institution in Northeast
- Graduate Major &amp; GPA: Masters of Accounting, 3.82/4.00 GPA
- Current Occupation: Big 4 Accounting Firm, NYC, Sr. Associate (3.5 years total time)
- GMAT: 690-730 (Practice exams)
- Certifications: CPA, CFA 1
- Volunteer: Coach youth basketball
- Current Targets: UVA, UNC, Cornell, UCLA, NYU (Reach), Darthmouth (Miracle?)

------------------------
**Overview:** I did terrible in my undergraduate studies - immature, no direction, unable to cope with undiagnosed depression. By some miracle, the dean of my undergraduate college actually reached out to me and got me the help I needed to finish school. Though I almost flunked school, I was always active - I volunteered and completed two internships with two different, household-named, companies.

Post-college, I landed a job with a major financial services company doing basic service representative work. I obtained Series 7 and 63 at this firm but worked there for less than a year - I had realized I needed to go back to school to really have the opportunity and career I wanted. I enrolled at a small private university in the greater-NYC area and did very well there. I became a Dean's List scholar, was awarded scholarship, and worked as a graduate assistant focusing on research to broaden university curriculum. During this time, I successfully completed an internship with a Big 4 firm and accepted full-time offer in their audit line of service. 

It's been 3.5 years in this capacity and I've done fairly well here. I've worked on some top-notch clients and seen some incredibly complex finance/accounting operations. My performance on my teams has always been good, I don't foresee any issue in obtaining my management's letter of recommendations. In addition, I obtained my CPA and have also progressed through some of the CFA curriculum. I have been studying the GMAT and taking some practice exams, scoring in the 690-720 range - I'm working to improve these scores to a target range of 740-770. On a more personal note, I've been seeing a therapist for the past year to address my depression and to work out my own issues - it's really been going well.

My interests surrounding the MBA are obvious. In my opinion, I think I have been establishing credibility and have shown that I can learn from my mistakes. With all of this said, I understand my undergraduate grades will act as a significant deterrence to being admitted to any #10 - #20 MBA program. I will be turning 30 within the next 9 months and the odds are against me. I've read through many admissions books and blogs but I can't shake the feeling that I still might have a shot at all - or I simply missed the boat on this one.

Can anyone in this community provide any insight and realistic feedback? Thank you very much for your time. Please let me know if I can expand upon any of the aforementioned details.

-------------------------------

**TL;DR - Almost flunked undergrad. Graduated. Got job. Realized I needed more education. Went back to school for Masters. Did great. Got job with Big 4. Working for 3.5 years, got promoted. Considering MBA. Need realistic feedback.**

I'm working at a Fortune 500 company this summer, 30 hours/wk maximum, all desk, basically doing what their entry level programmers do. I'm paid $11.5 an hour and a lot of it is spent twiddling my thumbs, reading reddit, understand existing code, etc. but I'm not sure that what I have here is very good relative to the rest of the field. I see friends that are at Walmart and other places and they're working on hackathons, intern teams, really rapid dev type of things and I feel like what I'm doing is the complete opposite. For instance: I've been working 2 weeks on a batch file that will run some Sql code every so often to delete from a table. I'm essentially refactoring an old program which runs similarly. Honestly it's slow as fuck and I'm bored. Is it just me, or is it this job?

I'm hoping the experience itself will be nice to have on my resume - I have learned a lot as a college upcoming Junior, but I feel as though I'm missing out."
3f5g9u,13,2015-07-30,Neighborhood Watch,Reabkxbn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3f5g9u/neighborhood_watch/,"   When I was a little kid I always wished to be older. I wanted to be teenager so that I could drive around and go places with friends. When I was a teen I wanted to be 21, so I could drink and go to clubs. Now I wish I could be a kid because bills and taxes are the scariest things in life. Or so I thought...

   When I graduated college two of my friends and I decided to get a house together. The two of them had internships in college, which landed them full jobs upon graduation. Christie is an accountant, Leroy is a computer repair technician, and I am a freelance Web designer. With much help from Christie, we created a budget and found a fairly decent house in a really good neighborhood. It only had two bedrooms, but we converted the basement into another bedroom and that became my room. I didn't mind it because it provided me a nice and quiet work area and it was directly connected to the kitchen, which was great for working all night trying to meet a deadline. 

   Things were great until a few months later. Strange things things started to happen. Many people reported stolen items and there were even a few missing reports and confirmed murders. Leroy and I were playing Super Smash Bros. while Christie was at work and we hear the doorbell ring. It distracted me and allowed Leroy to Falcon Punch my character off the screen. Since I was the loser I had to answer the door. A few neighbors were at the door and they asked to come in. They were going around to recruit people for a neighborhood watch to hopefully find a reason for the dissapearances. Leroy and I declined and one of them said that we should join ""not only for the safety of others, but for your own safety."" This made me a little uncomfortable and I talked about it with Leroy after they left and he basically blamed it on too much reddit and scary movies.

   A few days went by without anything strange happening.  One night I was editing my resume and portfolio when I hear a scream. I ran upstairs and found Christie running out the bathroom. She said that she saw someone outside just watching her. I was a little on edge and the doorbell rang. I checked who it was and it was a nice old lady with her oldest son that lived across the street. She heard screaming and wanted to check it out. I explained what happened and she told me it was most likely someone from the neighborhood watch being pervy and said that she'll find out who and make sure it doesn't happen again. The only problem is it happened again the very next night. I was getting Chinese food for dinner when I get a call from Christie saying that the same thing happened and she's hiding in her room. Leroy was at work, so I quickly paid for the food and rushed home. When I got close I slowed down to see if I could see anyone around the house and I didn't.  As soon as I got in the house I saw Christie run downstairs toward me with a baseball bat. Luckily she realized it was me before she used my head for batting practice. We ate the food, watched some dumb reality shows,  and forgot about what happened. 

   When Leroy came home he asked us ""Who was the guy that just left?"" Christie and I looked puzzled and told him that we were the only ones in the house. Almost instantly we split up and looked up and down the house. Nothing was missing and nobody else was there but I did find a flash drive on my keyboard.  I asked if it was either of theirs and they both shook their heads. I know not to put unknown flash drives into my computer, so I put it in Christie's old laptop.  The only things on the laptop were a few pictures labeled house_watch. It was a few screen shots from the Sims 4. Leroy noticed that the house looked just like ours and it had three sims in a living room that looked extremely similar to us. There was a sim dressed in all black in the backyard. We all turn to see someone in our backyard looking at us. Leroy runs out there with a baseball bat. Christie makes sure the doors are locked and nobody's in the house. I quickly call the police and help Leroy look around the perimeter of the house. 

   After the police arrive we tell them everything and show them the flash drive. They say that they will investigate and talk to the head of the neighborhood watch. After seeing our discomfort one of the officers said that they will patrol the next day around the same time we had these unwanted visits. To our pleasure nothing happens for a few more days.

   I got an email from a potentially new client hoping that I can make them an awesome blog layout about gaming but more specifically the Sims. I didn't want to at first, but the pay was too good to pass on when rent was coming up soon. He asks for my phone number so that he can just tell me everything he wants and talk about any deadlines. He calls me and tells me all that stuff and I tell him to email me some screen shots of his game and any logos he wants on the blog. He sends them rather quickly and since my sleep schedule was terrible I figured I would just pull an all-nighter and get it done because it was an easy job. I look at the files he sent me and because they had one letter names I would actually have to look at all of them. They all were of this house with two people upstairs sleeping and one in the basement on the computer. I freaked out when I saw that creepy Sim just stand at each of our doors and stare. The final image was a logo saying ""Neighborhood Watch"" but the ""oo"" were a pair of eyes. I locked my door and pushed a dresser in front of it. I called the police after texting Leroy and Christie what I saw. Christie texted me back when I heard the doorbell ring. I knew it wasn't the police that fast ,  so I stayed barricaded in my fortress until I heard sirens. When the police came I went upstairs and Christie came downstairs.  I explained the situation and the officers searched the house. They found nothing and said that other than themselves Christie and I were the only ones home. I tell them that we had another roommate when I get a text from the ""client"". It's a picture of our sims' house but one of the roommates are gone. I show the police the text and they tracked the number. They found the ""client"" and they find Leroy's body, but after hearing what the client did Christie and I immediately started to pack. It sends chills down my spine.

   Christie ended up getting an apartment closer to her job and I moved back in with my parents. I just got a new client. He's a gaming youtuber that focuses mostly on creating sims of celebrities and other youtubers. He asked me to make a website for merchandise and social media. The pay is amazing. He's supposed to be sending me a few pictures and his logo soon. I was kinda creeped out when I got a text from Leroy's number. I read it was fairly common and I would do more investigating, but I better go. My parents just brought home dinner after they went to some neighborhood watch meeting. They asked me if I wanted to come, but I declined. I'm not really a fan of neighborhood watches"
3f5i6t,250,2015-07-30,For those on the lower end of the bellcurve:,statistical,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3f5i6t/for_those_on_the_lower_end_of_the_bellcurve/,"I graduated in May with an AE degree from a mid-tier university for my major. I had no internships/co-ops, no significant research experience, very limited extracurricular team project experience, and a ~2.8 gpa (overall, major was much lower). The reason for the post is this: I visited this subreddit through all four years of college (a lot, since I procrastinated a lot) and would read constantly about those of you who have managed 4 summers of internships, 2 co-ops, 3.99 gpa's, undergrad research publications, etc.. This resulted in a constant cloud of anxiety and feelings of inferiority for most of my time as a student. I believe that this in turn seriously affected my academic performance, and my ability to network at more professional events, such as career fairs and company visits. 

I encourage all of you that feel similar to the way I did to take stock of how easy it is to feel inferior to those on this subreddit. **Be aware of your own confirmation bias**. Those who have a sparkling resume will be more likely to post about their accomplishments online. Those that are really, really exceptional will be more memorable to you, inaccurately weighing your perspective of what an ""average"" engineering student is. 

**Just because your grades are low, doesn't mean your peers and instructors will not respect your intelligence.** If your grades are low because you don't go to class, don't study and/or don't turn in assignments, your peers and instructors will not respect your intelligence. Do not let initial (or persistent) poor performance deter you from attending class, studying, or turning in assignments. (I really liked doing that)

**Talk to your peers about how you perform.** Find out who the highest performing students are and what their work habits are. I can almost guarantee you will be surprised. Acknowledge that there are some that will study minimally and earn near-perfect scores, and some that will work blood, sweat, and tears to pass (and some won't pass). 

**Talk to someone about your anxiety.** It can lead easily to depression. **Talk to everyone about engineering.** Find out about career paths, goals, ideas, choices, mistakes, lessons learned. The more you get to know about the people around you, especially your direct peers and professors, 
the more community you will create, which will turn into a positive support network.

This wound up wayyy longer than I intended. I hope that this will help at least someone who is struggling and felt the same way I did. "

The internship is at a robotics company roughly 10 minutes from where I go to school, and I absolutely love the work. I always knew I enjoyed robotics, but this just sealed the deal for me in terms of where I want to go with software development. 

Here is my situation, before I interviewed and while I interviewed with the VP of the company, there was talks about possibly working remotely (in my case I could come into the office because I am so close) during the school year. 

How do I go about approaching them and asking if this is a possibility for myself? Should I ask him for a meeting via email and go from there? Or do I mention that I want to talk to him about possible work during the school year via email and would like to talk in person? 

Any help is appreciated, as I am really happy here! Thanks! "
3f5ouv,4,2015-07-30,How do I delay shelling out money for a certification for my current job when I know I will be leaving soon?,Hamburgerss,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3f5ouv/how_do_i_delay_shelling_out_money_for_a/,"I have been at my current job for about 10 months. I like it and I have learned a lot. I am 27 years old and it's my 3rd job out of college; it is in a new field so I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow in this industry. A few months ago, I ran into a guy that I had an internship with in college, and we got to talking about what I'm currently doing. Long story short, he said he'd like me to work for him, since one of his employees is going on disability. We have gone to lunch and talked these past few months, and at the end of August the job posting is going up (had to wait for FMLA period to expire; big company so they have to post according to protocol). It is pretty much a done deal, I just have to wait to go through the process since it's at a national company with their own procedures.

The new job is better in every way. My new boss would be much cooler and laid back than my current boss (I know, since I interned with him in college). Job security at the new place will be much higher, and I will get benefits (currently have to go through the marketplace since my job doesn't offer them). Also, the pay would be better (slightly higher base with much higher bonuses). To be honest, my current boss is an arrogant dick, and he is terrible at managing people. I'm tired of coming in every day wondering what mood he's in. He creates an unnecessarily chaotic environment, since he changes his mind constantly and can't stick to anything. He also makes terrible hiring and business purchasing decisions (3 people have been fired since I started here, and I can't even count the number of things he's spent money on but never uses). All this while undervaluing his most important asset, his employees. I came to the conclusion months ago this current company will never be great-my current boss's personality and way of doing things will always hinder it's potential, so I don't see much of a future here.

*Just to clarify, the new guy I would be working for is a financial adviser, and also one of my father's good friends (and my dad recently decided to have him manage his finances as well). So we have had a relationship for years and years. He told my dad just a few weeks ago that he is definitely hiring me, as long as everything is good with the company's background check, etc., which it will be. I include this because I know some people may be concerned with his seriousness about hiring me and that he may be promising things he can't deliver. Basically, it would be a shitfest if he fucked me over, and honestly I can't see him doing that. Although I do realize that there are always unexpected things that happen (like what if he got hit by a bus tomorrow?)

My question concerns my review next week at my current job. I was just informed that I am having a review (for some reason at 10 months?) and that's all I was told. They have been talking about me getting a CFP certification, which would require taking a course and test to pass (I got licensed in insurance for this job already, about 3 months ago). I am almost certain that this will be discussed. I could also see them giving me a raise as well, since I have contributed a lot to the company, but who knows. For the insurance license course, they had me pay out of pocket up front, and then reimbursed me when I completed it, and I have a feeling they will want me to do the same thing this time. Problem is, I don't want to front the money (it's super expensive) and then leave in a few months (around end of Sept/early Oct) and be stuck taking a course I don't want/need, and/or being out so much money.

So I guess my question to you all is: how do I delay signing up and starting coursework for this certification until the hiring process at the new company starts up and finishes? Any other general advice given my situation?"

I am a sophomore in college studying computer science and I have two jobs there currently: I have a work study job (school gives me money and I work to earn it) at an IT help desk answering calls. Not too many hours, probably like 18 per week. I also got a second job at my school's IT repair center. It pays $1 more but I will be getting a fraction of the hours as the first job. 

My question is that I was offered two more jobs; to become a tutor and to become a TA for one of my old classes. Should I take a third job? Will any of these look better on my resume? 

EDIT: adding information below

I did fine in classes this past school year. I even got dean's list second semester. I currently have a gpa of 3.68. I only had one job last year (the work study one as depicted). I currently have an internship this summer and will be definitely working to get another one next semester.

3f5swt,24,2015-07-30,I'm a programmer that's been out of work for about six months; my skill set is in low demand. I'm not sure what to do next.,mainframethrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3f5swt/im_a_programmer_thats_been_out_of_work_for_about/,"**edit**: Crazy enough, an hour after I posted this I was contacted by a recruiter for a mainframe position.  Whether or not I get it I'll continue to build my skills in web development, since seeing dozens of web dev jobs to the single COBOL job on a regular basis is super frustrating and I don't want my next job hunt to look like this one.  Thanks for the advice everyone.

------------------------------

I was going to post this in the programming subreddit but they're link only for some reason, so I'm here.

I'm a mainframe programmer living in a city that doesn't have a lot of banks or insurance legacy systems.  When I was young and idiotic in college I took an internship in mainframe development, which led to a job offer and then 8 years of mainframe dev, and now almost my entire resume is legacy system support and I can't even get an interview for an entry level/junior web or desktop development job. 

My mindset is that when hiring managers are looking at two resumes, one of which is a college student that knows a few languages from courses but has never had an IT job, and the other is someone who is less familiar with those languages but has almost a decade of working experience, the more experienced person is going to be picked at least occasionally.  Many entry level applications later, this doesn't seem to be the case.

One of my worries is that I'm looked at as someone who's going to demand higher pay once I settle into the job, and they're looking to get someone out of college with lower salary expectations or a ""will work for experience"" mentality.  

But on the other hand, I don't think I can handle a higher paying mid/senior job where they're probably going to expect me to show up and immediately begin to produce in Javascript or C# or something.   

Anyway, I'm learning skills on my own but I have a kid and a mortgage and just need to find anything to keep above water with child care/mortgage/general costs of living.  I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, I guess some words of encouragement to keep plugging away from people in similar situations would be nice.  Thanks.

3f5wdk,1,2015-07-30,"I have a phone call with HR scheduled, but am not sure if I'm being interviewed. Help!",[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/3f5wdk/i_have_a_phone_call_with_hr_scheduled_but_am_not/,"**Short background:** I've been applying for jobs since graduation a few months ago and have been getting very few responses. I realize that my industry (academic/policy) is *very* competitive, but I honestly thought I'd at least be getting a few callbacks.

For what it's worth, I do think I have the skills and mind for the job. I graduated *summa cum laude* with a relevant degree from a well respected and fairly prestigious university, have excellent references/recommendations, and and totally in love with the type of work I'd potentially be doing. I have three internships directly related to the field, and two more which provide widely applicable (read: administrative/program management) skills that are relevant to the job.

**Important part:** Fast forward to a few weeks ago when a friend volunteered that he knew a few people on the board of Company X, which is pretty much my dream company. I've applied there three times before (once for an internship during school, twice after graduation for full-time positions) and been declined twice -- the most recent application is still being processed.

My friend asked me to forward him my cover letter, resume, and the position my current application was being processed for. I did so. A week later the director of HR emails me essentially saying, ""I hear you're interested in working here and would be happy to set up a phone call to discuss the positions we have available.""

**The Question:** If your boss (be they your supervisor in HR or someone from the C-level) passes you a resume, what is your reaction? Is it more of a ""speak with this kid so I can tell my friend I did him a favor"" or more of a nudge/suggestion that my resume should be on top of the stack for upcoming positions (so long as I qualify)? 

 I guess you guys aren't mind readers, but I'm just not sure what to expect (or not expect) from the conversation. I don't assume they're offering me a job on a silver platter, but I also don't want to let an opportunity slip through my fingers -- should I press and ask to be considered for certain positions? I've never done an informational interview before, and I don't even know if this is one.

**TL;DR:** The classic ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"" problem -- I'm getting a phone call from an HR big wig at a very prestigious firm and am not sure how to handle the situation, as I didn't earn the phone call through merit, but by a friend pulling some strings.

This is much longer than I want it to be, so I'll end here with a preemptive ""Thank you, I appreciate your time."" Because I do."

Hey I'm a recent high school graduate looking for major life advice/college advice and I'm just going to put this question out there, really anyone can answer. I'll try and keep it short.
LITTLE BACKGROUND 
I'm now 18. Love the outdoors, skateboard, snowboard, traveling, music production, film, Virtual Reality development(Oculus Rift owner) and talking to new people with ideas that compel me in any way to do something. Went to private catholic school my whole life. I loved video games since I was a kid, I began to build computers for myself or friends(for some quick cash), then go more in depth to troubleshooting them for my own use and playing around wanting to be the cool nerd who could do impressive things on a computer. I got comfortable using computers at a higher level by filming and editing my own skateboard videos, modding games, or setting up the new hardware I would get consistently. I just loved manipulating and problem solving which computers are great at, so there is where my extreme interest began. Little did I know that id randomly come in contact with a mentor in high school who would push me in the direction of cyber security for my career In high school I started a cyber-security team led by my IT director and best friend, we were primarily concerned by starting with the basics and learning defense because it’s the best offense. Our biggest achievements were 2 regional contests 1st place and 1 global cyber security contest 1st place. Not to mention a lot of prize money for a high school kid. From there, since we were all above average in cyber knowledge and OS defense etc., we were gifted 10 CompTIA Security + books and we all passed giving us the Security + Cert. We were also offered the Certified Ethical Hackers (CEH) Course material which is $3000 approx. a person but we didn't have enough free time with high school and our already heavy workload outside of school learning computer skills. Moving forward, in my junior and senior year summer breaks(I just finished 2 months ago) I received an internship for at an Energy Distribution company who normally only hires college seniors for internships. I have learned a lot here and it's been a great gift.

My question is about college and the future. I don't want to speculate and look to far as everything in life is pretty uncertain and unplanned, I'm sure some cyber folks will agree with me on that, but I do want some advice. I feel held back by high school, potentially college next year and I just want to pursue my passion of computers without all the General Education that I was forced through in late high school and now early college. No more Spanish class, religion class, history classes on lessons that I can google and read about in the rare chance that it is required to know historical facts that aren't general knowledge. I found my niche..computers..its broad as I don't lock myself completely to anything in life, but it is my passion and I'm ready to take it in whatever direction fits best. I just like options

I'm currently enrolled and plan to start next month at Longwood university in the ""business with cyber focus"" degree track which is basically a business degree with added computer and IT classes that looks okay. My first problem is the fact that I really only had about 4 colleges to choose from(Longwood university, Champlain Univ., UMBC, and Frostburg)  because I was so set on making sure the major was cyber focused. Now feeling regretful, I'm not excited to be in Virginia at a small school where I feel I have no opportunity to make my ideas happen or help another geek start a project that could take my life who knows where in the environment around me i.e. 5000 people school, small town with farms and rural culture and not a lot of buzzing tech people running around. I have no problem with the culture or people as I am great at talking and being comfortable with them(imp that very social kid that you wouldn't expect to be good with computers), I just don't want to be in an area that long term has nothing to offer me and I imagine I could meet interesting and business minded people in a city or suburb environment elsewhere that could take my life in an exciting direction where I am really passionate about what I'm working on. Small startup or a larger company I don't care I just want to be excited to do what I'm doing.

More importantly is a question I ask myself too much; Do I go to college for this specific degree and end up getting a job somewhere with those skills, do I go somewhere else I'll enjoy with different people and setting, choose a less specific degree that I could get an equivalent job when I come out of if I keep up with my technical skills, or do I not go to college, keep doing what I'm good at which is meeting people who get me inspired, and usually have a spot for me to work for them. I know college is probably a good idea since imp not quite the Einstein of coding that the NSA is tracking down to hire before college but at this point I just feel too held back by taking general education classes all my first year, being in a place that's not conducive to blowing up in the cyber field. I'm nervous not having a degree but imp more pissed off at the education system that is geared towards people who don't know what they're doing and simply follow the ""cookie cutter"" until they get out with a classic ""business"" degree and work at a normal office job doing simple task and paper work. 
I want to take off right now. I want to bury my head in technical computer security classes, learn to use REAL WORLD tools like nesus and snort, look at monitors for breaches, study business concepts and be able to work with higher ups that can't understand the technical info but can understand me explaining it to them in a simplified way. I want to be around people that don’t waste time and are as passionate as I think I am. I'm the kind of kid that doesn't do what he doesn't want to(to an extent), but when you get me ""inspired"" or I inspire myself with something, I won't leave my room for weeks, I'll tell all my friends and peers about this new amazing idea im obsessed with that could do something cool for them too, Ill devote every second of my time researching and looking how to take the next leap in whatever im doing almost like an addiction but in a healthy way. 

TL;DR Should I continue on the academia path or go try to find an environment with my current skills where I can learn only computer skills that I'm passionate about and are extremely useful.

I have worked in several positions, roles being vital to this organization. 
5 years ago I accepted the job as a Web Manager, we had a Graphic Designer and a that boss oversaw all our work. 

About a year ago the boss left to work somewhere else, our GD (after being with the company 8 years) applied to be the boss, accpeted the interim role for 5 months, applied, interviewed and they hired someone else.GD leaves company. 

Today, I the Web Manager am now doing the job of the GD plus whatever the new boss doesn't know. Basically I am keeping this department functional and on point.

I am giving 110% my time, my work to this workplace. I have asked to be given retro-pay for doing the job of the gd, declined. I have asked to be approved for a new title and higher pay to take on new duties, I got a new title although the pay I asked for (asked for $10K) is a quarter of what I said was my minimum and they are using my degree as a reason why I cannot get the whole ammount. 1K now and 1K after I get my degree. 

TLDR: 
I am doing the job of two positions, being paid for one. ASked for an increase of 10K, but I am only being given 1K now and 1K after completion of my degree. I am also being put on probabtion on a job Ive been doing for the past 3 months.

I have asked for a meeting with CEO to talk about my next steps moving forward. To please increase my pay to my minumum being 8K and to consider my last of work the past month towards the probation period.

I need words of encouragment or at least someone to tell me am I in the wrong about this, I am personally insulted. Should I just quit?"

Here is my situation:



-I was looking for an apartment with a good friend for school but the school's financial aid screwed him over in mid July, leaving me with a few weeks to find a place

-I saw and replied to a Craigslist ad that I was interested in, contacted the OP (his name is Jack), verbally ""*committed*"" to the listing (a four bedroom house by my school) after visibly inspecting the property in person and being okay with it

-About eight days ago I received the contract and noticed that it, to me, was suspect (too much liability, the contract didn't even have amended my move-in and move-out dates, and they refused to give me a subletting option, which I had suggested)

-I learned that I could not meet the other two prospective roommates (including Jack) until after move-in, which would have been after signing the contract: which of course is a massive risk, to move into a house with two complete strangers and one I hardly know)

- A few days ago I learned that the guy I ""verbally committed"" to was lying to the homeowner: over the summer Jack and a friend/tenant (Brandon) were supposed to have paid the rent, however Brandon got an internship in another state which left him contractually obligated to pay of course; they found another guy (Eric) to pay for Brandon's rent living in the house **without ever having Eric's name amended to the lease and without the homeowner ever having learned about it**

-I backed out of the lease two days ago but I didn't tell the broker or the homeowner about Jack infringing the contract, because even though he demonstrated he was not trustworthy according to me, I did not want to screw him over


Now this is where it gets absurd
-I received an email this morning saying, from the homeowner who I've never met or seen, that I now owe him almost $400 because; explicitly: ""[they] were dependent on the commitment that you made to them and they should not be required to brunt the expense incurred on your behalf.""


What is my best course of action? This accusation, to me, is ridiculous: I never signed my name anywhere, nor have I ever even met the owner, who is the person accosting me of owing him money *(and not Jack or the broker)* : verbal agreements as you know are almost impossible to prove: in addition, I have scoured through my emails with the broker (her name is Margaret) and my Facebook messages with Jack to see if I in fact made any concrete, objective proof of such a claim, which I have not found, though of course I may be biased; even from Margaret's own email message forwarded to me, the home owner, and all the tenants from over a week ago, quote: ""... I have been in contact with [my name and my parent's name] and ***they will most likely*** sign the lease in person at our office..."" which in the broker's own words, admits nothing has been demonstrably verified, rather just, in her opinion, a high likelihood, *but not ""they ARE going to, or they WILL BE, for example.*

 
I must apologize if I am being pedantic, but I am prone to overthinking and I have never before been in such a spot. I'm just afraid that they'll take me to court on the assumption that I said *I might* sign the lease, as opposed to them saying that I said *I would* sign the lease- it is important to note that the contract was conducted (and the homeowner himself is facilitated) through a well-known and reputable international realty group (I'm not going to name them, but they are very well known), and considering the nerve of the homeowner to demand I pay him for this ""commitment"", I would not put it past him to want to go to small claims court, even for something so trivial. Though of course I admit a possible bias, it seems to me that I hold all the cards in this argument, and that his (the homeowner's) message to me asking that I pay him this fine is ludicrous. How should I respond to this man?

Full story: it's a news website. I was an intern there for 3 months last year (was graded 8/10), I've freelanced on and off in the past year for them, and a few weeks ago I was asked to freelance for them for 5 days a week for the next few months, which I am happily doing. They also have a job opening for the position of editor. 38 hours a week.

So these guys already know all about me and I already know all about them. I know how they work and what they need, and they know my strengths and weaknesses. I can hit the ground running more than any other candidate (I am already running) and am even able and willing to take a possible pay cut to compensate for a learning period where I level myself up to match my colleagues. I really want this job and for the whole job quest to be over. I've been searching for about 6 months now.

So what do I expect? I've never been in a situation like this one before. Do I lean back? Do I lean forward? Lean somewhere in the middle? Is leaning in the middle even considered leaning? That's just sitting up straight, right? I wasn't expecting an interview at all. We've already had so much contact and worked so much together, what's there to even talk about? Maybe it's just a formality? Maybe they just want to skip to discussing terms? I'm a little lost here. I don't know what's coming.

The interview will be held by the news coordinator and the new editor-in-chief. I already know them both quite well.

Shine a light for me, guys?

Thanks.

EDIT: well I did the interview yesterday. Everything went quite well. It was nice seeing everyone again (it had been a year, only worked with them online through IRC in the meantime) and we had a few laughs. Did a little tour to see what had changed in the office layout and then it was off to the interview. It was half serious and half seeing your old colleagues again. We talked about the job market and stuff. I might have overshared with regards to the difficulty of getting a job these days. Didn't matter in the end. All the serious questions they asked, I had an answer to, thank God. I didn't even prep for these questions but I had a good, confident answer to all of them. I guess that's just due to having worked for them a lot already. Strenghts/weaknesses, what would your ideal job be, what is the site sorely missing in your opinion, all that. Aside from that, they kind of laughingly admitted that it was mostly just following procedure to have me over for an interview, so in a way they were as stumped as I was when it came to what to talk about. I had some questions for them, but they were mostly about commute times, working from home, hours, weekend shifts, that sort of stuff. I really didn't have anything else. I already know it all, not to sound arrogant.

They called me back when I was on the train home. With great regret, my boss said I was not chosen. But that had nothing to do with my qualifications. There was simply another guy who had a wealth of experience and they chose him simply because they get more value for their money. Same old song, I suppose. But he did reaffirm that he is very very happy with my freelance work and would like to keep employing me in this way for a time to come. So what it comes down to is I didn't get a contract, but I am employed in my field part-time as a freelancer and the pay is very good. So that's a good start. That rids me of my money troubles (once they actually pay me, that takes a while), and that's the most important thing in the short term.

That's it, I guess. I'll be freelancing from home next monday like I've already been doing. Saves me a commute, I guess. Thanks /r/jobs! I appreciate the comments!"

I am (will be this year) a senior at a state school in Minnesota. If things go according to plan, I will graduate May '16 with a BS in Information Systems.

This past January, I got lucky enough to land a web development internship at a company just outside of town. It's been absolutely phenomenal, from an experience stand point, to actually having relevant experience on my resume. I work under a senior developer who is incredibly helpful and supportive. I've learned a ton.

The problem is that I feel like, while I've definitely learned a ton in the last year, I'm nowhere near good enough to do this. We started out working with Umbraco &amp; Visual Studio (.NET MVC/C#) and that has been going well. I'm getting the hang of how a site actually runs and what's necessary to hold it together. Together with the other two interns that work here, we managed to put together a simple site for monitoring data collected from machines (oil/gas industry) while we work on the fully featured site. I also personally wrote an entire backend solution for determining weather around said machines based on location and their nearest NOAA reporting station.  Along the way, I've learned a ton about Azure, Active Directory, and a ton of backend/C# knowledge (BLOB storage, Azure Tables, MongoDB, etc.) I can do basic HTML/CSS, and my Javascript is decent. I have a decent eye for design (at least compared to my coworkers and in my own opinion).

Despite all of this, I just feel completely incompetent. It feels like there's ~100 JS frameworks to learn, an equal number of backend configurations, multiple browsers to support (we have to support IE8 here....), 20 different CMS'. I guess I'm just overwhelmed with it all. I have no idea how or where to keep advancing my knowledge beyond what is required of me at work. It seems I have the easiest time learning through doing; I've tried CodeAcademy, and it's great for the basics, but I already know the basics and it seems like I barely retain any of it. I see people making these amazing websites singlehandedly and it seems like I'm nowhere near that level. Is this normal for someone my age? I read posts from kids who are 16, popping out webpages like it's no big deal, and here I am, struggling to make one. I imagine I'll be able to find work when I graduate, but what's the point if I'm not actually good at it? It seems like there's 100 routes to go in the web dev industry, and I have no idea how to start down any of them.

Any advice is appreciated. I don't need links to tutorials or anything, I can use google. I just need some guidance. "

However our code is a huge monolithic piece of spaghetti, we have close to zero coding standards, and the majority of the dev team has the attitude that working code is the same as good code.

I was hired straight out of university, although I have had previous internships. 

While I really enjoy the work environment and the benefits, this place, has really made me appreciate the coding standards, pressure from project managers/QA departments, and red tape that I hated at my internships.

I honestly do not believe the company will survive longer than a few more years considering the quality of code and the number of bugs we release. The owners (whom have no insight into the codebase) are under the impression that our code is solid, but I know for a fact once/if we land a customer there is absolutely no way we will be able to keep up with any service level agreements we make.

When I first started I was very vocal about issues within our codebase, however as the ""new"" guy I really have no weight in arguments so I have just gone heads down trying my best to adhere to what I believe are good practices with respect to what I am working on.

If/when I decide to leave how honest should I be about the fact I thought our codebase was terrible? I am aware its never good to bash your previous employer but I want it to be known I did not agree with many of their practices.

Also would you folks advice I jump ship as soon as possible?

I am currently registered and will be attending a community college next month; I’m mostly decided on my major to be a mechanical engineer, but I have also considered going into computer science.   

Initially, I thought I was making a good decision because community college is cheap and most people claim that you get the same education, if not better, than a 4 year university. I was set, my parents cannot afford 4 year college tuition and I would only be able to afford a year or so with my current savings so being able to go for only $1,500 was a big plus for me. I do plan, however, to switch to a 4 year university for my last 2 years (University of Colorado Boulder). The main problem is that now I am starting to regret my decision.  
 
I went to a college day at the school in June, where we met other students, had an icebreaker session, told us more about the school, and showed us around etc. The whole day I just felt out of place. I’m afraid I will be missing out on “The college experience” going there. It seemed like a big high school, pretty much the “13th grade”.  I know it is going to be cheaper but I feel like having a social life will be nonexistent (the mentality of community college students is WAY different from 4 year students). I get very lonely and upset if I don’t get to hang out with friends very often. And more importantly, I will miss out on opportunities to network and intern.   

So did I make a mistake on going to a CC instead of a 4 year? Should I transfer before completing my two years? Thanks for reading my long post, and for any advice you might have.

I'm going to be a rising 3rd year CS major. At my school (UVA), they separate Data Structures and Algorithms into two courses. I took Data Structures last semester and did well. I'm pretty excited to take Algo this fall.

**My problem:**

After reading about the technical interview process for internships on this sub(mostly ""Big Four""), I felt behind because I was in the middle of my DS course and hadn't even taken Algo yet. I lost hope of getting an internship this summer and tried to do my best to get one next summer. I've been working on personal projects and trying to self-study algorithms.

**Why I'm lost:**

I heard that you should apply for internships by November, but I'd still be in the middle of my Algo course. So, I tried to skip ahead and teach myself algorithms this summer. I realized it's harder than I thought! I tried reading The Algorithm Design Manual cover to cover but I wasn't grasping the material concretely so I stopped. Next, I tried a Stanford course on Coursera. Although I learned some important principles, it's taking me longer than I thought and I'm not super confident in solving algorithmic questions yet.

**Long story short, I feel screwed because it's getting close to the time to apply for summer internships, and I haven't fully grasped algorithms yet.** 

Once school starts next month, I'll be a lot busier. Am I just making excuses because I didn't try hard enough? What should I do?

3f9ay4,0,2015-07-31,Want to contest will for passed aunt. What's my course of action here? - from California,HanSoloMio1,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3f9ay4/want_to_contest_will_for_passed_aunt_whats_my/,"Seeking help for someone who's not too legally minded here. I will be trying to detail my case so you all can have a more informed opinion on me and my situation and advise me more precisely, so I apologize if this comes out long. Any names listed are of course made up for protection.

I learned recently that my aunt Mary had passed away a few months ago, which was a shock to me. She had owned a home out in the country that I used to visit as a kid for years during summers, but I stopped going around the age of 12. I terribly regret I could not find time to visit her during the last 10 years or so. Family situations changed, it's very complicated, but I was not as much an independent as I am now and didn't really have any way to visit her on my own. It was always my intention one of these days within the past few years, but I had moved onto university. Her brothers (all deceased) owned their own business which was pretty successful, making that whole side of the family pretty well off from what I can gather. I can recall her sister Freda living an extravagant lifestyle, including trips to London numerous times.

Anyway, as you might guess, she left behind a pretty hefty sum. She died leaving behind no children, never married. In the will, she apparently left her bank account at a specific bank to Freda. The copy of the will I have received shows that for me and my brother, she apparently left her dog (who, afaik, has long since passed away) and $5,000 to take care of it. It also shows that there is a petition on behalf of Freda, calling on her son Mark to act as the administrator of my aunts estate. From my assumption here, this implies that Mary had an account with another bank with money that is being left unclaimed? I am not entirely clear. But the very fact she needs to set up this petition at all seems to me to be a sign she isn't 100% intended to be receiving this money.

This is where I come in. I could really use that money. I had previously inherited a good sum nearly a decade ago now when my grandmother passed away, and I have been extremely grateful over the years that this money helped with my education.  But unfortunately, with university and living expenses, among other things for my family, that money is currently standing at only around $4,000. I am in a very dire situation right now and soon won't even be able to afford my rent. To make my situation more clear before anyone thinks $4,000 is enough if you are frugal and money conscience, let me explain my situation and why I am looking to contest this estate in my favor.

1. I have a business startup that I am passionate about and looking to move forward with. With the funding I could obtain from my aunt's estate, this would allow me to have money to make this current dream a reality, and provide a nice safety net. 
2. At present, I have no funds to go ahead with starting up this business, and am in terrible debt due to owed credit card payments from university. I'm talking $16,000 in debt. Since it is never a good idea to try starting a business when you are in debt, I am stuck indefinitely putting that business plan on hold until I can pay off this debt. But with my current expenses of living, added to my not so well paying job, I can't afford to pay that debt off anytime soon. This debt I can only afford the minimum payments each month, and with the added interest due to the high amount, about half of these payments are in fact just the interest. I am getting nowhere.
3. Add to this that my brother has a bill that totals to the same. He got a great opportunity to relocate to another country and work there, but unfortunately the tax system there makes it so he gets a considerable cut from his pay each month. This is one additional reason why the previous inheritance that we used to have has dwindled; I am paying for his university charges to his card for over a year now, or else he wouldn't even be able to afford his rent each month.
4. My mother completely lost any savings around the time I originally obtained the previously mentioned inheritance. I started paying for her and her bills from the instant we got that inheritance. But it has been nearly 10 years now. It is a huge burden on me with how low my account is now as she has very expensive bills, and I am not talking extravagances at all. Just regular life. I end up having to sacrifice around $800 or more a month just to support her. She has previously tried to get a job, but has ended up missing every opportunity due to being tech illiterate. She doesn't know how to work a PC at all, and the few times I have tried to help her when I am free, no one ever calls back. 
5. I have a fiance now, and she has absolutely no savings. I am her sole source of money now. I have recently paid off her recent summer university session fees, which totaled $7,000. Add to that I also pay for the both of us to live. I am the sole payer for our rent, which is ridiculously expensive out here, but I stay behind so that I am not separated from her and also because her home is too far away from her university. I also pay her bills because her family is very low income. Not a strong background, and I am honestly a savior for them since I have shown up as the school does not want to give her much funding anymore, apparently. She has tried to get a job, but ends up having to quit as her studies in addition to internships and volunteer work piles up too much to allow the time.

So as you might assume, I have a lot of financial responsibility for more than just my personal expenses. It honestly is killing me, and for that reason I am wanting to contest this will and claim the estate for myself. There is not one single person besides myself (and my brother) listed in my aunt's will that are near my age, while everyone else is well into retirement. That is another reason I just do not see them necessarily needing the money, while there is a relative over here (me) that is literally about to go broke. 

The will itself lists that Mark, who again, Freda has appointed as administrator for the estate for this petition, has me and my brother listed as not being ""operative testamentary instruments."" I am assuming this means they are trying their best to keep my out of this. But I surely have an opportunity, correct?

If anyone can guide me how best to go about this, I would appreciate it. There is a court date for this petition in a three weeks, and I have every intention of showing up. If legaladvice could tell me what my options are, how best to set up my case, and what I should be researching, I would be eternally grateful.

**TLDR;** In serious debt, aunt recently passed and left hefty estate, her sister has appointed her son as administrator of the estate in a petition that will be held in court in three weeks. Me and my brother are only relatives in entire family not at retirement age. Wondering how best to claim estate so I can escape debt and start up my business for a better future."

Building includes constructing the robots from the ground up.

I started here at the beginning of this year and I replaced a recent masters graduate.  When I originally signed on, myself and the professor were unsure whether there would be funding to pay me, and I was simply wanting to be involved to learn.  Around the time the masters student graduated, more funding came in and I was asked to work full time.  

At Intel I was paid about $28 an hour as a software engineering intern, and I had just finished my sophomore year, so I was very inexperienced.  Additionally, when I was a freshman, I was paid $12 at this university to do desktop support IT work.  This internship I am in now is the first job I've had in which I don't have an idea of when I want to quit, I like what I do.  However, I am only paid about $9 an hour.

I've been working here for more than 6 months, and my contract ends at the end of the summer, but my professor/manager has told me that they ""need"" me.  I've received offers recently to return to Intel, but I declined because I enjoyed this job more than I would the one at Intel.  I figure this is a perfect opportunity to negotiate my pay.  

Please tell me if I am looking at this with a skewed perspective, I want to see the reality of my situation.  This is concerning me because the most similar wage I've earned was at a movie theater as a teen making $8.50 an hour.  

So the question is, am I viewing this appropriately?  What tips/advice do you have for me to negotiate? What should I say/don't say?  I've been thinking I should tell her how much I made at Intel and how much I made doing IT work at the university and try to negotiate something in between.  I know they can't afford what Intel would pay me, but I like it here more.  

Sorry if my thoughts are not organized well, I'll answer any questions you have to help you answer mine.  Thank you."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Is Germany really the nearest “safe country”? What’s your opinion of people who say these are economic refugees who want to live off German welfare?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmwrs0?context=5)|Maybe not the nearest safe country, but certainly the richest.
 |I'm afraid some of them really are. They have been told their entire life that the West is a magical place where milk and honey flow in the rivers.Their traffickers also made them a lot of promises. So they come here with huge expectations which we can't meet because we are on a really tight budget. One boy told me that he doesn't want to work because the German state after all pays for all of his expenses.
 |The majority is just glad that they got out of the hellholes they came from. Many have scars all over their bodies, one guy misses an eye, another one has a gunshot wound. Poverty certainly also was an aspect that led to them coming here, but it is not the only reason.
[Do you feel as though you are a part of something which is benefitting the German community? Or would you agree that the welcome extended to economic refugees is purely altruistic and that it is of no benefit to Germans?  Or possibly detrimental?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn6ykr?context=5)|Sure, we want them to become productive members of society, taxpayers. 
[What would you estimate the success rate to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn79ea?context=5)|I really don't know. There are certainly some who will have a hard time making it here.
[Do the boys have any real chance of having a normal life in the years to come?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmxa0x?context=5)|If they work hard they have the chance to live a normal life. Some of them are slackers who don't make any effort at all to learn the German language. They will have a really hard time in the future.
 |Others also may be deported when they turn 18. We have a boy from Bangladesh here who might be gone in October. Also, Afghanistan is considered to be a safe country of origin, sounds crazy, right? So the Afghans might have to go to.
 |Coming back to the question: the younger ones have enough time to go to school, get a job and lead a normal life. The older they are the harder it will be.
[Why would they go all that way just to make no effort at all once they get there? Do you think this is the indicative of the perception that the European countries they specifically try to get to (not the first they come across\) have overly generous welfare systems that don't require you to work in order to survive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmza92?context=5)|Yes, but it really is a very small minority.
[Do they have much, if any, contact with their family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn79uf?context=5)|Yes, they talk to them all the time if they still have a family, some of them are orphans.
[So what do you do with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn4dkw?context=5)|We show them pictures of overcrowded camps and tell them that we will send them there if they act up.
 |We also tell them that their asylum application might be denied if they don't show the will to be a productive part of Society.
[Are the orphans at risk of being sent back, like if they're from Afghanistan? Would they ever be put up for adoption or just spend their whole childhood in those homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn7l8a?context=5)|Well, who would want to adopt a sixteen-year-old Afghan? They stay here till they are 18. They won't be sent back while they are still minors.
[Hey thanks for this. What do you find the average German's opinion is on immigration in your small Bavarian town? I hear that Bavaria is pretty conservative and doesn't want refugees.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmvxrs?context=5)|The average Germans here are pretty divided on that topic. Most welcome refugees from war-torn countries but people who ""only"" come here to escape poverty from for example states of the Balkans are often frowned upon.
 |A small minority wants all gone, they argue that we have enough problems of our own and shouldn't waste money on people who they think abuse our social security system.
 |In general I was really surprised about the outpour of help from the community. A lot of people donate clothes and their time to help. Our neighbours for example gave us an old foosball table and a sofa.
[You've stated repeatedly that these kids are we'll off in many cases. Can you understand how the hypocrisy would irk people?  These aren't refugees, they are economic migrants. Why do you not see that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn58u5?context=5)|The ones well off are almost exclusively from Syra. Being well off doesn't protect you from being hit by a bullet.
[Have problems ever arisen between boys of different nationalities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctnad1s?context=5)|Yes, Afghans apparently hate Pakistani and vice versa. But when they got to know each other better this wasn't really a problem anymore.
 |The Syrians also had some kind of feeling of superiority over the other boys because they were better educated and were overall better adjusted to Western manners. The Afghans really don't like this kind of smugness and we had physical confrontations because of that.
 |But you can't in general expect that everybody gets along just fine, there always will be some Tension.
[Tell us more about these physical confrontations and verbal spats? To what degree were these confrontations physical? Surely you have some anecdotal stories you can share with us.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctnezrq?context=5)|It is basically always the same two boys. The Afghan guy is an analphabet and has a really hard time learning German. He is very self-conscious about it and the only coping mechanism he has when he gets into an argument is punching. The Syrian guy doesn't simply like him and provokes him often 
[What have been some of the more stark stories that you have come across?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmzqae?context=5)|One boy lost his family in an earthquake years ago. He moved in with an uncle who abused him and wanted to marry him to his apparently hidious daughter. So he escaped.
 |Other boys talk about the way they were threatened by the Taliban. One of them was shot by the Taliban and still has a visible scar, another one has a scar from being hit with the butt of a rifle.
 |We of course can't verify if these stories are true, but considering the way they behave, they certainly had a hard time back home.
[How did you start? What's the biggest challenge that faces you every day? EDIT: wording.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmtphf?context=5)|Well I didn't get a decent teaching position so I applied for this job. Since we are basically overrun by refugees, qualified personell is sparse and anybody with an educational background will be hired.
 |The biggest challenge I'd say is to find something useful to do for the boys. They are not allowed to work and just today the holidays started so they won't go to school for 6 weeks. So we have to make sure that they won't get cabin fever.
[Would it be useful to connect to Boy Scouts/Cub Scouts or something similar? They already have activities designed to engage and teach boys in more fun and playful ways. It might be a good way to also help build a bridge socially between these boys and the other local boys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmy386?context=5)|We have already reached out to a lot of local sports clubs. Some of them now play soccer with German boys, other play Handball or Badminton.
[How hard is the road to get to Europe? Is there much abuse that goes on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmxir1?context=5)|Depends how much money you have. Some of the Boys come from rather well off families and spent only a few weeks on the road, the others needed up to one year to make their way from Afghanistan to Germany.
 |What most Boys talk about is how often they had to go to bed hungry. Some tell that they got abused by local Police in different countries.
[Abused in what way (physically, emotionally, sexually\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmzidw?context=5)|Some of them told me that they were beaten, most don't want to talk about this at all. A lot of them certainly are traumatized and urgently need a therapy.
[Do they get help when they are traumatized? Many of them must have PTSD, and will never really have a normal life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn24oe?context=5)|Yes, but they have to wait up to 6 months to see a therapist.
[What are the housing conditions like for the refugees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmvv0z?context=5)|They are ""lucky"" that they are unaccompanied minors. They have it way better than adults who often live in crowded camps or maybe even in tents. We live in a house and two boys respectively have to bunk together in one room. We have a garden, two kitchens, a huge living room with TV. Couldn't be better.
[Why are there still asylum seekers living in tents in sought-after cities (Munich\) when there are so many vacant flats in Eastern Bavaria? Wouldn't it be more economical for the big cities to outsource and pay for accommodation elsewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn2e87?context=5)|Bureaucracy I'm afraid. We are in Germany after all :/
[What is your view on the whole immigration debate? How do you deal with the massive influx of refugees, do you think it's sustainable and what course of action (if any\) do you support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmy3rk?context=5)|Well, countries like Turkey host way more refugees than any European country, so we will manage. I think we are only battling the symptoms, the best way of action is to improve the living conditions in the countries they are fleeing from.
[Also, what political or bureaucratic change would have the most positive impact for your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmy3rk?context=5)|The bureaucratic change I'd like to see most is that they should be allowed to work or take internships. 
[What are the biggest differences to your work as a Lehrer? Did you ever imagine the work would captivate you so much? As of tomorrow, I will finally be a qualified Erzieher. How does the work compare to the job of a Hortner in a Grundschule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctn8tpx?context=5)|The hours are certainly different. I often have to work on the weekends or stay over the night. But when I leave my workplace, I don't have to grade tests or prepare lessons which is nice.
 |I knew the Job would be demanding, but it also has a lot of nice moments.
 |I don't know what a Hortner is ;) 
[Where are all of the boys counterparts (girls\)? Is there another group that is girls only or are there no girls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/ctmz7gz?context=5)|There are almost no girls. Families wouldn't send a girl on the way alone because something might happen to them. Also, this might sound a bit harsh, but when they only have enough money to send one child they rather choose a son.

3fbelf,4,2015-07-31,"Applied for a fulltime position, was offered an internship.",oneAngrySonOfaBitch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3fbelf/applied_for_a_fulltime_position_was_offered_an/,"I'm having a weird experience with a very good company. I have a masters in electrical engineering and applied to a full time software development position, I was then contacted by a campus recruiter and told that I was being considered for a 4 month intern-ship instead. I then did two interviews with devs who said that the intern-ship role didn't make sense for me because I'm a graduate and I wasn't given a coding interview because they don't require one for interns. 

I'm now not sure what to think of this. I feel like my work and academic experience isn't being valued at all. 

I have a couple of questions.

* Is this what an EE should expect from trying to break into the software development world ?

* Should I try and negotiate the hourly salary that i'm being offered ? , it turns into about $16K (With housing) CAD for 4 months about $12246.46 USD.

* Should I try to reach out to the devs in the company who said I should be in the full time stream and maybe see if I can come in for a coding interview ?

I'd love to get a second opinion on this.

3fcqmm,5,2015-07-31,First job offer out of college. What do i do?,yayyyygotit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3fcqmm/first_job_offer_out_of_college_what_do_i_do/,"Background,

Based in BOSTON.

On F1 visa.

University of Massachusetts.

3.4 GPA.

Paid internship in summer 2014. Was paid $40/hr. Manager was a jerk and behaved like one when i turned down his part time offer for the project I worked on with him and gave me a negative feedback. Hint : It's a big ass company that pays over 130k to its new hires.

May 2015. I graduate.

Not a lot of interviews.(5) Rejection from Microsoft and Apple after onsites. I go back to my country depressed. 

Come back on july 10th. Start spamming resumes again.

Lo-behold. 9 interviews in one week including one at google ( yay). 3 rejections after HR because  "" we are looking for someone with more experience"" and two "" we dont sponsor visa( hello, I am on a 27 month OPT , i dont need a visa ).

Out of 6 HR interviews I cleared, I have two technical interviews including google ( yay!) lined up for monday . 

I have given 4 tehcnical interviews after coming back on 10th. Got invited for face to face interviews for all 4. Got rejected at one, bad experience. Gave another one on monday. Got an offer today and have 2 more lined up.

This is how the offer looks like,

Base Salary : 84000 .

Sign up Bonus : 10000

RSUs : 2500 units ( company's stock is on a roller coaster and has been trading between 18-30 in last 6 months)

Unlimited Pay Time Off.

401k sucks but yeah.


Rated as one of the best places to work at in boston ( Awesome awesome office). but the company has made small losses in last 8 quarters  



-------------------------------

So yeah out of 4, I have one rejection ( screw them , rude people) , one offer ( I guess I will love it here) , 2  upcoming onsites ( world's largest asset management firmed based in Wilmington,DE) and Cerner ( they are flying me in on 20th august for the experience cerner day)

-------------------------------


Is the salary good enough for Boston for a new hire? I know I wll properly get a better paying job but I dont value money much as much as a visa sponsorship in future!

--------------------

I am going to keep interviewing but I just wanted to know if the offer i have is good for Boston.


--------------

YAY I AM HAPPY  i know sound like a teenage guy who has had his first kiss but yeah whatever :D
