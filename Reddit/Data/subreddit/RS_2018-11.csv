Thanks a million to r/cscareerquestions. I've been lurking this thread since before I took my first programming course, and now I've accepted an offer for C1's TDP Internship. The knowledge I've gained from this sub has been priceless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty torn between the Richmond and McLean Office for my internship, and am looking to have a few questions answered to help me determine my preference list. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which location is better for the overall internship experience?

How does the culture between the two locations compare?

Which one of the offices in McLean are TDP interns likely to be placed in?

If an intern is offered a full-time TDP position after graduation, is it usually at the location they interned at, or is it pretty flexible? I'd much rather live in McLean/Plano than Richmond.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

I have worked non-stop and dealt with immense amounts of stress. And still, in the process of applying for summer internships, I have received almost 0 initial responses (and many, many instant rejections). I have redone my resume 5 times with positive feedback from Google and Microsoft recruiters and engineers.

This is incredibly stressful and honestly it feels like I can't do anything more. It feels like literally no matter what, I am not good enough, and I never will be.

Is it too late for me?,misanthropy-isboring,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9t7442/22_and_directionless_i_want_honesty_is_it_too/,"I have absolutely nothing going for me. I've found myself unable to muster the willpower to push through university/college courses. I consistently get As in college coursework but dread class each and every morning, ending in lower grades because of attendance issues or withdrawing from the course altogether. I have been to a university and two community colleges now and have dropped out from each after withdrawing my full course load.

I have been unable to find a job and largely been unemployed for the past five years. I spent four months dishwashing at a small diner, but various factors led to quitting that job as well. I have applied over a hundred times to the lowliest positions imaginable and received virtually no responses. The employers who have responded were quick to discard me after the first interview.

I dropped out of high school and isolated myself from my social group, believing that I might find a better fit in college or university. That has not happened and I've essentially been alone for the past five years. I've spent my past five birthdays alone.

I initially dropped out of the educational system with the reasoning that it was largely a scam (still rings true), figuring that I could do a better job educating myself with the numerous resources available to me. While I still believe this, I realize that I'm heading down a path that will likely end in prolonged homelessness and desperation, and possibly early death without any positive experiences.

I was on-track to manage the campus radio station's music department, but wound up leaving the university before I could accomplish that. I wrote a number of long-form articles for the station which were well-received and considerably higher quality than they've received in the past. During my time on campus, I majored in philosophy and specialized in philosophy of language.

But I'm entirely incapable of handling the day-to-day life associated with a nine-to-five and have extreme difficulties completing tasks in front of and alongside people. I find myself overwhelmed by social responses and behaviors. Over a prolonged period of time, social tasks become grating to the point of incoherence. I have come to the conclusion that I might be unfit for a career in the general workforce. I don't want to be an unpaid intern, shuffling coffee cups in a car and pushing aside my own ambition and interest in order to satisfy some higher-ups. I don't want to wake up only to dread the office hours every morning.

I've thought about pursuing a career in journalism, where I can largely put my head down and type, re-type, edit and publish, and re-enrolling in a community college to enter the program before transferring again to a university. But I'm honest about my situation and the task of comparing my resume against others who have done far more in a considerably smaller window of time. I'm also trying to be honest about my ability to fit in to such a situation. Is there a path ahead for me? What could it even look like?

The competitiveness of the workforce and employment market frightens me. There are tens of millions of people with stacked resumes, the intelligence to rival anybody and the will to do what I cannot. I want love, friends, and family, and I realize that I need to work like anybody else to achieve these things. But my world looks dark and I'm having trouble finding the path forward.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

After a few days I'm more calm about it then I was when writing the following.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning/evening/afternoon/night reddit!

So I've posted here before with something that happened at my intership at a IT servicedesk. Here I'm back with another story that happened recently. Some eleboration on the company if you haven't read my other post. You could skip this part if you'd like:

The company issues laptops to every employee, these laptops are however still owned by the company. You have to give them back once your contract is terminated. If a laptop breaks for whatever reason you get a loan laptop until your one is fixed. You can choose to not get a loan one but you can't pick between them. We have older models ready as loan laptops and no other ones(No exceptions).

So this lady a bitlocker key issue, she called ahead and told us she had to enter an unlock key. Sure, this happens from time to time and we could fix this within an hour if she came by. So we asked her to come by so we could fix the issue, as giving this key over the phone wouldn't be feasable. She said she could not come by because of an injury she had. After a hassle and about 5-10min of talking about that it just wouldn't be possible without her coming by she said she would get her husband to take her. Because with her injury she couldn't drive.

So she arrived about 15-20min later looked just fine but alright not all injuries show that you are actually injured. So without issues she threw her company issued laptop on the table and said to fix it. So I took the laptop and said it would take about 20min to retrieve the key. As we need another employee to get them for us, that person was at a different location so I had to send a skype(Yes we use skype for business) message to him and had to wait. Calling wasn't possible as he wasn't at his desk and didn't have a cellphone with him.

So I told her all of this and said: ""Ugh that takes way too damn long, just get me a loan laptop so I can atleast work! And keep the laptop here!""

Uhmm okay I responded with: ""It's company policy that for fixing software related issues that take less than an hour that the employee stays with us incase we need you to test things.""

She declined and insisted she had to go for about 10 minutes which ended with her calling her supervisor. Which is fine I suppose, so I called mine to make an exception for her as I was having a difficult day. My supervisor approved this, she came back mad almost threw her phone into my hand and said her supervisor was on the phone and I had to talk to him. I said that my supervisor already approved us keeping her company issued laptop until hers was fixed.

""Ow okay then, hurry up so I can go"", she took the phone back and I just started getting a loan laptop out of our storage. I came back and instantly she asked: ""Uhmm, is that laptop heavier than my current one? I can't carry heavy things now!"" These laptops were indeed a bit heavier, about 1.2x heavier. So I said: ""Yes it's a bit heavier."", she didn't even try she used one finger to lift it a bit and said: ""No we can't do this! It's way too heavy! THIS WONT WORK!!"". I said this is the only loan laptop we have. She did not agree: ""Uhmm no I \*\*need\*\* to work with a laptop! Get me a different one."". I insisted that this wasn't possible so I took the laptop back.

She just instantly went away leaving her laptop there and just saying: ""I'll contact my supervisor about this, awful awful service. Can't even consider that not everyone is a f\*cking body builder.""

Well, fine I guess! Leave without a laptop, I can continue doing my job just fine. I did send my supervisor a mail about this whole thing so he would be prepared to get an email about her supervisor about this. I was a bit agitated about this afterwards as I was also this a student and an intern and this made me very uncomfortable."

I’m currently a sophomore majoring in computer science at a decent sized college in Indiana. Right now, I’m trying my best to go for as many internships as possible as I know the real world experience would be fantastic. My biggest dream is to go out west towards Colorado or California as there are so many companies there that would be amazing. Obviously though, California is a huge step up from Indiana and that comes with a price hike. Is it common for employers to provide free housing in general, and then to an extreme case like me that’s coming from across the country? 

Thanks to everyone and anyone that can give any advice. "

First-time job seeker here! I imagine there are a lot of post from people looking for advice, so I will try to make this as efficient as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

**Me**

* Quantitative discipline doctoral student graduating in the next 4 months currently writing my thesis AND working a part-time data science internship (good work, but basically learning how to use SQL and usual data practices in Python; no model development or statistical work)
* Previous work experience working at a medical company performing simulations and helping create processes for testing compliance with regulations
* Graduate school experience included writing programs in MATLAB and Python for data cleaning and analysis
* Minimal experience making regressions and models (I've spent the past year learning about machine learning in my spare time and understand the concepts, but do not have a significant Github portfolio)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Desired Job**

* Entry-level data scientist position a large company in a role that focuses on understanding data and building models for customer products
* Working on a team under more experienced Data Scientists to learn technical skills and corporate environment details
* Located in NYC, SF, or DC
* Preferably earning $100K or more (I have a decent amount of debt from undergrad)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Experience So Far**

* In two months (Sept and Oct), applied to 100+ positions through a combination of LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, and in-person career fairs
* Received many rejections within hours of applying from the big companies (Twitter, Uber, etc.)
* Received 3 interviews - one with an ad-tech company, one with a financial services company, one with a data consulting company

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

* Given my limited time to develop my portfolio outside of work, what are the most important things to convey on my resume to try to get an interview?
* Does anyone have any advice on how to do a job hunt for a location in which you don't live? (Applying online is not working out well for me)"
9tapdh,2,2018-11-01,Should I move Cross-Country next semester?,warinmymind94,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/9tapdh/should_i_move_crosscountry_next_semester/,"F24 I'm from rural PA and will graduate this May in a dual degree in Bio and Psychology. I take online classes. For my last semester I have the option if doing a 150 hour unpaid internship, which is something that financially is not the best idea. The problem is even with an internship it is very hard to get a full time job in my area unless I commute 1.5 hours one way. I'm better with money and am able to live with my mom or relatives that live near my mom for free. I have been doing this and working diligently this semester, but found myself slammed with 5 page papers and heaps of time consuming busywork everyday. In my free time, I run a small online store flipping items for a profit. It requires less hours and pays more than the full time jobs I could get right now (like at Target or grocery stores). The problem is that I do not want to live at home forever and that I have always wanted to move out of state. Like, to the south. Louisiana or Texas from Pennsylvania. I volunteered for a week in Louisiana and really enjoyed the area and the people. When I started job searching there, I found that they had several full time entry level jobs in my field, and that they paid the same or better than my area in PA. What's different was that the cost of living was drastically cheaper than my area. Apartments near me in PA start out at around 850/month plus utilities. In Louisiana, there's apartments for around $600 month that include some ultities. They're far nicer than what's up here for $900 a month. Gas in Louisiana is cheaper too, about 2.40/gal versus PA around 2.99/gal. Utilities are slightly cheaper and all other bills would be about the same as PA. Next semester theoretically should not have too large of a workload, so I was thinking of getting a part time job in my field while taking classes. this was I could start getting ""experience"" sooner and at least get some paycheck. as great as internships are, I really just need that time for homework or my online shop. college is too expensive and I will have around $33k of student debt. Moving to the other areas of PA that have the jobs and internships is more costly. Plus I hate the big cities and the cold weather. Commuting 5 days a week is a lot time wise, but also in gas expenses. So I was thinking, just move to Louisiana (or Texas) before my last semester starts and finish the online classes down there. get a small apartment, and get a part time job. then when I graduate get a full time job. meanwhile, I can keep running my online store at my own pace. I'm scared to leave the safety net of home and logistically its gonna be hard to move that far away. U-haul won't rent to my car and its very expensive to hire moving companies, Pods, or someone to drive a rental truck down there.I checked the costs. I will need to drive my subcompact down.I pretty thrift shop/ discount savvy so I can probably find very cheap / free furniture in Louisiana when I am there. the only thing I would have to pack is some clothes, shoes, bedding, and my laptop. my other option is to wait until around graduation in may, and just move down then. my friends think it will be better to go now. my boyfriend said he is willing to move with me, and then split the cost of rent and that he would fully cover all utility bills. he's attached to his big old dressers and has a cat. pets make finding apartments much harder as many do not allow them. I personally hate the cat, as it is a mean and old cat that claws me for no reason. litter boxes always grossed me out, and his cat never covers his business, stinking up the whole place. so while the move itself will be challenging, there's a lot of promise in Louisiana. Or I could stay in PA for the semester and try to save more money up. starting a career in PA to me would be pointless, and I already decided if I have to stay in PA to get a job totally outside of my field where the start pay is $15 /hour plus great benefits. we have a family friend that could get me in. sorry for the rant, I'm scared to flee the nest and also terrified that for whatever reason they bog me down with so much busywork academically that it makes life tough. this semester for some reason is awful with so so many papers and only 2 days to do each (example she assigns Monday and due Wed). I know for sure when I graduate then I have all the time in the world to work."

To give some background, I am currently a junior and anticipating to imminent arrival of college applications for next year. My grades are good and I’m hoping to do well on the SAT which I am taking in December. However, the one thing worrying me right now are my ECs. I run cross country and track (though not sure if I will continue to do track because I don’t like it as much as xc), I am part of some clubs, nothing major, and I am a member a few honor societies at my school. Recently, after discussing some things with friends of mine, they told me that internships, especially for something you are interested in, are good to show. I plan on going in and studying computer science in college; however, right now I do not know much code (should’ve taken comp sci). If I were to perhaps at least teach myself a basic understanding of it by summer time, would an internship at a local university be good? If this does not happen, how do college courses during the summer look?

I've been looking at rooms to sublet for the past few weeks and have narrowed it down to two rooms. The rent price is the same for both and they're both in the same neighborhood, but I am struggling to choose between the two.

Below are the pros for each apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Apartment A:**

* I like the girl I would be renting from better (more friendly)
* Probably not very important, but the decor is nicer in general
* Less problematic commute (3 different buses to choose from, as opposed to one for apartment B)
* Cable available
* More potential for a social life (roommates seem more outgoing and occasional parties in the basement)

**Apartment B:**

* Newly renovated, so heating bill may be cheaper
* Lower utilities bill (they only pay for heating and electricity, Apartment A also pays for water)
* 2 bathrooms for 3 girls (VS 1 bathroom for 3 girls in apartment A)
* Guaranteed 2 housemates (one room remains to be sublet in Apartment A)

&amp;#x200B;

Other than the commute aspect, I know Apartment B makes more sense because there are two bathrooms and will most likely be cheaper. But I am worried I won't get along with the other roommates as much. I'm naturally very shy and reserved, so I like the potential for more of a social life at Apartment A.

Which one should I choose? "

The thing is, I've applied for their ""tech"" internship, which had multiple sections, but I was ultimately interviewing for the web-development team.

My end goal is to be a full-stack engineer so I've been preparing myself with Node (JS guy back to front) and I feel like I'm getting stuck with front-end positions. My previous two internships included one information  systems internship which was pretty active in both front and back end, and my latter one (currently in) is primarily web-development (at another large media company). Will I have an issue in transitioning to become a full-stack engineer once I start applying for entry positions? Just looking for a way to properly transition to a full-stack applicant (shifting toward the backend since it's what I really enjoy).

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience moving to a full-stack role that caters to both front and back-end from starting with only front-end web-developer roles?"

This year I’m in and out of a school assessing and testing a few students. Yesterday when talking with one of the teachers, she began venting about what a tough job it is. Eventually saying she understands why the retention rate for teachers in schools is so low. 

I know from working with her she was just blowing off steam, and really enjoys her job. But after thinking it over, it’ll soon be part of my job to be a resource for teachers like her. 

So what are some things you wish your school psychologist did? How can they help you more? What do they do that you love or hate?

I was brought into the US when I was four year olds. I'm a Mexican citizen. I've never been in trouble with the law, and I'll be graduating with a BS in mathematics in a few months. Unfortunately I have zero relevant work experience (such as an engineering internship) under my belt since I can't hold a job legally in this country. Even with a STEM degree, I feel like there's nothing I can do here to pursue a career unless I marry someone and gain legal residency.

I do have family in Mexico, but I haven't seen them in over 15 years. I speak Spanish fluently. No disabilities, but I would still like to have affordable healthcare in the case of an emergency (I do have health insurance in the states, but the deductible is much more than I can afford so I only use it for yearly physical exams).

I've thought about getting a TEFL certificate and teaching abroad somewhere else, but I feel that I'd only be postponing my situation. I want to settle down somewhere legally, have a career, and just live my life. I'm open to the idea of going back to Mexico and finding a job for around 2 years while I figure out how to go somewhere else (in case I don't like living in Mexico).

I'm socially liberal and love the outdoors, warm weather, etc. Of all the places I've researched, I could see myself staying comfortably in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Costa Rica, and some parts of Mexico.

Would TEFL be a good idea? If not, what kind of jobs and career paths should I pursue while in Mexico to become better qualified for permanent residency from one of the countries I've listed?

I'm pretty open, and I know I'm a few years away from being able to emigrate to Australia/Spain. But what should I be doing in the meantime, to ensure I get a chance in another country besides Mexico?"
9tdl0a,11,2018-11-01,How a guy went from super shy with little to no friends to speaking in front of thousands of people,tommy_9,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9tdl0a/how_a_guy_went_from_super_shy_with_little_to_no/,"So I am a Cinematographer, which is a role in the film making process who is in charge of painting the image of a film using lights and cameras. I recently graduated high school and moving into college, but while I'm in college, I needed to find some internship, job, or volunteer service where I can practice my skills. My ultimate goal is to be some sort of film teacher where I can teach student filmmakers the skills I learned from my experiences in the film industry.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out, my local church was looking for camera operators for their live services so I decided to volunteer there and work my way up to their film department (it's a really big church). I start volunteering there a lot and try to work my way up at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this church, there's two main pastors who switch off every week, who we'll call Matt and Chris. Since this is such a big church, it's hard to learn what these two pastors were like after the service (unless if you knew them personally or talked to them after the service). However, because I work camera operation behind the scenes, I get to see who these people really were when they weren't preaching and here's what I learned:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with Matt; he was extroverted, happy and calm. He would always try to learn about everyone who works behind the scenes so it was likely you'd talk to him at least once.

&amp;#x200B;

For Chris, the first time I saw him he was standing in the corner in the dark looking down at the floor while everyone was talking. This was really weird because when he goes up to the podium during sermon, he would preach confidently about the Lord and Jesus and stuff like that. I asked around to see why he was shy normally but passionate and loud on the podium. Turns out, he was super shy and introverted growing up. He had little friends and wouldn't participate too much in school. During his later years in school, he really wanted to preach about the Bible but it was hard to do so when he's super shy and had social anxiety. So he just started practicing and practicing. He said it was a huge struggle for him personally but because he did something about it instead of nothing, he became the pastor he wanted to be.

&amp;#x200B;

This was really influential for me (and I hope for you guys too) since I want to become a teacher and its hard to do that when I'm shy, I was thinking I could never do it at the time but this story helped me realize I could do it if I put my heart to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story: don't let your shyness deprive you from becoming what you want to be"

After receiving some incredible advice (and a couple snarky comments), I sat down and talked with my boss about some of the issues I've been dealing with regarding clients and their interactions with me. For one of the clients I specifically mentioned, he wasn't surprised with the actions of the client (i.e. the client somewhat regularly calls people pet names like sunshine), but said he would discuss what is and is not appropriate with them. I don't have any issues with confrontation, and if the client continues to behave inappropriately I feel as if I have the tools and resources necessary to talk to him myself now!

Something I didn't mention last time is that my boss has known me since I was an intern (his first intern ever) and thinks highly of my capabilities and would absolutely do what it takes to make sure the office is a comfortable place to be. During our meeting I also discussed some of the other workplace stressors and hindrances that will soon be resolved!

Because of this, I had the idea of doing some freelance work to see what being a software developer is like. However, as most of my experience is from learning algorithms, data structures, etc, I don't actually know all that much about the workflow of a complete project, or even what kind of things a freelancer would be expected to do. I feel like a lot of the more ""practical"" aspects of programming are lost on me, and I want to see what I'm missing out on while doing some actual work along the way. Now, with this goal in mind, I thought that becoming a freelancer sounded like a good idea, after all, most places don't offer internships or jobs to people who can't even drive yet.

I'm coming to Reddit since I've kind of just been dropped into the adult world and don't have much understanding of how moving countries and just generally how anything works, and I never really thought it was feasible since my family is quite poor (family of 7, &lt;£16k annual income) but I managed to get into a university which is just below Oxbridge when it comes to my course.

So now comes the question of how, and the overall plan of achieving this. Let's assume by the end of my course (4 year masters) I come out with a 2:1 / a first and I've got an internship under my belt and I work every summer. I've already got a pretty hefty CV under my belt so these things shouldn't be too difficult.

Are there any internship schemes that mean I could work in America during my studies? Should I stay at home? What kind of salary should I be on before I make the move? At what age / overall savings would I be able to comfortably make the move? Do I apply for a job before I move there? Would getting into stocks be smart? What are the milestones I should be trying to hit? Is there anything else I need to know?

I graduate last year with a degree in Computer Science. I never had much internship/work experience because I switched my third year and was busy with classes over the summer.

I spent the last year working 2 temporary dev jobs and most recently an internship in SF, two of which were not really beneficial to my development as a programmer due to company politics and the team I worked in kinda just ignored me.

For the interviews for these positions, I kind of felt like I never really fully ""learned"" the skills I needed to but kinda just crammed enough to where I could get the position.

&amp;#x200B;

**The dilemma now:**

Since my internship ended a month ago, I am looking for a full-stack dev job (JS, AngularJS, React, MySql, Node.js, MongoDB). I've been getting back into interviewing. I've had a few interviews where I made it to onsite, but rejected.

Again I've been kind of cramming for these and not really learning deeply the technologies I am applying for. I have a ok grasp with everything, but if I am asked questions about database schemas/designs, different tools of AngularJS/React, I feel like it does show that I am at a very basic level with these tools.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question:**

So should I continue cramming for these interviews, inflict a lot of stress on me just to get a chance at a job?

Or should I take a month or two off to work on a personal project and really *learn* and feel confident about the technologies I will need to showcase?

This may be a dumb question for some but if anyone has any personal experience similar to mine, some insight would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Continue cramming for interviews? Or take some time off to truly learn concepts?

9tgojr,2,2018-11-01,How can I project confidence and authority in a small office setting where I may be able to earn a promotion due to office restructuring/new hires?,office_problems_thwy,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/9tgojr/how_can_i_project_confidence_and_authority_in_a/,"Several months ago I created this account to express frustration at the lack of leadership in my small office. The office director seemed to be phoning it in, I was taking on more, etc. 

**The TLDR was: I work in a small office where a lot of work overlaps, but a new staffer is making my job a lot harder than it has to be, keeps making mistakes, and isn't responsive to constructive criticism. Our office director is apathetic and refuses to do anything about it. I am struggling in dealing with twice as much work as I used to, plus the stress of working with someone who does not respect me.**

My intuition was right on the money - our office director was interviewing for a new job and several months after hiring this new staffer. Since then, the rest of the team (only 3 people) have been really picking up a lot of extra work while we search for a new person to fill their shoes. 

I applied for that position, along with many outside applicants. Since the director left without filling the role, I have taken on a lot of their responsibilities, including running office meetings, creating agendas, discussing personnel issues with the CEO, and managing a lower level employee, along with all of the office interns. I have been putting in a ton of extra hours, which I think the CEO recognizes, and even convinced them that we need to restructure our personnel in order to have a better office flow and be able to expand capacity. This restructuring would allow us to hire a new person who fills a very niche need for the office, but also leaves space for me to assume the role of office director. 

My issue now is - my boss hasn't formally handed me any actual authority, and my coworkers are pushing back in some ways but accepting of my leadership in others. Yet at the same time, I feel as if I am dismissed in some meetings - they don't look me in the eye, talk over me, etc. On occasion I will reach out to someone outside the office, who then follows up with my coworkers instead of me. My coworkers relay that message, but I seem to not be projecting some kind of ""leader"" quality that would ensure they knew I was the point person, or caused them to go around me. I feel that something about my body language is off to be regularly spoken over, meetings that I've set up for the CEO rearranged as if they are less important than the rest, etc. 

It's hard to pin down what I am missing. Since the former office director left I have started dressing more professionally on a day to day basis and trying to limit my office gossip/venting. I have started bringing a more formal padfolio to every meeting to express that I take each meeting seriously and of importance. I am juggling way more tasks than any one person should honestly have time for, and trying to do it without complaining much.

Can anyone help me figure out what cues, body language, hair, makeup, style choices, language I need to start incorporating into everything else to project authority to colleagues both in the office and externally? I wanted to be viewed as a leader, because I have been taking on that role, but I am missing the mark in some way. Any advice, suggestions on self-help books, or tips would be really really helpful!

When I saw a room that was $450/month INCLUDING utilities less than 3 miles from school, I thought it was a steal!

It's supposed to be a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, shared with the married homeowners, and a roommate. I'd only be sharing a bathroom with one person. When they asked me to sign for the whole year, I was pumped because I also have a summer internship in the area. My room is a bit small, but it's fine. The entire house is really small.

This has been, well, NOT the case. As it turns out, the wife was 6 months pregnant (at the time, she's in the hospital right now) and works from home online. The husband works at a grocery store. The other roommate is on some kind of disability and isn't working. In addition to these people, there's a friend of the family that sleeps on their couch roughly 50% of the time. 

They own the house, so there's no rent. I'm very tokophobic and childfree, just looking at the wife makes me ill, and there's no avoiding her because she's ALWAYS THERE. There's always at least one person in the house. I can never have anyone over because there simply isn't space and the women in the house ""don't like strange men around"". The roommate that I share a bathroom with has digestive problems, so I don't get a ton of bathroom time. 

I can't smoke and they've said that if they see any illegal drugs they will call the police immediately. I can't even have beer in the fridge because ""husband is a recovering alcoholic"". They'll remove it and place it in my bedroom when I'm out.

I'm dreading when she gets out of the hospital because there'll be even less space and I'll be able to hear Every. Single. Cry. I also hate that my rent is basically funding them HAVING a child and/or the entire utility bill.

My parents love that this arrangement keeps me celibate and sober so they won't help. I need to get out of this lease and into similarly affordable housing. What are my options?"

I'm considering removing my mother from my life, but want to know whether I'm being rational or just simply cruel and dramatic (as she would put it).
​

Let me begin with how our lifestyle choices are polar opposite. I'm a full-time Physics student and NASA intern who values intelligence, fitness, cleanliness, hygiene, and overall lifestyle wellness. She, however, works a part-time job as a receptionist but prioritizes partying above all; she's an extreme alcoholic, heavy smoker, obese, and has no concept of hygiene as far as a non-homeless woman should be concerned.
​

Just for reference: she sleeps on her living room sofa rather than clean her messy bedroom. I have come to visit her on weekends and found maggots in her kitchen sink because she never washes her dishes. When I lived with her in high school, I remember nights as a child where I cleaned up her drunken vomit, and even her urine, or one incident where my father and I went looking around the neighborhood for her when she ran away wearing no pants.
​

I recognize that these are fairly superficial, ""surface-level"" issues but they don't stop there. Her personality collides with mine far too often. Anytime I express the slightest disappointment in her, she retaliates, believing she's a ""disgusting, horrible failure of a mom!"" and that I must take responsibility for being the most evil, cruel daughter (even while she is calling me names, cursing, and throwing items across the room).
​

These are the memories I have of my mother. When I think of her, my skin crawls. But they aren't the only memories.
​

Once in a while, I have flashbacks to good moments. It's the small things, like being significantly involved in my school life. She was my biggest cheerleader at sports games, made certain she was present at every performance I had, went to lengths to learn how to help me with homework, encouraged my creativity, defended my from bullies, and wrote ""I love you"" notes in every single school lunch she ever packed - and she packed a lot for me. Her love and care for me was bright and brilliant. Things were a lot nicer then, too, though. She rarely drank or expressed her anger.
​

I write this as I cry because she is not the same mother anymore. I imagine she is the way she is because her marriage failed. My dad is a professional athlete and was hardly present in my life, and greatly toxic in hers. I can't hate him because I was never close with him, but I know he brought my mother grief and would frequently cheat and manipulate her to take the blame. This went on for years as I watched her emotionally suffer and attempt to mend it. Nonetheless her stress was taken out on me, and it only ever got worse.
​

They separated several years ago but only recently divorced. She is so sensitive and so addicted to her vices because she is depressed - that's for sure. Nobody hates her more than she hates herself, deep down. She has no motivation to take care of herself because she feels this way.
​

So here is my final point: I despise my mother. For most of my life, she has been a dirty, toxic alcoholic, who does nothing but instigate arguments and manipulate me. She brings me down and affects my mental health so severely that it's borderline traumatic. However, I know that with that said, nobody on this planet loves me more than she does. She wants to be a good mom, but doesn't know how to change because she's so extremely depressed.
​

I am writing this tonight because I've been kicked out. SHE asked me to leave, then once my bags were packed, told me that I must take responsibility for abandoning her and carrying my grief to go burden anybody I choose to stay with. It's such a toxic cycle and I can't stomach it. She seems to believe that my support in her will cure her, but sometimes I truly do not know what to praise her for.
​

But how much is enough? Is it cruel to walk out on my depressed, longing mother who loves me, or is it only the right thing to do for my sanity and mental health?
​

TL;DR I'm a goal-oriented physicist. My mom's an abusive, alcoholic slob. She's the way she is because she's depressed, and idk whether to continue suffering to support her or walk away for my own mental health."
9thupa,1,2018-11-02,It's Complicated,livemasbaby,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9thupa/its_complicated/,"When I first started trying to decide what I wanted to study in college, I was a little unsure. I wanted to do something that would be fulfilling, allow for decent income, and not require a long time in school. That attracted me to engineering and when I looked at branches of engineering I found biomedical engineering to be of great interest because I believed it was the field that let me do the greatest good. I was never really a math and science guy in high school. I did it because they were my classes and I treated just like work; nothing that I particularly loved. I was always better at humanities and especially loved languages, having studied two in high school. 

And so I began applying to universities. Fast track to college acceptances and I receive an acceptance letter from Yale University. This changed everything for a bit. I no longer had to worry about post grad debt due to generous financial aid or finding a job and though that perhaps I could study something I really enjoyed. I then decided I would stick to biomedical engineering because I still had the belief that no matter what I studied in college, I would treat it just like in high school, just another assignment I have to do and a different kind of work.

I am now a sophomore. I took my first biomedical engineering class and hated it. I truly lost all motivation to read the material and stay interested. So much so that, even though my grade would have been fine (at worst I would have had a C in the class) I dropped the course. It was adding a stress to my life that at that point I just could not handle.

And now I'm quite lost with regards to what I should study. People have always told me they thought I was more of a humanities person. That being said, I do enjoy math in college much more than writing papers. I feel like I switched. Give me a pset over a paper any day. I'll actually enjoy it. The class I dropped was simply pure memorization (physiology) and I just not fit it all in my head, not to mention it was simply uninteresting to me. But if you catch me on my free time, I'd rather be learning a language or hanging out with a friend. Language learning is the only thing I'd say I'm passionate about really. I realized as well that biomedical engineering does require a good amount of sacrifice for not a super high amount of compensation (potentially having to go to grad school, maybe get a Ph.D) and I just don't think I could go to grad school or work on a Ph.D for a field that I really don't love. I was also always under an impression that within engineering, the hardest part is school but no the stress and difficulty carries on at work too (correct me if I am wrong). I just don't think I could carry on with the stress of being an engineer and just now knowing how to solve a problem or create a design. I fear being in a job that I don't like and am bad at.

I did think about possibly working at the UN for a while in high school (it honestly sound more exciting to me than being an engineer it always has) but I was worried about compensation. I though about perhaps working in the US state department or foreign service. All these jobs definitely sound more interesting than engineering to me. It also has a different kind of stress, one that I somehow fear less. I always thought clubs such as model UN and debate sounded much more interesting than any STEM club in high school (even though we did not have any of aforementioned groups). Which brings me to my next point.

I also have a very set image of the life I'd like to lead in the future. Ideally, I'd live near parents and siblings, with my significant other and children. I would go to work in the morning and come back in time for dinner with my family. I'd also like if I did not have to worry about work at home and could leave it at work. This life is impossible to have with the foreign service as you'd likely be abroad 75% of your life. But I wonder if it would be possible to do at the United Nations (I am close to NYC).

But in general I just don't know what I'd like to do with my life anymore. I know what I'd be good at and where I'd thrive and it be somewhere along the line of global affairs. But I also fear it as a more risky path (but then again I do not know how much a Yale degree does to ease that risk). I did do some CS in high school and actually quite enjoyed it so I was thinking of giving it another go next semester here in college. I also feel as if CS jobs are more common and have much better working conditions that would allow for me to have a work-life balance I want. Many of my engineering friends also switched to CS this semester and say it is much better as there are way more job and internship opportunities. The salaries are also more competitive. I don't think I'd mind toughing out CS at school if it meant I had a greater guarantee of my ideal life after college. The problem with bme was that I didn't love it and it also did not give any guarantees. But I also think I'd have more fun in a field somewhat related to global affairs. 

I think it basically boils down to this

\-Stay in an engineering field since I already met a few requirements for any engineering here (though I likely will not graduate from an ABET program) and tough it out. (This becomes a more viable option if there are engineers here who can tell me their jobs were not super stressful.)

\-Switch to CS as it offers a greater chance at stability with high compensation and better workplace conditions.

\-Switch to global affairs and figure out life as I go along but doing something I think I'd enjoy more. Maybe go to law school after two years in foreign service post graduation.

P.S. While money is a concern of mine, I am not looking be super rich. Ideally, my salary would be at least $100,000 a year. I would chose a $100,000 in NYC over a $200,000 job in California just to be close to my family. Stress is also a major concern. I really do not want to go through the stress of high school and college for a prolonged period of time ever again. I don't think I can handle it. I do also worry a lot about starting a family (I don't wanna be an old parent lol). I worry a lot about not being able to meet someone and settle down until pretty late. I also realize I'll probably go to some form of grad school some time down the road, but engineering grad school actually sounds terrifying to me (maybe someone can testify otherwise). Law school or getting an MBA doesn't sound so bad to me though (though again I'm afraid of debt, particularly with regards to law school).

Sorry for such a long entry."

&amp;#x200B;

I say ""I want to kill myself."" ""I fantasize about dying"" ""I go to sleep every night hoping that I'll die"" and no one is listening.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't say it often and I don't joke about this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't meme about it, but they respond like I am making a morbid joke or tell me ""you just need to do (insert fix to current 'problem')""

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reaching out for days. I have gone to 2 classes all week. I've barely been sleeping. I've withdrawn myself from everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is too busy to really hear me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to commit suicide in 2013, and for months before hand, I tried to reach out to my family.

&amp;#x200B;

In April 2013, I told my mom that I was considering checking into a hospital, because I was feeling very depressed, even though nothing was wrong in my life"" and she said ""you aren't depressed; I have depression."" I asked my sister to go to dinner with me, where I told her explicitly, ""I feel like I don't want to be here anymore."" and she told me ""not to feel that way"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then when I was in the hospital, surrounded by doctors and interns, they ALL said ""We had no idea."" ""She never said anything"". I wanted to scream! I even brought it to their attention after I was in recovery, and they apologized.

&amp;#x200B;

I reach out. I am reaching out.

&amp;#x200B;

No one is hearing me.

&amp;#x200B;

I self harmed once in December 2012, months before my attempt, and I went to the doctor and got started on antidepressants. The entire night while I was hurting myself, I told my two best friends what I was doing. A nurse that I had never met before called me brave for coming in and thanked me for seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to kill myself at my kitchen table in September of 2013. I spent one night in the ER, and 4 days in the psychiatric ward.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt humiliated. I felt disconnected from the world. I felt angry. I felt nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the group sessions and learned coping mechanisms. I was started on medications that made me feel like my brain was one misfire away from exploding.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped all medications in favor of counseling.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a counselor at least once a week until May of 2015, and learned a lot about myself and my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned how to recognize when my depression was masquerading as my true desires, after getting scarily close to a second attempt at taking my life in November 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote letters to my friends and family, got rid of some belongings that I didn't want my family to find, and I spent hours talking to my best friend, convincing them that ending my life is what I truly wanted, because living was so painful for me every day. They finally said they understood, but asked me to wait 24 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home and I slept for the first time in days, and when I woke up I literally thought to myself ""holy shit, what is wrong with my brain???""

&amp;#x200B;

Depression isn't my friend. It is a parasite that lives in my brain.

&amp;#x200B;

It drains me of energy and impregnates my thoughts with feelings of unworthiness.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this. Having this recognition. Has helped me through so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am exhausted. I feel my body slowing down.

&amp;#x200B;

My motivation is gone and I've gone from 90s to 70s in my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see it happening.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that it is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't move.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to.

I’m a Brazilian industrial engineering student close to graduation.

- 3 yr of work experience (internships in big companies) in different fields (logistics, finance and manufacturing);

- 18 months in Germany as an exchange student (one of my internships was performed there);

After living abroad, I feel like I don’t belong to where I live today (Brazil) and I really want out after I get my degree. 

I’m able to speak/ write English at a high standard, Portuguese at a native standard and German as an upper intermediate standard. 

My only citizenship is the Brazilian one. 

My worries are that since I will be a recent grad with only internship experiences and no second nationality I might not be a match for recruiters abroad.

9tmpcs,15,2018-11-02,Is it possible my ADHD has gone undiagnosed due to good grades?,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9tmpcs/is_it_possible_my_adhd_has_gone_undiagnosed_due/,"Hi guys / gals,

I’m posting this because I believe it is a real possibility that I suffer from a form of ADHD that has gone undiagnosed due to having above average intelligence and exceptional grades. I believe this may be the case as in 2014, at the age of 19, I suffered a panic attack, and another subsequent episode which both led to me being hospitalised. 

After these episodes I was requested to take blood tests, a cardiology test and a sleep apnea test, all physical tests in an attempt to explain the two aforementioned panic attacks. However, the results of these tests all returned normal and proved to display no explanation for my panic attacks. 

Over the next two years or so I suffered various panic attacks that were caused by overwhelming thoughts about my health, and fears that I was in poor health despite my medical tests telling me otherwise. However, I found that the challenge of overcoming my panic was not creating new cognitive pathways away from those thoughts, but actually having the attention necessary to develop coping techniques by having rational internal dialogue, such as being able to internally count to execute breathing techniques. 

I found that I struggled to stay on a single line of reasoning for a long time, and often would develop a very mild headache when attempting to stay attentive to a single thought. This coincided during a period where I struggled to stay attentive to my hobbies and it felt as if I had lost a lot of joy in these activities due to their lack of ability to hold me. This kind of difficultly concentrating is something that would come intermittently to me as a child as well. 

Other issues were present when I was child, between the ages of 4 - 6 to be exact, to the point where my parents took me to a (what I believe was) a child psychologist / behavioural specialist. It was this persons advice that I may have had some kind of attention disorder that could relate to how I was being parented. This did not sit well with my parents and they did not follow up with this diagnosis as they felt as if they were adequate parents. 

Throughout my schooling life I demonstrated some behavioural problems but always achieved good grades. My behavioural problems ironed out in high school, to which my grades soared from good to exceptional, with many teachers leaving glistening reviews of my work and attitude towards learning. Because of this my parents used this to create a conviction that the specialist they went to when I was a child was wrong. 

Fast forward to today, and I am still achieving quite well at university. I have a 5.1 GPA and am looking forward to the prospect of internships and post-graduate studies. However, between all this are horrendous instances of procrastination, overthinking, and times where my mind becomes overwhelmed with the tasks at hand to the point where I do nothing, and ignore everyone. 

These feelings especially hurt when it means I can’t bring myself to pick up my guitar, a video game or a novel because the attention it would need feels tiresome. Even more so when I believe that it strains my friendships when I feel this innate pressure inside me to just shut everything out and cool off. 

I’m not sure what to do from here. Perhaps seeking out a medical opinion might be the next step. I just feel as if my ability to keep attention is something that is inhibited by a force that I can’t identify and I would like to solve this issue so I can work towards improving in the fields that are important to me. Maybe I just might be lazy and am overthinking it?

Thank you for making it through this =) !

TL:DR: Had panic episodes for the first time at 19. Started to notice ADHD symptoms. Had a childhood diagnosis that parents ignored. Want to increase my attention span as an adult.

She came back at 5:30AM with messy clothes and I knew exactly what she did. For the rest of that day, we spent our time together crying, again I don't know why we did that. Perhaps it was the fact that we were engaged to each other and I made plans revolving around our future family. The emotional pain and the toxicity of the situation did not hit me until the next day. I had an interview with an engineering company for a summer internship and the first question they asked me was What is your strength? It was at that moment when I managed to get 5 words out of my mouth and started crying uncontrollably. I drove an hour to her house and when I did not see her car outside at 11, I thought about what happened the day before. I don't know what my thought were at the time but I downed about 20 pills of Extra Strength Tylenol. Now if you know something about suicide, OD on non-prescription drug has about 6% of success rate. Perhaps I did it to lash out on my ex as well as a way for me to cope with the stress and trauma. I ended up rushing to the hospital where they held me for 2 days under suicide watch. I have been told to go to Student Counseling Services as well as Student Assistance Services and they have been going extra mile to help me cope with what happened. But now... a week and a half after all the drama and emotional pain, I don't think I can take it anymore. I know I have a lot of live for, part of me still wants to live because of my dreams and goal and not wanting to give up. But the other part is in extreme pain and there are times that I feel I can't continue anymore. I don't have a lot of friends and family but they all care about me. I just wish that they don't care so much so it would have been easier on my conscience to give up."

I am a recent grad in computer science but due to lack of internships and my immigration status, I have been having trouble finding an entry level software engineering job. 

I recently had a phone interview with one of the SAP partners called Contax Inc and they have invited me out for an onsite interview at one of their offices in the US. The pay is low, which is fine with me, but if I take this job, would it hurt my career in few years from now when I want to transition to software engineering roles at much better companies? The role I applied for is that of a programmer/app developer and they use this technology called ABAP, which I doubt is used in any other industries.

If anyone have personal experience with this or have any advice, please share. I don't really know much about this industry. Thank you!"

Currently, I am a sophomore at a top 50 CS school.

I am very thankful for this opportunity and believe it has put me in a good position for attaining a big N internship next summer if all goes well (although I could be wrong). With that said, I have always wanted to study abroad. If I were to study abroad next year in the fall of my junior year, how screwed would I be in attaining a job at a company like big G? I am conflicted because I doubt any company would offer me an internship without an onsite and I can't really complete them from Europe, but not studying abroad is something I feel like I'd regret. My parents keep telling me to just travel after I graduate before starting full time but I have no idea what to do. If I were to study abroad, I would probably take BS classes and just travel + study CS in my free time to practice for after I return. If I were to stay at my current school, I'd probably study CS and take a semester off to do a co-op since I am a semester ahead. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance."

I am a young student nearing the end of university/college, and I have been fortunate enough to have a couple offers that I am interested in taking.

Company A was a place I interned at. Smaller company personnel-wise and brand-wise, but fairly valuable and definitely a steady business. I admittedly was paid pretty below market on this one when I was there, but I found the work really interesting. However, they have come back to me, and they want me to come back, but they offered to pay me ""the big bucks"" this time, let's say. It's about 25% higher than I am currently making at...

Company B, where I am doing an internship right now. I am getting paid a pretty reasonable amount. Right around market value, let's say. More corporate place, it's good work wise, laid back, learn a fair amount, and I think it still has a lot of growth potential business-wise. They reached out to me today to tell me that they want me to come back; no financial terms discussed yet, but I assume I can negotiate what a deal would look like.

For me, I haven't been struggling, but I definitely feel that I haven't made as much money as a lot of my comparable peers. I am looking to get paid, first of all. So now I have the enviable position of having two offers on the table, which is really great. How do I go about facilitating a bidding war between two companies without coming off like a dick? From knowing Company A, I know they are understanding of the view of it being ""just business"" and I think it's highly likely they would be willing to increase their offer a bit (they did the last time I was employed by them, by 15%). I know less about Company B, but generally people think big names are less flexible.

Company A I have the LinkedIn of my former manager who has the offer for me, and Company B sent me an email this morning, which I haven't responded to. How do I go about this gracefully, but hoping to maximize my earnings?"
9tqba9,118,2018-11-02,[Texas] Mom won't allow me to move out,JustNoMILThrowaway69,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9tqba9/texas_mom_wont_allow_me_to_move_out/,"Hello all. 25/F/Texas and needing some advice on a shitty home situation with legal ramifications. 

First, my post history on this throwaway is pretty NSFW, just a head's up. 

I'm currently trapped at home by my mother, who won't let me move out unless I either leave all of my stuff including my car behind or I finish paying her the $50000+ I agreed to owe her. Now, this agreement is not on paper. There is supposedly an Excel document with the value of each charge I owe her for, and I have my own tracking sheet in OneNote, but I have never signed any sort of formal agreement. She continues to purchase me things without my asking and when she gets angry at me she adds them to the list. She also regularly threatens to kill my cat or kick him out of the house. I am not charged rent and instead have to do cleaning and home improvement, but she does add my phone bill, utilities, an uncalculated food/alcohol charge and a vaguely calculated ""cat care"" charge to my debt each month. 

The original $50000 I owed her starting January 2018 was roughly $240 a month for six years of living expenses (a year of college, two years dropped out which I lied about until I couldn't hide that I wouldn't graduate, and then three years of college again in a different city that resulted in a BSc in mechanical engineering) and monthly payments for two separate vehicles. The additional expenses outside of my monthly expenses were payback for a trip to a robotics competition in NorCal where I was staff that she wanted to join me on (I was going to pay my own way until she joined the trip and instead of actually learning about the competition with me she mostly drove around to wineries and was mad at me for not going with her) and then expenses at a convention that she insisted were gifts until she got mad at me again recently (oddly, she ""borrowed"" $400 from me in cash, bought me a bunch of merch with that cash, told me to take that $400 out of my monthly payment, and then asked me to add it back in because ""I manipulated her to buy me those things""). 

A rundown of my assets: 

* Bedroom furniture gifted by my grandmother
* A dining room table mom purchased as a set with a china hutch she wanted, that she gave to me because she wanted a different table
* A gun safe and several guns, most of which were gifts from my grandfather while the gun safe itself and my carry gun were supposedly gifts from my mother 
* Several large Tupperware bins of household supplies, including my family's old plates, gifts from years of birthdays and Christmases, inherited pots and pans and decorations
* A table saw from my grandfather
* Three bags of hand tools from my grandfather, plus a drill, Dremel, soldering iron and a 3D printer
* My desktop that I built myself with money from my internship worth just over $2500 plus a 4K monitor that I paid for in full that I was going to give to mom if she paid 3/4 of but she never did 
* A 2017 4Runner, of which $30000 was a gift from my grandmother for graduation and the rest was spotted to me by my mom after a very weird back and forth over the original $30k

An example of the bonkers manipulation that occurs that I'm trying to get out of, as illustrated by the 4Runner: When I was initially given the $30k, I was driving a 2010 Rav4. It was a good car, in need of an alignment but had butt warmers and a rocking stereo and was generally reliable. I'd crashed it thrice during my use of it at my second university. The car was bought for mom to use while I would use her 2007 Rav4 but she swapped the vehicles because she wanted me in the newer, safer one. Shortly after my second crash she decided that I needed to pay her for any vehicle repairs, and anything I couldn't afford would add to the living expenses I'd agreed to pay her in exchange for living at home while I tried college again. She later decided that I also needed to cover monthly payments for the duration of my use of the vehicle, and added those and my insurance payments to the debt. (Sidebar: she'd tried to buy me a 2007 instead of buying herself the 10 for a paltry $2000 but it was a scam, and she used my savings account on that scam.) As such, I didn't really feel like I needed a new car. If I had to pay for the 2010 anyways, why not just use the $30k for my masters? Mom refused to allow me to bring that up with my grandmother and I didn't want to buy a 2017 Rav4 because the rear tire is way less accessible. This started a two month fight over which vehicle I would get, during which I repeatedly tried to get mom to take the $30k to cover my debt. She finally agreed to take it and treat herself to a 2017 4Runner, which I praised her for. I nerded out a bit over the car as I tend to do over anything shiny and mechanical, and she interpreted it as jealousy that I didn't have one. She harassed me about if I really wanted a new car or not and in a moment of weakness I caved. Massive mistake, but she agreed to front me the remaining money for it and put me on the loan so I could have a credit score finally. I started my masters and dropped out within the semester, and my work only hired me to hourly engineering instead of salary because of budget issues after moving to a new building. 

At the moment I've paid her $20000 in 9 months. I make $2524 a month after taxes if I don't work overtime, and I pay for my own car insurance now, so I'm actually slowly falling into credit card debt to keep paying her off. She's demanding I finish paying her back by 2021, all while adding more to my debt and refusing to let me build a savings account or purchase anything fun for myself. She's isolating me from my friends both in person and online, and micromanaging my time at home. 

I can't live in that house anymore but because of my debt situation I can't move out. I don't want to leave my stuff behind, as that's a tremendous amount of money to replace those items. Talking to her about reducing my monthly payments has not worked. 

Some of my friends have advised that I move out while she and my brother are out of the house, and then have a lawyer on standby to explain why I've ceased payments. What kind of lawyer should I talk to to achieve this? I'm spending the weekend gathering my legal documents including my car title, social and birth certificate so in case of an emergency I can grab my cat and leave, but I'm still hoping I can make an ideal scenario work out. 

Any advice is appreciated. I've done bad things in the past but I'm trying to be a better person and I feel like a massive piece of shit for what I'm about to do to my family, but I don't think they've left me with a choice. "

9triut,4,2018-11-03,"How do I negotiate/navigate full-time offer as an underpaid, overqualified intern that does most of the companies coding since I joined?",NPMInstallTiddies,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9triut/how_do_i_negotiatenavigate_fulltime_offer_as_an/,"So I'm in a little bit of an interesting situation... I'm an intern at a seed-funded AI startup in SF. The previous few weeks the CTO and CEO have been telling me they want to bring me full-time. Today my boss scheduled the meeting for us to discuss my salary and full time offer at the end of november. I just wanted some opinions on how i go about this, as I'm in a pretty interesting situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

So for some background, I graduated at the beginning of 2018 from an OK school with a CS degree. I didn't have any internships because in 2016, I got recruited by a friend/Googler to work on his bootstrapped startup with him and his Googler friends. I figured why take internships when I can actually build a company ground up with a group of extraordinary guys. On our project I built and maintained the less critical parts of a NodeJS API and a lot of front end stuff (despite hating front end). Basically for 2 years we built a product over and over again because every time we were about to go for funding, the CEO decided he didnt like it and wanted us to start over. So basically, 2 years of experience with nothing to show for it except knowledge and the ability to spin up a side project in no time (of which I had quite a few).  

&amp;#x200B;

When graduation came around, I began applying for real companies and like much of you couldn't land anything. Despite advertising the 2 years of experience, a few of my ""cooler"" side projects and the degree, no full time SWE bites. I managed a few Big N onsite interviews that I thought went well, a few onsites at well known companies, that I also thought went well, a few onsites at a bunch of small startups and nothing, all for Software Engineering positions but no offers.  Eventually figured I'd just start from the bottom and start applying for internships.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up landing an internship at a really small, (relatively well) seed funded startup in SF. But with really promising tech. It's about a 2 hour commute for me, but what they're building is insane. I love the company, the location, the culture, the product/vision and the stack. With that being said I am disgustingly underpaid. When I was given my internship offer it was even prefaced with, ""We don't want you to think this is representative of what we think your value to our company is..."" But after 9 months of applying for jobs, I'd take an unpaid position just to get something tangible on my resume... So $40k and a laptop didn't sound too bad. He then went on to say, when they bring me on full time I'd be a Junior SWE and I'd get about 1.5x salary + healthcare and shit.  

&amp;#x200B;

Within a few weeks I think it was pretty apparent that I was not very junior and  definitely not an intern. Within 4 weeks the CTO even put me in charge of the other data science intern and he now reports to me, ""If you have any questions just ask 'Tiddies'"". In our bi-weekly 1 on 1s, the CTO was telling me that I'm ""Blowing past all expectations"" and that they ""really lucked out on me."" I went from the script and automation kiddy I was meant to be, to building API endpoints, to redesigning and now beginning to rebuild the whole system architecture to scale and meeting with potential partners to build a spec with their requirements.  

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, the time to discuss my full-time offer is on the horizon and I really don't know what to do. If they stick with the 1.5x salary I'm going to hate my life. I wont be able to afford to move near work, and I'll have to stick with the 2 hour commute. But I really want to work with them and I have super high hopes for the tech. The thing is, they literally can't find engineers. I'm the only one who codes other than the CTO and he's so busy that it's all on me. Basically I code, he does code review. Thats all the coding.  Even with that being said, we met with our first potential paying client about a month ago, they wanted a completely custom API for our AI solution and I delivered and we landed the deal. It literally couldn't have been done without me, at least without outsourcing the work.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the fact that they can't find engineers (and they interview about 10 a week) they actually took down one of the listings for a backend role because I basically filled that. They didn't mention this directly, but I had been keeping an eye on the job board, and on the same day they asked me to start the system architecture rebuild, they took down that position. And in a 1-1 with the CTO I mentioned my junior ness (because a lot of times I build my own solution when there is a well known node library to do what I need) and the CTO said ""I don't consider you junior at all. You're a full-fledged backend engineer.""  

&amp;#x200B;

So thats it for background, the concise meat will be below the tl;dr

\*TL;DR \*

&amp;#x200B;

So I really want to negotiate a higher salary but I'm kind of a pushover and I'm already slated from the get-go to be underpaid. And not sure how to go about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I'm taking into consideration going into this is:  

When I was hired as an intern, they said full time would be \~$60k as a junior software engineer.  

Within a few weeks proved I was not intern level, and top end of Junior if even Junior at all. This was confirmed by CTO.   

$60k is not enough to move to SF. I discussed housing with my CEO and he said he'd like to get me to move as close to work as possible when I come on full time.  

I essentially filled their role of backend engineer that (until they took it down) had $100-150k salary and 2-4% equity but asked for 3-5 years of experience.  

Single-handedly built a custom API for a client and landed their first paid deal.  

Only person who codes (because CTO doesnt have time) of the 5 employees there right now and they have been looking for more engineers and failing for 3+ months.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really won't be happy unless I get $100k +. But I'm willing to take the $60k I just know that it isn't a permanent solution and I'd have to find another job asap, and in the meantime I'd keep my ultra shitty commute. My concerns are that even though I have been told I'm not junior, they still slap me with the junior title and I end up at 60k or even 80k if I negotiate heavily because thats the original plan.  

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback, similar experiences or tips."

The problem is that I don't know what to choose. Speaking about .net, I would work for a really big company, a multinational, a stable IT company near my home (just what i need right now due to family problems) but I'm afraid that I will get stuck into Microsoft world and for my future I was hoping to become a Java developer, maybe for some big major.  
On the other hand, choose the Java internship, I would work for a small society with no references or information about, nothing found on the web, just their (not so working) web-sites and some linkedin articles. But it would mean growing my java skills, just what I desire.

Some questions:

1. How do I ensure that I would even be competitive? I don't have any CS internships or prior jobs, and although I am taking an intensive web dev class that's covering a lot of stuff (both client and server side as well as back end and front end), and at the end of the class I will have my own website that I've designed, I still feel like I'm behind the curve in terms of being competitive compared to other freelancers who probably have had years and years of experience and maybe used to have careers in web dev and are masters/experts in what they do.

2. Which field would even be the best for me? I mentioned web dev because I feel that's where the most work comes from, but I might be wrong. I am also taking an intensive class in Python data management/analysis, so I'm not sure if that might be up for consideration as well. 

3. This might be more of a personal question, but I want to freelance in order to keep up with the CS field, not waste my hard-earned degree, and supplant my income in the process. As I said, I'm gonna be doing a different full-time job, so realistically how many hours should I expect to put in without wanting to kill myself? 

4. Anything else I should know about freelancing and getting started?"

I really don't want to quit though because it'd be nice to have some real experience on my resume before I graduate. Allow me to explain why it sucks though so you can understand.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I almost didn't even take the job because it's downtown, they don't provide parking, and it only pays $13.50 an hour. They do give you a public transit pass but it would actually take me **hours** to get there by public transit. I ended up taking the job because I found somebody I could carpool with.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting that figured out I thought the job wouldn't be so bad. Maybe my mistake was assuming that a software internship with a government office could still be a good learning experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**But they don't even use source control.** My manager just advised me me to make a folder on my computer and store old files there in case I mess something up. They deploy their changes by dragging files over to the server in FileZilla. Which I guess is fine because most of my job is just rearranging pictures on a website because Becky in accounting sent a email to our team asking for it.  I've been handling most of the tickets (I say tickets even though we don't have a ticketing system) that come in but it still only accounts for about an hour of my day and we've got around 10 programmers. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've heard though it seems like they don't even make most of the stuff we use. It seems like they bring in consultants to do all the work whenever the project is even moderately difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my tasks was/is pulling some data from an external website into our database, processing the data, and then updating a graph with the new data. The tool for pulling in the data crashes if you look at it funny, and all \~100 lines of garbage source code were apparently written by a consultant. The whole task could easily be automated which really irks me because they've been doing this monthly for over **10 YEARS**.

&amp;#x200B;

You might be thinking ""but OddHand if this program is only 100 lines why haven't you just fixed/rewrote it""? I'd love to but my entire computer is locked down! **I can't plug in a usb, install anything, or even update the software that's already installed.** I've only just got a decent Python installation after waiting **three days** for IT to come by my computer and put in their password. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I think you can see why this is a little frustrating. Has anybody got tips for not losing my mind working this job?"

Basically, I want to emphasize my grades on our major classes more (C++, Java, [VB.Net](https://VB.Net), and such) and my grades ranges from 96-97 out of 98 for these subjects whereas only around 94-95 general average. However, I had a feeling of it becoming too much and making me look boastful which is not what I want. That's why I'm having second thoughts because I'm a naturally down to earth person. Its just that people I asked said that I should show off my accomplishments on my resume.  


So should I still include my grades for specific classes in my resume or just stick with my general average? If yes, how do I properly do it without becoming too proud of myself?

**Some background:** 

I graduated last May (2017) with a BS in electrical engineering. Since then I've applied to hundreds of jobs, but have had no success in getting an interview. A lot of companies expect candidates to have a specific experience for entry level positions and I can no longer apply to internships because I'm no longer in school. I wanted to ask if there is anyone out there that has been in the same position as me and what they did to get their first ""break"" at a company. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some things of note:**

**Internships**: My school's program was a developing one and I was in a small town, when I tried researching internships there wasn't very much opportunity unless I went out of town, but I didn't have the financial freedom to pursue an internship out of town.

**Research:** I signed up for research with a professor which was great, though we needed to have a certain number of student researchers and as a result lost our grant. Professor told me when he'll let me know when we can pick the project back up, but that never happened. 

**Volunteering:** I've heard people talk about volunteering, could anyone let me know where to start with this. I'd be willing to volunteer if it'll lead to getting a job. Is there specific volunteering for engineering?

**Career Fairs:** I've gone to a few, though I've been told to simply apply online, I still go though as it's a way to meet people from said company.

I have spend my 20s in a different career area then IT. I have have decided to switch to IT, because it offers better job opportunities (in my field I have been unemployed for long time, not being able to land even an unpaid internship). I got my BSc in CS this summer. I see plenty of job opportunities around and I am now in the process of figuring out, which type of job and employer would fit me the best.

I recently did two (paid) internships in software development, both at small companies. I enjoyed working there but I faced two problems:

1. I noticed that the jobs at small companies are rather unstable. It is important for me to have a stable job and stable income (because of personal and family reasons).
2. at both companies, where I worked, developers were following the very latest tech trends. They were obviously spending quite a lot of their free time learning some cutting edge tech (because they love doing it) and then they were applying it for the company projects. I realized, that just to do my job properly there, I will have to do the same - routinely spend a lot of my free time on learning cutting-edge technology. The problem is - I don't want to do it. Because, although I like programming, I prefer to rather spent my free time on hobbies, family and friends, than on learning some new shiny XYZ library/framework.

So I started to think about getting a job at some bigger organization instead, like a bank or an insurance company. I was told that jobs at these kind of companies are much more stable. And I was also told, that these companies usually use some elaborated custom software products, which is hard to change because of its size, so they are not chasing the latest technology and rather stick with stable technologies for longer time. I expect then, that at these companies I could enjoy more stable job and a 9 to 5 working day without constantly investing my free time in learning some new shiny technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Is what I was told about working at big organizations (vs small companies) generally true?

9u3hy3,9,2018-11-04,Is it time for more engineering disciplines?,DNGTA,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/9u3hy3/is_it_time_for_more_engineering_disciplines/,"This is not going to be a well thought out question but I'm going to try my best. Also please bear in mind that I'm in the US and generally unfamiliar with education systems elsewhere so my query will reflect that. I will be referring to Mechanical Engineering as the example.

Looking at my experience leaving college and a very large number of posts from new graduates I see a very common statements...

&gt; ""School didn't teach me anything, how do I do the engineer?""

Then we have the other end...

&gt; ""I hate my job because they don't let me do anything advanced. I have 6 co-authorships in undergrad, why don't they respect me?""

Then the sorta middle ground I guess...

&gt; ""I'm just got my BSME and all my classes and internships were focused on Thermal Analysis of Automotive Widgets but I want to do Quality Control for Space Widgets. Did I ruin my life?""

It seems as if all of this is a reflection in general of the expansion of human knowledge. The Engineering degree and the basic specialties we are over a century old. Seriously ASME was founded in 1880 which was 138 years ago. Since the founding of ASME we've gotten massive electrificiation, powered flight, plastics, and whole host of things that weren't even imagined yet. There's more but that's a whole different discussion.

Taken at it's face value one thing we seem to all agree on is that it is the job of the Engineer to interface between those at the forefront of science and the common man. We don't necessarily research the plastics, or alloys but we put them into CD Drives, iPhones, Car Frames, or Wind Turbine blades. So it becomes necessary for the Engineer to be at least aware of the where the limit of human knowledge may be.

The last two paragraphs are a long way to say the following statement.

&gt; Since the Mechanical Engineering discipline was established the scope of science expected to be applied by the Mechanical Engineer has grown exponentially with the scope of human knowledge.

So while I can't confidently say that it would be possible for a single person to learn the scope of Mechanical Engineering in the year 1880, I can state with absolute certainty it's impossible to do so now.

The problem at hand that I see is that we start to ask the question as to what exactly Engineering school is supposed to be? If the breadth of possibility for a student is so vast it's basically impossible to train for the job then what is the goal? What is the purpose of the debt and the various survey courses in specialties that'll be tossed aside for job specific training later? Is there a way we could make the coursework more relevant, or even shorten time in school by limiting the education to the core fundamentals? Should specialties like robotics and mechatronics courses be the sole responsibility of the student or the employer after a person has decided on a job?

I'm not sure what long-term impacts would happen from cutting up the disciplines. We've already seen this attempted with things like Solar Engineering at one point and BioMed which vertically split disciplines by category. We've also seen the emergence of the Technologist programs which are considered to be more of a horizontal split.

That's the end of my question there. What can we do better? Now I'm going to meander a bit about why I have this question.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I work with a bunch of Mechanical Engineers in a large OEM setting. My *dirty secret* is that despite my title at work I'm actually degreed as an Engineering Technologist. I sit in the same cubes and share the same workload as BSME's but came up through manufacturing and drafting work after getting my degree. I work with engineers who can't bend metal or machine parts. They don't know, they never turned a wrench. I had a new employee out of college who had never done an assembly drawing in his life. You see it's possible to make it through that single semester of CAD &amp; Drafting with an 85% grade and never really comprehend the GD&amp;T side of it.

Now I might sound like I'm bitching and holding myself above them. Actually though it works out because I spent so long doing drafting and more seat-of-the-pants type work after college that I don't have some of the more hard skills anymore. I had to review how to do basic free-body-diagrams and stuff like that. So we each have our roles to play.

All of us carry the title of Mechanical Engineer and I feel like that name just doesn't work anymore."

Got an email saying they will email me again shortly with an initial assessment. Got the second email. It’s a link that consists of 2 assessments. The first one is a time cognitive test. You get 12 minutes to complete 24 verbal reasoning questions, 16 numerical reasoning questions, and 10 abstract reasoning questions. I haven’t clicked the link yet I’m honestly too scared. Then after that is another assessment about working style. Thankfully this is not timed. And then if they are happy with my answers from these, then they will conduct a on demand video interview (you record a video, it’s not with an actual person if I understood correctly). Then if that goes good THEN you get an actual interview. My brother told me Shell is HARD to get. He got a masters student to do his assessment with him and didn’t proceed to the next stage. Has anyone done these questions and can let me know what to expect ?  "

I would just like some knowledge and insight as to what steps I should take, things to consider, certification paths I should start on knowing I like dealing with people and helping others out; or maybe just looking for IT positions with my CS degree despite my lack of IT knowledge and doing a lot of self study?

9u73r3,1,2018-11-04,What should I do about my job?,PrioritizeSmash,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9u73r3/what_should_i_do_about_my_job/,"Hi there,

I'm 20 years old, and I think I want to get into video production as a career. I'm currently going to college, I'm in the third year, and I'm on track for a video production degree. I have no aspirations to be a big Hollywood filmmakers, but something in the world of entertainment would be cool. Haven't quite figured out what that is yet, but I've tried a lot different things.

Anyways, a little over a year ago I started an internship at a video production company. When I started, and they asked what I was interested in, I expressed interest in learning more about the logistics of filmmaking. They seemed particularly excited about it since they need more people like that. I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but we didn't have a gear/equipment manager at the time and I became that person. Pretty sure it was because I was the intern and said yes to anything, but fell into the role completely because it was a void that needed to be filled.

I didn't particularly like the work, and it wasn't affording me any room for advancement both in the company or in my own personal learning. The equipment situation was a mess between all the offices (there are offices in multiple cities). The equipment manager in another office tried making an inventory system, which I input all the data for our office, but it still hasn't gotten off the ground because of so many obstacles between veteran employees and new management. Plus, with so much gear being shipped around without the inventory being implemented yet, everything I had put in it is kind of useless and needs to be redone.

Also, seeing as we're a video production company, you'd think I'd get the experience of going out on jobs and learning that way? Well sort of. I was PA sometimes (sometimes they decided to hire freelance even though I was readily available), but this consisted of my doing menial tasks like wiping tables, getting coffee, or standing around constantly bugging people for stuff to do. I totally understand that as a PA that's the work that's expected of me, and just being there with other people can help you get your foot in the door if you do a good job and have a positive attitude. But, over the course of the year, I kept mentioned that I'd like to learn more and become a more valuable asset to the company, and they kept acting excited every time I mentioned it, but never did anything about it. Didn't really even care what it was, so many people find something they like and/or are good at this way. Guess they just didn't have a need for anything. I worked at the company part-time while I was in school. I was in the office full-time over the summer, just doing gear, but nothing happened as much as I asked. 

You'd think with me being around the gear all the time I'd be on track to become something like a technical director/producer, but I was never given the time to play with the gear and there was no one in our office who could teach me either. Someone got mad at me once for not packing something correctly, to which I responded that I'm doing the best with the knowledge I have, and they responded that I should come in on my free time to teach myself this stuff...

On top of all this, I only get paid $15 an hour (that's minimum wage where I am). Hired PA's make $18 an hour ($250/12, works out to about $17.85). I'm usually asked to do more and trusted to do more than other PA's because I work at the company, but I get paid $3 less. That definitely stings. 

To be fair, there was a big job near the city I grew up in and I really wanted to go. I told them I could get myself there and house myself since I could stay with my parents, and they agreed. It was just a PA gig but one of the best experiences of my life.

Anyways, I was sick of the gear work and saw no room for advancement within their production jobs. Over the course of the summer the company started hiring new management people, like an operations officer and sales &amp; business person. They put up a listing for a part-time social media coordinator. I knew I was going back to school so I'd transition back to part-time, I knew I was no longer interested in gear, there was nowhere I could go with gear in regards to production, and I knew I wanted to stay a valuable asset to the company, so I raised my hand and said I was interested.

I have no formal knowledge of social media marketing, outside of school clubs, but they let me interview anyways. They ended up going with me and hiring internally which is great...or so I thought.

I guess I should have known, but the social media situation is even more of a cluster-fuck than the gear situation. What it boils down to is that nobody knows what they want, and I have to go through multiple different people to get anything out there. I sort of feel like Peter in Office Space, I have a bunch of different bosses.

So first of all, I'm not really given any funding to do this. Nobody is specifically creating content for us, I'm just taking pictures that people try and remember to take on set, and that doesn't always happen. But then when I draft something, I put it in a Slack channel with 6 different people. Sometimes nobody responds, and sometimes only one person responds. I've even had times where I draft something, two people give me feedback, then a third person swoops in at the last minute and says we can't post that for whatever legal reasons. Way too many obstacles, but if nobody responds I can't do anything in fear of doing something we're not allowed to do.

I should clarify that the work we do is for clients, and we have specific agreements with the clients about what we can and can't say. Someone want us to remain invisible, others are ok with us saying we were there.

On top of that, everybody has different opinions on what the content should be. Some people are ok with BTS photos, others want exterior and pretty shots. To have a success social media page, especially if it's Instagram, you have to keep the content consistent and not sporadic. But at the end of the day, I'm just working with what I'm given, and nobody seems to recognize that.

We have a ""social media call"" once a week, and everybody just talks about what they want instead of putting things into action. It's a waste of time, and it just falls on me to come up with some shit and hope for the best. Plus, with how sporadic the content comes in and how decisions are made, we can't keep any timing consistency which is also important for social platforms. 

I should also mention that none of these people have social media as their main priority. Their main job title is something completely unrelated, so social is one of the last things they think about, and sometime they're busy on a job or doing something else for the company. That's the reason why they don't respond right away, or forget to entirely.

I've expressed some of my grievances in a calm and polite way, but I always get the response of, ""I'll talk to so and so"" then hear nothing. If I go to ""so and so"" they're oblivious about what's going on and can't be bothered or give me an answer that's completely opposite to what I need.

I also still make $15 an hour. I've asked for a raise twice to at least match the PA rate of $18 when I'm out on a job, but have been denied twice. I actually worked for free when I started, and was told I wouldn't get paid even if I went out on jobs. Pretty sure they started paying me because it was illegal to do that, and not because they ""wanted to start paying me"" like they said.

So anyways, I'm at a loss here. Do I stay or do I go? I keep thinking it would be a dick move to leave, but I guess I have no loyalty to the company and them none to me. The one really nice thing about my new position is that I can work remote, but I kind of hate where I live right now (can't afford anything better, ironic isn't it?) so it's not always the most ideal set-up. I don't exactly want to leave without having something else lined up, but I just can't stand it anymore. I'm pretty sure that I do not want to have a career in social media at this point, and even if I did go back to my old position it would be the same as before with no room for advancement. I don't even know if going back to my old position is an option anymore, and I can't go out on any jobs anymore as I'm told to focus only on social. Even if I want to go to the office and work from there I have to go through somebody who doesn't even work in that office to get approval. 

I also haven't really looked for something else yet, so part of this torture is my own doing. I've been extremely busy with school, work, and personal projects. Plus I'm looking for a new place to get out of the place I currently reside. On top of that I can still only commit part-time so it's not like a lot of opportunities exist. I could try and go back to freelance, but I don't exactly want that either.

Plus there's plenty of other things I haven't mentioned like my main boss being a total asshole who thinks he's cool and nice, and how they hired a new equipment manager who has less experience than me and she makes $60,000+ a year. Not that I wanted the position, but damn, I did the same job for less than half the pay. That's also the reason I don't think I could get my old position back, but it's not exactly like I want it either.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Any and all advice would be appreciated, and I'm happy to further clarify anything!"
9u7odf,2,2018-11-04,Start working in January or July?,Wooden_Tap,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9u7odf/start_working_in_january_or_july/,"I recently accepted a role with Citadel's engineering rotation program, with a start date of July. I also have the option of starting in January and finishing my last couple units online, but since I wouldn't receive my degree by then I'd be considered an intern until my summer start date.

The pros I see for starting early are having more time to establish myself at the company, and being more ready to excel when my full time program does start. Additionally, I'd be able to establish myself in Chicago earlier, and get a sense for the area before diving into the intensive rotation program. Finally, money is nice (but I'm not sure if I'd get my sign on bonus until my full time start date).

The main con I see is leaving college early. I only get to do this once, and I might regret chasing my career instead of enjoying my last year of school. I am done with all classes pertinent to my major, however, and am just sitting here being unproductive. Although I think I can tough this out, another concern is the weather in Chicago in January. As someone who's never experienced cold areas, it might be quite a shock to move in when the temperatures are so low.

I would appreciate any input regarding this decision. Would joining early help me that much in my career? Also, does anyone have suggestions for living in Chicago as a young professional?

9u7w93,9,2018-11-04,Civil interested in Construction,GoatVillanueva,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/9u7w93/civil_interested_in_construction/,"For the past year I have been interning at my DOT in the Transportation department and have recently switched to the Construction management side. While I enjoyed my time in Transportation and learned a lot, I see myself wanting a future in Construction. 

The one thing I have noticed so far while interning in the Construction department though is that it seems as if there are limited roles that an Engineer can have to fully utilize their degree, such as being an Inspector or Project Manager. In addition to this, most of the construction internships I see are either Estimating and Scheduling or Project Management.

I guess my main questions are, if I want a future in construction that includes the potential to obtain my PE and utilize my future Civil Degree, what are my potential job options and how to go about giving myself the best shot for those positions? And would it be worth it to try and obtain an Estimating and Scheduling internship?

&amp;#x200B;

**a bunch of tour guides rush into the room right as the AO is finishing up.**

tour guide #1: hey guys! We're going to get the tour started. Unlike other schools, we do a pick-your-own-adventure-style tour. So, we're gonna go around and introduce ourselves!

tour guide #1: I'm a junior and a biology major on the pre-med track -

**the ears of all the premeds perk up**

tour guide #1: I do research, volunteer at a hospital, and help starving children in Africa. In my free time I like hanging out with my friends. And my favorite color is turquoise.

tour guide #2: Hey guys, I'm a from LA -

**a bunch of socal people from the back of room start cheering**

tour guide #2: - senior studying sociology and jewish studies. When I'm not busy with school, I play in a band and you should check me out on Soundcloud at \[insert username that is a thinly veiled reference to weed\]! I also work at the on-campus movie theater where we play Steven Spielbergmovies every Friday night.

tour guide #3: hi, i'm a junior and I'm in the school of engineering, specifically BME. I like to watch The Office and Parks and Rec, go out bowling with my friends, and \[insert another chill activity\]. I spent this past summer hiking in Montana.

tour guide #4: hey, i'm a freshman, and i'm currently undecided but i'm leaning towards women and gender studies or psychology. I'm involved in \[insert minority group club\] and \[insert name of an acapella ensemble\]. I also mentor children at the local elementary students.

tour guide #1: So yeah, follow us outside to the BEAUTIFUL green and try to divide yourselves up evenly.

**the premed tour guide ends up having the largest group by a wide margin**

tour guide #1: So, where are y'all from? \[repeat of asking everyone where they are from, who came the farthest, the closest, etc\]

tour guide #1: Okay, so even though this is my third year of giving out tours, I still am really bad at walking backwards so please tell me if i'm about to hit something. First off, uor school was founded in 1837 when a very wealthy white person decided to donate a lot of money and land, which became this university today. The first graduating class only had TWELVE students, but now we are a mid-sized university with two schools: the College of Arts and Science and the engineering school. But, everyone eats and lives together. And don't worry if you don't know what you want to do! It's really easy to transfer between the schools and I know a TON of people who have done it. Now, we will visit the statue.

Tour guide #1: this is the statue of our founder \[insert old fashioned white person name\]. As i just went over, he was the founder of our school, but he was also the first president of our school. Every year before midterms, people will go up to this grand statue of him and rub his right shoe for good luck. However, legend has it that if you rub his left shoe, you will get pregnant and drop out of school.

**Some parents chuckle.**

Tour guide #1: And if you’re a guy, legend has it that you will not be able to graduate within four years. And so, to prevent people from committing this mistake, some engineers form the class of 1955 decided to build a block around the left shoe. They created a wooden box around the shoe, which lasted for quite a few months actually. Now, are there any questions about traditions?

**someone asks a question about housing**

tour guide #1: For those in the back, someone up front asked about housing, which we will get to later on our tour.

**tour guide turns back around and starts walking normally. some eager juniors go up to the tour guide and ask some questions related to pre-med opportunities, cut-throat peers, and grade inflation.**

tour guide #1: Alright, so now we're at \[insert generic white person surname\] House, which is objectively THE BEST house. Others may tell you otherwise, but they're wrong. Basically how housing works is that you fill out a form with your preferences, like whether you're an early bird or late owl, do you study with music, are you messy or clean, etc. Then REAL PEOPLE match you with someone who they think you'd be good with. And the system really works. I love my roommate and I don't know of anyone who's requested to have a different roommate.

**question about whether there are singles for students to stay in.**

tour guide #1: so, most people will be living in either doubles, triples, and sometimes quadruples, but you can request a single if you have a medical condition. Also, most of the floors are co-ed, but you can request to live in a womens-only floor, or a substance-free floor. Are there any questions? No? Alright, now we'll walk over to the science center where I'll tell you a little more about our UNIQUE curriculum.

**While the tour guide is walking, someone comes up to her and asks her about her stats and why she thinks she was admitted.**

Tour guide #1: Actually, as a tour guide, I’m not allowed to talk about the admissions process. Our school practices holistic admissions, so we look at everything, not just your SAT or ACT score, or what grades you have. I would just say that everyone who got in had great grades, great essays, and a great personality. So don’t sweat it.

Tour guide #1: so, this is our new, state-of-the-art science center. We can’t really go inside because that would take up too much time so I’m just going to stand outside and start talking. Even though we are a top research university, we also emphasize having a liberal arts education. As part of the liberal arts curriculum, every student has to take classes in the natural science, social sciences, humanities, and foreign language, but you can place out some of the requirements with AP or dual enrollment credit. And it might seem daunting to try to fulfill all the requirements, it’s actually very doable. I fulfilled one of the humanities requirements by taking a class where we analyzed Disney movies and our homework was to watch Disney movies. I think that the liberal arts curriculum does a very good job of preparing us for life beyond college. Now, we’re going to stop by the dining hall and talk a little more about the dining and food options here..

**Tour guide starts walking really fast and people struggle to keep up with the pace**

Tour guide #1: Alright, now we’re in front of \[insert another generic surname\] Dining Hall, which is one of THREE dining halls on-campus. All of the dining halls have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options AND we have chefs who will PERSONALLY make you a meal to meet your dietary needs. Additionally, there are fresh produce everyday and I love grabbing an apple during lunch before heading to my afternoon genetics class. Besides the dining halls, there’s also a few places on campus where you can grab a bite to eat when you’re up all night studying, like onion rings, quesadillas, and chicken tenders. So, the freshman 15 is definitely real if you decide to eat that stuff every night. Now, we’re going to head on over to the Career Center where I’ll talk more about internships and study abroads.

**a rich, white lady raises her hand and asks about campus safety.**

tour guide #1: that's a great question. so, our school is relatively safe, but we do have a blue light system. If you look around, you can spot a blue light every couple hundred feet or so, and if you're out at night and you ever feel unsafe, you can just hit the blue light and it'll automatically alert the police. I've heard that the average time it takes for the police to get here is something like 90 seconds. And if you're ever out studying in the library and you ever feel unsafe, you can just use this app that all students can get that calls up a personal driver to drive you back to your room, or you can call for a security guard to escort you back to your dorm. However, i've personally never felt like I've needed to use either of these things.

**a student raises his hand and asks about greek life.**

tour guide #1: so, our school does have greek life, but only like 30% of people participate in it. Personally, I didn't rush, and I don't feel left out at all because i'm so busy trying to beat the curve in my orgo class that I spend most of my Friday nights in the library. There also a lot of multicultural houses that host events that you can participate in, like the Black Student House.

Tour guide #1: Okay, so this is the Career Center. The people here are SO AMAZING, they will literally sit down with you and help you craft a resume and coach you through interviews. I have friends who have used the Career Center and gotten internships with Goldman Sachs or gotten grants to do research in Thailand. This same building also houses the Center for International Experiences, which helps people plan their studying-abroad. Now, it is a little difficult to study abroad while being premed, but it is certainly doable. I know people who have studied abroad, not once, not twice, but three times, and on the school’s dime. \[insert university name\] really encourages its students to engage with the global community so they can be effective and understanding leaders in a wide range of fields. Now, we will head on over back to the admissions office, which will be the last stop of the tour.

Tour guide #1: I like to end each of my tours with why I ended up committing to this school. I know that senior year when you’re applying to college, you’re probably thinking about the school’s ranking or how good your major is at the school. I was like that too and I was lucky enough to get into MANY top schools. However, when I visited many of the schools on admitted students day, the people didn’t really click with me. But, when I came here to visit, I was INSTANTLY WELCOMED by the students and I felt at home. The community here is SO AMAZING and SO UNIQUE. These people will no joke, stick by you, through both thick and thin.  I don’t regret committing here and I hope that wherever you go, you will have an amazing experience.

**Everyone starts clapping**

Tour guide #1: i’ll stick around for any questions you guys may have.

**A bunch of premeds go up and ask for the tour guide’s email so they can frantically email her at 11:59pm on the early deadline.**

9u8gth,2,2018-11-04,ECE student needs advice for summer/future career plans,SFSUer,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/9u8gth/ece_student_needs_advice_for_summerfuture_career/,"Hi, I'm a senior ECE student(Graduating next year) leaning towards applying for graduate programs in CE as opposed to applying for jobs right upon graduation. I've completed an REU program last summer. An REU program is basically a NSF funded research-internship at a university. REU programs are targeted towards those aiming for grad school as opposed to industry. My main purpose for leaning towards grad school is that I want to get a deeper understanding of the field as opposed to the scraping of the surface which is done in undergrad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now looking forward to next summer and am debating whether I should apply for REU programs again or if I should give industry internships a try. I am heavily interested in FPGAs and Embedded Systems. However, it seems like these sub-fields are more heavily covered in industry instead of research.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, I would really appreciate any thoughts or recommendations that you may have. "

&amp;#x200B;

So I've landed myself in something of a little predicament. I'm a General Engineering student who should've been Computer Science. I have a minor in Business and in Math. I took three courses of Java in high school so I have that experience, but it's been a while. I can't switch majors now because I graduate in less than a year and a half. Because of this, I'm trying as hard as I can to develop experience through a potential internship and electives (maybe another Java course this next fall). What would you guys suggest I do about pursuing a good job in SWE? Grad School? Bootcamp? Internship to job experience? What if I did an MBA instead so I could work through the ranks later on?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little stuck and some help would be absolutely wonderful. Thank you guys so much!"
9u8qb2,7,2018-11-04,Thank you r/cscareerquestions for helping me land my dream job in SF! Here's my story.,modestbeachhouse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9u8qb2/thank_you_rcscareerquestions_for_helping_me_land/,"**Context:**

I am a CS major at a US top 20 school overall, and around top 40 CS. I realize the advantage of this, so take my story with a grain of salt. This post focuses on how I went from not being able to reverse a linked list to getting 4 six-figure plus offers (1 at a BigN, 1 at a unicorn, 1 at a prop shop, and 1 company in SF). Hope you all are ready for my 2 year journey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sophomore Year:**

I go to my first career fair in the Fall and give some companies my elevator pitch. I have a solid GPA, have a few class and hackathon projects listed on my resume, and am a TA for Intro CS. I get a few interviews at non-tech companies like AT&amp;T and MasterCard. I get pretty far with AT&amp;T after passing fizzbuzz and reverse a string, but I failed the last question cause I couldn't reverse a linked list on the spot. I fail MasterCard behavioral because I didn't know the STAR method. In the Spring, I somehow manage to convince the CEO of a tiny startup to allow me to help code some plug-ins his wordpress website at out startup career fair because I learned PHP in one of my web development classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Junior Year:**

All right, last year's recruiting cycle didn't go that well. I had to change my strategy, so I started reading posts on this sub and hear about the magical website called leetcode which apparently is the key to getting those highly coveted silicon valley internships. I do \~40 leetcode problems that were mainly easy difficulty so that I don't mess up questions like reverse a linked list. **Even though I did those problems, I didn't feel like I learned any common patterns among the questions and had to look up the answer often**. I decided to TA DS&amp;A to keep the info fresh as well. I manage to get an onsite at a BigN because of campus recruiting but ultimately fail all the problems. **I knew that I needed to use BFS/DFS or merge sort to solve the questions they gave me, but I couldn't code them on the whiteboard because I had never practiced mock interviews.** I fail another BigN online assessment I got through a referral because I freeze up on LC medium tree and array questions. I felt stupid because one of my friends got the BigN without ever doing a leetcode. I did get a few other interviews at non-tech companies, and I got a job at a healthcare tech company because they didn't ask any leetcode style questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Junior Year Summer:**

Last year went better, but it still wasn't exactly what I wanted. I decided I would double down on leetcode after work over the summer and I would try my best to practice effectively. **I tried learning as much as possible during work about how to work in a team, learning from code reviews, asking my mentor and senior engineers tons of questions, learning how this company structures their code to be maintainable, efficient, and modular**. Most importantly, I tried to learn how these engineers made their decisions. What was their thought process? **I knew everything I learned during work was a talking point for behavioral questions for my next round of interviews, so I made the most of it**.

After work, I'd hit the gym, get dinner, and work from 7pm-10pm fully caffeinated and brushed up on common algorithms and **doing leetcode** ***by category***. I learned tree traversals, graph traversals, merge sort, recursion, two pointers, sliding window, greedy, etc. I learned each algorithm's time and space complexity. I realized I didn't really understand recursion until this summer, and I am just amazed at how useful it is for a ton of these problems. Once I actually learned the concepts behind the categories, doing these leetcode questions became much more enjoyable and I was cranking them out quicker. **I framed my learning based on** [**Jeremy Aguilon's article**](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score)**. Thanks so much Jeremy!** Jeremy is soooo right about how 80% of leetcodes can be done by knowing several strategies and 20% are the annoying ""gotcha"" questions everyone hates. All the leetcode questions I got in my real technical interviews senior year fell into the 80% category, and it's crazy how doing them in 30-45 minutes becomes more and more realistic once you figure out the patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

**Side note about working after work and if the leetcode grind is worth it:**

I worked around 7pm-10pm Monday-Thursday, took Friday off, and 11am-4pm on Saturday and Sunday. This wasn't a super strict schedule, though. I still had a ton of fun over the summer on my nights off turning 21 and hanging out with friends. I was bored 7pm-10pm Monday-Thursday and weekend afternoons anyways. I found a balance that worked for me, and I think you can too.

I took on the grind because I knew that putting in a few months of after work grinding would pay off getting a good tech company would pay off so much more working 60 hours a week for years climbing the ladder in a non-tech company.  That combined with the awful habit of me comparing myself to my peers causing anxiety and how I didn't want to waste spending tens of thousands of dollars on a private school education to get an average job was what motivated me, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Senior Year:**

Now it was crunch time. I still continued doing a few leetcodes in the beginning of the school year and had done about \~80 easy and \~80 mediums and 4 hards total by the end of my preparation, distributed across the categories I mentioned, before I started interviewing. I took an easier class load anticipating a lot of interviews. August-September I focused on doing **mock interviews** while applying to companies through our university job website and finessing the recruiters at the career fair. I gotta say [this video by the TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWvbPIYQPFM&amp;t=1s) was **one of the most influential videos** to demystify the ""thought process"" everyone talks about. I think it's actually more important than if you can get the most optimized solution for the problem. The thought process boils down to talking about **tradeoffs** and having a **bulletproof reason for each line of code** you write. You can't believe how easy it is to impress interviewers when you talk about all the possible ways you can tackle the problem, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and making your decision of what to use based on the constraints of the problem. **Gayle** was soooo right in CTCI about the thought process and the best conceivable solution as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I probably did about 10 mock interviews with friends, taking turns being the interviewer and the interviewee. **It was interesting being on the other side because it forced you to think about what the interviewer wants to see**. We gave each other medium problems to do with a strict 45 minute time limit. I can't stress how much doing mock interviews helps you develop the skills needed to whiteboard and explain your code as you're coding. I can go into more detail about what I think the interview essentials are, but honestly TechLead's video and CTCI goes over them pretty well, and this post is getting super long.

&amp;#x200B;

This time I only applied to coveted high-paying companies in cities I wanted to live in maximizing the salary to work-life balance ratio. This included the BigN, a few prop shops in Chicago, and a handful of midsize/unicorn tech companies in SF and Seattle. **I focused my applications on places I had referrals to, companies that came to my career fair, and at the least, companies that were listen on my university job listing page.** I found I would get a much higher chance of getting interviews through these channels rather than spamming applications online. I had referrals to 2/3 BigN's, some prop shops in Chicago came to my school's career fair, and I found a few companies in SF/Seattle in my university job listing page.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I got interviews to 9 companies. I passed the coding challenge, phone screen, and/or on-campus interview for 6 of those companies. I knew I screwed up my first BigN onsite, but one interviewer there gave me the advice that helped me more than anything for the rest of my interviews:

&gt;""Hey modestbeachhouse, I could tell you were pretty nervous during this interview trying to tackle this hard problem. We don't deduct points for nervous candidates, but remember that every one of these interviews is going to be hard. The sooner you accept that the sooner you can focus on doing your best to solve the problem rather than letting your nerves affect your thought process.""

Doing my best to follow his advice and be confident, I managed to secure the next few onsites. It is much easier to follow that advice after you get your first offer lol.

&amp;#x200B;

In total, I had 25 technical assessments counting coding challenges, phone screens, technical interviews at onsites. I tried learning what I did good and bad in each one and fixing it for the next one. If you combine that with my \~10 mock interviews that is about 35 total interviews. The most important algorithms to know are graph traversals, tree traversals, and the sliding window/2 pointer technique in my opinion. Honestly, after practicing the ""thought-process"" it is very possible to at least get an answer even if it's not the most optimized to most questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts:**

The interview grind isn't for everyone. A lot of people hate on it, but it is what it is. For me, it was worth it because I was able to nearly double my compensation from the return offer I had from my previous company, which was around \~$70k, after several months of grinding, mind COL differences. Not gonna lie though, I did learn a ton throughout this process. I am definitely lucky though that I genuinely enjoy computer science and building things. Everytime I learn a new way to solve a leetcode problem or a design pattern from my internship, I am like ""Holy shit that so cool! Now I can use that new thing I learned for the next thing I build!"" I'm also lucky in a ton of other ways, but I could go on and on. Regardless of the school you go to though, nearly everyone goes through the grind. I remember meeting someone from Waterloo at one of my onsites and he said he cracked open CTCI on his daily commute and did those problems on paper and that's the only reason he got the internships he did.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lastly, I definitely could not have done this alone. Recruiting season is hell for everyone.** It is super easy to feel absolutely worthless when you don't get the job you wanted or feel so stupid when you can't understand an interview problem, and I gotta thank my friends and family for being supportive during the lows. **Thank you so much to everyone in** /r/cscareerquestions\*\*,\*\* [**Jeremy Aguilon**](https://jeremyaguilon.me/)**,** [**TechLead**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw)**, Gayle, and** [**Jarvis**](https://www.youtube.com/user/VSympathyV)**!** I know that reading other people's stories on this sub helped me out a ton, so I figured I'd write one of my own. I don't really post ever, but I do have more details I left out advice about behavioral interviews, making a good resume, and doing personal projects. Let me know if you're interested!

9uc67z,13,2018-11-05,"As someone who is older and has fairly extensive work experience, should I bother with an internship?",bung_musk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9uc67z/as_someone_who_is_older_and_has_fairly_extensive/,"I'm in my early 30's and have less than 2 years left for my degree in Computer Engineering. Here are some details about my current situation to provide some context.  Hopefully it doesn't sound too much like a personal pitch, but I think it's important to mention my skill set and experience.

&amp;#x200B;

During the summers I am working at my old job as a production manager and freelance technician in the entertainment / corporate AV industry. Before going back to school,  I managed some decent sized projects (in the tens of thousands of dollars range) and traveled quite a bit for work.  I feel like I have a good reputation in my industry, good management/people skills, and a strong sense of how to run a business profitably.  Currently I make enough money to pay for my tuition and living costs by working my butt off in the summer - without doing so I would be assuming a large amount of debt to complete my degree.  That being said, I am worried that not taking an internship or some kind of entry level position before I graduate may limit my employment options.  I am obviously quite a bit older than the typical junior developer, so I am also concerned my age may be a limiting factor.  I will be the first to admit that I am not the smartest person in the class, or the best coder alive, but I am competent, a good problem solver, I enjoy coding and  have a strong work ethic (when I am getting paid - killing myself for a high GPA is something I tried and led to burnout and depression, but I digress).  

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest hesitation is financially motivated:  I am already going to be making less as fledgling dev than I currently make, and taking an internship would mean assuming some debt to pay for the rest of school.  However, I am willing to delay the financial reward further if it means significantly increasing my job prospects.  Would it be wise to continue working my old job during the summer and avoid debt, or is an internship going to markedly increase my chances of landing a better entry level position?  

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone who is or has been in a similar position offer any insight?  I am over half way through my degree, so I looking at how I am going to move forward with my career path seems to be something that I should start putting some serious thought into beyond, ""Learn the things, get the piece of paper, get the job."""

I feel like in theory my credentials should be competitive (CS masters degree with good GPA, two internships including one at a recognizable tech company, etc.) yet my resume is getting almost completely ignored.

What am I doing wrong with my resume? Also, I'd appreciate any suggestions for a better format. Thanks!

The degree was very similar to the Computer Science curriculum with the exception of a few classes. The big difference being that my degree had a specific sys admin track. Which in college I did a brief 6 month internship as a software developer and then I got a sys admin job shortly before graduating, which I have been doing ever since.

Having worked in a sys admin role for awhile now, I have come to realize that I would rather be doing software development and I feel like I enjoy it more. I have always made a point to do software development activities in my spare time, and I keep an active Github profile. I am looking for some specific suggestions as to what steps I can take to land a role as a software developer.

I have already started applying to jobs, mainly though just to test the waters and see what type of responses I get. I haven't really gotten any responses so far other than automated emails stating that my skills are not a match. My strategy has been to emphasize my versatility having a background as both a sys admin and my internship experience as a developer. My resume has my Github URL as well. I'm curious if anyone else has tried to make a similar type of career change or if anyone could give me insight into what they might be looking for when hiring a software developer who doesn't hasn't followed a ""traditional"" developer career path.

I’ve always been interested in tech and startups. So bought and read a bunch of books HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby; used online resources; and ultimately decided I need to attend a bootcamp. After much research, I’ve narrowed it down to FullStack Academy NYC and Le Wagon (the Tokyo campus)

What attracted me to Le Wagon: their motto of learn to program like an entrepreneur, they seem very authentic, the glowing reviews on course report and switch up. 

What attracted me to FullStack: tremendous reputation, much closer to where I live, most of their graduates appear to end up with great jobs.

People have pushed me one way or the other based on the fact that Le Wagon is Ruby on Rails focused, whereas FullStack is a deep dive in JavaScript.

I can’t help but feel that Le Wagon is a risky, once in a lifetime experience whereas FullStack is the safer option. (Based off checking the LinkedIn’s of people who wrote reviews for both schools, seems Le Wagon alumni try to start their own company, freelance, and some go on to developer roles; whereas FullStack many are employed at notable companies)

My ultimate goal is to have the ability to build a startup via tech when I want, but also be able to apply for entry level roles at solid tech companies in the US. (Heck I’d even take an internship somewhere)

Is there anyone that can point me in the right direction? Alumni, people in the industry, etc. my heart says Le Wagon but my brain says FullStack :(

Much obliged!"

In fact I hate it with everything I have. I can't stand being in class anymore and I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail this semester. I'm also dreading the second semester (if I pass) because I have to do an internship to pass, an internship that I have to find myself and is most likely going to have to be out of the city...to which I don't have a car because i'm f\*\*king broke. But I'm dealing wit it the best I can, even though my mental state is deteriorating before my freaking eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

But the worst part about all this is that I have no one to talk to about it! And it's not even like I haven't been trying, I have talked to friends, classmates, my psychologist. I have been pretty vocal that this isn't what I want to do and i'm starting to feel lost. But all I have been getting is the same feed back from all of them, almost like they are all reading from the same goddamn script. 

""You got this, don't worry about it""

""I believe in you, you can pass.""

""If you fail you can just retake the class.""

""I'm sure everything is going to be fine, just talk to your teachers.""

""Your so good at this, I couldn't do that."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Its all so freaking frustrating, WHY ARE YOU IGNORING THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS! What good is this positivity when I am openly saying that I fu\*king hate what I'm in and don't want to do it anymore. All I want is someone to talk to and have a conversation about my options, and help me just talk it out and maybe finally get some clarity on what I can do. This whole thing has done nothing but bring me more anxiety and depression, and has successfully caused me to put up even more walls. I don't really know what to do anymore, and I'm not even sure what to expect from posting this really, I just couldn't hold it in anymore after another failed attempt to talk about this.

9uhcm4,6,2018-11-05,[New Grad Advice] Can't choose between two companies,delta9r9r,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9uhcm4/new_grad_advice_cant_choose_between_two_companies/,"If this doesn't belong in a post then feel free to redirect me to a daily thread or whatever. I'm in my last year at college and am very fortunate to have received two offers for next year that I'm having trouble deciding between. I'm writing this post to seek specific advice about which company to choose but also just how to deal with the general uncertainty that I'm feeling at this stage in my career.

My long-term career goal is to end up doing machine learning/deep learning research, ideally at a place like FAIR or Deepmind (still a long way to go until then). This path may involve me pursuing a PhD in 2-3 years after industry work, but I haven't fully committed to this path just yet. I first and foremost value being able to make an impact on other people's lives a lot, and money only insofar as I'll be able to support my parents and future family. At the same time, I very don't enjoy most of the software engineering I've done so far, as I get mentally exhausted when I get blocked on the same lines of code for several hours. Perhaps this is a result of never having worked on something I was truly passionate about, but I'm confident I enjoy thinking about high-level ideas (algorithms, math, system design) more than implementing those ideas.

My offers are between Twitch (the video streaming site acquired by Amazon a few years back) and Facebook (returning intern offer). I would be doing backend SWE at both companies. The total compensation and benefits from the two offers is similar enough that it doesn't really play a large part in my considerations. Here's basically what I've listed out for pros and cons of each company:



Twitch:

- I know my team, and I will be working on a team that uses applied ML (plus), and I connected and felt like I could learn a lot from the team members during my onsite interviews (plus)

- I connect more with the product and culture, as I am an avid user of twitch (s/o to the gaming homies) (plus)

- Location is ever so slightly better, as it's in san francisco whereas facebook is ~1 hour south of SF (plus)

- A lot more growth is happening at Twitch right now imo, so I would be gaining a lot of experience in a style of company I've never been in before (mid-sized) (plus)

- Smaller company, so if I want to pivot teams or find new things to work on, there'll be less opportunity (minus)

- Less ML research/less known names compared to Facebook AI Research (assuming I can even interact with them at facebook) (minus)



Facebook

- Bigger brand name -&gt; easier time switching jobs in the future in case I decide to stay in industry rather than PhD. Specifically, moving from Facebook to Twitch is probably easier than the other way around (plus-ish?)

- Bootcamp means I don't know what team I'll be on, so there's a slight chance I can get onto the Applied Machine Learning team or sneak my way into FAIR as a research engineer in a couple of years, but there's also a chance I will be doing something completely unrelated to ML for a year or two (plus-ish?) (side question: would any connections I make here be able to help in the grad school application process?)

- A lot more locations in case I decide to move later (plus)

- More organized growth structure in terms of job promotions and compensation (plus)



Other random tidbits that may be relevant (or may not be):

- I'm fairly confident in my interview skills (got internship offers from amazon, google, facebook last year)

- Fairly sure I want to stay in Bay Area or New York City for at least a decade



In summary, Twitch seems like a good choice for me right now in the short term horizon given my career state, but Facebook seems better for my future (i.e. 3+ years out). In some sense, it seems like my heart is telling me Twitch but my mind is telling me Facebook. How would you weigh these advantages/disadvantages if you were me? (or even if you were yourself). Also for those of you that are curious about the interview process/either company, feel free to ask/DM me.

Thanks for your input!

9uivry,3,2018-11-05,Should I quit my internship?,MutedButterfly0,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9uivry/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"Things at my internship have been rocky at best lately. I desperately want to quit, but I don't know if it's the right move. I \*know\* some of this isn't normal... and some of it is wrong. But how do I balance that with the need to have an internship on my resume?

Context: I'm 24 years old, I'm a graduate student, this is my first internship.

I'm supposed to be working at this sort-of art museum as a ""librarian"" - basically, they need someone to catalogue their book collection. However, it's been week since I've worked with books. Mostly, they have me give guests tours or help out with their events, which really means waitressing.

Here are the reasons I'm considering quitting:

1. The payment stuff is shady. I started as an unpaid intern, but they asked me to come in for extra paid shifts. When they pay us, they do it from three separate bank accounts. I don't know much about accounting or finance, but that seems wrong. I wonder if it's connected to their status as a ""nonprofit,"" even though I know for a fact they turn a profit?
2. My boss is crazy. I mean literally crazy. Everyone who works for her says she's crazy. Past employees (who I've just now started to find online and in real life) say she's crazy. Two interns recently quit because... you guessed it. She's crazy. She yells at me for not doing stuff she never TOLD me to do. Some days, she's extremely kind to me. Others she says horrible, inappropriate things. When I come in to work, I can never tell if she's going to scream at me or tell me she loves me. I'm anxious about it constantly.
3. One of my male coworkers is being inappropriate towards me. I liked him a lot at first - he seemed nice, we got along. But recently he keeps touching me. Specifically, he keeps touching my ass - but he acts like it's accidental and at this point, I can't tell if he's actually purposely being a creep or if I'm just fucking crazy.
4. I have another job and am trying to get through my last semester of grad school. I feel like I don't have enough time to do this anymore, especially because every day here feels more and more discouraging.

So my question is: do I quit? Or do I tough it out so I have an internship on my resume? I have a lot of other impressive stuff on my resume... but at the same time, this is the only internship I've ever done. And the woman who runs this place is powerful. I mean really REALLY powerful. I think she could ruin my life if she wants to.

What do I do?"

Let me preface what I’m about to say with the fact that I am the son of a widowed mother of 5 kids (4 boys one girl) who works really hard to provide. I am paying for all of my school through loans and will graduate with around 250k debt before interest. My mom has done whatever she can to pay the minor amounts not covered by loans. 4 of us are in or just graduated college and she has little to no money to spare on luxury things. 

I knew before I left to study abroad that I’d be spending the little I had saved during the summer, but did not expect it to run out so fast. Being that I’m abroad, I am not allowed to earn money or even intern for free. The whole financial situation has been worsened by the pressure of other students to do weekend travel and go out, for which I’m too embarrassed to give a firm no to. For example, I said I would like to go to Oktoberfest when asked and was subsequently included into an air BnB for which I had no intention of staying in. For weeks I idiotically told the other kids I would buy my flight and ended up coming up with a last minute excuse as to why I couldn’t go. Although I didn’t end up going I am obligated to pay the 200 dollar air bnb cost, which I find fair, but have no money to pay for...this was over a month ago and I have yet to pay him back. This has been compounded by many small transactions by my more well off roommates who have bought me food and drinks. I have tried to cut back these interaction and have resorted to eating one calorie dense meal of potatoes eggs and beans every other day and doing audio transcriptions to pay for such food.

But wait, it gets worse. Being that I had come up with excuses as to why I couldn’t come on any trips my friends insisted that they purchase my plane tickets for me...for two trips (Austria and Amsterdam. I confronted them on the idiotic purchase just for him to say “I’ll never forgive you” if I left him with kids he didn’t know as well.  

So that takes me to here, 2 am Austrian time sitting in and crying in a bed that I can’t afford, looking for an excuse as to why I can’t rent ski’s tomorrow. Luckily, I was able to get through today by saying my reservation was messed up. I have at this point, with the help of my mom (she is unaware of how in debt i am) paid what I was told the cost of the trip to be (250 dollars for hostels and flights) but have been utterly destroyed by fees I was unaware would occur. For example, 50 dollar fee for two nights in a hostel (only the deposit had been paid), 140 (my portion alone) in Uber’s to a ski lodge, and 180 for 3 nights in such place . All of which someone else had to pay for, for me.. People are starting to catch on that I’m broke and I’m totally embarrassed and overwhelmed, it just makes me want to hang myself from the rafters. I know I was idiotic and a pussy for allowing myself to get into this situation, but now that I’m over 1000 in debt with more expenses to come it doesn’t matter. My mom can not afford to have this type of financial pressure put on her and has helped me enough. I don’t know what the fuck to do...."

I think this lays out the situation for me pretty well and helps me decide how to make my decisions going forward. Thanks for your interest in my problem and for making Reddit a helpful place!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello folks! I would appreciate some input on a strange situation. I am an undergraduate student (thus, still green) and thought that maybe some more experienced academics and researchers might be able to offer me insight and help me understand my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

There's more to the story than I'll write here, and I can offer it up if anyone asks. For now, I'll just try to keep it brief for you:

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:** I'm enrolled in an undergraduate program that offers a thesis capstone. I've also gotten an internship at a firm that is asking me to research a topic. My work at the internship is broad, because there is barely any existing research on the topic. They're having me do a deep literature review to see if I can dredge up any emergent theories or relationships about this topic. At seeing how little work exists on this topic, I was intrigued. I thought it might be a good idea to base my thesis' research question on this topic. That way, I could stay focused on the subject and hopefully produce better quality work for the firm and for my thesis.

It didn't quite work out how I had hoped.

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor has expressed that he doesn't want me writing my thesis on *anything at all* in the subject area, even going so far to instruct me on what my thesis may and may not include. My thesis work doesn't answer to him so that felt to me like intimidation. I offered tweaking my research question, changing my methods to methods of less concern... I even suggested I pivot to a whole different research question in the same field instead, way earlier on when there was still more time in the semester, and he discouraged this idea (Maybe he was just being polite but he seemed serious to me). My thesis doesn't need to get published, so I asked if this was a concern, but he still doesn't want me to do it even if it doesn't get published.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what his motivations are.

I've been asking around and doing some reading, and my impression is that it isn't a breach of ethics for me to *study the same thing* that someone else is studying or will be studying, as long as I avoid using their data without permission, and avoid plagiarizing myself. I learned about the idea of ""being scooped"", but if *even* unpublished work is a problem then I don't understand how that would be the concern. Plus, at the undergrad level on a three-month timeline with absolutely no funding, the notion that anything I do could be a problem for him strikes me as absolutely absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to work with him, but I feel like I need to understand what my goal is in order to move forward. *Should I be working to correct my own unethical actions,* or *should I be working towards meeting my needs while granting my supervisor a professional courtesy?*

The subject area, by the way, is not too broad or too specific. It's something like, for example: ""urban poverty and arson deaths""

I do a lot of my Ec's outside of school as I swim varsity and we have practices 5 times a week. This makes it impossible to do Ec's in school So far I have: I have self-taught myself 6 languages, swim varsity (captain senior year), coding club president (during my senior year), self-taught myself 4 coding languages and built may apps with that knowledge, taking on a computer science summer internship (2019), and started a coding nonprofit. I would really like to add a few more solid Ec's in order to further strengthen my application.

Also... could you guys also rate my Ec's on a scale of 1-10

9ukhw1,3,2018-11-05,"Oakland, Ca - I'm thinking about quitting half year, looking for advice",CalRunner1991,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/9ukhw1/oakland_ca_im_thinking_about_quitting_half_year/,"Hey all, thanks for taking the time to read this. Please read the **TLDR** if this is too much below.

I'm a first year teacher in Oakland, CA that is struggling HARD right now. I teach 4th grade in a rough district, but not that bad of a school. I'm hired on an as intern (I'm finishing my last trimester for my multiple subject credential in tandem), and looking for some advice on what to do these next few months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Class background:**

When I originally started working, I had only 21 students - which seemed like the grace of god. I had 2 other 4th grade teachers in my cohort - another 1st year teacher, and a 30 year veteran teacher. I knew that 1st year teaching is always rough, but I had some *strong* personalities in my class - 3 girls in particular who couldn't care less about their education or about their disruption in class. My biggest weakness is I hate to yell, and I have a pretty soft heart, so for the first few weeks I was pretty lenient about waging war with these students. As the weeks progressed, however, I started to shut down their behavior, have meetings with their parents, and basically let them know that wasn't going to fly. All was going well. Until...

&amp;#x200B;

A little over a month ago we got the news that they would be consolidating the other 1st year teacher's class into our 2 classes. This means that we would inherit 10 new students each. Now, I know that most teachers typically deal with class sizes near 30-31, but the shift has been insane. 4 of my new students have ridiculous behavioral problems - swearing at teachers, straight up refusing to do work at all, walking out of the classroom, swearing, picking fights, ect. It's unbelievable the amount of disrespect these students are showing! I have a clip chart and regularly move them down to contact home and losing privileges - recess is lost, computers, performing arts, ect. They have to write reflections too, but they just DON'T CARE! They would much rather waste their time messing around then actually getting their act straight. Their parents are no help either - I've probably been in 15 different meetings with the principal, therapists, psychs, ect with little or no change. The class is seriously so disruptive, rude, mean, and disrespectful that I've considering walking out halfway through the day MULTIPLE times.

&amp;#x200B;

**The actual debate:**

So, as I mentioned earlier, I'm hired on as an intern. Typically if credentialed teachers leave halfway through the year, they cannot teach for another year. Interns, however, don't face the same consequence (I believe). I will be done with my hours and work requirements (Cal TPA videos, RICA, ect) by this Thanksgiving break, and will have nothing left to fulfill for my multiple subject credential. I am strongly considering just bouncing and letting some other teacher(s) deal with this class for the remainder of the year while I find some work subbing or better yet pick up a long term subbing position at a better district and hopefully secure a spot there. I have some moral issues with leaving my class halfway through the year, but honestly I work my ass off 12 hours a day to provide these kids with an education that they show ZERO appreciation for! **I LOVE teaching and I love kids, but everyday this class makes me questions whether I'm in the right field because of their disrespect. I didn't get hired on as a therapist, psychologist, or a babysitter, and it feels like I'm forced in to those roles instead of an educator 90% of the time. I just don't know what to do. Any advice?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** My 4th grade class is insanely disrespectful, notoriously difficult (as said by many of the teachers at this school), and making me feel like my work is not appreciated. I dread going to work each day, and am regretting my decision to get into teaching. I know in my heart that I want to teach, but I don't like working 12 hour days for kids that don't show appreciation for what I do. Should I bounce after winter break and find something better? What are the consequences? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much if you made it this far, I truly appreciate it."
9ukjbp,1,2018-11-05,What you can do as a freshman and sophomore for T10 applications...,koodoos,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9ukjbp/what_you_can_do_as_a_freshman_and_sophomore_for/,"Hey peoples,

&amp;#x200B;

I see alot of you ask what you can do as freshmen and sophomores to start strengthening your application and improving your chances of getting into a T10.

As an [admissions reader](https://koodooslearning.com/meet-our-team), I've noticed a few trends (in coursework and ECs) that students start in freshmen or sophomore year that really help the applications stand out with respect to course rigor and extracurriculars (they get the 9/9 for academics). And this is stuff that doesn't cost a lot of money (they're all free in fact) and are pretty much available in every school or city.

Based on what've I've noticed after assessing 1000s of applications, here's what I recommend (4 things) freshmen and sophomores do to start early:

## 1. Take as many AP, IB classes as possible

One of the major factors admissions officers take into account when assessing applicants is the rigor of their high school course load. To maximize your course rigor, I suggest taking as many Advanced Placement classes as your school offers as soon as you’re allowed to (I hear some schools don’t allow students to take AP classes until sophomore or junior year). This includes taking AP world language classes like Spanish, French, and Latin as well as the AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, AP English, and AP Fine Arts classes, depending on your interest. I also recommend students take classes to earn the IB diploma if AP classes aren’t available at their school. That being said, taking a full schedule of AP and IB classes will ensure you get max points for course rigor on your applications.

## 2. Get a summer job

I would say only about 1 in every 8 cases when I read undergraduate applications did the applicant list a job in the extracurricular or work section. So, when an applicant listed a summer internship or other paid work as an activity, it actually stood out to me. Jobs that are related to the applicant’s academic interest (stuff like starting an online clothing shop for arts majors or working at a hospital for pre-med students) were especially impressive. I recommend spending at least one summer pursuing paid work to bolster your experiences and activities for your application. Plus, working a summer job gives you one more thing to write about in those “tell us about an experience” prompts.

## 3. Run for student government, including student commissions

One of the top extracurricular activities admissions officers look for when assessing a candidate is time spent in a leadership position on their school’s student government team. Being the student body president, gets especially high marks. I work for a large school district, so I know that lots of school administrators operate student committees (to get feedback about how the school is running) that students have the opportunity to volunteer for and serve on at the school or district level. Being a part of a committee like this is usually open to all students so sophomores and freshmen can serve on them alongside their older schoolmates. Serving on a committee or in a top position in student government demonstrates initiative and leadership and will definitely help you stand apart from other applicants who haven’t assumed a school-wide responsibility.

## 4. Volunteer with a community organization to conduct an extensive research or advocacy project.

Community groups and nonprofit organizations are always looking for hardworking and capable volunteers to help build their capacity to do more work within their organizations. For highly talented freshmen and sophomores, I recommend they take advantage of these opportunities and coordinate with a local organization to conduct some research, outreach, or an evaluation they need to be done. Using your intellectual skills and academic interests to help a community group speaks volumes about your ability to learn in the classroom and turn that knowledge into something positive. It also demonstrates a willingness to dedicate extensive time to bettering your community since deliberately planned and executed projects can take months to complete.

Any questions about other specific things you can do to get started early?

That being said, I'm very conflicted between my choices (as they're all pretty different in both domain and culture) and I've heard many various things about them from my friends. On top of that, I'm also conflicted about eventually going for a PHD. I was hoping someone with experience at any of these companies can talk more about them and what they were like.

JS has the highest comp, followed by dropbox and robinhood. At the same time, my experience at previous internships has led me to believe that my preference in work goes the absolute reverse way. I also got a weird vibe from JS when interviewing with them, but I'm not sure how valid that is. I'd like to know more from first-hand experiences with these companies.

9uksdf,1,2018-11-05,"How should I ""advertise"" my personal project to employers if it is huge in scope?",pennstudent1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9uksdf/how_should_i_advertise_my_personal_project_to/,"I just graduated, never had any huge internships, just worked as a software engineer for archaeological projects at my school.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest ""selling point"" is this personal project of mine. In short it's a search engine for the art market that uses AI to identify art for sale without having to be explicitly told whats for sale in the markup (like how Google shopping works). It also functions as an e-commerce site for art dealers.

&amp;#x200B;

The project is huge, I've been working on it for 3 years. It includes a full site written in PHP, HTML, Sass, &amp; MySQL. It has its own API, its connected to Stripe so that customers can buy subscriptions and host their own customizable storefronts. The whole site is mobile optimized, I did the graphic design, the web design, the web dev, literally everything but making the fonts themselves. I also wrote the massive Node.js server and the web-scraping technology that the site is ""selling"".

&amp;#x200B;

How do I put this on my resume when I'm applying to entry-level software engineering and web development jobs? Do I just try to list all of the features and languages I used? Should I mention the scraper technology and AI side of things more than the web development itself? Should I leave out things like the web design that I also did? Last time I tried to put this on my resume it took up a huge amount of space with me just trying to list everything I've done. I literally have no idea how I should describe this on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

My other concern is that I haven't officially released the site. Everything is working, I'll post a link if anyone thinks they need to see, but things like the copy on the about page aren't finished up, and I've heard stats are valued over descriptions of what you've built. Thoughts?"

I think the only reason I'm having this much difficulty is that I didn't get an internship in college. Trust me, I tried. Same shit, just on a 2-year time limit.

EDIT: I guess i might also be having problems because I attended college in another state with a less renowned CS program. But the place had way better game dev program and way cheaper.

So....that's it? I'm just screwed for finding a CS job because some douchebags didn't return my calls in college?

I feel somewhat old to be starting a career.

As a college student, I never had the option to work an internship which has hurt my ego pretty bad. I landed a couple but, most of the were unpaid and others were to far to commute. I needed to work to live and unpaid internship never could be an option. 

I’m getting my degree in Information system. CS just wasn’t in the cards for me. The degree is pretty general and I focused my classes mainly on programming/computer security.  Which are the fields I would love to work in. 

Personally I do have a lot of customer service experience. Though jobs like serving and working at a grocery store. I can personally say I am great with people. Right now I currently work at a local Cell phone/computer repair shop which I thought would help. But, even now I don’t know if it does. 

After I graduate I really want to start looking for a more professional job.  I have books for Network+ and  Security +. Which I plan on hitting hard as soon as the semester is over. 

So, if anyone can help with advice on landing that first  IT job, I’m fine with Helpdesk since it’s pretty much what I do.

I grew up working on my dad’s farm but i lived on the beach. I’ve had many different jobs from carpentry, construction, lawn care, inmate handler, public works, farming, truck driving, equipment operating and the lot. I went to college for a while and learned it wasn’t for me, hated the city and the apartments and nobody wanted to a beached out farm boy. My parents moved to NC before they had me, making me the only person in my family tree not born in the Midwest. All my cousins and uncles and aunts and grandparents lived out in the Midwest and i rarely ever saw them but when i did i always the got the “you’re not a real *insert my last name* since you didn’t grow up farming out here, they meant it as a joke but i took it to heart because my name means something to me. Well i ended up getting an internship opportunity to come work for the biggest farmer in the county of where my relatives live and where my parents grew up. I always dreamed of working on a farm out here so i jumped at the chance. Fast forward 6 months. I came up here as soon as college got out and have stayed with my Uncle while working for this farm. They got over 10,00 acres of row crops and five herds of cattle so I’ve been busy. I impressed my boss so much he asked to stay on for harvest, so i did. I drove a truck and ran the combine and auger wagon when they needed. All brand new John Deere equipment, 3 S780s, 1 S770 and four wagons and a fleet of nine trucks. Well, one of the main employees got fired a few weeks ago for doing drugs or something (ain’t my business what he did and why he got canned) and my boss put me in his rig since i was driving one of the older trucks. Then my boss gave me his work pick up to drive for work instead of the beater i was driving. And now my boss has given me all his responsibilities. Since his firing everyone has been saying that I’m in the lead for his job, seems like shop talk right? Well to get what I’m saying understand this, my boss tends to talk and ask the opinions of all the main employees before hiring or firing someone so they all must’ve heard from him that he was fixing on offering it to me. Now my uncle and aunt know my boss quite well and my aunt even mentioned how impressed he’s been with me since I’ve been and how much he’d love for me to stay on. This is my dilemma, i came out like a bat outta hell to prove to my daddy, my family, and everyone who said i couldn’t make it as a Midwestern farmer wrong and to earn my name in the eyes of those wouldn’t let me have it. I done that. And i absolutely love being out here. But, i don’t want to stay here forever. I had planned on going to Texas after this to work on an oil rig to save enough money to buy my farm when i went back to North Carolina, that was my plan. Now since this talk of me getting a full time job with this farm has got my head spinning. I’d love to stay out here and work but I’m worried of getting stuck out here and never returning home. I just don’t know where to put my head on this and i want to have an answer for my boss when he asks me, if he does. So how should i think about this? How do i decided what my answer is gonna be? Should i take this job? What factors should i consider? I’m 21 years young, i have many skills and can work hard. I ain’t got no girlfriend or kids. No debt. I’m free as i can be but i can’t decide what i want to do with this potential job opportunity.. help me out y’all!! Thank ya. "

I currently make 120+decent benefits in NYC.  I have a very strong analytical background with BAs in Econ/Stats from top school and MS in analytics from a top state school.

I started off working in SF out of undergrad for a measly 60k doing energy consulting for utilities companies. Quit after 8 months but couldn't get another job somehow despite my pedigree (graduated early and had no internships). Went back to school for a year.

Out of MS program I got recruited into a bank. I worked for one year as a brokerage analyst (literally analyzing the online brokerage business), one year in credit card (acquisitions, risk, underwriting) and now moved to CRE portfolio analytics 3 months ago.

Being in NYC makes me hungry for more. I like my team and my WLB is unheard of for NYC. I also think my pay is pretty fair since I'm still just a senior business analyst.

However, with more experience I have realized that the mid-upper management isn't making nearly as much as I imagined when I first started. This first sunk in when I got promoted and my raise was only 8% -- later adjusted to 12% after they updated salary bands.

I have done great work with enormous impacts (9 figures to annual NPV generation model) and scope (literally the only analyst for the whole brokerage). At my bank, people sometimes slip through the cracks and get amazing experience that no other bank would trust an analyst with. Recruiters are sometimes shocked at the work I've done.

I don't have 10 years to make it to VP only to make $300k. Just no. I am not fast tracked here. The experience is world class but the performance management here is so bad it's not even worth trying. They still force stack rankings.

As a general business analyst, I think it would make sense to make manager here then go somewhere else for a step up.But I would like to leverage my finance experience too. 

What kind of options are there for me to hit that step change without sacrificing too much WLB? Currently I work 40 hours straight up. I realize I have a good thing going on here, but I want to make a lot more money. I now have experience doing financial modeling across several fields, and a world class pedigree. Should I go deeper into real estate  and try to get picked up by a PE firm? Should I get a CFA  and consider equity research (love researching stocks and very good accounting intuition)?

Open to any and all suggestions. Up until now I focused on learning as much as I can and getting good experience. Now I am looking to cash in, but not looking to work more than 50 hours a week. 

Part of me feels very fortunate, but the other part knows that people who are more clued in are making way more money and I feel like if they can, why can't I? Coming out of top undergrad and comparing to peers, I realize I wasted the opportunity to get on the right track straight away. I was not prepared at all for the job market and paid for it. Now I have a pretty unique and diversified background, but it's so unconventional I don't know where to go with it because it's not as simple as ""been working in ibanking for two years, what next?"" I am not even sure how PE firms would react to my resume. Is my breadth of experience a plus or a red flag? Personally I think it's a huge plus because I bring a fresh perspective and can tie together similarities across the work I have done

I am an expert in SQL and comfortable working with data in python 

I love being a generalist. I was born to be an analyst and dont mind being an individual contributor long term. But where will my general skillset be valued?"

So my question is what positions, if any, are suitable for students that are within my field of expertise. I also welcome tips on how to search for those jobs as I never have done any serious job hunting.

Thanks in advance."

Hello everyone. Me and a friend are making plans to find a way to move out of America and wish to receive feedback on the best European nations for accomplishing this. I am looking at Amsterdam, New Zealand, and if all else fails Canada. I am open to suggestions of course. My friend may go through with it if he decides to separate himself from a toxic situation, but I wanted to see if I qualified in making it happen on my own. Of course, this is easier with two people, but I wanted to see my options.

I wanted to take the time to post my brief skills in type of work I did, education, and financial overview.

I have roughly $3300 in my account and I am living with family who does not charge rent. After this holiday I should have $5000 or $6000 saved up. I am one hell of a penny pincher that my hobbies include eat, sleep, shit, repeat. I am not joking, I am surprised I have not gone stir crazy honestly. I could sell my things including vehicle which could place me in around $10000.

I want out because I do not want to live like this anymore. America does not care about its people hence the reason why we have the greatest wealth yet the greatest homelessness. I am sure that none of you require nor need me to explain the numerous reasons to want to leave this country but all I ever hear is how Americans that left are truly living, that they live each day and there is work and abundance but you simply must work hard for it and it will present it self to you. I jumped state in America thinking that it would solve my problems and for the most part it has, but finding a means to live is cut throat. If there is a chance, even a tiny one that I can leave especially with my friend then I would like to take it. I do not care what I do for a living as long as it covers my rent and expenses. What do you think reddit? Is my vague and brief work history, education, and finances enough? Or will I have to just get comfy and try to make it work? I feel like I can’t hold on much longer with this economy and way of life I want to live again, not be a husk walking around.

9urmcl,7,2018-11-06,Is it okay to approach the customers of my former boss who passed away one month ago?,unicron26,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9urmcl/is_it_okay_to_approach_the_customers_of_my_former/,"I am a bit in a dilemma about this.

So two years ago I worked for an advertisement photographer during an internship. I learned a lot in this time and I had a good relationship to him. Until recently, while working as a photographer myself, I still helped him out from time to time as an assistant while he was slowly preparing to sell his studio and go into pension.

One month ago I received a letter informing me he passed away due to cancer which was really unexpected. Nobody knew about it. 

Two weeks later one of his customers that I happened to know better approached me for a job. I felt a bit bad in the first place but obviously everyday business keeps running and they needed somebody to take their pictures, so I accepted. In fact this was a huge opportunity for me and my biggest customer so far. 

I am now wondering if it is okay to approach some of his customers I'd like to work for and offer them my services. After all, I have got more insight into their needs than other photographers since I happened to do these exact jobs for them myself several times. At the same time this feels like a shitty thing to do, like making profit out of somebodies death. What do you think about this? Is it okay to approach his customers? And if so, how would you do it to not come off as a bad person that they would never want to work with?"
9urvjd,3,2018-11-06,Please critique Statement of Intent for MPA program,Asheai,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/9urvjd/please_critique_statement_of_intent_for_mpa/,"When I was 8 years old, I determinedly wrote a letter to the Mayor of my hometown, XYZ. The letter was printed on dot matrix paper (it was the 90s after all) and it started with a short introduction of myself, my pets, and my brother. It concluded with this: “Well let’s over. I’ve told you all of that stuff. Now can you stop building too many new buildings because then soon all of the trees will be cut down and soon there will be a big city at least as soon as you cut down a tree at least grow another. The reason I wrote this letter is that trees give us oxygen and shade and are beautiful and nice views and coolness”. 

I am happy to say that as I have aged I have learned about the horrors of run-on sentences. However, one thing that hasn’t changed is my passion for politics and the environment. I have always had a strong sense of morality and justice, determining at an early age what I thought was right and going unswervingly towards it. This mindset may have been from growing up in a single-parent family where we often struggled for basic necessities such as food or rent. From the age of 12, when I began working as a babysitter and ever since then, I would occasionally contribute to our family groceries and living expenses. Growing up in a poor household taught me the unfairness of poverty and the struggle that many take to succeed in a world with barriers stacked against them. 

It was a natural progression, then, which led me to the University of XYZ, where I completed an honours degree in Political Science with International Relations. My focus during my undergrad was on international development and my honours thesis at the end was titled “Microcredit and the Empowerment of Women” where I examined the situation of women in primarily Latin America and how access to money to start their own businesses strengthened women’s rights. As always, my fascination with, and strong beliefs in, social justice, economic prosperity, and environmental issues formed my interests in the research that I undertook. 

After graduating from XYZ, I was pleased to be accepted into the Youth Internship Program with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). I was sent to Arequipa, Peru for 6 months where I worked with rural entrepreneurs and helped them write business plans, which they needed in order to access microloans and microgrants. Working directly with the most vulnerable populations solidified my desire to work towards making the world a fairer and more equal place. I wanted not just a career but a chance to make a positive difference.

When I returned to Canada, I worked and volunteered with a number of nonprofit organizations. Among them were the XYZ, YXZ, and the ZXY. For the last year, I have been working as a Project Planner for the XYZ. I find working with vulnerable populations to be a fulfilling and necessary job and I am looking for any ways that I can to be of service.

This leads me to my current goal: to obtain my Masters of Public Administration from the XYZ. Throughout my education and career, I have been focused on finding solutions to social problems such as poverty, lack of education, and women’s rights issues. I would like to continue my work in these fields at the governmental level, by researching and implementing solutions on a larger scale. My ultimate goal would be to work for the Federal or Provincial Government as a senior policy advisor. 

I particularly would love to achieve my MPA from the University of XYZ. XYZ has always been a university which I believe upholds strong values of justice. Also, after having experienced a ‘larger’ university at PASTXYZ, I have come to the realization that smaller, more intimate places of learning are my style. I thrive in an environment of like-minded individuals who are committed to social change and doing their part. I believe that the MPA at XYZ would provide me with the education, contacts, and reputation to succeed in my career.


EDIT: A question: If I have a large gap between my undergrad and my application to my masters, should I mention why? I address it vaguely in my letter by talking about the places I have worked since, but give no reason why I did not immediately go into my Masters.

9us9vz,0,2018-11-06,How do I go about getting a summer internship at AMD?,Quexth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9us9vz/how_do_i_go_about_getting_a_summer_internship_at/,"Hello everyone,

**TL;DR** I am a junior CS/Computer Engineering undergraduate student from an university at Turkey that generally ranks top 500 in the world. Last year I got digital design and computer organization courses and I became interested in the field. I am also a fan of AMD as a company and exciting things are happening there nowadays. In short, I would like to get a summer internship (preferably for a hardware related position but software is fine) next summer at a major semiconductor company with the preference order of AMD &gt; Arm &gt; everything else. Although I have relevant qualifications I currently have little to show for it portfolio-wise. So what I am asking is advice on how to improve my chances of landing an internship and how much time I have until I miss my window of opportunities. 

To give a more detailed information about my qualifications here is a list ordered by relevancy (not everything being related to the hardware field itself):

* I passed the Digital Design course with an A+ and learned about low level digital hardware such as CMOS gates, latches, registers and worked with FPGAs and SystemVerilog to implement some hardware. There was a relatively small project for this course, should I list it in my portfolio?

* Next semester I took the Computer Organization course where I learned MIPS Assembly and MIPS architecture along with some concepts such as caches, pipelining, ISAs, memory, virtual memory. Also I used FPGAs to implement a MIPS processor and we added new instructions to it.  Unfortunately this course did not have a project but I have the lab work for the courses I mentioned so far, if that would be useful.

* I am currently taking the Introduction to Computer Graphics course where we are working with OpenGL or based on student preference WebGL, in this course we have three small project type assignments with increasing complexities so I might be able to add the end results to my portfolio. Also I am taking the Programming Languages course where we are studying language design and getting started with compilers using Lex and Yacc. We are also creating our own programming languages in groups in this course. So at the end I would have created a programming language with its own semi-working compiler.

* Last summer I had an internship where I created an optimization algorithm for a defense industry project. Not exactly hardware related but this is the only work experience I have.

* I took the Basics of Digital Signal Processing course but although I got familiar with the concepts I can not say I am proficient in it.

* I am experienced with Java, MIPS Assembly; somewhat experienced with SystemVerilog, C, C++, JavaScript, Xilinx software for FPGAs, development for Arduino and using Linux; familiar with MATLAB, digital signal processing and [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/) (Hardware Construction Language).

* I took quite a bit of data structures and algorithms courses. I would like to think I am good at those subjects for an undergraduate.

* I am double majoring in mathematics for what it is worth. I have a 3.78/4.00 GPA at CS, which should hopefully improve more this year and 3.73/4.00 GPA at Math.

I have an opportunity to work in an undergraduate research* project with my Digital Design professor. It would require me to properly learn Chisel but I can do it. I also have enough free time to finish on a project or two in the following months and about a 5-week break in February. Next semester I can take the Computer Architecture course and I will take OS and Database courses. I am also interested in contributing to the Linux kernel.

Summarizing, I have some qualifications relevant to the field. I want to preferably get a hardware related internship but software related to hardware (drivers etc.) is also fine. Last year I applied to Arm but got rejected due to my inexperience. I think I need to build up a portfolio and I would like to get advice on the quantity, quality and scope of the projects I should put on my portfolio. Also, any other suggestion is welcome. I would be interested to hear about your experiences and gladly answer any question you might ask.

Thanks for reading. I will be off to bed soon and check out the replies tomorrow."

I'm a sophomore at Washington University in St Louis with a major in Creative Writing and a second major in Computer Science. I'm also the co-owner of a bike rental business here on campus called Bears Bikes with about 150 bikes. 

Up to this point, all of my professional experience (outside of Bears Bikes) has been related to my soft skills and/or Creative Writing. I interned at a digital design company, a social media marketing company, and then I had a digital creative marketing internship at NBCUniversal in Los Angeles last summer. 

Now this summer, I'm interested in getting an internship that strengthens my coding skills. I've only been in the computer science major for two semesters and don't feel that my coding skills are strong enough right now to get a full software engineer internship. However, I have learned Java and will be programming a lot next semester and would love to get a trainee programming internship that takes students who are still early in their majors such as [Google's STEP](https://careers.google.com/jobs?src=Online/LinkedIn/linkedin_us&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=jobposting&amp;utm_campaign=contract#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/summer-trainee-engineering-program-step-warsaw-financial-center-emilii-plater-53-4513340028&amp;) (which I already applied to). 

Down the road, once I've developed both my soft and hard skills equally, I'm interested in becoming a Program Manager at Google or another big tech company where I 'd manage a team of people and focus on the bigger picture but also need a technical understanding of the work we're doing. 

I'm curious to find out if there are other program's like Google's STEP. If so, what are they? What internships related to CS might be a good fit for me considering my background and my future goal of becoming a PM? And what internships would provide me with training in software engineering?  


Thanks so much!"

There is no harm in including a resume even if it has some of the same information as your online application. 

Maintaining a resume is an indicator of maturity and professionalism and provides admissions officers with a consolidated snapshot of your academic and extracurricular profile. I would steer clear of submitting anything less than a one-page resume, however, as the half-page resume goes against standard practice. 

For most high school students, I would expect a resume to include: an objective, high school academics (GPA, test scores, college coursework), a skills summary, paid work, unpaid work (research, summer programs, internships), extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and academic achievements &amp; honors/awards. 


Submitting a resume also gives you another opportunity to curate your image if you focus the objective, honors, ECs, and work experience on what you want to major in (ie if you want to go into a CS program, most of your resume should be centered on your CS ECs, subject tests scores, and skills, etc).

I've been wanting to discuss my displeasure about my compensation with my manager for a little more than a half a year now since my responsibilities have been starting to pile up, my accomplishments have been accumulating, and my skills have improved significantly since I got hired on. After pressure from recent events causing uncertainty in my life and long-time discussions with peers at my company I finally brought up the topic of compensation with my manager during a one on one. As I expected, I was told that he was aware of it and that I'd have to wait until my company's annual review period that happens early in the year.


I have a really good manager and can understand that there are some things out of their control but I can't help but feel like I'm undercompensated considering what I've done in the one and a half years into my first post-college employment. I'm also the only hourly employee I know of in the company; all of my peers that started after me and that are in similar positions are salaried. I don't feel like I have enough experience just yet to jump ship to another internal team in the company or even externally. 


Looking for advice and I imagine some advice I probably won't want to hear. A piece of advice I've previously been told by my manager and had it mirrored by my senior director is to document what my accomplishments have been for my annual review, which I've been keeping a rough list of.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I'm sorry if anything I say comes off as conceited or just as some stupid first world problem. There are loads of people out there with way worse issues, and I don't mean to make them seem less important.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 20 year old second year maths university student ( This is relevant ). And right now I guess I know I want to go into some financial job that pays well. But recently in life I just feel like I'm incapable of actually achieving any of my goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to study more things outside of my modules, somewhat more relevant to the jobs I'd end up getting, but also just to diversify myself and Improve my knowledge. I genuinely value self-improvement in every sense.

But I'm genuinely not good enough, I can't study long enough to achieve what I want (Which is beyond the highest grade, some would probably say it's pointless, and they're arguably right). I can't stick to being efficient, delegating my time properly. Keeping to a strict diet whilst go gym. Basically, I can't commit to anything, I hold myself back from doing what I know I'm capable of doing and it sucks. I'm genuinely not sure how to change this.

I have so much planned too, internships to apply for, volunteering and charity work, changing jobs to diversify my CV and for something that's more convenient, arranging events for the society I'm apart of. Socialising with people and trying to actually enjoy life. Spending some time playing the 150 games I bought and basically never touched.

So yeah, that's one part of my life, not exactly sure how to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2 of this mess.**

&amp;#x200B;

Socialising, I did just say I enjoy it, but it's such a surface level thing. I have quite a few 'friends' (I don't mean to sound like I'm some popular cool dude or anything, I'm not. I'm a fat little kid), a lot of them are really nice people but it's impossible for me to say I'm genuinely myself around 90% of them, I'm acting most of the time. My two closest friends moved away due to university and I never get to see them.

I just feel like there's no one I can genuinely be myself around. I try and meet so many new people in order to find someone I can be like that with. I'd be happy if it was just one person, but it's no one. Usually it would be a girlfriend but I've been single for 2-3 years and it doesn't really seem to be changing anytime soon. I have no one to vent to, or to help keep me on the right track when my morale is low. And to be honest it just sucks, I genuinely just want some proper friends and I don't know what to do. I literally have conversations where I ask questions I know the answer to, pretend to act interested when it's something really superficial. Idk.

I've been fortunate enough to receive these two offers for a SWE internship next summer. In terms of pay, Amex pays the most, but I don't care about pay as of this moment. 

My goal is to eventually work at a Big-N company as does almost everyone in this sub lol (or at least it seems that way). 

American Express appears to be mass hiring interns at some schools I know. The interview I got through the career fair for Amex was too easy, had a basic coding question and was mostly behavioral. In fact, you didn't even have to answer the coding question correctly or have any prior internship experience to get an offer. I've heard that Amex is restructuring their program, leading to this happening. The internship program seems better than Cisco's as Amex seems to have four different teams you could go on(mobile, web, sec, data science/ML) so it seems like they are actually trying to appeal to others. However, there's no guarantee I would get the team I want even though I'm web dev oriented.

Cisco, on the other hand, is a technology company so it would look better. But the one interviewer I talked to said the program was just that an engineer would copy a branch from a repository, give it to an intern, have them work on it and give it back for an engineer to possibly improve and ship (the guy who told me wasn't my scheduled interviewer so I'm not sure if he's in touch with the program). But I would for sure do development work.   

What do you guys think? I would love to hear anyone's opinion especially if you've interned/worked at these companies. "

I'm currently a CS student looking for an internship and I have a predicament. I've been offered 2 internships and I'm struggling to decide which route is the best for me.

The first is an internship as a back-end developer for a company that is not in the technology industry. The second is a front-end developer role at start up that is in the tech space responsible for creating applications for other large companies. I prefer a start up environment because of the fast-faced environment and the ability (at least to my knowledge) to learn a lot more. However, I can't see myself doing front-end development as a career and I think I would like to do back-end or full stack more, but I don't think I would learn nearly as much at a larger company. By no means are both companies using outdated technologies.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone has been in this situation or has experience in companies like this and would like to share their thoughts and potentially my mindset about companies like this. It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

9uwdir,2,2018-11-06,Career track for developer,2048b,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9uwdir/career_track_for_developer/,"I am a mid-career information technology graduate with 7 years of experience currently at a loss as how to stay still or move on in my career. During my teenage years, I became interested in programming and decided to take an information technology program in university.

As with most fresh IT graduates, I started with a software engineer job with a systems integrator that was open to taking in fresh graduates. Initially, it was interesting as a fresh graduate taking the first step as a tech professional learning how an IT project progresses (with or without proper management). Management was not professional, and many a times, clients slip in additional requirements or changes midway, forcing a project redesign and budget overrun. It was more like fire fighting day-to-day and adjusting along the way without a clear plan. There was no proper training plan or program to ensure that engineers were equipped with the skills to move seamlessly to the next level. After 3 years, when it became clear to me that the only way was a management track as a project manager (without the proper training and skills) stumbling and learning along the way, I left.

My second gig was with a small business in the private sector, a small independent video game studio. The team was small, about 15 developers with 3 team leads (each team lead oversaw 5 entry level developers) and a tech lead. Crunch time was crazy, with constant overtime and nighttime deployment and support. People worked through weekends too as the customers demanded 24x7 support and system recovery. After 2 years, I left.

My third job was with a systems integrator mostly doing government projects. Working condition was not that bad, mostly office hours and little overtime. However, it was a brownfield project with a code base and build process that were in a mess left behind by other engineers who have quit. To add to the problem, the newly promoted project manager was either inexperienced or irresponsible, with many last minute requests for change, or for user demos. The team was sometimes given 1 or 2 hours to prepare for a user demo because the client suddenly called on that day and wanted to drop by to take a look, and the whole team had to drop whatever they were doing or rolled back code changes they were typing halfway. By this time, I started wondering about whether there are other job roles for IT graduates, apart from software development.

My fourth job saw me trying out an entry level cyber-security analyst role in the public sector. I applied for and was hired as a cyber-security analyst, which I presumed to be a technical role of analyzing log data in a security operations center. However, as with many public sector jobs, it turned out that my time was mostly spent on:

* Entertaining and doing professional networking with enthusiastic vendors pushing their products with small talks
* Doing administrative work like applying for entry clearance, form filling, searching for free meeting rooms
* Minutes taking for meetings
* Arranging meetings for bosses
* Helping out with cyber-security events and exhibitions
* Escorting contractors doing building repair works in my office (because of security access)
* Supervising interns, organizing welfare events for them, and processing their paperwork when they join and leave
* Brainstorming for ideas to present to visitors and management

Plus the environment was kind of toxic with a demanding manager and backstabbing colleagues who were interested in getting into the boss' good books but never getting their work done. That lasted a year.

Now I am back to square one, after 7 years of tech experience and still not knowing which direction I can or should go as a mid career (and soon to be outdated) tech professional with a couple of job change.

I am an introvert who simply wants to mind his own business, do his work, avoid the politics that people trying to scale the corporate ladder love to play. However, I would like to clarify that this does not mean avoiding human contact completely, and I am open to working in a team and with well meaning colleagues who are sincere about getting things done together, and not about pushing work to others.

I have a few questions.

1. What kind of senior roles or jobs do many mid career introverted IT professionals with a software development background eventually end up in the long term that they find comfortable and enjoyable?
2. What kind of sectors or organizations (big MNC, small businesses) can we typically find these jobs?

I welcome any helpful inputs and comments you may have. Thank you."

Despite that, I still did a lot of self-taught programming on the side, so by the time I graduated I had a few personal projects under my belt and developed several marketable skills that made me valuable as an entry level candidate. I even developed a personal website to display some projects. But other than that, by the time I graduated I didn't have a great GPA and no internship experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first job offer I got was during a job fair, where I had an on the spot interview, and an on the spot offer immediately after. However this offer was contingent on my GPA being much higher. After sending them my unofficial transcript which already had that GPA, I was sent an official job offer. I thought I was safe, but in August it was rescinded because when I sent them my final transcript they told me that they would not be able to take me on as a developer with my GPA. So here I was, no job, low GPA, and no applications. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I rewrote my resume from scratch since I knew my old one wasn't going to cut it, then I started applying like crazy. I spent the next couple weeks applying for jobs, doing code challenges, combing this reddit page, and studying up on my algorithms. 3-4 weeks and almost 300 applications later, the only phone call I got was from Revature (so not really an offer). I was dismal, but I decided to post my redacted resume on this reddit page. **Thanks to the great advice I received from everyone here I had great resume.** (I'll link to the post at the bottom) 

&amp;#x200B;

My resume was looking completely different from what I originally had. I started reapplying immediately after I felt comfortable with my new resume, even to companies I had already applied to. I also re-did my website to look more visually appealing. I made the decision to try to apply to 100 jobs a day, and then repost my resume to be reviewed after every 300 jobs, but I didn't even get to 200 before I started getting calls. Two weeks after I started re-applying I had 3 full-time offers:

1- 65k, full benefits, and .5% equity. (start-up)

2- 80k, full benefits, equity to be assessed based on performance, unlimited paid time off.(start-up)

3- 60k, only healthcare benefits. (Big corporation)

I ended up taking the 2nd option and a month later I'm really enjoying my job. So I guess in the end what really made a difference was my determination and relentlessness, constantly reassessing my process, and most importantly never stopping. Thanks for taking the time to read and I hope others are able to learn from what I went through.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** After several hundred unsuccessful applications, I reassessed my process, and got my resume reviewed on this sub reddit and reapplied. In the end I got three offers a few weeks later.

9v0ilz,2,2018-11-07,Will employers care about a W on my transcript?,curmudgeono,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9v0ilz/will_employers_care_about_a_w_on_my_transcript/,"**I just withdrew from my CSO class, getting a 'W' on my transcript.**

I'm a junior undergrad and this semester I took on way too much work - I'm taking three CS courses, a gen-ed, and working between 10 and 20 hours a week at my internship. I also am doing visual effects &amp; animation for a movie, a passion of mine that probably takes 10 hours a week. (actually involves a lot of coding!) Anyway, my computer systems organization midterm exam really snuck up on me - I thought the class homework was really easy, so I didn't worry much going into the midterm, and boy was that a mistake. I failed, and got an overall midterm grade of an F. I've never done so badly &amp; I went into complete shock. I received the grade hours before the deadline to withdraw, and made the decision to withdraw. Now I have a SECOND W on my transcript. (the first happened during a data structures summer course 2 years ago because of a serious illness, not really much I could do there) 

**(the next two paragraphs are details you can probably skip)**

I now have 2 W's on my transcript. Besides that I have a 3.5 GPA at a near top tier CS school (not quite ivy league) I've worked really hard for my grades, and I feel like I just really blew it by taking this W grade, maybe I should have just tried very hard and gone for a C/B-? It's a foundational one in C &amp; assembly language etc so I'm worried employers may really care, and worry about my ability to follow through. Out of all my courses this semester, THIS was the most important, so I'm really down on myself right now

My plan going forward is to ace my other classes (looks good so far) and to put my newfound extra time into my internship and this movie. Next semester I think I will have to really step back my work in both of these areas, and just focus on school, as I don't have much time left before my GPA is finalized. I would really like to pull off a 3.6 by the time I graduate, and I know I have it in me.

**(More important paragraph below)**

Does anyone have any experience recovering from a W on their transcript? Or has anyone had experience with how employers look at Ws? Maybe you're an employer yourself? Anyway, I'm feeling really demotivated and just want a realistic picture of what this means for me - especially as it is my second.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Got a W. (my second to date) How bad is this?  How should I explain this to potential employers?**

9v0pcw,184,2018-11-07,...,disasteronly,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9v0pcw/_/,"Dear myself and whoever stumbles upon this message,

When I chose UW, I never thought that I would be writing this post, but I can't find anyone to speak to anymore.

UW has taught me a bit too much and made me grow as a person a bit too quickly.

I have learned how it never works when someone tells you, ""I'm here for you"", ""I'm listening to you"", or ""You are not worthless"", because after they pat your back or console you with their kind words, reality hits you and you are still this failing student and job-seeker who has just cried a bit more than usual.

There are of course some glimmers of false hope from time to time, like that test mark that is a bit better or these friends who seem to share your hobbies.

You will smile to yourself stupidly until you are crushed by an exam that weighs much more or until you fail all your interviews. Then, you realize that you have no friend.

But you can't blame them, because, in the end, you *are* below average. You are this worthless, ""bad egg"" that above average students frown upon and try to avoid.

And, let's be realistic, there is no way you can ever reach their standards, at least not during these years, but they are all that count, right?

These are the years where you earn grades that will define you for your whole academic career and where you build a resume that is stuck with you for your entire career.

If you have better internships, you will get even better ones, and, if you have less good ones or don't get one, well, you are in ""deep shit"", as they would say.

It's the same with grades. Any post-undergraduate educational institutions or any big companies will take a look at them, see the courses you failed or that you nearly failed, frown, and throw your resume away.

But no matter how many consecutive all-nighters and skipped meals you pull to be just a little better, just a little closer to the average standard, it's futile.

UW has taught me how useless it is to attend classes and tutorials, to finish all the exercises you could find for your courses and to ask questions and receive great answers whenever you don't understand.

Because there's just too much and it's too late. From the frowns of some TAs, teachers, and peers, I know that I should have known all this way before. I should have been better at the start of this all. Now, it's just too late.

Too late.

UW has taught me what the real world is like. It doesn't matter if you were the top or close to the top at your high school and thought you loved school. It doesn't matter if you did well in your hometown. Because you are part of the large universe and the whole universe, not just the people from your school or your little city, will judge you.

And trust me, they don't care if you didn't know how big the world is and how many people are much better than you outside of your tiny little social circle.

UW has taught me how I am just myself and, no matter how much I try to improve this self, I am stuck with it and probably will for a long time, because it's just too late.

UW has taught me to never have dreams or expectations.

UW has taught me how to know if I will fail an exam the moment I start it, if I will mess up an interview the moment I walk in the room or if I will ruin a school term right after the first examination.

It has taught that I still need to drag myself through the term, that even if there's only a dead end or dead ends in front of me, I still need to go on.

But what happens when I reach the dead end? What is the point to continue on when you know there are only dead ends?

UW has taught me how windows are not high enough, how trucks are not fast enough or how truck drivers are not careless enough and how I miss a bathtub that I can fill with water.

UW has made me grow old and tired much too quickly.

I just want to sleep for a long time and, just before, I want to apologize to my parents who wasted so much time and money on me."
9v0yka,1,2018-11-07,First job after college,FeelingClue,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9v0yka/first_job_after_college/,"Hi, 
This is my first time using Reddit- but I thought it might be helpful.  I graduated from undergraduate in 2017 in public health and earned my masters this May.  While earning my masters degree, I was fortunate to have great internships and learned so much, so I felt ready for a full-time job.  After graduation in May, I was lucky to get a job offer in mid-June.  I thought it was too good to be true- and the commute was only going to be about 20 minutes which is great.  The pay was a little more than I anticipated my first job being, so that was great; and PTO/benefits were also very appealing.  When I went in for my two interviews I thought the company culture was great (and they kept saying over and over again how amazing the company culture was) but come to find out it's 20 people who sit in an office and don't speak.  I will say I don't have a toxic work environment and the people I work with are all nice people - but after five months into this job I find myself dreading coming to work and bored out of my mind for 8 hours a day.  I knew after going to college for 5 years the real world 40 -hour work week was going to be an adjustment, but I was ready for the challenge (and to actually start making money).  At my internships everyone was friendly with one another and chit chatted throughout the course of the workday, but here it is SILENT we all say hi and we all say bye to one another and that is it for 8 hours a day.  I was never looking for best friends at work, but friendly small talk would make the day go by faster.  I'm a social person, so listening to music eight hours a day gets old quick.  I will also add, I knew my first job out of college wasn't going to be my dream job- but I hoped I would be challenged and learn new skills- but that is not the case.  I sit at my computer hoping someone will give me work, and that might happen twice a week; I ask if I can help with anything and I get the response ""I'll let you know...maybe"" ... I didn't work my but off in college to sit on a computer to read articles and pretend to make myself look busy five days a week.  I try to not complain because I know it's hard to find a job right out of college, and I know I'm lucky but I hate feeling miserable- feeling down and sorry for myself isn't who I am at all.  The job search isn't fun and I hoped once I got this job I would stay there for 1-2 years at least.  From applying to internships to a full-time job, I was happy to take a break from the job search process.  With all this being said; is it bad to start looking for a full-time job so soon after starting?  I would wait for the holidays and the new year to pass but I would start sometime in January.. bringing me to about 7 months at my job.  I can't sit in silence much longer 40-hours a week and I don't see me growing at all in my position or in the company... should I wait a year?  Or start looking?  I want a good reference and I wouldn't quit until I had another job, but I feel stuck.
Any insight would be great!  thanks

There is another relatively new worker and she’s blending with them well, but she’s also in her 50s. There are only 2 others in the entire office under the age of 30, and even then they’re both married and/or have children.

I like to think of myself as being pretty personable, and I have had internships and jobs with people of different ages before, but I can’t connect to anyone here it seems. Has anyone else dealt with this before and eventually gotten “in” with the others? The job itself is fine but I can’t see myself being somewhere long term where I can’t really relate with or get along well with my team. "

Am I wrong to think that I'll have a lot more chances as I get closer to graduation?  So many jobs are looking for an immediate fill, so my logic is that I can start applying to hundreds more junior/entry level postings once I'm within a few months of graduating.  Rather than just applying to the tiny # of postings right now specifically asking for 2019 college graduates.

\-------------------------------

**(((** P.S.  I ask because I have a disability that makes travel difficult, and am busy/stressed studying for classes &amp; interviews.  I don't know if I should try for *any* potentially *incrementally* better offer, or only apply to preferred locations from now on.

I have an onsite invite that would take up 3 days: 8 hour each way travel (+5 hour flight itinerary) for an all-day event.  I'm really stressed trying to decide whether to go.  Their potential offer would only be modestly better than my current offer, and still far less preferred than getting a job in either CA or Chicago. But a better job is a better job, you know?

I'm a so-so quality candidate (no internships) with 3 onsite invites so far.  A dream job to me would be a developer position at any not-awful company that paid at least 60k in either CA or Chicago.  I don't know if my odds are high or not.  My current offer is 70k in STL which had an easy/moderate interview difficulty.  If I didn't find my 'dream job', I'd be okay with starting at my current offer and trying to move for a 'dream job' after getting some experience. **)))**"
9v28i5,3,2018-11-07,I'm a new freshman/CS Major at a community college after 10 years of no school and no coding background and I need some advice.,rageandred,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9v28i5/im_a_new_freshmancs_major_at_a_community_college/,"So I am currently a freshman at a community college in a small town and this is my first semester back to school in 10 years (I am 27). I am a CS Major, with a passion for graphic design and a little experience in web design (I haven't done anything more complicated that some simple PHP forms). I feel like I would be good at coding, I have an attention to detail, I analyze things, I'm good at math and problem solving and have always had an eye for design (I was a graphic designer at a t-shirt company before going to school full time), so Full-Stack web development is my endgame. I have scoured this sub Reddit as well as /r/cscareerquestions and am a little concerned about a few things. 

1. I know some HTML and CSS, but other than that I have no coding background. Would it be smart to start teaching myself to code now in my free time? Start making websites asap? 

2. From most of the posts I see, it seems as if everyone else is spending all four years at universities, taking CS courses freshman year and getting internships freshman/sophomore year. I am planning on spending 2 years at this community college and then transferring. There are absolutely no internship opportunities in this city, and the closest are about an hour and a half away (I would have to move there for the summer). Is this going to screw me? Did I make a mistake by going to a community college first? I'm terrified that I won't be able to find a job after because I won't be able to compete with that. 

3. I do great in group work, get good peer reviews, can socialize when needed, but honestly I don't have any close friends and I don't really care to. Everything I've seen says that CS is a very social field. I don't have the best social skills and can't network for crap. Also, its seems more difficult to network when everyone is almost 10 years younger than you, and it makes me feel a little weird. I guess I can fake it if I have to, but will this hinder my chances of doing well in this career? How can I improve this?

I sincerely appreciate any advice anyone can give me, as I am freaking out, lol. After going through a few subreddits, the job hunt after graduating looks completely daunting and I want to make sure I'm as prepared as possible. "

I graduated university with a bachelor's degree in 2015, and immediately after this I got an internship at one of the big consulting companies. They liked my work so much that they quickly offered me a permanent position and altogether I stayed there for 2 years (summer 2017). In the spring of 2017 I was getting offers from recruiters on LinkedIN literally every second day. One of them was a message from a recruiter in a big tech company where I work now (important info - I relocated to another country for this job). I like the job and I hear I'm good at it (hopefully) but I don't like living where I live now and since there is no prospects of moving to the States I wanna move back home. This is a company that all of you know and probably use their services every day so I was really expecting them in my CV/Resume to be a door opener.

Now I want to move back to my home country and unfortunately so far I'm getting rejected all the time. I apply for jobs in various sectors, from consulting (though not in the company I worked previously), to consumer-oriented companies (like Uber), to more IT-oriented companies (B2B and B2C), I think I fit the requirements either very well or rather well, but really to no effect.

What may I be doing wrong? I started to think the company I'm working for now is a liability, as recruiters may maybe think I will be expecting too much money (note: I come from Eastern Europe, moved to the West so my pay currently is indeed significantly higher). Or maybe it's the fact I did not finish my masters? But then why would that not be a problem two years ago?

And if you were in my position, what would you do? My background: bachelor's in statistics, data analytics consultant in Big4, working in operations in a big tech brand now."

I'm graduating soon, and am not particularly fond of any of the opportunities I have found thus far. I love the idea of working on my own software product, even if just for the experience. Can you reasonably expect to be successful working independently on a software product in 2018? Or is this only possible nowadays in larger teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeking some advice here. I'm a CS student, graduating with my Bachelor's in the Spring. I've started seeking opportunities in the field, like entry level jobs or internships. The issue I'm having is that the few opportunities I have been contacted about are not very attractive. I was offered an unpaid internship that would require me to commute upwards of an hour and pay for parking, with a not so impressive company. I was also contacted about opportunities as an entry level role, but they would pay you only minimum wage for the first 4 months while you were ""trained"" and then $20-$25 per hour after - also with a company that wasn't so enticing.

I don't mean to seem conceited, I know I am inexperienced, but none of the opportunities I have found thus far are very attractive. The thing that makes these decisions even harder, is that I currently work a job that pays roughly as well as the previously mentioned opportunity, and I'm with a company that I love to work for.  If I didn't have this, I expect I'd job at the first opportunity to present itself.

I understand the reason I haven't found many better options is likely that I have no working experience, and I also am not yet graduated. However it's gotten me thinking.

I have always liked the idea of being self-employed, but is this really possible in the Software Industry in 2018?

In a perfect world, when I graduate I would continue working the job I have now (its not a CS job), and do software development on the side until A) I found enough success to pursue solely software, or B) I felt experienced enough to get a CS job I am passionate about.

The trouble is that the field is so competitive and complex that working independently on a software product seems impossible. For example, can a single person make an app that earns enough for them to support themselves in 2018? Obviously with no expectations of being the next YouTube or Facebook. So many other software companies seem to be surrounded by Venture Capitalists and large teams. Can I publish an app/site alone?

&amp;#x200B;

Country: México

Medical Service: Social Security known as ""Seguro Popular""

Diagnosis: Cronic Depression (And more issues like Anxiety, Eating Disorders, Alcoholism, ADHD, Borderline Disorder and so on...I was just getting started with my diagnosis).

&amp;#x200B;

I just moved, and I'm ""getting"" new medical services in here. The doctors did´t got any of my old files and made new ones (after a small interview). And after some ""not so professional moves"" I'm heading to a rehab clinic instead of getting psychiatric attention and therapy, as I requested (because, that was the things I was doing before moving and the thing it was working for me).

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so here's the story:

I´m a 23 year old woman (?) who's have been through a lot. And, I have been seeking some medical help for many years, I tried at first some psychologist from my old school. Then I went to some very expensive services by the private sector in Mexico, that obviously I coudnt afford. 

So, about a year ago I ended up on the social medical services named ""Seguro Popular"", its a wide program that offers some general services to the citizens on México (its free), and it changes depending of the city, and the necessities of everyone. I used to live in Querétaro, and after a while I was just starting to get some real help: I went through many studies, tests, therapy, etc.

After a while, I had my first confirmed diagnosis: Cronic Depression, and a whole bunch of mental issues that we where spotting, result of that (ADHD, Borderline Disorder, Anxiety, a lot of eating disorders, and some potetial inclination to addictions (alcoholism overall), and various forms of self-harm),

 

But, when I was just starting to go deeper in therapy and adjusting with my meds. I had to move. And start over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I live now, they offer the same medical services. But in here they have different protocols. And I didn't mind. Actually I was very excited (?) ´cuz I've heard that in here theres a lot of more and better Mental Health services. 

But the first red flag I spotted, was that the new doctors woudn´t be able to reach to my files: All those therapies, and advances, and all my profile lost in the wind. Even worse, when the first doctor (a general doc, not an mental or psychiatric) was making my profile just interview me for 15 min. And I really tried to bring up almost everything I could about my diagnosis and everything. But no one can just do a year of profiling in just 15 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the doc said that she was going to refer me to the mental hospital. And actually that is my goal, this hospital has a really good reputation in my whole country. I thought that I was going to finally get the medical attention I need, even if I may be interned for a while (or not, idk)....I felt relieved. The secretary of that doc, said that she would call me to confirm my appointment in the new hospital (to get an introduction, and finally have someone who can make me a proper profile, and make some more appointments with the proper types of therapists, etc). But, she didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the second red flag was the week she didn't reach me. And the second week where I tried to reach this assistant (cuz apparently she was the only one who was available to make my appointment), and by the third week after a lot of pressure I finally got my appointment...

...But oh no...It´s not the one I thought ...

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of having an appointment in a Psychiatric Hospital, tomorrow I have to present myself into a Rehab Clinic. I guess, the doctor, or one of the secretaries thought that was a good idea sending me there ´cuz in my brief interview I mentioned that I did Coke (twice in my whole life), or my deal with alcohol. But I see those things like a symptom of my metal issues....

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, tomorrow I´ll go. But, I'm really more concerned about my depression episodes, where I self harm, or my incapability to deal with the anxiety in a normal situation than my alcoholism. Like, I really fear, of going to a rehab center where I´ll feel more guilty about everything and crash with all the things I'm dealing now.

I just want to get back to therapy and get the proper treatment, that eventually (I trust) it will help me with the alcohol/drug use.

&amp;#x200B;

And you may say: ""Well, why don't you go directly to the hospital?"" But its actually harder in here. You see: You cannot be treated at the hospital without been referred from another doctor. So my options are:

\-Try to get it from the same doc that sent me to rehab (´cuz in the social security system I'm in, I can only be treated by the doctors from that very specific clinic. And its a reaaaally small one).

\-Go to the private sector. But, in my experience, they conveniently recommend you to stay in the private sector.

\-Hope that in the rehab clinic a psychiatrist refers me to the mental hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Im actually afraid, of they trying to intern me for the wrong reasons in the wrong place.

And that's it.

I know, its a very specific theme, and not many in here knows how any of Mexico works. But, I just had to try it. The internet is really big, and maybe I´ll find someone who's in Mexico too and has some recommendations about Mental Healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you reach here, I'm reaaaaallly sorry about my English. And thank you for your time."

Fall 2018 Referenda

The following question will be posed to voters during this by-election:
""Do you support the use of electronic voting in the elections of the Concordia Student Union?""

I hope you all know how important this is. So many councillors and students have been saying that Concordia desperately needs this. We are one of the few universities that still does paper voting. I could ramble on about how this is a waste of paper and bad for the environment (especially since the CSU cares so much about the environment). But that's not the point. Electronic voting is important because it has the potential to reach more people. People say they don't have time or they don't plan on going to vote or they never see it when on campus. Or some just can't because they're working/on internship. If it's plastered all over your My Concordia page, you'll be less likely to avoid it and those who can't make it can still vote. Concordia has painfully low voter turnout to every election/by-election. This leads to misrepresentation in the CSU and makes it more of a popularity contest. These people get our money. We need to make sure that they are elected properly. I think that online voting would one of the best things that could be done right now to raise voter turnout. 

So, get yourself down to a polling station on the 27, 28 or 29 and vote. Vote so that this will be one of the last times you do so on paper at Concordia. Vote to bring this student union into the 21st century. Vote FOR electronic voting. Maybe next time we'll get our online opt outs too."

Not sure if I should give it another shot. Want to have some reviews on my profile first!

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review my profile!

**Information**

* Race / Nationality: Asian Female. Taiwanese. 25 (right now)
* GMAT: 650 (28V 50Q 8IR) this is my second attempt, my first one was 620 (27V 50Q 8IR). Perhaps I will retake again (but not anytime soon, I am burned out)

**Work experience**

* Currently work in a company that me and my sister started about a year ago. We imported products from around the world into Taiwan. My work is mostly about the distribution network in Taiwan, marketing and public relations.
* Started an E-commerce site (it was more like a soft trial for the current business), which I sold after the current business was established (not sure whether to include this or not)
* Disaster Response Team for a top 10 NGO in the USA from Louisiana to Texas (hurricane harvey) for 2 months.
* Course &amp; Volunteer instructor for a NGO in Cambodia for 2 months. Teaching disadvantaged kids English, visiting their families, recruiting students (to convince parents to send kids to our school instead of working) are all my work. I was also responsible for after-work workshop to exchange ideas on teaching skills and improving relationship with kids.
* Team member in a social project to help kids and their families from rural area for 8 months. Raised over $8k for the kids. At the mean time, we also helped their families, mostly farmers, to market the their produces better, ranging from redesign the package to process the product into something else for better profitability.
* Team member for a NGO in Thailand for 2 months. Work is mostly basic construction (water supply network) and rebuild the community for the minority. During the free time, we usually do some project to help out the organization.
* Cryptocurrency and stock investment for 2 years now.
* Started my first company with my sister. The idea is similar as the current one. It was successful, but we had to shut it down because of supply problems. Opened for about 1 year.
* Team member for a NGO in Italy for 3 months. Work is mostly projects around the community and fundraising. The most successful event in the group was the one that my friends and I hosted. We raised over $3k in one night.
* Internship at an international trading company for 3 months. Had the opportunity to work closely with custom and people from around the world. (unsure whether I should put this one or not)

**Extra Curricular**

* Various instrument, especially piano. Been playing since I was 5. Passed the exam which is equivalent to a piano teacher. I also played trumpet and harp.
* Solo backpacking. Currently been to 26 countries with the money I saved from bartending and the investment.
* Visual Design. I enjoy graphic design and photography. I have redesigned websites for a few business.
* Community and volunteer work. Sorting recycles, mentoring kids kinds of stuff.

**Education**

* Undergrad GPA: 2.98 from the top university in Taiwan with a major in Business Administration. My GPA tanked to 1.1 during sophomore year because of some health issues. It went back up to 4.0 during my senior year. Overall, I ended up with 2.98.
* I also had a 2-year gap during university. The health problem I had made me decide to take a break. I moved to Australia for working holiday, made some money and traveled.
* Team leader for AIESEC for 1 year.

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
My longterm goal is to achieve a senior managerial/executive position in an established charity or NGO that focus on human rights and women’s rights. The more I worked with NGO, the more I realized that the impact is on such a small scale, as important as it was for certain people. I realized that if I want to have a bigger impact, I need to be in the decision group that creates the vision and forms the policy. And I think a MBA will fit perfectly in my profile and lead me to my ultimate goal.

Also, I would like to develop more management and analytical skill to further expand my current business. (I am not sure if I should include this because I have seen so many people said that entrepreneurship is not a realistic goal)

And of course, networking and the opportunity to study and live abroad.

* Target School:I first set my target for top 20 because my GMAT prep score has been consistently around 720. Particularly Johnson, Notre Dame and Georgetown. Of course I wish to attend an even better school. But, due to my GPA... :( 

**Questions**

* Are my target school realistic with my current GMAT score? If no, according to my current score, what schools would you suggest?
* Is my profile good? Are there some other weakness or strengths that I am not seeing? How can I optimize my profile?
* Should I include in the goal that my father and I are thinking of reorganization and rebrand of his company after the MBA? (It’s just a small company with about 11 staff, but that’s not a major goal of mine)
* How do I avoid come out as a rich girl who’s just traveling around? I have shared my experience with other people and most of them told me that I am lucky that my dad is rich. But, other than the exchange program to Japan in high school, I paid for most of my travels.
* What to do with recommendation letter? As you can see, most of my work are short or by myself. Should I ask professors in college for one?
* Will I make it this year? Or should I just chill and apply next year? (I only have GMAT score now….)
* Is it okay to include both goals of MBA (NGO and my business)? Or does it make me seem like I can’t decide on one?
* Although not officially promoted, but 3 out of 4 volunteer works I became the leader in the group, assigning duties, allocating resources and conducting meetings. Should I address this? If so, what's the best way?

Sorry for the messiness of this post, I just got my GMAT score, which is my first step to my MBA and everything is just super unorganized.

I decided to go back to school and choose CS. Now, at 30 years old, I'm a year from graduating.

On Monday, after over a month of interviews, I started my first internship at a relatively small company. My first day I did some HR paperwork, shadowed another employee while he worked on some stuff, and did about 45 minutes worth of training with an employee not in my team. I was there for about 3 hours total.

Yesterday was my second day and I came in to a post it note on my monitor that said ""Middle Aged Teen!"". I'm only going to be at this internship for about two and a half months and I don't really want to rock the boat by bringing it up but it really surprised me.

I'm just curious if this is the kind of stuff I can expect as I move into an entry level job later.


Edit- Thank you all for the information and advice. I'm glad to hear that this isn't the norm and that it probably isn't malicious. I will be keeping the post it and documenting what happened just in case but will otherwise let it go and see how things progress."

It was fun, interesting, the team was really appreciative and supportive and I was given a relatively important role. 
I've since leveraged the skills I got to land tutoring roles (Data science) at my uni, and this summer I am attracting more interest on internship applications than I am used to, and people are really liking me.
So far I've interviewed at the ABS, (Aus Bureau of Stats) (was weird... not so sure about it), for junior full stack dev role, though touching mainly on backend skills that are relatively mature (With opportunity to develop front end) (This has so far gone well and I'm excited by it) and I've been contacted by the same team from my uni's infomatics hub that I worked with last summer about working on a bigger, better, more complex, higher pressure and ***well paid*** job (37aud ph base, potential casual loading (to 46 or st) on top of FT hours, versus an approx'd 25-30 from the start up, told I'd be on the ""upper end"" because of the strength of my app. 

I shouldn't be hearing an offer from the startup until today, when the work day begins. 

The startup is an AI driven /NLP (somewhat) based proof reading service with a user base of 650k and growing and it's actually really appealing, and the kinds of work they'd have me on would put me in close contact witg the CEO and the team of 5, in the CBD in a communal startup space, with decent opportunity to network outsife of the company. 

I don't want to stuff my old team around, and I liked working with them a lot, and tbh both roles sound great.
The new project sounds cool but the biggest difference is that I'll be using R instead of python which is cool but idk. 

I did read the FAQ for this sub and yeah... I know that I'm moving forward regardless but I'm afraid of pigeonholing myself, particularly as an Electrical Eng undergrad. 

It's particularly hard to say no to a team who makes it clear that they really value my input, and I'd %100 want to work with them again, especially since I know that I should be able to get stuff done and produce what I need to, and probably do a better job than last time. 

I'd be overselling myself if I could give this new team the same degree of trust. 

Honestly I feel like a d*ckhead for viewing what can only be a good thing but I'm struggling with this decision and I keep getting degrees of concrete vs wishy washy advice and some from people specific to compsci might help"

I worked a vacation 40h job for several weeks and it exposed me to the real world and it was really soul sucking and it made me feel worthless. 
When I would timestamp, I could see through the employees depressed faces that they don't like their jobs and that they really don't want to be there. Most of them even have an undergrad degree. 

I know that I can do much more than just pack up 1000x little electronic parts. And even count every. single. one of them. 

I do sometimes realized while I was working that I basically just traded in my time for money and that I could spend all the time working for someone else, working for myself that eventually benefit me later. I felt really empty in my soul and my whole body felt like it's just a robot. I felt so useless to the point I was questioning if I even belong on this planet. 

I did a bunch of internships before and never have I ever enjoyed any of those. I am pretty optimistic, believe it or not. However, does every job has to be so depressing? Honestly it really affected my personal life and the so called ""work- life balance"" wouldn't help me either because I can't balance my life if my job is so soul sucking. I'm very glad I'm back to school. 

I do for the part enjoy school but I just feel like going to University will get you also a soulless job.
I'm probably saying that because I'm not sure of what to study. Although I know since I like English so much that I want to study abroad since the university student life to me seems like a nostalgic time I'd like to experience. But I don't even know if  I'm made for University. 

There's a big city near my town which is called ""the financial capital of Europe"", if that says something to you ;)

And everytime I go there it's a lot of people in suits and they too feel like they're working a depressing job even if it's in a skyscraper. That's what I meant earlier with Uni gets you a depressing job too. 
Might be because it's a big city, and like all big city's they have that stigma around it. You know working in a huge building, hustling, doing the rat race. 
I'm sure you can relate to this.

I got my paycheck yesterday in the mail and I saw the amount I was getting paid for (It wasn't just a little) but I don't care. They could pay me a million dollars and I wouldn't care. This is how much I hated the job and my mom laughed and couldn't even understand why I wasn't happy and I looked at her dead serious and I told her that this isn't funny and that she should stop laughing immediately. I'd rather not live than having to live this live forever. 

Now I have all this money. So what? Like what is this little peace of paper supposed to make me feel? Happy? I'm just lost.

Sometimes I see people while their working, for instance my teacher trying to explain me something and I just wonder : do they actually want to help me? or is it just that they have to? Do they even enjoy their job? Are they happy? It's probably because I mostly can't comprehend how they can work a job cause it wouldn't be something I would do but I ask myself this question daily, at any given point of the day. 

A lot of times not just in school I tend to not ask for help because I feel like everyone just hates their job and I want to leave them alone. 

I'm really scared that I'll become this boring adult who hates his job and I just don't know what to think. I just don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore. I would do anything literally anything to not have this life even if it means I shouldn't exist. Please help me"

9vc877,1,2018-11-08,Current job not providing experience needed. Seeking advice.,djnutfrost,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9vc877/current_job_not_providing_experience_needed/,"So my overall goal career wise is to be a marketing executive for a large technology firm. Right now I feel like my current job is ruining my chances of that ever happening and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background, I graduated from undergrad in December 2017 (started to apply for jobs in October 2018). Throughout college to pay for school while getting the most out of my education, I worked freelance for just over two years, helping small businesses or students starting their own businesses get their feet off the ground with Digital Marketing work. This helped me work the hours I needed around classes, provided income to graduate debt free (paired with summer jobs), got some experience in field, and they got some cheap services compared to an agency or full professional freelancer. All wins right? Well apparently, not for me.

I went into my career center at college about a year and a half out to seek some advice for finishing up school. We refined my resume and asked if I was missing anything. I was particularly curious if, my current work was good for experience vs an internship. She said it was a fine substitute and showed a lot of initiative, work ethic, and if I liked the work I shouldn’t worry about it. Taking the professionals advice, I continued to work and collected similar clients through graduation.

Well, after 6 months of applying after graduation, no one would entertain the idea of hiring me. The most I got was “phone interviews” where they we’re obviously just curious and I would never receive a second call. Incredibly disheartened that my undergraduate education was worth nothing, I went back to the same consoling center to seek help finding work. Well, that same career consoler knew a small business that wanted a full-time marketing person. It was basically what I was doing freelance but for a bigger business. Sounded great, it was not. 

So they touted the position as a “marketing data analysis” (obviously bull but whatever) and what that really meant is I fully re-did their site in WordPress, set up all their social accounts, run those social accounts, set up email automation, set up all the accounts for SEO purposes, write copy, do all the traditional publication research, and more.

They have me do all this while refusing to give me a budget, and expect the fact that they pay me on a bi-weekly basis to be budget enough. Also beyond my immediate boss, who is the only saving grace here because he is pretty cool and knowledgeable, I basically act as a marketing professor, having to explain my every action and how their work should interact with me to a bunch of old people who make 3x as much as me. 

I feel like this place is only learning from me and is destroying my career, I have done exactly 0 paid advertising here, I have just recently gotten permission to start automating emails (newsletters), we have no CRM for re-marketing customers effectively, so I made my own in excel (no I cannot use HubSpot for specific reasons). I have to constantly explain why content and having a social media presence is important, and the reporting I do for them in from GA is so basic that any agency or company where I would be proud to work, doing actually data analysis, would think I’m retarded at this point. How am I supposed to do any meaningful data reporting when the current web presence only drives 500 unique visitors a month and they are giving me no outlet to try to improve it beyond publishing content for organic traffic? What agency is going hire someone who’s old job didn’t “allow” him to do any paid advertising? How am I supposed to learn or get better at work when everyone is learning from me? This place is destroying my career and now I’m stuck because if I quit early it looks bad and if I stay my experience looks like something someone savvy high school student could do.  

I also do this while making well below industry average, because you know, I needed to eat eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don’t take this as me being upset with how much work they have me do, I fine with working hard. I would rather work 12-hour days at Microsoft then work 8-hour days here. It just makes me incredibly sad and anxious that I will never be able to work at the places I dream of working in any reasonable amount of time because this place is making my resume worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also aggressively studying for my GMAT, so my time outside of work is limited. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My work is not providing experience is key areas that I feel I will never recover from. What should I do? "

I'm going to be coming up on the summer before my senior year, which is supposedly when I should be doing an internship (applications are to be sent in soon). I believe this would be the best route to take and I just had a few questions for anyone who's been in the info sec world or hired in the info sec world. My main issue is that I don't know anyone personally that works in the field and therefor I struggle to find a ""baseline"" against which to compare myself for readiness. That is, I don't really know where I stand, compared to other cyber sec students. I should say I'm an extremely anxious person when it comes to work (as in heavy shaking/vomit multiple times before interviews/shifts at my previous food-industry job) and the purpose of me asking is to set goals for myself which will A.) make me a more desirable candidate and B.) feel more comfortable about what is expected of me versus what I'm capable of. 

For a bit of background:

I'm 25 (started college late due to some IRL limitations), a junior working on an IT degree at a large state school (with a focus on security). I've gotten good grades throughout college so far, but only recently has my coursework started being any real level of applicable to my chosen career. I would love to eventually be a penetration tester full time as I enjoy the challenge of the unknown, and the ""there isn't one set way into any machine"" sort of mentality. I made the decision around February this year to switch my in-school and out-of-school focus from general IT to security after reading about HackTheBox on a security blog and deciding to give it a go. I thoroughly enjoyed myself on the site and figured this might be a worthwhile career path. Since then, I've read ""The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing"" and the majority of ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"", begun practicing scripting in both Bash and Python (with Python being my stronger language), rooted 30-40 machines on HtB of various difficulties, bought a Pineapple and BashBunny to practice wireless/physical security, and most recently, took a month of Offensive Security's Pentesting With Kali course, and obtained my OSCP. 

After looking at the requirements for many penetration testing jobs, and broader net/info sec jobs, I see my weaknesses as the following:

* I have the ""mile-wide, inch deep"" sort of knowledge outside of penetration testing. I've taken many one-off courses that are required for the degree including: SQL database design and management, web app design, network design, data analysis, programming in Java, cloud computing, encryption, etc. But, while I was exposed to many of these technologies, I wouldn't feel comfortable call myself proficient in any of them or listing them as particular strengths. 
* I don't have any real-world experience in info sec.  
* Almost all of my practice experience thus far has been offensive. I've done a lot of breaking in, but not much in the way of preventing break-ins. I often struggle when I consider how to even go about starting a process like hardening a network/host. I know basic stuff like authentication, assigning least privilege, firewalls and ingress/egress rules, malware/A.V. detection, but I have trouble actually doing any of it without Google. I also wouldn't feel confident that I had properly secured it without some form of test against it. 
* I can't program in C/C++, nor even advanced Python. Many companies ask for proficiency in one or both of these it seems. I can read/modify simple C code, especially if it's well commented. I can read/understand most Python but still refer to 3rd party resources for more advanced coding.(The same goes for PHP/JS -- I can read, but can't really code it. However, I rarely see these two as requirements outside of WebApp Security specifically).
* I'm very new to the field. There are still very obvious things I feel like I should know, but don't (as an example, I recently learned about SMB Shares, and the serious vulnerability they can present a short while ago \[primarily a \*nix user btw\]. Most people I've talked to think it's a relatively elementary topic and one that should've been known.) I'm sure there are loads of people that have been fooling around with hacking and pen testing since they were teenagers; I'm not sure how I stack up against them or what I could offer as a benefit to hiring me over someone like that. Furthermore, I worry that this ignorance of some basic-level information or testing methods will lead me to miss a glaringly obvious solution to an issue in the field at some point or another. Not having the foundation fully covered seems like a bad idea, but I don't know how much I don't know. 

I understand penetration testing (and to an extent, all of Net/Info Sec) is sort of a graduate position that you usually switch to after gaining real-world sys or network admin work. I figured an internship would be less demanding of a large skillset, and more of a willingness to learn, so I'm hoping to get a glimpse of my future career. With all of that in mind I'd like to ask anyone who's made it this far the following:

* Who is your ideal intern candidate, in terms of skill and experience?
* What would you consider to be essential for someone in my position to know? If you were hiring a penetration tester or for another Info Sec job, what basics should they know how to do without assistance?
* Of my weaknesses, which do you think are the most detrimental to my success? Are any of them weaknesses shared by the majority of college students looking for internships is similar roles?
* Any general recommendations on becoming comfortable in this field? It feels like there's always something to learn, always something to improve on, so how do you become confident that you know enough for a position?
* I've noticed many jobs that involve penetration testing are for large companies where this is just one of many duties I would have. Are these worthwhile long-term for a career in pen testing or should I look to start cold-calling more boutique firms that are strictly pen testing related? 
* Any other tips/recommendations/comments for a skiddie looking to make a career for himself?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and answer my questions. I'm hoping to over prepare for every situation so I can do my absolute best (and not throw up before interviews quite so much). "

Their tech stack is JavaScript, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL and some Python.

I'm a sophomore Computer Science student and have a solid foundation of data structures, algorithms, and OOP. I'm proficient in Java and and have basic knowledge of Python, but beyond that, I have no experience with this stack.

I would really like to hit the ground running and have *something* thrown together using their stack to show the CEO and CTO at the meeting. I have no class Friday-Monday and will be dedicating full days to this, as I have taken off work this weekend.

Does anyone have any advice or knowledge of the best resources for learning these technologies? There seem to be a lot of options.

Edit for clarification: By no means do I believe I can become proficient in any of these technologies over the weekend. However, I do wish to learn as much as possible in that amount of time, as it seems that the position would allow me to learn as I go (it's an internship and I will have guidance) if I am hired. "

I’ve been in Virginia for almost two months, and it would be an understatement to say that I don’t like it. Everyone asked why I would ever leave California which made me feel incredibly stupid. But I feel like I’m trapped here since I would have to pay the signing bonus back if i chose to leave before a year, on top of breaking my apartment lease, and paying to move my car and other belongings back across the country.

My experience at work has been very discouraging on top of everything else. From the phone interview I had, it sounded like I was going to be a Java developer, but I feel like of done everything besides Java. I’ve had to work in JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, C, C++, and more. It’s been taking a while for me to get used to everything, and as soon as I finish one task, I have to learn something completely new. Half the time I find out that the stuff that I fix was done the wrong way or in the wrong place. There’s only one other experienced developer working on the same project as me, and I’m constantly asking him for help. He’s kind of like a robot, which makes it really hard for me to go to his desk and ask for help directly so I end up emailing him back and forth which I can tell he doesn’t like. Thankfully, the project manager is a really nice guy and doesn’t get mad or anything when I take too long with a task or solve it the wrong way, but I can tell I’m not impressing anyone. I find all of this super discouraging and it makes it hard for me to stay focused and enthused about my work. The other new hire, who has his masters and a few other jobs under his belt, seems to be coming along fine which makes me feel like I’m under qualified for this position.

Everyone says that this is always how it is when you start working, and they don’t expect much out of a fresh grad but I just feel like I’m not really learning and not progressing. I feel like it’s starting to affect my mental health. Any advice would be appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a sophomore in a Finance program, that's going for a double major with Finance and Computer Science. So basically since I entered as a Finance major, and I didn't start my CS major until freshman spring semester, I am a bit behind everybody else (I'm currently taking the basic Java class along with Discrete Math). I basically taught myself Python up to what I would like to believe is an intermediate level, and I know very, very basic HTML and CSS (I used [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org)). 

I was wondering what you guys believe I should teach myself to be able to have the skill set necessary to apply for software engineering internships for next summer (I am going to do a banking internship this upcoming summer). At this point I am not sure exactly what aspect I am most interested in, I'm not sure whether I want to be a front end developer, back end developer, web, etc. I was just wondering what are some basic skills that would be good for any aspect of developing and that I would need for any internships. As long as it is something in programming so I can at least try it out before I decide whether I'll decide to go into banking or computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Finance student that's now doing a double major in CS along with finance. Want to try to improve my skill set so that I would actually be a viable candidate for software engineering internships."

9vfga6,3,2018-11-08,Full Stack vs DevOPs?,ratchetthairsalon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9vfga6/full_stack_vs_devops/,"Hi all,

I'm currently in an IT role doing basic app administration and a little development (mostly SQL routines and debugging some Perl scripts). I have a CS degree but found that I haven't really used it to it's full potential. I have done a little bit of everything at various internships and jobs since 2007.

What I really want to do is work remotely, on my own hours (within reason) for a cushy company, and I don't really mind one way or another what the actual work is so long as my skills remain relevant and competitive. I have applied around for months, but I just don't have the skills or professional experience for the types of jobs that can be done remotely. I have no portfolio or GitHub profile, because I haven't done anything fancy.

From looking at the keyword statistics on [remoteok.io](https://remoteok.io), most of the top 10 keywords are in the full-stack/frontend/backend field, so I decided to pursue a part-time bootcamp on Bloc. I haven't signed up yet (have until next Friday before the next session starts), because everyone I speak to for career advice says that DevOPs is getting really big, and they're not finding enough experienced people. DevOPs is the #3 keyword on remoteok right now, so it's up there as well. People also say that web dev will always have work, but it's so oversaturated with very skilled devs that it's hard to stand out. 

While DevOPs is newer and more in-demand, it doesn't have a lot of resources because of it. I haven't found any good DevOPs bootcamps like there are for Bloc, and I really want the structure, mentorship, and portfolio-building ideas of a bootcamp to piece it all together in a real-world employable package. I have been trying to weasel my way in with the OPs team at my current workplace, but we are an old, state-funded nonprofit with a vanishing budget, and I don't know how excited they'd be to start implementing things like containers or Jenkins servers when whatever we've been doing has been working fine. I'm also afraid that if I ask for something like getting an AWS cert, they'd know I'm looking to jump ship because we don't use AWS.

So I leave my fate in your hands. Which path should I go down? Would it be crazy if I did the full stack bootcamp while trying to mosey up my DevOPs skills at work however I could?"

1.) Company A has offered me an internship over the winter break that would eventually lead into the spring and summer. Pretty normal offer, Pay is decent ($15.50/h) and I would be working with a small CE firm that focuses on construction of commercial buildings. While working with them I can continue my degree plan, clubs, etc.

2.) Company B came out of the Blue today with an offer that's in right field. They are offering me a spot in their highly competitive Co-op program. It is a 3 semester (1 and a half years) program, 40 hours per week at around $20/h, where I will be working with energy and power. They want to relocate me to one of their many locations in a few different states (they haven't decided where they will relocate me yet). They will give me a relocation stipend and a company car for transportation as the job requires a lot of travelling. My college is not in the most interesting city, but I'm sorta iffy on leaving everything behind. I have just became the club president of a new organization, have a great campus part time job, and just started making friendships. Working at Company B would also require me to take classes online if I want to stay on track for graduation, but many of my CE courses aren't online. However, Company B will work with my college to try to get me CE credits from my coop. They also guaranteed me a job with an even higher pay after graduation if I decide to do this. This is a very exciting, albeit out of the blue, position that would have me moving in January, so I have about 2 weeks to make my decision. 

3.) Company B will choose to give me a full summer internship if I decide to turn their first offer down, but it doesn't come with all the flashy bonuses as the original offer. The pay is likely to stay the same (around $20), but would be short term (Summer).

Edit: After thinking about it a lot and thinking of different scenarios, Im conflicted. Offer 2 sounds incredible, but Im also leaving a lot behind. I JUST became the president of a new organization I started and love. We also have great members who are looking forward to the future of the organization. I found out today, that my campus job may be paying me more next semester, which is great. And finally, Company A called me today and told me they’re excited to have me and will work with my college schedule completely which is nice. Company B sounds really great, but relocating, breaking my lease, and leaving school and/or only taking online class (which can affect my scholarships/financial aid) is going to be a hassle. I still have all the offers on the table, but each offer comes w/ pros and cons. Still open to feedback! "

I'm not a computer science major but instead a computer information systems major. I feel like that will work against me when applying for internships because it's not as prestigious a degree. I don't know anyone nearby that has been getting offers from companies like people here are, and certainly not the pay.

Basically, I feel less than because I'm not doing what people here are doing. Am I being irrational? Or should I be concerned that I'm not seeing the same results? I'm a junior right now. And feel like I'm basically out of time and I'm too late. "

I really enjoy working there and do learn a lot in terms of technical skills but I do get only minimum wage there (which my boss told me will increase with time). After lurking on this sub and seeing the brutal rejection rates for grads while landing a job right after high school I realised I was incredibly lucky. Now the problem is when I think of the future I'm not sure how likely I am to land a job in the future which I might consider if my salary doesn't increase. So I'm wondering how is the experience for other Europeans who have applied for internships/jobs and what are the rejection rates there?
9vih5g,1,2018-11-09,Which job do I pick,NakedZergling,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9vih5g/which_job_do_i_pick/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a bit of a pickle.  I have two potentially promising job offers and I do not know which to pick.  The second job has asked that I give them a decision by end of business tomorrow.  I have a bachelors in mechanical engineering and I am 2 years into my career and I currently live in Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to give as many relevant details as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

The first job is for a 6 month contract-to-hire near Oklahoma City where my family is living.  Contract-to-hire means that if I do a good job for the first 6 months I will have a full-time direct hire position, benefits, salary, etc.  The hiring manager stressed to me during interviews that there he didn't hire contractors unless he knew he had a spot for them long-term.For Job 1 I would be doing supply chain engineering type work for a military airplane sustainment project at a higher rate than I was making in Wichita.  I couldn't get a clear picture of what the job would exactly be but it sounded very dry.  It seems like I may be managing the renovation of aircraft from a high level for production, procurement, instalation, maintenance of updated aircraft electrical components.  My employer would sponsor me for a secret clearance and it might open doors down the line, it certainly wouldn't hurt.  I already got some advice on how valuable this clearance is and I feel I didn't get a consensus on askengineers.  I gave the recruiter for Job 1 permission to accept a job offer on my behalf many months ago, and the details were finally worked out between the government, the airframer, and the contractor this Monday.  I simply received a phone call telling me that I got the job and an e-mail with my start date.  I filled out all the on-boarding paperwork for the contractor maybe a month ago.  I felt a bit misled because I'd never actively accepted this offer, only passively.  I did 100% give them the right to accept job offers on my behalf.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my family and I have missed them while working as an engineer in Wichita but my relationship with my father and brother has always been a bit strained.  My dad spent most of our childhood working and angry.  My brother was a bully for over a decade to me.  I just spoke to my parents and they are fine with either job but would be absolutely ecstatic if I were to work in OKC.  They are getting older (late 50's) and I truly do not think it would be wise for me to sprout roots in another city and let my parents pass while I am thousands of miles away.  I think I should settle down in OKC.  I have no pictures of my family or recordings of their voice which worries me some days.  When I asked my parents a few days ago they told me to go with Job 2, but now they tell me to go with Job 1.  Either way I know they'd support me, and I think they and I are fairly easy to sway one way or the other.  My dad has his own way of talking, and says he doesn't want us to argue and would like to see me once or twice a month.  I'm not sure what to make of that.  My brother's advice was useless and just basically insulting me for not having found a position sooner, except he said he had heard stories of people at Job 1 working 60 hour weeks (for a software group, not mechanical).  He attends university nearby OKC.

&amp;#x200B;

The second job is for a 3 month contract only position for a ginormous Seattle, WA air-framer at a rate that is $15/hour higher than job 1. Cost of living calculators suggest that Job 1 actually pays better than Job 2, and the cost of living becomes especially significant if I want to buy a house.   I am a bit excited about this position because they have very large testing cells to test gigantic loads on air-frame assemblies.  Next door to where I'm would work they test the entire airplane.  One of my summer internships was working with engineers who were testing jet engines, and I have to say that the test work was the most exciting thing I've done in my career.  Though, I don't know if I can say I have ever truly loved or entirely enjoyed any job.  The hiring manager says he can make no guarantees beyond 3 months, but the recruiter says 90% of contracts are extended at least once for typically 4-6 months and that 40% of contracts result in a direct hire.  The hiring manager talked a bit about the need to transfer knowledge to early career engineers due to a lot of recent retirements in aerospace and that he is about to begin testing a new airplane which seems promising.  However, there is a real chance that I will end up without a job when the contract ends.  Three of my best friends and old roommates from college are living in Seattle and working as software engineers.  When I think back on my adult life I cannot remember a time I was happier than in college, hanging out with these friends a few times a week and every weekend.  We game on discord sometimes but the time difference is rough to deal with.  I don't know if it would be possible to recapture these days but I would enjoy it very much if it were.  I visited them in Seattle 2 years ago and had a blast, though one friend was a little sick of seeing me every weekend for the duration of my vacation.

In terms of where my head is right now... when I jot my thoughts down I get something like this:

Job 1:

Family, pay is better after adjusting for cost of living, security clearance

Boring work

Job 2:

Exciting work, best friends in Seattle

Riskier contract, higher cost of living

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to proceed about deciding between these two positions.  I am happy with you telling me which job I should choose and why, or how I can go about best choosing.  The recruiters are persuasive and after I talk with either of them I end up more confused.  I plan on calling the recruiter for Job 1 tomorrow to get as many specifics as I can about the work I'd be doing, my one-over-one hasn't responded to my e-mail with that question that I sent on Wednesday and I think I need the answer before making a final decision. There are a lot of factors to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have to pick right this second I think I'd pick Job 1; Job 1 is already accepted on my behalf (I may permanently burn bridges with a big company and a recruiting firm if I rescind the offer as well), my family is right near Job 1, Job 2 has no guarantees beyond 3 months, and there is no guarantee I can recapture my old college days if I went to Seattle.  I'm not sure if I'm seeing things clearly or not.  Many thanks for your advice.

 **AIRLINER MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING**

If a Boeing airliner gets damaged too severely to be fixed by simply following one of the standard repair manuals (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBG62FkKHYk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyhxExhfVic) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayCWSm1f9qk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=788mOucDELU) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw-aUVa3a0U) or [this](http://www.nycaviation.com/2013/07/developing-ethiopian-boeing-787-involved-in-incident-at-london-heathrow/29564)), the airlines' maintenance facilities call up Boeing's office in Seal Beach. This was my first job at Boeing and **it's more interesting than it may sound**. Instead of just designing and analyzing parts on a computer for future airplanes, engineers design and analyze parts to patch up the damage to old airplanes that need it asap. (Each day that the airplane is sitting on the ground waiting for a repair, or getting maintenance, is hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue that the airline is missing out on). You learn a lot about the airplane's structures and systems, about what things break and how, about how and why airplanes are designed the way they are and how this has (or hasn't) changed over the last 30 years. It's much less theoretical, much more ""when the rubber hits the road"", than most aerospace jobs. In addition, these engineers are increasingly being tapped to help Seattle folks do design and analysis for new airplane models currently in development.

 **AIRLINER MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING**

If a Boeing airliner gets damaged too severely to be fixed by simply following one of the standard repair manuals (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBG62FkKHYk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyhxExhfVic) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayCWSm1f9qk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=788mOucDELU) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw-aUVa3a0U) or [this](http://www.nycaviation.com/2013/07/developing-ethiopian-boeing-787-involved-in-incident-at-london-heathrow/29564)), the airlines' maintenance facilities call up Boeing's office in Seal Beach. This was my first job at Boeing and **it's more interesting than it may sound**. Instead of just designing and analyzing parts on a computer for future airplanes, engineers design and analyze parts to patch up the damage to old airplanes that need it asap. (Each day that the airplane is sitting on the ground waiting for a repair, or getting maintenance, is hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue that the airline is missing out on). You learn a lot about the airplane's structures and systems, about what things break and how, about how and why airplanes are designed the way they are and how this has (or hasn't) changed over the last 30 years. It's much less theoretical, much more ""when the rubber hits the road"", than most aerospace jobs. In addition, these engineers are increasingly being tapped to help Seattle folks do design and analysis for new airplane models currently in development.

I’m a east coast new grad in May and I’ve already gotten 3 job offers (basically anyone I talked to in person I landed an offer.) 

One with navy for 62k + secret 
One with mid sized consulting for 73k, okayish benefits
One with small contractor 78k + secret, good benefits but no time off

I’ve had two internships and have a patent, and at the rate I’m getting these offers I’m really doubting my worth. I would pick the third choice but it is practically a 2 hour commute or less because of traffic. I’m thinking about counter offering for more but according to Glassdoor I’m at the top of their new grad pay. 

I’m also unsure of just feeling post grad meh about all jobs. None of them really interest me I feel like I’ll hate my job regardless of where I work at.

Has anyone gotten good offers but can’t find the will to accept? It feels like I’m settling on a realtionship I’m not ready for."

I'm currently studying in a really good university in my country, and I know this gives me an advantage while getting a job, but I want to use that fact (and everything else I can do like grades, projects, internships, etc) to my fullest potential. I do have an updated LinkedIn where I have my intership, volunteering work, some ""awards"" and workshops I did.

I'm still a few years away from finishing my degree but the sooner I start learning the better. Thus far I've only been in one interview for a internship and I got it. I don't really have a lot of time for extra curricular projects during the semesters. 

Some questions:

* Which type of companies should I apply to? I'm not sure how it is in most places but here there are *a lot* of consulting companies that basically make you work a lot and don't pay that well. Should I not do consulting? Should I go for software houses?

* How do I keep updated with jobs even if I am not not finished with my studies in the next two years so that I'm ready when I do finish?

* The company I interned for this summer wants me to work for them, but I don't think I have the time for that, so they might want another intership next summer. Would it make sense to do another internship with them if I will probably be doing the same thing as in the last internship?

* How do I take advantage of being in a top university while having good grades?

* How do I make good connections?

* I get connections requests from recruiters every day, but how do I gain anything from this? I accept them all. Some ask to talk to me for a few minutes to get to know me. Since I'm not interested in jobs at the moment I deny, should I accept it anyway?

* **Do you recommend any guide or book for CS or general students to take the best advantage from their opportunities while in college?**

9vm5h6,2,2018-11-09,How necessary is a Bachelor's for Computer Science?,AndreBoogy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9vm5h6/how_necessary_is_a_bachelors_for_computer_science/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if a bachelor’s in computer science is 100% necessary for a career in computer science? I’m currently a sophomore in an associate’s degree program at City Tech in NYC. I initially planned on just transferring to another CUNY school with a bachelor’s program in Computer Science. However, after speaking with some professors, they said in their opinion, a degree in an “applied” degree program would be more beneficial as I would become a better “problem solver” which has benefits than just a pure computer science degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

My school offers a degree in Applied Computational Physics, which looks very interesting. I enjoyed taking physics last year, so I know I’ll enjoy classes like Electricity and Magnetism, Classical Mechanics, and Intro to Quantum Mechanics. The “computation” part of the degree comes in with classes like Computational Fluid Dynamics and Computational Methods. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not even sure what I want to do in the future. I’m starting an internship soon as a Junior .Net Developer, but who knows if my interests will change in the future. I just know that I love programming and improving my logical skills; I even do a lot of game design on the side.

Today, however, I got an email saying the position was closed...
What do you guys think? Did they actually close it, or did they probably just found some else?

I wrote a good deal about my background, but while its extensive its not nearly as big as I'm guessing plenty of other applicants will have, so I wanted to mention on my personal side. I was going to write about how I struggled with undiagnosed ADHD all throughout high school, and doing so taught me how to succeed in unconventional ways thus making me a quick flexible learner that works best under pressure, as well as a creative problem solver, and managed to develop strategies in Junior year that got me from a 3.5 GPA to a 4.3 GPA Senior year, and brought my sleep from 3 hours a night to 7+. I'm worried though that this will make me seem as a liability - to tell the truth I do still struggle with tardiness and procrastination, and though I'm doing far better than Junior year, I still struggle with all these problems on the daily, even with the medication I've begun taking recently, so I'm worried that I might be overstating my success in dealing with ADHD and that they'll be constantly looking at me for signs of my ADHD making me a problem.

The best case scenario for me would be if I could transition to a part-time position around July so I can work during my studies and if that is not possible, I'd quit the job and find something else after that.

\- Tasks: I am not going to code much in the first few months. So it's basically a consulting job (Well, it's Accenture)

I want to learn as much as possible and try to get a summer internship 2020 at a big tech company. So my choice would go out to the job offer that would bring me closer that experience/knowledge, but I'm not sure which one of those two would be the better one.

For some background I'm a cs major, California based, about to graduate this December and I'm more or less dead set on going into data science at least as a starting point in my career. Sorry if this is kinda wordy but it's a very specific dilemma I found myself in...

I originally planned on going straight to grad school, taking a 6 month data science internship (or two 3 month internships) between now and when it would start. So far I havent heard back from any that I applied to out of 50ish except 5 denials and a request to interview from Genentech. (Side note, I know data science internships are typically for grad students, but I have a previous data science internship and some deep learning research that I think would give me decent chances)

I also have a family member at PWC who encouraged me to apply there, albeit for a tech consulting position. They extended me an offer on the grounds that they'd rather have me on full time as opposed to an internship, and now I have 2 weeks to give them my decision.

The tech consulting position could potentially be with a team that works with machine learning and statistical modeling (one of my interviewers mentioned theyd really like me to work with their team that does this), but I they wont actually tell me my specific role until after I accept the offer... and I don't know if I'd want to do regular old software consulting.

All that said, would it be wiser here to take the position and delay my grad school plans? PWC is a really big name and I might still be working in a realm that's applicable to data science. But I also havent heard back from some internships I think I have a decent shot at, and internship + grad school seems better right out the gate for data science then a consulting position.

Currently, I have an associates degree in liberal arts social sciences and humanities. I have experience in civil engineering and I am pretty tech savy. I do case management in a non profit organization for about 1.5 years now. 

I'm curious to know what transferable skills and experience can I take with me both short term and long term when heading into the IT field?

I currently supervise 30 active young adults, I am a recruiter for our program, a business partner (creating partnerships with other businesses with our program), I do administrative tasks such as payroll (collecting time sheets and monitoring/totalling hours) and intake for new applicants which will include assisting in I-9 and pre-screening (a second interview to understand the applicant better for qualification reasons).

I originally did not want to stay in this field long term as social work has no financial stability for a commitment of 4 more years of schooling (bachelors and masters).

I looked at going into HR, as some of my skills may be transferable as a recruiter and the marketing skills I have when recruiting but I'd have to intern as an HR.

Based on my current interest for IT, to be more specific on which direction I'm considering heading into is Cloud Computing, learning CRM, and my interest in Google Analytics. Saas, Iaas, and Paas all intrigue me. I am aiming at focusing more of my attention on Salesforce as an administrator but have not began the process.

With those three interest in mind, what pathways am I looking at 1-3 years down the road and 7-10+ years in the future?

Note: I have very basic understanding of Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript as I took some online courses on KhanAcademy and CodeAcademy. 

I do not intend on going further in coding, but wouldn't mind a challenge as a side gig for the fun of learning and adapting as I evolve.

I am a very outgoing and sociable character. I love engaging with people and clients if this helps.

My interest in IT has everything to do with financial stability and benefits tech companies offer. I also enjoy working in a team. 

Thank you!

Edit: I also would like to add I am 26, I am on DACA. DACA is a major reason why I'd like to persue a skill deseriable for employers. I am on a time line I cannot afford to not educate myself and advanced my knowledge. If I were to go back to my home country, I know nothing of it. I came here at 1. I would rather have skills that can protect my well being if this was the case with a proper job. Case management/mental health is not deseriable in my home country. My main goal is to land a job at a better company that will likely support an employment visa, although I am hoping for a solution with DACA in congress."

Got an offer from Facebook a few weeks ago and signed that thing as quickly as I could get my hands on it! I’m a sophomore studying CS and Math on the East Coast in a semi-reputed state school. Last internship was at a startup in Philadelphia that didn’t really have a product, let alone an internship program, and was severely undervalued and underpaid; naturally, the concept of $8K a month before I graduate and free food and housing blows my mind.

I do a lot of coding on the side for tech organizations at my school and even run Arch Linux on my own laptop; from this, I developed a fascination, bordering on an obsession, with learning more about how Linux works and makes life easier for people. I’ll try to describe my learning path in this and other subjects so you guys can get a feel for where I am.

I first got roped into it by some Vim-golf enthusiasts at my Uni, and then learned grep, awk, and sed for myself. Along with this, I also learned Python for ML and backend web development (using Flask and the usuals.) Soon, I realized how mind-blowing Linux can be, and started using Arch so I could learn about init, systemd,  X, and the like. Naturally, Docker and Kubernetes followed as I grew to take on coding projects in college. Along with that, I have some knowledge of Chef, but generally prefer containerized architectures for big apps because a Docker container is a much more consistent and scriptable environment than a Chef cluster. I’m also procrastinating my school projects to learn Rust along with C, which I should be learning for said school projects (almost kicking myself for not having “discovered” functional programming earlier!)

Any advice on any of the subjects above, Facebook especially, would be appreciated. Specifically...

1) Naturally, I tend towards a Systems Engineering specialization; however, I don’t know whether I can or should narrow this down to something more specific like SRE, build engineering, production/release engineering, or something else entirely. To people in this specialization or who happen to know about it: what other things can I learn that might interest me or push me forward professionally? What are some long-term career paths for people in this specialization (Do they usually go to management, or gravitate to a more specialized team and function within a large company? Both or neither?)

2) I’ve read around that getting a return offer for another internship or an FTO at Facebook shouldn’t be too hard, but being that achieving this opportunity was a miraculous stroke of luck on my part that I’m sure plenty of others would kill for, I don’t want to leave anything to chance. What are some things you would recommend for people to be wow-ed by my work? What’s life like for an FB intern; what are the expectations, the resources they give you, and the best ways for you to use those resources? To a greater extent, I’ve heard everywhere that FB is an amazing company to work for in terms of its work culture and values; what are some things I can do to make the most of what it has to offer and push myself forward as a developer and a person?

Thanks for reading, guys! Very excited to hear your thoughts!"

I've actually finished a decent amount of GE's/requirements so I will probably have more time than your average student, especially if upper div courses have prereqs I need to finish.

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks guys"

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a University student at San Diego State University that has 2 years of credits worth. I am behind and honestly disliking my school. The classes are just a grind and I feel like it is just based on attendance. I also went into college straight after High School so I just went into Computer Science just because it was closest to 'working close to games.' I am currently feeling pretty unhappy with how school is for me right now.

But enough of that, my dream is to become a Game Designer. I love games and have always wanted to do something with it. My school does not offer Video Game Design degrees (other than Media studies?). So I am stuck whether to transfer to a different school or to finish up my degree at my current University.

I live in San Diego,California so my options are limited for Game Design degrees when I looked through google. I have : National University, and Art Institute of San Diego.

I've heard some negative things about both these schools so I am very hesitant to pick... I am open to suggestions on other schools!

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to any advice or help. I am very naive to how the graphic design jobs work and what they want in terms of qualifications. I am also planning to intern at Playstation or something!

Thanks reddit!"
9vthqx,2,2018-11-10,Are all jobs so depressing? :/,thoaway17,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9vthqx/are_all_jobs_so_depressing/,"I'm 17 and I'm in 10th grade, from Germany. 

I worked a 40h job for several weeks and it exposed me to the real world and it was really soul sucking and it made me feel worthless. When I would timestamp, I could see through the employees depressed faces that they don't like their jobs and that they really don't want to be there. Most of them even have an undergrad degree. 

I know that I can do much more than just pack up 1000x little electronic parts. I do sometimes realized while I was working that I basically just traded in my time for money and that I could spend all the time working for someone else, working for myself that eventually benefit me later. I felt really empty in my soul and my whole body felt like it's just a robot. I felt so useless to the point I was questioning if I even belong here. 

I even did a bunch of internships before and never have I ever enjoyed any of those. They were soul sucking as well. I am pretty optimistic, believe it or not. However, does every job has to be so depressing? Honestly it really affected my personal life and the so called ""work- life balance"" wouldn't help me either because I can't balance my life if my job is so soul sucking. I've never felt so down in my life. I therfore always walk around with a serious face and I laugh fewer because there's nothing funny anymore about life. 

I'm very glad I'm back to school. 

I do for the most part enjoy school and I like economics, business administration, and a little bit of politics but I'm not sure about these. I just feel like going to University will get you also a soulless job.
I'm probably saying that because I'm not sure of what to study. 

There's a big city near my town which is called ""the financial capital of Europe"", if that says something to you ;)

And everytime I go there it's a lot of people in suits and they too feel like they're working a depressing job even if it's in a skyscraper. I sometimes can see through the windows in some skyscrapers and I look and all I see is offices hundreds and thousands of offices and I think that this will await me and I feel so sad about this. 
Might be because it's a big city it's just has that stigma around it. I'm sure you can relate to this.

I got my paycheck 3 days ago in the mail and I saw the amount I was getting paid for (It wasn't just a little) but I don't care. They could pay me a million dollars and I wouldn't care. This is how much I hated the job and my mom laughed and couldn't even understand why I wasn't happy and I looked at her dead serious and I told her that this isn't funny and that she should stop laughing immediately. I'd rather not live than having to live this live forever.

I checked at the ATM yesterday if my money was transferred and all the memories came back up and even 600€ can't make up for that. I will definitely save that money due to the fact that I don't know what to do with my life, I have this huge fear of being homeless and the thought just really scares me. 

It's not like I was treated poorly in that job. It's just I can't imagine having to this for the rest of your life and I absolutely loath it and I feel like when I look at the people in that big city, when I look in the crowd, every job is like that. 

Now I have all this money. So what? Like what is this little peace of paper supposed to make me feel? Happy? I love wearing clothes where I feel comfortable in but I was at H&amp;M and I know I wasn't going to buy something since I need to save it, however I thought those clothes won't give you any satisfaction. 

Sometimes I see people while their working, for instance my teacher trying to explain me something and I just wonder : do they actually want to help me? or is it just that they have to? Do they even enjoy their job? Are they happy? It's probably because I mostly can't comprehend how they can work a job cause it wouldn't be something I would do but I ask myself this question daily, at any given point of the day.

On my way home I really felt depressed. Luckily Music especially coldplay calmed me down a little. 

It's not that I don't want to work or don't want to study. I'm not depressed, but thinking about this topic makes me feel like wanting to disappear from this planet for ever. 

I'm really scared that I'll become this boring adult who hates his job and I just don't know what to think. I just don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore. I would do anything literally anything to not have this life even if it means I shouldn't exist. Please help me. 
Is it even possible to feel fulfilled or at least satisfied? "

This might get long so please bear with me.

I went to a state school and struggled in every way. Money, mental health, direction, etc. My grades suffered and I never did any personal projects. In January I landed an internship  working on a web app (picked up a lot of frameworks since I only ever learned vanilla) and when I graduated in August they offered me the full time position. 

Our team has about a dozen developers, all with less than 3 years of experience, and I constantly question if I'm getting comfortable and falling behind the current trends. We use spring for our services and laravel for the web pages. Typical HTML/CSS/JavaScript with jQuery and I can't help but think ""I'd be better off working somewhere that uses Angular or Node or Vue"", but I also never really wanted to get into web development. I still enjoy what I do (90% of the time) but I had much more interest when I was using c++ in school. Even assembler was more fun than scripting web pages.

So my question is, am I losing value by staying at this job? I always see everyone say one year of experience is all you need to be marketable but could I be hurting my chances of getting out of web dev and landing a job at a larger company that can help me he's into more relevant languages and frameworks?"

So basically the title says it all. I am currently a senior in high school looking to become a software engineer. I have little experience in coding itself, but I have always been inclined on learning but have just been intimidated for some reason. I obviously have a love for technology to pursue this field. For some experience (doesn't really correlate to software engineering), I've built computers, worked on some networking and running servers on Linux.  


After some research, I decided that I would love to program and create software, as to me it is fascinating to build something from the ground up.   


**What steps I have already taken?**

* I have recently started using CodeAcademy to learn the basics on python. Later after these courses and some experience in the language, I plan on taking some of the other courses offered to expand my knowledge.  

* I am looking at doing a two-year transfer out of my community college into a four-year university. I will be getting my associates in CC.  

* I have a possible internship with the National Institute of Standards and Technology I am applying to.  


**Question time!**

* What is some advice or knowledge you would've wanted to know before diving in?  

* What are some classes I should look for to take if I plan on going the Software Engineer route?  

* What are some good resources I should look into to help me learn?  

* Should I look into any books?  

* What are some programs you personally use to program in?

I have what I call the ""robotics route"" which consists of

* **C Programming**
* **Micro controller Programming**
* **Intro to Robotics** (this is the real class I want, but the first two are pre-reqs for it. in order)
* **A.I. Programming Languages**

* **Computer Graphics and Interface Design** ( Two-dimensional graphics algorithms, point and coordinate transformations, animation on graphics terminals and systems )
* **Computer Game Programming: Theory and Practice**  ( designing and developing 2D and 3D real-time multimedia simulations and games for education, training, robotics and entertainment. )
* **Software Dev. internship** (I plan on an internship no matter which path, but this is also an elective option).

I’m trying to keep this as anonymous as possible, while giving enough details so that I can hopefully get some career advice.

**TLDR: I’m a working artist at a studio, who wants to get hired full time, but doesn’t know how to go about doing so. The company is new and doesn’t have any formal hiring systems in place, so I don’t have scheduled evaluations where I can speak to higher-ups about my progress. I’m thinking I may need to talk to an administrator or to the owners directly, who hold hiring power, but I don’t know how to approach that situation.**

I’m a 26 year old recent college grad, and I’m very fortunate to be a paid artist, currently working part time at a prestigious art/design studio in Los Angeles as an apprentice (&gt;40 hours a week). This is my first big job out of college so moving up the ladder is new to me. I love my work, my coworkers, and the freedom we’re given (open schedule, so long as you don’t exceed your allotted hours). The studio is very successful but still technically a start up (less than 10 y/o). There are only about 6 full time employees, and another 6 are part time. I began as an intern, and got offered to be an apprentice for a year, which I accepted along with a raise. I’m about 3 months into the apprenticeship. I would really like to work there full time, but there isn’t any protocol for hiring, nor formal evaluations where I could be given an opportunity to express my desire to work for the company, or even receive concise feedback on how I might improve so that I was up to par as a studio artist. An operations manager has recently been hired to help improve the business side of the company, but I’ve barely spoken to them. Basically, I think the company is run like a lot of other start ups: they’re just figuring it out as they go.

I’ve mentioned to my boss that I’d like to be full time, but they told me that they don’t have the authority to hire full time employees - only the owners can. I believe them, as they are just one of a handful of artists who have been with the company since it began. My boss is allowed to hire interns as needed (we hire interns all the time, often for a month or so as needed for big projects), but it seems like full time employees only get hired by the owners. I’ve spoken a tiny bit with the owners and they’re super nice and friendly, but the extent of our conversations are usually no more than “Great job guys!” and “I love this!”. One of them has asked me if I was full time already. I said no, and they were kind of surprised, but didn’t say anything else about it.

I think that what’s happening is like when you are walking somewhere with somebody, and you realize you’re following each other, but neither of you know where you’re going, you’re just walking aimlessly. Nobody is leading in the hiring process, simply due to lack of communication. So nothing happens. I originally thought that I’d just keep doing a good job, and eventually they’d have a conversation about hiring me, but I also don’t want to drag out the process for months and months, or worse -not get hired at all because I waited around for something to happen, rather than take some initiative.

I think I need to talk to somebody higher up than my boss. I thought about maybe talking to the operations manager to see if they could help me, or at least get me a meeting with the owners. I don’t want to offend my boss by sneaking around their jurisdiction, but I also don’t want to wait for them to do something that I should have done myself.

Should I talk to the operations manager and maybe see what the best plan of action is, or do I go directly to the owners? Or do I just keep talking to my boss to try and get them to get this process going?

What kind of things could I say to express my desire to work at the studio full time, but not come off as entitled or overly demanding? I worry that I’m being antsy. I’ve been treated well since I got there, I don’t want to give the impression that I feel I’m being used.

Thanks for any advice you can give me.

2.) They won't have time to be enrolled in college full time? My question with this is how likely would you be able to get a FT offer if you graduated in the summer following that internship?  
3.) They won't likely extend your offer into the summer (for the internship)... unless it's in tax.  


I'm wondering if they care if you graduate on time? I'm planning to possibly graduate with 129 credits, however that would be I would need to take 6 classes (3 credits) each that following spring, which isn't possible seeing the hours needed. Also how likely are they to amend to your schedule? Is there flexibility with the hours? (For example.. if i wouldn't be able to work the normal 8 during some weekdays, would I be able to stay all day + do the hours i've missed on a day where I don't have class + the willingness to work weekends?) Do they care if you graduate the following summer (in the same year as the internship)? I was considering a couple of winter courses, however this would cause a conflict with the winter internship as it starts before winter courses end...   


Thoughts/Opinions? Any experience with delayed graduation and still getting a FT offer? This internship is with KPMG. "

The research that I will be doing is on the Terahertz band. I am not sure which track to pick: industry or PhD.

A little about me: 

I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in computer science. I have been working really hard, and have been scoring really well (I have been getting mostly above 90% in most classes and 100% in some). Of course, in order to score this high, I had to put in a lot of time and effort. I enjoy challenging my self and learning new material in new fields which is what pushed me to take high level courses in computer science such as (ML, operating systems, computer security, etc. ), and also high level courses in Electrical Engineering. In my senior year, I started taking Graduate level courses in EE designed only for Grad Students (I had to get permission from head of department to enroll). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been dreaming to work for big tech companies in the Silicon Valley since my freshmen year. However, I have been getting rejections from all of them (not even getting to first round interview). I started applying to internships since sophomore year, but wasnt able to get any offers. I also started branching out and applying to any tech company/start-up that came my way (but still no offers or interviews). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done research in the summer with a professor (the same professor who offered to fund my PhD), and I have enjoyed it.

I have also tried to network and reach out to recruiters and engineers in the tech industry (on linkedin mostly) but I dont get any responses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what to do right now. Any ideas or advice?

I want to eventually become a professor/researcher at a postsecondary university, but I don't know the steps I ""need to do.""",leochen202,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9w264r/hi_i_plan_on_studying_computer_science_for_my/,"Just to be clear, I don't want this post to turn into a thread questioning my incentives for wanting to become a professor. I am well aware of the rather poor job market of professor positions, so no need to tell me about it. All I can say is that I am extremely motivated to learn all about computers(I'm interested in quite literally everything about them, but less on that...). I REALLY want to study computers and publish original research in the future.

Based on what I've researched using search engines, 
I know that becoming a professor is a long journey. Not only will I have to excel in undergraduate school, but I'll most likely need to earn a doctorate degree, along with several other activities - I've pretty much already made up my mind to devote my time into this career.

I know that people in the past have worked in research programs offered at their universities, worked on publications, or created cs portfolios, which ""buffed"" their graduate school applications. I don't really have much of this kind of experience, so I'm not entirely sure what any of these things actually look like. Basically I want to get a grasp of what I'm actually walking into.

However, I am only at step 1; I'm still in high school. I have very limited knowledge in terms of academia; I've taken classes like AP Calc, AP Physics, and AP Comp Sci, but I feel like the level of these classes isn't very representative of that of the actual classes found in college. Despite doing ""well"" in the class, I still feel that my understanding of these subjects is rather weak.

But anyways, especially after I'm done with college apps, I'll have A LOT of extra time; I want to spend this time to ""get a head-start"" towards my career.

Now here's my question: As a high school senior who is soon going to be an undergraduate cs student, what kinds of things could/should I spend my time doing?

Should I learn multiple programming languages? Should I attend cs-oriented internships? Should I take summer classes? Should I work on side cs projects? Seriously, what can I do? I would really like to have specific answers, so please elaborate on comments like ""do summer internships.""


It would be more helpful to me if you read the whole thing, but I still made a tl;dr for y'all:
TL;DR - soon going to be undergrad cs student; what can i do to learn as much about cs as possible?"

I have been looking at getting an MS in Computer Science (I have a BA and MS in International Affairs) and have talked with a local university about what I need to do about going back to school. I originally thought I would have to do an undergrad all over again, but they said I can be admitted as a provisional grad student where I would have to take a bunch of foundational courses before being an official CS student (so about 90 credits total to get an MS, instead of an additional 110+ to get a BS). I'm hoping to apply to the university for Fall 2019, but starting in the Spring I'm going to take Calc 1 and an intro CS course at a community college, and then Calc 2 and intro 2 CS course in the summer just to get the basic basics out of the way. I'm also thinking of taking a few business classes after reading a few threads here.  


My main question is this - if I want to work in the space industry what could I be doing now to prepare myself for university? I already have a few local companies that I've scoped out their internships, one that I would love to end up working for (Ball Aerospace- I don't know how lofty of a goal/dream that is). Shortly after I finished my undergrad I considered going into astrophysics or aerospace engineering, but I wasn't sure if that was the smartest path so I somehow worked my way into education. I really enjoy programming, and have started to go through the resources on [https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) but I'm still a little lost. I've even looked at a ton of job postings, but I don't know if software engineering, data science, AI, or some other branch is what I should be focusing on.   


I've liked the idea of software engineering because I really love to build things. I used to make costumes for theatres - getting the drawing, having to break down the different parts, drafting and creating patterns, doing fittings, revising patterns, doing mock-ups, and making final costumes... I love going through all the steps of taking something from an idea to reality and I understand spending hours - or days - working on something, and then having to undo everything to start again just to get it right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered doing a bootcamp but I honestly think getting a degree is what I need to do for the field I want to work in... so any advice would be very welcome! Thank you!"

Demographics:

Asian female

Top 5% for income in the US

Mom went to WashU, dad went to UC Berkeley

current junior

Stats:

1570 on the SAT, hoping to superscore to a 1600, 20/24 on essay but I’m hoping to do better

will take sat math ii, physics, and either lang or latin

gpa - 3.2 UW, 3.8 W because I failed most of my classes freshman year and didn’t do well sophomore year either due to mental health problems and other circumstances 

Will graduate with 15-17 ap’s: seminar (4) (totally useless ap by the way), government (4), physics c (mech, e+m), econ (micro, macro), bc calc, lang, world, art history (might not take the test for this one), music theory, studio art, research (useless but the product gets me hella clout), lit, psych, compsci, stat

Some other relevant courses I’ll be taking are MV or vector calc + quantum and thermo 

this is basically/close to the most rigorous course load I can take at my school which is best in state 

I got straight a’s this quarter so I at least have a 4.00 for the semester and I’m hoping to continue the upwards trend 

Extracurriculars (assuming I continue with them to senior year, which I will hopefully):

Teach lessons for theoretical physics for two years + senior cappie (this is already decided)

math team for 4 years

physics team for 2 years + senior cappie

model un for 4 years + senior cappie 

unicef club for 2 years (I did a lot of fundraising and “took initiative” for things)

nhs for 2 years

hopefully mu alpha theta next year 

debate for 1 year 

piano for 7 years

guitar for 2 years

clarinet for 3 years 

internship with nist over the school year 

internship at fermilab over the summer

hoping to get another internship for next summer 

ran a summer camp in costa rica for a month with a few other kids - we designed the whole thing and put it together 

helped rebuild homes in new mexico for a week

I’m fluent in english and vietnamese, conversational in spanish and russian (self taught) and I’m looking to tour Russia by myself senior year to develop fluency or do an exchange program

Participation in competitions where idk the result yet:
pumac (math), hmmt (math), physics bowl, amc (qualified for aime last year, hoping to do the same this year), tjpho (theoretical physics), dime nasa competition (theoretical physics), f = ma, omo (math), some other physics thing I don’t remember, scholastic writing competition

I did the majority of these last year and the year before too and did alright in a few 

Awards:

a bunch of model un first and second place awards for regional competitions 

t20 for csaw and pico ctf in my state

got some honors for math things, nothing particularly impressive 

won a bunch of small writing competitions - they’re technically national competitions but nobody enters (maybe a few thousand MAX) so I don’t know if it really matters. The prizes are great though so can I say something about that? I’m just trying to get my college clout where I can man

Essays: 

I’ve started some stuff even though it’s a year away and people say they’re pretty good so far because I’ve got a great sob story or whatever

Loads of tragedy in my life (fun!) and also physical defects and family dysfunction 

Recs:

Probably pretty good, I have really close relationships with a handful of my teachers - like we talk after school about passions and have loads of great discourse and things 

I’m looking at cmu and berkeley right now because they’re really great research schools and have amazing courses on theoretical + experimental physics, which is what I want to go into. Do you guys think those are reasonable reaches? Because my awards right now aren’t great and I feel like I could accomplish a lot more throughout this year so if you guys could assume by this time next year I’m less dumb that’d be great lmao"

Experiences: QA intern (Food science related), IT/Computer Lab supervisor position at school, Medical scribe, Medical assistant

To be brief, I had originally planned to attend medical school after graduating but I’ve realized that I am not happy working in the healthcare field and would like to change my career path. I want to study electrical/computer engineering and hopefully pursue a career in robotics/AI or software design after graduating. 

Ideally, I want to apply to graduate school for master’s in electrical engineering but am not entirely sure how to go about it since I did not study engineering in undergrad. From researching, I have found some post-bac transitional programs such as BU’s LEAP ([http://www.bu.edu/eng/prospective-graduate/leap/](http://www.bu.edu/eng/prospective-graduate/leap/)) and NYU Tandon’s bridge program ([https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/bridge-program-nyu-tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/bridge-program-nyu-tandon))

My question is, what would be my chances of being accepted into a master’s program with an unrelated BS in Bio? I know some schools allow you to make up prerequisite work prior to starting the master’s program. But how can I make myself a more competitive applicant – what skills/languages should I be learning right now such as Python/basic machine learning courses? How can I prove to graduate admissions that I am qualified and serious about learning engineering? Is it worth it to do a post-bac program?

Thanks, your help is much appreciated!"

9w6rwr,12,2018-11-11,Chances at Georgetown EA?,[deleted],chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/9w6rwr/chances_at_georgetown_ea/,"Hey guys. I am pretty nervous for decisions to come out. I know that no one can say for sure, but I was wondering if anyone had any thought as to what my chances are. I am applying to the college as a government major. Georgetown is also super weird in that their EA is actually a lower acceptance rate than RD, so that isn't helping haha.

ACT: 34, 35 superscore

SAT: 1480 (740 both)

SAT Subject Tests: US History 780, Literature 730, and Math II 670 (math isn't great, but I also sent in my 5 in AP Calc, and since I don't want to do anything with math, I don't think it will have too much bearing)

AP: AP GOPO 5, AP Calc AB 5

IB: German 6 (we take our foreign language exam early)

Course load: I am at an IB school, so I have taken basically all of the AP classes they offer in addition to my IB course load, so I won't have many APs to send in (since IB exams are taken at the end of senior year) but they will still see I have been taking the most challenging classes I can

Unweighted GPA: 4.0, 

Weighted GPA: 5.303 (my school does weighted GPAs super weird, so my rank is probably a little more revealing than my GPA)

Rank: 6/261

Extracurriculars:

* Mock Trial: all 4 years of high school,became captain my junior year; I have 11 most effective attorney awards as well as a most dependable award
* Student Activism club, founder
* Intern at our local chamber of commerce every week
* Volunteered on a congressional campaign this summer against 3 term incumbent until campaign ended
* Work as a runner at a local law firm about 7 hours a week
* Volunteer at our local museum where I help with kids activities
* Member of the National Honors Society, Science National Honors Society, and German National Honors Society (these are all the ones my schools offers).
* Beta club
* Math team (1 year) and soccer (1 year) - not that important but I think I checked the box on the application
* Junior Marshal at our school which only the top 20 students get to do

Awards:

* Mock trial (mentioned above)
* Silver on the National German Exam
* Varsity letter in academics (I know it’s weird, but my school gave them out so I listed it)

Essays: I think my essays were pretty good. I had others read them and edited them multiple times myselfs, and I think they are interesting and personal. I think they really conveyed my personality and passion for government. 

Recommendations: I think my recommendations should be good. One is from my 9th and 10th grade English teacher. She liked me a lot both years she had me, and she definitely knows I am a hard worker. She is also the mock trial teacher, and I am (I'm pretty sure) the first junior at our school to ever become captain, and I have broken the record for awards, including leading our team to state for only the second time in a long time. So, I think she will be able to speak to my leadership skills and my just overall extraness. My other recommendation is from my 11th and 12th grade english teacher (idk why it always ends up english). She has known me for a while and I consider her a friend. She also taught my Theory of Knowledge class for IB, where I actually got so into a conversation about the National School Walkout that I organized a group of students and got an article published in our local newspaper about it. Because of this, I started the student activism club with a friend, and she is the teacher supervisor for that, so she has seen my be very passionate about things and be a leader.

Interview: It went super well! We talked for over an hour and totally got along. She said she found me impressive and thought I would do well anywhere, and we liked a lot of the same things. She even gave me a movie recommendation...

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t have any amazing hooks or anything. No legacy, but I am from SC and I know that is usually less competitive than like California or NY, so that could be good.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I mostly game and I got a huge boost from the 1070 last year. So I'm still back and forth about if its worth replacing the MB, ram, and CPU.

I just failed Yelp's technical interview, which confirmed my unpreparedness. I also got through Facebook's resume filter and now I have to answer some questions via email in order to continue my application process (nothing technical yet).

Should I just tell them that I am currently unprepared for the interview (which will save their time from interviewing me) and that I will reapply for the winter internship next year once I am prepared?

Or should I just do the interview if I know I will fail, just to get a sense of what it is like? Will previous interview failures affect the probability of getting interviews in future applications?"

I'm currently working in Bachelors in Information Technology. I am currently a Junior at my institution, and will achieve Senior standing by Fall 2019. Its my second major from my current institution, and so far, I am really enjoying the program. Ever since I was a junior in middle school, I have been practicing IT, getting certs, and renewing my current certs.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried applying for a position a network technician on Monster, but I did not have my CCENT at the time. *I did not get a call back.* Jobs as a network technician are very limited in my area. I am primarily looking to become a network technician (even if it means moving out), but I am mainly looking to get a job as computer specialist to get a higher wage and more experience.

Here's a link to my resume :  [https://imgur.com/a/LTqogsd](https://imgur.com/a/LTqogsd)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a couple of questions I have in regards to my resume:

# Education:

I went to college for 2 years, and got my Associates under the liberal arts college. After I graduated, I decided to go after a Bachelors for in Computer Information Technology **in the same institution.**

*Should I remove my previous degree, or include both?*

# Experience:

I've been working with IT for 4 years before I entered into my technology internship. For over a year, I have been working with the networking department. I also worked with the computer specialists in the same job, but it was only temporary (for 2 months). I did not include this, because I rarely accomplished any work at the job, because my supervisor was frequently out for no reason. I accomplished very little, but I did the best I could.

*Should I include those 2 positions separately or leave it as is?*

&amp;#x200B;

Constructive Criticism is welcome!

There's a program that places American students in German classes, then university, culminating a 6-month internship (which I would have to seek out myself with some assistance). 

I used to live in Germany and speak German at home, so the language barrier shouldn't be an issue. However, I moved away when I was 9 and don't know about the general state of software engineering in Germany; I'd like to learn more. 

* Is there a predominant tech stack?
* Do most companies follow a specific development philosophy (like Agile etc...)?
* What is the management structure like?
* Is there generally a lot of bureaucracy involved in day-to-day work?

I will have 2 years of software engineering experience before I would start the program. Specifically, I've done a lot of frontend (although it's more full-stack) work with VueJS; I'd prefer to try something new, such as moving to the backend or switching to React. 

My biggest fear is that I end up in some crappy enterprise job, away from a major city; I enjoy building new tools and features, it's what keeps me interested in software engineering as a whole. Creating a product that reaches beyond the company I'm working for is important to me and I worry that I might not get that experience at a primarily non-technical company. 

Looking back at what I've just written, I hope I don't come off as super pretentious! I'm not very familiar with the tech industry outside the US and want to know what I'm getting into before applying for the internship program. "

9w9ap5,11,2018-11-11,Being managed horizontally or managed out?,exact-approximate,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/9w9ap5/being_managed_horizontally_or_managed_out/,"I started a job 2 years ago and this is the following timeline of events:

After a few months of working hard, but suddenly my supervisor is demoted voluntarily (this is what we were told) because he wants less responsibility. He resigned 2 weeks after. 

I would have expected to be the natural successor to my supervisor, but instead my team is merged with another team without consulting us, essentially eliminating the role I would have been promoted to. 

Weeks pass and I am forced to train my new colleagues and my new supervisor, handing over my responsibilities to them and not getting any new projects.

A couple of weeks ago the supervisor's manager suggests a new 'opportunity' to me to move team to another team; the new job requires skills which I already have but are unused. It is considered to be a better post in the sense that it should be better paid in general and the skills required are pretty difficult to find in employees.

The move needs to take 6 months where I would do 50% of my work in my current team and to train my new colleagues, and 50% of my work in my new team. 

However, the move comes with a caveat - I got to know through the grapevine that they are hiring a person for the job I would be filling. Therefore I would be somewhat redundant in my new job.

Over the past few weeks I've been spending a lot of my time handing over my responsibilities to other people and training them. I've asked for a plan and both my current supervisor, future supervisor and their manager have not given me one.

When I brought up the concern to the manager, he told me that I am the best member of the team but he is scared that I will get bored and leave the company and therefore he is suggesting this 'opportunity'.

The following thoughts are running through my head:

1. I didn't request the opportunity myself and while it is clear to everyone that I would like to take the job, I feel like it is only being offered to me because it is politically convenient, not because they want me to take it.

2. It is well known that my manager is actively involved in developing my new supervisor, and they have an excellent working relationship. I feel like he is ready to do anything to benefit my supervisor, even if it is at my expense. In a realistic sense, I am a bit of a threat to my supervisor's job since I can easily replace him, so having me magically disappear is somewhat convenient.

3. My new supervisor has made it clear to me that he wants myself or another employee to move out of the team to make space for an intern which he wants to hire full time. I have no idea why he has made it a priority to hire an intern, whose work is average at best. I have no knowledge of this 'opportunity' being presented to anyone else, and this was not an open discussion.

4. The new job should come with a significant wage increase, but no salary was mentioned to me

5. I still don't have a plan in spite of asking for one repeatedly. I am meant to spend a long time training other people and doing nothing of value, before moving to a job which I know little about.

6. The fact is that I am given the opportunity to move to a vacancy which is already being filled. This makes me somewhat redundant in my new job.

7. The manager (supervisor's manager) will be leaving his job within the next year, so even if all goes well I am not guaranteed to have the support which he says he will give me.

When I bring up my concerns, my manager (supervisor's manager) throws praise at me saying that I am one of the best in the department and he wouldn't want to lose me. Yet this opportunity came out of nowhere without any prior discussion.

Every time we discuss it, I am made to feel that my concerns are some sort of paranoid overreaction. I am trying my best to remain positive about the situation, and not assume that it is being done maliciously but I am finding it very difficult. I haven't been able to sleep properly for weeks and it is gravely affecting my mental well being. 

Yet, I have no one to rely on and I don't know what to do. I have been reluctant to involve HR as I feel like it would be a 'nuclear' option which would be akin to 'lawyering-up'.

My question is:
What can I do to protect myself here? Am I being managed out or is it just bad management of a horizontal move? What should I do?"

I am going to begin with a seemingly innocuous confession: I have sleep apnea. This boy has some weight on his bones, his tongue is a bit large, and his mouth is small- when my doctor first informed me of this, I thought it was hilarious.  I’ve been known to be a bit of a loud mouth and I love my stories.  

My snoring and intermittent cessation of breath caused my wife consistent annoyance and worry.  It was the fight we were always having and the reason I spent every night on the couch, she was tired of being driven from bed by my sleeping bellows and I was tired of feeling guilty about it.  She was a graduate student in her final drag of internship and, between her schooling and my health, we were both waiting for the stress to break. Then it happened: she was offered a job, the time and work were going to pay off—but it would require a move that left me with less time in my day and an even longer commute, meaning fewer hours for me to even attempt restful sleep.  Deep down, I knew my personal issues were making an already stressful situation much worse.  

We spent our weekends searching for a new place to call home. Something away from the busy street too close to trains that howled all through the night. Something with less shitty neighbors who were only separated from us by thin walls.  To help with the expenses, we decided to take on a roommate, a mutual friend who was looking to finally move out on her own.  We were still limited in our options, thanks to bad credit born from a decade of poor choices, compounded by my own lack of drive in learning the whole financial-side of adulting. My wife and I had moved in together only a few years after she finished high school and I had dropped out of college.  Buying a home was never really an option for us…and a lot of potential land lords considered our shit credit to mean we were too risky to take on.  

Our last weekend searching, we found an adorable cape cod set on a pretty idealistic street. The porch was a little shoddy, but the inside was painted in warm shades that changed room to room. There was one of those vinyl decals on the autumn red wall of the living room, proclaiming in an elegant font that “Home is where Love resides, memories are created, and Families are forever.” It was *perfect.*  It had space for all three of us and it was so goddamn charming. There was a half-finished basement that I could turn into my own bedroom/office and set up a futon to not disturb the ladies. I was more than willing to forgive the hideous mustard paint on the walls of the finished side. 

Waiting for the acceptance call for our rental application felt like the longest five days.  After we got confirmation; it was a blur of packing and internet shopping. Her new boss even fronted us money against her pay and helped us move. It was going to be a new chapter in our lives. 

That first night, after I struggled to assemble that black futon that contrasted so starkly against the cream floor tiles of the basement, I thought I noticed a curious smell. It was a light, sort of lingering smell of dampness.  That scent hovered there and clung to me as sleep came crashing down. I still couldn’t help but wonder why it was such a godawful yellow down here when every other room was painted in such idyllic hues.

I slept like shit. I felt like hell the next day. I chalked it up to fatigue from the labors of moving—as I said earlier, I am not the fittest guy. My commute was brutal for the first week, but I didn’t really have an inkling of the nightmare it would become. 

Over the next few weeks, my sleep quality declined again. I became temperamental, my weight began to increase steadily, and I was aware of waking a minimum of four times every night. No matter how much I tried, it felt like I was never getting a full night’s rest—and it started to show in my inability to stay awake during the day. I’d find myself sitting, maybe watching a movie or trying to get some play time in on a video game, and next thing I knew, my eyes would shut. I began to guzzle down energy drinks, highly caffeinated sodas, and coffee in desperate bids to stay awake with no real success. And when night would come, I still slept like shit. That lingering dampness that I detected in the basement seemed to only get worse as the weeks passed, too. I kept getting the sense it had crept in to floors above. My wife has a very keen sense of smell and never complained about it. Our roommate shrugged when I asked her about the persistent smell and gave me an odd look.

Driving was a daily struggle, I dumped caffeine in to my system and thrashed back and forth in the driver’s seat to stay awake. My reflexes were sluggish, causing me to get in to several car accidents. My marriage was hurting because of my inaction. I was a slave to sleep, and sleep was a brutal master. When I fell prey to it, those clips were consumed by nightmares. When I tried to be awake, sleep would pilfer minutes from me randomly. 

My life was being stolen from me.

So, I finally made the call, went to a doctor and got a sleep study done in my beloved—albeit, smelly—tiny house. That’s when I found out I wasn’t waking up four times a night like I had thought. I was exhausted all the time because I was waking up over one hundred times a night. I was lucky that I didn’t get hurt, or hurt someone, because I kept falling asleep at the wheel. I can say that sort of realization really fucks with you. I trusted the doctor when he told me it would get better, it just meant paying a bit more attention to my health and I’d have to start using a Bi-PAP machine. Unfortunately, this was going to take at least a few weeks, if not a month or two, to get setup for me, thanks to the complications of insurance approval. 

This was also about the time that our tiny house was beginning to lose its shine. That musty smell was always in my nostrils and my nostrils alone. It was late spring when the rain got particularly bad in my region of Pennsylvania. These were the driving, heavy sort of rains that stung your skin. The basement where I hid was flooding consistently, and the only thing more frustrating than three or more inches of water sloshing through the room was my landlord’s silence whenever we tried to contact her about it. I spent hours ineffectually mopping up that water. One night I sat on the edge of the futon, staring in defeat at the mostly-but-not-quite dry floor. I remember sighing deeply and then looking up at the opposing wall, my gaze drifted as my head started to nod. I could feel myself starting to slip back to my master’s grasp, barely registering the door to the unfinished side of the basement. 

I realized that I forgot the unfinished side. I would have to address that before I could lay down. That was the intention anyway. Instead, I felt myself slip into sleep, exhausted from cleaning and bathed in the yellowing, fluorescent lights set in the ceiling above me. 

I don’t remember what I saw in the nightmare, but I do remember the sensations. Broods of something round and damp expanded my pores, causing terrible pain as they ruptured. I remembered the smells—dampness mixed with copper and moldering notes. I remember feeling my nose being swiftly ripped from my face, like a perversion of that classic grandpa gag.

I woke up on the tile floor, blood from my nostrils intermingling with a film of stagnant water. Not far from where I lay were my glasses, abandoned in a shallow pool with the left arm broken and the right akimbo. It was so cold; my front was soaked, and the water was slowly crawling up the threads of my tee shirt and sweat pants. It took me another hour to lay down enough towels against the sliding glass door in the rear and mop the basement a semblance of dry again. I was so tired that my eyes were burning, begging, and screaming to be returned to the dark behind my eyelids. Sluggish and aching, I sat back down on my futon and snatched an energy drink from the end table. That was my fourth energy drink in twelve hours. After I chugged down that tart fluid, I could feel my heart rate quicken, thundering in my chest like a war drum. I threw the empty can on the floor, waiting for it to give me the drive to move. I remember looking to that door with determination—what I don’t remember is opening it just a crack. I could smell the damp, moldy air that drifted from that crack mixed with the remnant scent of the beverage in my mustache. I dragged my forearm across my bloodied nose, leaving a streak of crimson across my forearm. I was going to deal with that situation. 

Instead, I fell asleep. Again.

I woke up laying on the front porch, hearing the shingles of it being battered by the driving rain. I wonder if I had shivered myself awake or if the racket woke me. I sat up and sheepishly stood, my body wet and heavy with exhaustion. My neighbor stared at me from across the street, her bright pink poncho glistening in the downpour that met dawn. I was so incredibly ashamed. I showered before my wife and roommate woke, promising myself to never share that embarrassing story.

As I trudged down the stairs with our few remaining dry towels, I heard a terrible clatter from the unfinished side of the basement. One of my cats burst from the open door, streaking up the stairs past me as a soaking blur of tawny fur. I tracked the poor boy down and tried to soothe him. His golden eyes had a panicked, haunted look to them. He smelled rank and musty, like he had been rolling in a puddle outside of a dumpster. I was certain that he must have gotten somewhere he shouldn’t have been on the unfinished side, and he was going to need a bath after this. But first, I needed to deal with whatever wet, horrible mess awaited me on the other side of my room.  

 The unfinished side had not flooded. This completely baffled me. I checked everywhere: beneath the heating oil tank, the shelves of abandoned paint cans, and even around the furnace. There was no water to be found. I sighed, rolling my head back and looking up to the sizeable black iron pipe that was exposed above me. I half gagged from what I noticed: at one of the pipe seams I saw something that looked like a bright orange stalactite, about an inch long. It appeared to be mold, a collection of imperfect orbs glued together in a pyramid with a sticky looking clear fluid bleeding from them. I gagged again and fetched a flathead screwdriver from my obligatory-toolbox-that-I-never-use. With it I scraped free the alien oddity and plopped it in a paper towel that went out with the trash that day. I sent a text message to my landlord about both the mold and the third incident of flooding that month. 

There was no reply, which was par for the course.  

About two weeks later, there was another flood in the basement. Like the last incident, I lost hours in a losing battle against the indifference of the elements. But this time, I also found three more of those inverted mold towers across the same black pipe and scraped them away. I tried to call my landlord, but the voicemail I left was never responded to.

The dreams were getting worse. I never remembered the visuals, but I frequently woke up aching and with the distinct feeling of violation. When I looked in the mirror in those days, I saw a dead man looking back at me. Blackness consumed the area beneath my eyes, like drooping lids on a cartoon dog. My new glasses didn’t obscure them anymore. My skin was getting worse, it took a vaguely jaundiced shade and was becoming a mine field of these big, mean pimples. A shard of a molar (I think) came out as I was brushing one morning. It was more yellow than I thought it should be, even accounting for years of smoking. It just flopped out in to the sink, wearing a little bleeding cape of gum tissue and blood.  The depression that haunted my shoulders encouraged me to just shrug, pluck it out, and throw it in the bin. It didn’t shock me, I was falling apart in my early thirties after all. As a teenager, I would joke about how I wouldn’t live to see thirty. In a way, I had beaten my own expectations. My eyes constantly burned, I was irritable, and my skin always ached—like my pores were being constantly stretched past their point of elasticity. Living hurt and breathing was a labor. 

There was one more flooding incident, one more time that I tried to contact my landlord that may as well be on another planet.  That night I work up, naked, in our fenced back yard, beaten awake by the rain. My skin didn’t just ache this time, it burned and itched like I was covered in dozens of needle holes that went deep in to my muscles and tattooed my bones. I sobbed as I shuffled back in to my tiny through the sliding glass door. My new next-door neighbor definitely saw me, and I wanted to die from shame. 

I stewed, hidden away in the basement.  Flashes of the nightmare oozed through the uneven seams of my mind. It was one of those first-person nightmares where you are trapped in your body and just watch the horror unfold around you. Surrounding me was a dripping fungal forest, trees made of orange spores that reached up to a bruised sky. The ground was a loamy, wet surface that seemed to bubble occasionally like an untended acid burn. Alone and exposed to the heavy coldness, I was shaking. Pain started rooting in my skin, burrowing deep and digging in to bone. Seconds later, my skin was tearing itself apart—my gaze drifted down to my forearms with their distended pores. Erratically, orange pustules were pushing themselves out in a profane birth. My skin was bleeding, miniscule tears were drawing a map of horror across my body. Dozens of them crawled out of me, these thin spines blossoming in to full appendages of dripping orange spores. 

I drove the memory of the nightmare from my mind. I was both relieved and fearful when I felt sleep steal me away again.

Almost a month later, I finally got that machine. Well, machines—it turns out that one half of the device was effectively an air compressor that pushed an “oxygen drip” in to the mask that I was to wear from the BiPAP machine.  For something that was supposed to help me sleep, it certainly made one hell of a racket.  If you’ve ever had to inflate a tire at a gas station, imagine that noise; but ten feet from where you head lay for as long as you intend to sleep. 

 I hated it, the noise was awful; but it provided a consistent stream of air that forced its way in to my mouth and nostrils. I’ll tell you what, though, I had never slept so well in my life. The next morning, I woke and wasn’t irritable, which was very strange for me. The world looked different, like the first time I watched something in high definition. It was so bright, the images so sharp, my wife’s smile when I surprised her with breakfast was blissful. Finally, the film of sleep deprivation was pulled from my eyes and I could see all the life that I had been missing. I could sleep through the night again. My skin began to return to a more normal shade and the acne had calmed down. For the first time in so long, I was present, I was aware, and it was such a startling change. 

We started looking for a new rental, we had goddamn had it with the flooding and the mold. We stood a better chance in the eyes of most landlords now due to some restorative efforts to our credit.  I was looking forward to moving, I would be able share bed with my wife again should we find a bedroom large enough to facilitate my equipment.

The nightmares calmed as well, but they never actually left. They were different. I woke up clammy or damp most mornings with some irritation around the parts of my face where the mask sat. A few times, I found scratches in this region, like one of my cats had battered my face when I wouldn’t wake up to feed them. One theme that reoccurred was a wet, drippy voice, one that made me think of cold syrup. It would whisper to me only one phrase: “I miss you.” 

A few days after that, I woke to find ragged tears in the thin pillow of rubber where mask met my face. I shrugged it off, blamed my cats, and ordered a new set of masks from the medical supply company.  They arrived four days later, I was relieved when I could replace my tape patched pillow with a fresh one. This was the same day as the next rain storm.

The basement flooded a-fucking-gain, but this time my experience was different. My bare foot had slipped off the futon, the cold-water pooling on the floor shocked me awake and I heard it:

“I missss…” 

I sat up with a shot, feeling something sharp and thin drag across the exposed portion of my right cheek. Someone… no… *something* splashed back from me, producing a wet and alien cry as it crashed in to my video game console and knocked over my television. Still bleary from interrupted slumber I released the hose from my mask and awkwardly perched my glasses on my mask. My mind struggled to comprehend what my eyes were reporting seeing. 

There was a smear of bright pink and orange fluid splattered across the television and console, a thin stream of it was already diluting in the water that went halfway up my naked feet. Hunched against the door, not six feet me from me at the base of the stairs, was *something* that I still cannot properly describe. 

Years of dungeons and dragons make me want to say “goblin”, but that’s nonsense. It was maybe three feet tall and seemed to drag itself around like a wounded chimpanzee. It didn’t have skin, but rather a moss coat of a green that was both putrid and verdant at the same time. Its body was covered in vermillion pustules that looked decidedly like the eruptions that had burst from my skin in nightmares and three spindly fingers that terminated in scalpel thin talons. With wet, dingy yellow eyes it looked at me through a mask of clear, orange, and pink fluid that bled over a nose-less face. Charcoal-colored teeth filled it’s too-human mouth with thin, quivering lips. It shocked me when it spoke with the voice that had haunted my dreams. 

“I miss you,” is what it gurgled at me. It started to form another word, but flight or fight had taken me, and I had no intention of flight. If this thing had even the most remote connection to the ruin my life nearly declined in to, I was going to kill the hell out of it. I rushed forward, but it slither-crawled past the door and to the unfinished side of the basement. 

When I crossed the threshold, it was gone. I was alone, feet submerged in the gray water that was collecting there. I looked around, feeling a shivering twitch beneath my right eye as my nerves began to fray. Black and green mold spotted the concrete and drywall, mounds of pink spores quivered on support beams, and dozens of those squishy orange stalactites hung from the pipes. Yeah… now was the time for flight.

 I hauled my machines out of the basement with me, leaving the few other possessions I had down there behind. We left that morning, living out of hotels for a solid pair of weeks and entrusting our cats to our roommate’s parents. As far as my wife and roommate were concerned, I had discovered the mold issue had gone out of control.  We caught a break and got an apartment in a nearby complex that was willing to take the risk on us with our shitty collective credit. We returned to pack the upstairs, but only on dry, sunny days with no chance of rain. 

We had no illusions that we would be getting out deposit back, which I know is a strange thing to be worried about when you know that the basement you lived in was an actual mold hell. It was an even harder move, especially since we had moved so far from friends to help us. Unfortunately, my wife and I had a realization while we rested among the range of cardboard boxes when it was over. 

We were missing one of those tough, rubber storage containers. It had our wedding certificate, our birth certificates, pretty much every important document. I remembered where I left it and cursed beneath my breath. When we first moved in, I had put it on the unfinished side of the basement, in this sort of tan metal cabinet. In a poor bit of planning, we had moved out on the last day of the lease. I couldn’t risk our shitty landlord suddenly becoming present and showing up day one of us being out. I was afraid it would get thrown out, which was not a risk I was willing to take. 

I kissed my wife goodbye and walked out of our new front door. One of my new neighbors gave me a cheery wave that I half-heartedly returned as my gaze went up to the thick clouds clotting in the sky above. I could feel a storm approaching, an eerie wind caused the dread adorning my shoulders to flutter and quake as I jogged to my car. 

“This has to be quick,” I remember thinking to myself as I struggled with the lock safe on the front door and pulled out my tarnished key. I passed through the massive, picturesque kitchen where I made breakfast on my first clear morning. I regarded the living room decal proclaiming this to be a residence where “memories are created” and flipped it off. I looked at the shitty white door to the basement with a pregnant dread and threw it open after steeling myself. 

Holy shit, the smell was immediate and pungent, it plugged my sinuses like fresh cement and seemed to drag the air molecules down with it. The narrow stairs were dark, and I could feel my hand shaking as I reached for the switch. 

When flipped, that familiar dying light filled the basement and made the stairs visible. I had honestly expected the whole of the basement to be covered in black mold, considering the stench. I was very surprised to see the same, shitty mustard paint clung to the walls and had not been claimed by mold. I turned the corner and frowned at my futon, my broken television, the crushed can that sat near the middle of the floor. When I looked above the futon and to the bare wall space, I gasped out my fear in to the moldering air.

There were words scrawled on that ugly yellow paint. Big, uneven letters, all etched in a deliberate, spiteful hand.  They were written in black mold.

“BITCH”

“WHORE”

“WHAT ABOUT OUR BABIES” 

I didn’t hear the storm break. My gaze was so fixated on those words that the rest of the room became fuzzy- kind of like how it was before I got my sleep machine. My heart was beating so quickly that it was beginning to hurt, I tried to use that as an anchor to guide myself back to the present. 

But a peal of thunder did that for me, followed by the uneven rhythm of rain. 

There are two doors that led to the unfished side, both with the shitty white paint like the one at the top of the stairs. One is near the sliding glass door, the other at the base of the stairs. The one that sits at the base of the stairs is also where I had seen the Mold Goblin crawl in to previously. I opted to go to the door by the sliding glass, fighting to release the stubborn lock that seemed to only willingly open when I was walking in my sleep. The rain was crashing down now, so hard that I could hear it slamming against the roof I was so far beneath. I was feeling so heavy; my anxiety was clawing in my body like a desperate man still alive in his coffin. Wholly trembling, I reached for the door and slowly slid it open. There were fat motes of gray and black mold that puffed out of the doorway as it yawned. 

I wanted to vomit, I wanted to flee. The light groaned to life and illuminated the unfinished side of the basement. It had become just like my last dream. It had mutated in to a moldering, fungal forest with many shadowed spaces. From the black spine that ran above me there were dozens of those inverted orange spires, the floor covered in a mossy growth that seemed to lazily breath. I forced myself to move further in, heading to a tan metal cabinet where I had shoved the container in to on the first day of our move. When I slid the door open, the dull green growth that covered the floor ripped and bled bright shades of pink and orange fluid intermingled with clear. The container was right where I left it, unmolested by the mold. It was heavier than I remembered. 

From the corner, beneath the oil tank, I heard the voice that was somehow drippy and sharp.  It was followed by a chorus of smaller, syrupy chirps, chitters and growls- so many that I could not give an estimation.  I could see those glowing, piss colored eyes open beneath the tank. Then another pair and another dozen. There were a series of moistened pops as the stalactites began to slowly vomit tiny, bright pink and orange facsimiles of it. It stood with a kind of flourish, gesturing to me with those razor thin talons. This gesture was echoed by another three that stood half its size, their frames looked like a distended shadow of my own.  

My head was bleary with fear, I felt like I was choking on the musk of it. 

*They* were speaking, but I wasn’t listening. There was only word I caught from those goblin-like voices:

 “—home—”

With a predatory shuffle, they advanced on me. I may have been screaming, I’m not entirely sure. I kicked the cabinet over in their direction, cans of paint thinner and other chemicals clattering and underpinning the peals of thunder above. Two of the smaller ones popped in a spray of bright pink- like they were little more than balloons filled with gore. The largest growled at me, hopping on top of the fallen cabinet with its stumpy legs and slashing at the air. My sneakers dug in to the loam, tearing it away from the stone beneath as I fled. 

Panicking, I forced open the sliding door, flinging it off track and causing to shatter on the tile with a terrible noise that met another crack of thunder. I fled up in to the back yard, howling out my fear. The neighbor threw open his door, his judging eyes illuminated by a bluish flair of lighting.

I slipped and slid as I scrambled across the soggy front yard until I finally clamored in to my car, hurling the container in to the passenger seat. As my car growled to life, I could see my neighbor staring at me from his porch. From the tiny house, I saw a myriad of fat little shadows staring from the windows with their eerie eyes as they crawled on the panes. 

I sped off, tires struggling to keep purchase on the slick road. I would tell you that I’m never going back; but that would be a lie: 

I fully intend to burn that fucker to the ground tonight.

My skills  
I know how to build a pc I know what all the components do I know how to install different operating systems, I have an idea of how to network I've never had to build an entire network at one time. But I've been using packet tracer to build and fix Cisco networks for at least two years in school experience I know how to use the Cisco configuration terminal, plus I did layer 1 during my entire internship. I know how to use a windows server it is quite easy I know how to use win vista-10. I know about peripherals and a whole lot of other little things about computers I can even make my own website and find a domain to host it. I am not dumb either, I self taught myself how to build a computer when I was 14 and I also self taught myself how to port forward as well so my friends could play minecraft, I have opened virtual private networks to trick minecraft that my friends were actually playing on LAN as well but it was slow so i port forwarded instead. I made league of legends run on Ubuntu back in 2012 or something, although i had to do a lot of research and followed someones guide I still did it, Linux users will know what i mean when I say i ran a game on Ubuntu.  


 I know I am capable and I really want a job but I don't know how to get one my area pays very low wages I'm still looking I applied to a certain place in a certain town around where i live in the USA this job pays a little over 12 an hour I am really hopeful that I will get it. But that is the best opportunity I have I could go find another third party call center that works for Comcast in my area maybe, but I would not be happy there. I am a hard worker and I know I could do technical support or work as a help desk or something, but I want to get paid a decent wage like at least $20 an hour. I do not know what to do I want to work for field nation but I don't have the tools I am almost broke I am still going to college hoping I get my bachelors soon if I pass all my classes I can take some sort of accelerated online class, and I maybe will have my bachelors by the end of next semester I don't know what to do I really need some career advice or a nudge in the right direction don't be afraid to pm, I really do need the money and I am willing to work hard."

I started in EE and Computer Engineering and realized through anxiety induced health problems that programming was a much better path for me, in terms of both interest and what I was excelling at for the time. While switching to CS from EE did vastly improve my stress levels and quality of life, there has been one big issue nagging at me. 

**INTERNSHIPS.**

I made my switch to CS last year, and feel like I have been behind the curve due to internships. I did have an internship within EE and it is listed on my resume with a letter of recommendation from within the company. However, even though I have a solid employment history, and a relatively good GPA of 3.45, I have only managed to get one interview and one ""programming challenge"" style pre interview. The interview  I did have went horrible for many reasons and has left me with nagging anxiety as I mindlessly apply to internships through LinkedIn and my university's resource center. Getting constantly ghosted by companies can feel very defeating, and gets worse as the rejection form letters pile in.


&amp;nbsp;

As a student, what are things I can be doing to have a more fruitful hunt for internships? I don't think I'm being unreasonable in what I'm looking for - opportunity. I do not have my sights set on any one particular company. I don't have any real big constraint on what I'm looking for besides wanting to stay on the west side of the US (WA,OR, CA). One of the aspects of computer science that intrigues me so much is the width of projects I *could* work on, ranging from webdev, to systems, app development, and more. I want to see where it takes me and enjoy the ride, rather than try to force one specific path. Sometimes I feel like this view is not respected when applying for internships. Is this limiting me?


 I also feel like as I apply for jobs I'm losing to those who started CS as a primary focus sooner, those who grind leetcode endlessly, those who have extremely robust personal projects, and those that don't struggle with anxiety. How do I level the playing field?

First, a bit of context. I am currently finishing my Master Degree in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Business Analytics and Machine Learning. I have a bit work experience through internships in Data Science (Python, R, SQL...), quite a good knowledge of statistics/econometrics and ML fundamentals and currently learning better the unix command line / basic sysadmin.

However, browsing job descriptions, I realize I definitely lack the knowledge of the *full stack* of the Data Science pipeline. I still work more like a scientific researcher in a lab rather than a full-fledged data science in industry. I have no idea on how to put a model into production, nor do I know anything about tools frequently seen in jobs descriptions or used in real life such as docker, jenkins, kubernetes, spark, AWS beyond the basics ...

I ideally wish to gather a  comprehensive understanding of the elements needed to put a model in production from end to end. (e.g., data retrieval and processing, alerting, errors and exceptions handling, reporting ...)

What do you think are the *most important things* one should learn ?"

9wf1oe,76,2018-11-12,Quitting First Year Teaching,ashfrenzy,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/9wf1oe/quitting_first_year_teaching/,"Hello Reddit,
I am a first year teacher, and I am quitting. I started this year highly ambitious and optimistic for the year. I had a game plan and goals I wanted to achieved. However, something happened about a month and a half ago- I reached the darkest spot of my life. I had panic attacks every morning, I woke up every hour, I couldn’t eat during the day without getting nauseous, I could not focus, and when I wasn’t at school, I couldn’t turn my mind off from the pain I was experiencing. 
I finally realized that it was not healthy, and I went to the doctor. I was surprised when diagnosed me generalized anxiety and depression. He then put me two medications and an immediate referral to a psychologist. I knew I needed help, but I did not realize the extent. When I went to the psychologist I told him about my story.

Since the beginning of the school year, I had a strained relationship with my mentor teacher. We teach the same content, and he is our grade level team leader. I won’t go into the particulars, but we had a different opinions in teaching philosophies. He wanted us all to do the same thing, even though I knew it wasn’t wise for our kids or our own teaching styles. Our relationship has progressed to a point to where I can try to talk to him, but I get short responses. Then when, and only when, he decides to come talk, he wants to questioned me down to a point. Additionally, he accuses of me about talking about him when I went to other teachers for assistance (I literally went to an English teacher one time to ask about something I could do with an article, and he took it as an offense). 

If you were wondering about admin, they did get involved. However, they took a wish washy approach by telling me individually that they are okay with me teaching in my own style, but then told others that they liked our uniformity. Additionally, they have told me that they think that I am doing a good job, but then said in front of others the things that I did wrong without noting the things I did right. 

As far as classroom management, I am in abysmal spot. I have lost control of my classroom, and I have tried “rebooting” twice. I have tried reinforcing the good behavior with praise and I have tried using consequences- this however has not succeed. My kids are done with me as a teacher because I spent the first part of the year teaching in a way that is not suited for my kid’s age, and focusing too much energy into teaching a way without focusing on management. Now, they come into my class asking for when we will have a sub and how they now hate my content area. I have tried to add in my own flair to the lecture based teaching style that my mentor uses but my kids are still left hanging. I have had several days where I have cried in front of the kids, and I know that this is a serious, serious problem, and I shouldn’t do it. But I have gotten to a point where I can’t help it. 

I used to be the strong leader who had everything in control, but three months in the classroom has thrown that out the window. I used to be the one who had everything together and people came to me for support, but three months in the classroom has thrown that out the window. I have gotten to a point where I can not find anything good or even okay about my days- even the kids who I know that want to learn aren’t helping me stick it through. I now knew that I do not have the heart that I need to continue any further. It is not fair to the kids and it is not fair to me. I know that I may seem like a quitter- leaving after a half year- but I know now that teaching is not for me. I wish my internship shedded some more light on it for me, but I’m glad that I know now while I am young and I am free to move to other opportunities.

To those who made it this far in my post, thank you for reading. I wanted to add my own story to the long list of teachers who needed a way out. I hope my story gives a teacher the courage to move forward, like the other stories helped me move forward or maybe give someone comfort, knowing that they aren’t the only one. 

Thank you Teachers subreddit for everything you have done for me. I bid you farewell."

9wgeom,1,2018-11-12,Boeing or Home Depot for Internship?,Improve-Me,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9wgeom/boeing_or_home_depot_for_internship/,"**TL/DR: Go with Boeing for a better location but potentially worse work or Home Depot in a location I don't like but potentially better projects?**

&amp;nbsp;

Hi guys, I'm curious to get your opinions on which of these to go with. I haven't been able to find too much yet on this subreddit or any other forums.

Boeing:

* Pay: ~$28/hr; Good benefits (401k, health insurance, etc.); No housing assistance
* Job Details: Their Defense, Space &amp; Security division. I'm not sure what exactly I would be working on but the contact that I talked to said their focus now is on the flight and application software for these product areas. They work mainly with C++ and Python.
* Location: Huntsville, AL

Home Depot:

* Pay: $20/hr; No benefits; They said they aren't able to confirm details on housing yet. In the past they have offered housing assistance though (~$800/mo according to comments I've seen on both glassdoor and reddit.)
* Job Details: Wouldn't know the area or project until spring. I think they are a Java shop though which is what most of my experience is with.
* Location: Their Store Support Center or Technology center (which is brand new and seems pretty neat) which are both in/near Marietta, GA.

&amp;nbsp;

It does seem like I could work on more interesting stuff at Home Depot and I have heard they have been modernizing their tech stack recently. They would definitely be the more tech focused company I think (for example their interview was a technical group interview with coding and design whereas Boeing asked me only behavioral questions) but I don't know for sure.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think net pay will probably be very similar between the two. $800 seems plenty for a place in Marietta and after factoring in Huntsville's LCOL, Boeing's pay is probably comparable to $20/hr.

&amp;nbsp;

My biggest issue with Home Depot is probably location. I worked in Atlanta last summer and I thoroughly did not enjoy it. This one is in Marietta rather than downtown though but to be honest that doesn't make me feel any better about it. In contrast, I know some people in Huntsville and its seems like a neat, outdoorsy place in the summer (I'm pretty into running and cycling).

&amp;nbsp;

My biggest concern with Boeing is the likelihood that they use outdated practices or that I might not get much meaningful work at such a large, bureaucratic company. I'm not really interested in embedded software and would really like to improve my front-end/full-stack skills because that's the area I would like to work in after I graduate next year. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think I would want to work for either of these companies full time and I'm just looking to have experience and projects to talk about when I'm interviewing for full time next year. I wasn't given much work at my previous internship which made interviewing particularly difficult this fall. My responses to questions about my past experience were weak and difficult to come up with.

&amp;nbsp;

If you guys have any experience with the intern programs at these companies or any advice in general about which to go with I appreciate it. 

Thanks"

Why would they be taking so long for me? The only thing I can think of is that I told them I was interviewing at other companies so maybe they are waiting to see what comes out of those? But I don't know if that even makes sense.

I've received an full-time offer from PwC as a Risk Assurance Associate (IT Audit) and a full-time offer from Raytheon for their IT Leadership Development Program. Raytheon pays substantially more (13k more) and it's in a lower COL state (I reside in California). Benefits are similar so I can't really decide just from that.

Besides pay, the biggest difference is the work/life balance. From what I've heard and read, Raytheon is MUCH better as it has consistent and standard hours. With PwC being one of the Big 4, it's no surprise their hours are hell (people who worked there have told me about 15 hour days and being in the office until 2 AM).

Raytheon's program consists of 2 rotations (each lasting a year) performing a different job within IT at different locations. They heavily emphasize leadership and development training (really big for me, I want to go into management). Rotations are a mix of technical and non-technical roles within IT. I wouldn't really consider myself too much of a technical person, but I've been told to at least try a technical job before non-technical because, supposedly, starting in non-technical roles would limit you right off the bat.

I'm currently an IT audit intern (not too technical) and I'm interested in pursuing a career in this aspect of IT, so my coworkers and boss told me to try getting into the Big 4, regardless of their working hours. They say all I have to do is deal with it for 3 years, hit Senior Associate, stay a little more, and leave. They say afterwards I'll have employers chasing me because of my experience in one of the Big 4.

I'm the kind of the person that values time way over money, and I would take consistent and standard hours any day versus the hell hours that one would get from the Big 4. But maybe it's better to struggle and have no life for 3-4 years and then reap the reward at the end. I don't know, that's why I'm asking the bright folks in this sub. What would be more beneficial for me within IT? Is the name recognition of the Big 4 really worth it, especially over stability?

* Pros: ""Big 4"" brand-name recognition. Potential large signing bonus if I join full-time.
* Cons: No guarantee I'll do the work I want to.

### Startup
* Pros: Guaranteed to work on things I'm interested in. Small-company work environment.
* Cons: No signing bonus if I join full-time as far as I know (I think that sort of large bonus is uncommon anyway). No brand-name recognition.

###Some notes
* There is the possibility of me doing work at the Big 4 company in the field I'm interested in, but no guarantee.
* Both companies pay about the same.

2. If I accept an offer from one of the above companies now, is it worth it to get an offer from Google/Facebook later and just reneg? Or should I just apply for their full-time roles afterwards instead? I've heard anecdotally heard that returning intern new grad offers at these companies is absolutely massive (150k signing bonus, 300k stock over 4 years etc.)

9wj4ls,3,2018-11-12,"Left my (Honours, Australia) application kind-of to the last minute, worried my thesis topic is rubbish/unsuitable/impossible?",burntoutstudent13,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/9wj4ls/left_my_honours_australia_application_kindof_to/,"Hi everyone!

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit. I'm applying for Honours at a different uni to where I did my three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (field is literary studies).  I don't intend to continue to further study after this, but I feel that doing Honours will help my job prospects, especially as for me it will involve transferring to, and graduating from, a better uni.

Just before this semester, I took a year off and did some basic preparation for Honours, including reading books and articles, and thinking of a general thesis topic. So I had definitely given it some serious thought. I had planned to do a lot more this semester -- research, write my proposal early, etc. -- but I had to overload on credits and THEN a lot of other stuff went wrong including severe health issues. I managed to keep my grades up, but any prep for Honours fell by the wayside.

I'm worried I won't get my proposal done before the 30 November deadline, and, more concerningly, that my topic might not be good/suited to me at all, since I haven't had nearly as much time (or any time) to really workshop it in depth. I'm also having trouble finding a supervisor, as *multiple* different plans at different unis have fallen through due to people planning sabbaticals, etc (even though I didn't work on my thesis proposal much all semester, I did continue trying to find a supervisor. In fact, the problems finding a supervisor may be one of the reasons I haven't done much on my proposal...)

If this were for a PhD or a research Masters, I'd definitely delay applying until the mid-year or 2020 round, but I kind of just want to get my Bachelors (inc. Honours) over with at this point because I'm already kind of mature age due to the year off. And it's ""only"" Honours, a 12000-15000 word thesis over 9 months (plus coursework), so I figure it won't be a massive disaster even if there were some idealised better possible thesis topic out there.

How I'm planning to solve this currently:

1. Spend next two weeks intensively researching and writing my proposal, and hopefully realise it does have potential as a topic
2. Spend summer preparing for Honours (also have work and internship), especially from January onward; once I've submitted my proposal, I'll try to have December ""off"" a bit to rest and improve my health before diving in.

I guess my main questions are:

1. **How bad is this situation?** Should I be considering deferring entry because I'm worried my thesis idea isn't good and will ruin my grades/life by not being suitable or ""academic"" enough or being too ""academic"" and not something I can pull off? (I am an obsessive person, so I'm aware this worry could be unfounded, and that I could even be so anxious about Honours and transferring that I'm trying to make excuses to defer to ""prepare"" for it more.)
2. Can anyone suggest **anything more I could be doing** to improve this situation (other than the above)?
3. **What happens if I think of a better thesis topic** \-- it'd still be in the same general area, so same supervisor, but what if my idea changed a lot?
4. **From the point of view of academics, does this look bad**? I would have hoped to submit my application slightly less intensely close to the deadline, and also to have had fewer problems finding a supervisor, and also I had some issues with deadlines at another uni because they had a ""hidden"" internal deadline for finding a supervisor which was over a month before the advertised deadline (I assume this deadline was obvious to internal students, but it was hidden deep in a PDF on their website that I didn't notice until someone linked me to it), and also with providing academic transcripts (the main thing I have going for me is that my grades are in the 90s) since our final transcripts won't be released as eQuals (and thus available to other unis) until after the Honours deadline.

Thanks! :)

**TL;DR: Thanks to life circumstances, I kind of stopped thinking about my thesis proposal, and I'm worried the idea is bad/impossible and I won't realise this until I'm stuck trying to do it. I don't feel like this is the end of the world, as it's ""only"" Honours and maybe I'll be able to change my idea a bit. How can I improve this situation and make sure I start off my Honours year on the right foot?**"
9wj893,0,2018-11-12,Questions about getting the first job.,SCCCP96,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9wj893/questions_about_getting_the_first_job/,"I am looking for some advice about my first career job. I got a degree in game programming and have been focusing on rendering in my own project. So far I haven't been successful getting into the interview process at game studios and related companies. Recently I have been getting a bit further with some serious recruiters, but still haven't been past a phone screen. I was never able to get into any internships either in the last three years and don't know anyone that could give me a job. Annoyingly, that's the main advice out there for getting in.


First off, is it really worth taking any programming job as the first? Do hiring teams put general work experience from any position higher than taking the time to work on game-specific projects like renderers or games? I've been trying to weigh the benefit of having a lot of time for developing my portfolio of work and skills versus being tied up with a full-time job and possibly a long-term contract. I would think it would benefit me more to spend a few weeks finishing up this stage of my project and making a write up or two on it for new applications than to take an okay contract job now and not be able to use that project for an application for at least another 6 months.


If you have experience with the hiring process, what are the most important things that hiring teams look at when filtering applicants? I am trying to figure out ways I can stick out in the filtering process.


Finally, what positions or companies would you recommend looking into if I would want to move into game programming after my first job? Obviously, I'd like to just get into game programming, but I can only go so long without a job. However, I want to make sure that the job is going to help get me to where I want to go in the second position.


I'm getting closer to the point where I'll be pressured into taking anything, and I'd rather have the best information to make some decisions."

**I learn fast, work fast, and have great soft skills but I can't deal with the BS of working at a call center. I've worked in support roles in defense and healthcare but I think my background sucks. A remote position would be great but less human interaction and a job more independent in nature is what I'm seeking. What should I be looking for?**

\-----------

Background:

Graduated back in 2009 with a BS Industrial Engineering and an MS Tech Management degree which is more or less an Industrial Engineering one from my uni. I had two summer intern jobs from before doing design work and continuous improvement projects so I was looking to do more of that when I got out.

Landed a job after 10 funemployed months. My first was a temp position at a defense contractor. Low stress and easy so it wasn't bad. I worked with other departments to investigate efficiency issues and also designed some new instructions for the machines. After my temp period was supposedly up I asked about a full time position and they let me go, said they wanted someone with more experience.

Took another year to find a job, in that time I found voice acting and subsequently film acting. The rest of my time was spent applying for jobs while living with parents. At that point I didn't care much what I did for a career as long as it paid me to take acting class. Another agency called me and I took a 2 year temp job supporting engineers in running tests for R&amp;D. I ran tests, collected data, and trained others on how to run the machines. It was chill. Spent some time reading scripts, auditioning, actually getting other paid gigs with a uni nearby. Acting is fun and I've met some cool people, but it isn't stable enough to put food on the table at the moment. So two years went by, no full time job prospect at the company, and my contract ended.

After 5 months I had a rough patch and took a night shift job in desperation. I worked in a specimen processing lab doing 10-14 hour nights for 1.5 years. It was a nice easy job relatively low stress and little human interaction. I was fast and good at it so never really got talked to by management. The money and mandatory OT was nice since I was living at home but meeting impossible metrics and having such a strict lunch/break schedule sucked. And my social life was all fucked. I never want to work nights again.

I shifted to a day shift job same company but it was front desk checking in patients entering lab orders. It was less than 10min drive away and my coworkers were cool. Dealing with a high volume of irritated patients sucked but I stuck it out for a year then started looking. I really sharpened my Spanish at that job but the pay wasn't enough to make me stay and I just couldn't live at home anymore (it got crowded and because of family drama I couldn't sleep).

A friend of mine helped me find my current job working at an inbound finance call center. Better pay but farther away. People call us for help with using our technology, and also for general money questions ""what's in my account"", etc. I was able to move out to a quieter place to sleep just a few mins away from work. Most of my coworkers are cool, the building is nice, we get to surf the net, a cafeteria that serves $10 dishes at $6 quality and a company gym I neglect because of another membership. Insurance, 401k, PTO, all that jazz. I learned the job quickly but as I approach my 1 year mark I'm having more and more waves of depression and stress. You've heard about call centers before; most statements are true. The technology is unreliable even internally and I can actually empathize with callers when they say ""this shit doesn't work"" and/or ""why is it so difficult to do simple things"".

There are also times I feel like I'm alone on an island and calls just get transferred to me that I can't even begin to address. I'd call other departments for assistance but they just aren't equipped or straight up don't want to help. I want to be able to do and answer everything but there are too many things out of my control that I end up having to apologize for or explain. Having to explain other's fuck ups or the fact that they just didn't do anything is the worst. Unnecessary calls because people didn't take the time to read a few lines or calls that aren't meant for me that last 15 more minutes than I can bear. And there's always callers that in a sense would order a cheeseburger and want to escalate to management the fact they got cheese.

That said I'm quickly losing my sense of professionalism with the job and my patience is wearing thin when I'm here. My customer service filter is gone. If I wanted to be this jaded by life I should've just moved to LA to pursue film. The crazy thing is my numbers are solid and my only issue is tardiness. Having a deep calming phone voice helps too. I feel like the same mentality is oozing out to other parts of life as well. More irritable, cynical, brash, etc. Sometimes I feel like stress eating while at work or just starving to counteract my urge to eat under stress. Don't work at a call center guys.

So now I'm looking. I've been applying and that's depressing in itself. Haven't felt this undesired since I first tried Tinder. I feel like the gaps in employment are killing me and the fact that I have a Master's makes me look even worse. Having this job is still better than being unemployed but almost every day I just want to walk out. My dad said I should be a mail carrier. My friends suggest I should go into tech writing or learn to code. They also think I have the charisma to do sales (not reflected in the distraught post of course) but I don't think that's a good fit for me either. The last career test said I should be a writer. 

**I'm 32/M, single, no kids, no debt, and as free as the American dream dictates. I want to work independently with less human interaction and still have the means to eat, sleep, and pursue hobbies that I can't monetize right away (making music, funny youtube videos, standup comedy). What should I should look for for a day/survival job?**

And thanks so much for reading... if you enjoyed my essay and live in the greater SD area maybe I'll grab ya drink in a shady warehouse bar at a business district."

I am currently doing a cognitive science degree that specializes in computer science with a minor in political science in Montréal . I have somewhat of background in programming considering my high school teacher taught us VB and Java, then at my previous university the intro class was in C++ and I took a workshop ~20 hour workshop on the basics of AI in Python. I will be attending more hackathons, workshops and hopefully do tech-related internships. My relevant planned courses of study are:

- *Intro Calc 1&amp;2* (recursive functions and integrals)

- *Research Methods in PoliSci* (Intro to applied stats and we used some STATA)

- *Intro linear algebra &amp; geometry* (linear equations, matrixes, inverses, geometric vectors, Intro to vector spaces)

- *Intro to CS* (math tools, data structures, recursive and non recursive algorithms, abstract data types...)

- *Theory of probability* (sample space, cond probability, independence of events, Bayes’ Theorem...)

- *Intro to Software systems* ( C programming, system calls and libraries, debugging and testing, developmental tools, version control systems)

- *Algorithms ans Data structures* ( algorithm design and analysis

- *Quantitative Data Analysis* ( continuation of research methods, uses R programming)

- *Discrete Structures 1* (Quantifiera, induction, elementary number theory, modular arithmetic, recurrence relations and asymptotically, combinatorial enumeration, Intro to graphs, digraph and rooted trees)

- *Computational logic* ( propositional logic, predicate calc, prof systems, computability Turing machines... this is more philosophy )

-  *Artificial Intelligence* ( search methods, knowledge rep, planning under uncertainty, Intro to ML)

- *Applied Machine Learning*  (topic courses varies from year but neural networks, support vector machines, decision tress...)

- *Natural Language Processing*  (Intro to NLP)

I feel like I might be missing out on some important math and cs classes. I am also able to take a classes in my degree in: 

- *Linear Algebra* (vector spaces, linear operators and matrix rep, orthogonality, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, hermit Ian matrixes) 

- *Multivariate Calculas* (Taylor series, partial diff, directional derivatives, extreme functions or 2 or 3 variables, parametric curves, multiple integrals)

- *Programming languages and paradigms* ( lambda abstractions, type checking, functional and logic programming )

- *Algorithm design* (advances algorithm and analysis) 

- *Databases and systems* (Database Design, manipulation and implementation)

- other advanced cs classes in Computational Linguistics, Computational Psychology, Music Technology, Computational Perception, Computer Vision, Langauge-based security, Probabilistic Reasoning of AI, other CS classes

- other advanced stat or math classes

I do have space for some electives or I could do another minor in stats, translation, music tech, linguistics and grad school is on option too.

If anyone from a similar situation or if a non traditional tech professional (i.e no cs or eng degree) has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated!"

I have come 3rd place nationally in the ACM collegiate programming competition in my country(no idea if this is something grad schools would care about), hoping to get 1st next year. I have interned as a software engineer at two of the ""big 4"" (Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple) again no idea if grad schools would care about this.

I believe I am capable of really strong GRE scores based on my practice tests so this may help my case further. I expect that due to my focus on industry rather than research internships and due to my low GPA(relative to other candidates) I will not have many options for grad school. However, I would really like to complete a masters as I love theoretical CS (basically have perfect grades in my theoretical classes).  So my question is if hypothetically I got really strong GRE scores e.g. (169Q, 164V) and good LORs could I have a chance of getting in somewhere like Purdue University for a masters in CS?

Would really appreciate some honest feedback, thanks."
9wl8ok,1,2018-11-12,Renting an apartment and the company keeps changing the offers? (Please help),apartmentrenting345,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9wl8ok/renting_an_apartment_and_the_company_keeps/,"Hey everyone, so a little backstory on the situation (will be pretty general with details to retain confidentiality). We are a group of 13 college students that are planning on renting from an apartment building company in Chicago. We are doing internships while taking full time classes as engineering students, so we are very responsible and honestly won't have time for anything other than studying sleeping and going to work.  They have a $400 application fee, and the rooms start at \~$1050 (which is the lowest cost, but it is pretty expensive for the area in Chicago). It is a new apartment building, and I have been in contact with one of the managers there trying to negotiate a deal, because we have 13 people, and I'm sure they have space that needs to be filled as they will probably have a lot of empty rooms in the coming months, so they could make a lot of money off of this as well. We are only planning on living there for four months. They are also having a promotion, where if I refer someone that person gets $500, and I get $500, and this happens for every person I refer (if I refer 3 people, they each get $500, I get $1500).

&amp;#x200B;

So we planned on using this promotion, because either way they'd still be gaining money, or else they wouldn't have made this promotion in the first place.  Over the course of the weekend I have been negotiating with them, and before my call this was the offer we concluded on basically by Saturday night:

\-$400 application fee is waived for everyone in my group

\-$1050 rooms were brought down to $1000 per month, $1150 rooms were brought down to $1050 per month (there are only a limited number of $1000 and $1050 rooms we can get, though, and some people in my group will need to get rooms that were brought down from $1250 to $1150 per month). As well, the promotion (which I double checked on multiple times to make sure that it still works that way, and every time they have said yes, if 13 people sign up, I get $6500 and everyone gets $500, and we would all obviously split the money so that it's even for everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Come Monday I had a phone call with the manager of the company, because he was supposed to send me the written format of our deal, which he took a long time to do, but basically I called him about it because some things seemed off, and this is what I got from the phone call:

1. Over the weekend a couple $1000 rooms and $1050 rooms were booked, so we'll have less of those and more people in my group will need to go to the $1150 option
2. He didn't include the promotion offer in the original written email, and when I asked about it, he said he'll put it in the letter. I get the new letter, and it again seemed off, so I called him and he seemed confused as to why I thought I would receive $6500 and everyone in my group would receive $500, and acted like I didn't understand them properly over the weekend, and apparently the promotion terms changed because my group is so big (which doesn't really seem to make sense to me)...

&amp;#x200B;

3) He also texted me late tonight letting me know that since they are making deals for a month and a half from now move in, which they don't normally do, that we must all pay first month's rent within 24 hours of signing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone please tell me what I should do in this situation? He seemed to change so many things up on us so quick."

I told myself it'll be good coming right out of undergrad because i'll still be in that school mindset and the transition won't be tough. 

I'm currently studying for my first real exam this semester. I'm having flashbacks to studying endless and endless hours in undergrad on the same type of material, but I had such more motivation then versus now where i'm dragging. 

I don't know what exactly is going through my mind right now but it's along the lines of ""I just spent 4 years working my butt off, only to be doing the same thing but 10x harder for the next 5+ more years?"" The idea of still being in 'school' for an undetermined amount of time is stressing me out. 

I was always unsure about graduate school, but after doing undergrad research and summer research internships, I realized that I enjoy the research life, enjoy working towards that goal of bettering the life and health of individuals.

I don't have any intentions of doing anything academia-related in the future, but anybody I've spoken to have said that there's so much more out there in industry/etc for PhDs besides academia. My time here so far has been spent learning about all the different career paths that graduates went down, and that really encouraged me that i'll find my place. 

Maybe since I don't have a permanent lab right now (I'm doing rotations), I don't feel like I fully enjoy what i'm doing yet? That might change once I find a lab and PI I really enjoy. 

Though, I keep having the looming thoughts of what if I did something differently and would I be better off (like, doing a masters, certificate or professional program where I'd have a clear job/career at the end, or where the end is a set time). Also the fact that, yes I know what i'm doing right now is important for my future career, but I have started my career in this field in many other different positions and still be happy? Also having that FOMO feeling about not taking advantage of living a post-undergrad life.

Does/Did anybody else feel like this? Did it get better as time went on? Did you regret any of your choices? "

I am graduating this week with an AS in server administration with a 3.9 GPA. I've picked up the A+, Net+, and Sec+ certifications. I'll be picking up the Dell EMC E05-001 (Information Storage and Management v3) within the week. I've been poking at the Server+ and should be able to take it within a few weeks.

I have had one part-time internship in IT a year ago. I also have a BS in an unrelated field (Biology).

Where should I start? I've been applying for junior sysadmin and network positions, but no real bites. Same with a few desktop support positions. 

Is it possible to jump to sysadmin with this degree/certs, or should I be setting my sights on a desktop support position? Or should I suffer through a helpdesk position? What should I be looking at for desired salary for each of these positions so as not to scare anyone off? I'm located in the Midwest."

I'm 21 yo and part of a rotational APM program at a tech company in the Bay Area. My practice GMATs are usually 740+. I majored in CS from one of (UC Berkeley / UCLA / Cornell) and had worked at a couple of VC funds while in college + had some experience with product management internships as well. 

My achilles heel: I got a 3.11 GPA in Computer Science and my university happily grade deflates all engineering undergrads to a 2.7 (so I'm in the top 50% of my graduating class). 

I'm always hearing about building alternative transcripts / taking courses to offset the GPA. Assuming I can perform on test day, how should I spend the 3k/year educational stipend my work gives me to maximize my chances of MBA admissions success later? Should I invest the money in something else entirely or are courses the right play? 

I wouldn't get an MBA unless it were HSW, Sloan, or Booth just because of ROI. I might apply to Tuck, Yale, and Tepper but those would be more for fun -- actually matriculating there is probably a tough sell for me. Planning to apply when I'm 24-25, so in 3+ years.

Goal after MBA: Maybe return to VC or maybe just level up as a product leader. Haven't really decided my long term goal yet but I'm probably staying in tech. "
9wmmd6,1,2018-11-13,This past year my mental health has gone in the trash,jyaerargertt,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/9wmmd6/this_past_year_my_mental_health_has_gone_in_the/,"

3 years ago I had a thing with this girl down the hall. She was super into me and I was into her. About a month of being with each other passes by and out of nowhere she just stopped wanting to have sex with me and put me right in the friend zone. But I still had the sweets for her. Mind you I am very good friends with her roommates and I see her all the time.  Now this hurt but my mental health was good at the time and I can’t control how other people feel. About a year ago she started talking to me again. 6 months pass by we got intimate a couple of times, went on a couple of dates, I felt like I could tell her anything and she was my rock (probably the happiest 6 months I’ve had in college). One night I finally got the balls to ask her if she wanted to get serious about this. After a little bit of thinking she looks me in the eyes and tells me THAT I AM TOO GOOD FOR HER and for the second time the only girl who has EVER showed me any affection walked out of my room and wanted nothing to do with me. I still see her all the time because I am still friends with her roommates and every time I see her my mind starts to spiral knowing I can’t do anything to get this girl to Like me again.

This past weekend my best friend who is the only person who knows about my demons and I go out to the bars with these three girls. Within the hour my two friends leave and I am left with my best friend and the girl who I can’t get off my mind. The entire night this girl would laugh at my friends jokes, talk to him, dance with him, all while I’m standing right there trying to not listen to the terrible things I keep telling myself. I don’t blame my friend because he did his best to include me and him and I had a great time. But that night really set my mind over the edge. What really Tears me apart is knowing she can go talk to any guy at any time while I am stuck getting rejected by people who don’t even know me. I don’t know how to talk to girls. If I don’t think I’m attractive who else is going to?

On top of that I’m going into my 4th year of college and I just switched my major because I failed out of engineering. I’m still working the same $10 an hour landscaping job because I do not have the gpa requirement for any internship that I want. I can barely pay my rent with loans. My truck just racked up 6000 worth of repairs which I cannot pay for. I wake up and think I am a loser. I go to class and feel stupid. I go to work and bust my ass for nothing. I go try to sleep but the idea that no one truly cares about me keeps me spinning.

I told one of my friends about some of this and she started to cry telling me how sorry she was. As much as I admire someone who cares about me for that moment. The thought of someone feeling sorry for me or worrying about me almost made me feel worse. I am scared to tell anyone else. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, I don’t want people who don’t truly understand to try and help me. I don’t know what I want from any of this. So I carry on day by day putting on my care free joke slinging friendly mask to hide any hint that this is going on.

All while telling myself I’m a failure.

7 years here and I’ve got nothing whilst in another country I could’ve gotten a citizenship already. 

My baby’s father is planning to move back to Poland. Obviously this is my answer but I don’t think he wants us or me to come with him. That’s why I’m looking for other options. I can’t depend on him and at the end of the day I have to look out for me and my baby first. 

If he did wanted us to come with, I’m worried about finding a job there that would pay good or clashing with in laws.

If anyone could suggest me any country I would be able to move to easily. Language barrier is not a problem for me as I can grasp easily. I was considering Canada, Australia, Japan or any Spanish speaking country. 

Or if someone could hit me in the head and tell me why I’m going through all this trouble when I can go to Poland lol


Note: I did three years of BBA but didn’t finish my last year of university = didn’t get my degree. I want to complete it but maybe in the future. I’m learning coding now. 



EDIT: I’m from Philippines. I work part time now so I have sales experience in luxury brands, beauty, and telecom. I did get exp as an Intern in HR too. 
As for budget, it’s not a problem but I still don’t know how much I’ll be needing exactly. Maybe anyone of you can suggest on this.


P.S. we are married. Just to clarify. Someone commented (and deleted) thinking we and our kid are illegal here lmao. This country is very strict. "

So I think a lot. And when I think, it’s never really good. I never really got nervous about my future, I always told myself things will work out where they need to be worked out. 

However, this time around it’s not. I am nervous about my future, is this major\school really worth it for me? I don’t go to a great CS school honestly, it doesn’t suck but it’s not great. I have no prior experience\internships. I want to get a internship and I am planning on applying to a lot, however I fear it’s too late to apply or get accepted to any. 

I am a transfer junior, I came from community college. My GPA is not that great, however I feel it’ll get better this semester (slightly below a 3.0). I have no projects underneath my belt. I find it hard to think up of great projects to do. I have a lot of ideas but I feel they are simple and repetitive, so it is useless. 

I don’t know, can at least someone relate to me? I hate this feeling, just assuming that everything is gonna suck from here on fire ward. That imma have the same shitty grocery store job I’ve had for awhile now, I’ll jsut be stuck with it because I got nothing going for me and I missed out and sucked. 

Any advice?

The problem with that is that that's 6 months in. Will ""this jobs not for me"" even be a valid excuse anymore? Like why didn't I just say it now or something. 

I'm a little conflicted because it's not like they've treated me badly or anything. I guess I should just be more mature about it and suck it up but I'm just so stressed and I can't do this anymore.

What should I say when I quit? (And I guess I should be asking if I should even quit in the first place but it's almost a non question because I really don't want to stay but I'll ask anyways because I don't know the consequences)

9wr8tw,0,2018-11-13,I can't eat apples anymore,OnyxTheMadMan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9wr8tw/i_cant_eat_apples_anymore/,"I hate being late, like seriously I hate it but I cant help it, I get so caught up sometime just binge watching YouTube videos, it's the closest thing to therapy I've got, ok let me start with my name before I get into to much detail my name is Jason Stanfield and I work for the interspecies exploration association better know as IEA they are a privately owned company you might have heard of them. The company was made to ""advance the bettermant of mankind"" well that's what my boss Mr. Shaw a fiery haired ginger says. I recently started working there and let me tell you that place is weird like super weird, they should call it the interspecies experimentation association.

Like the other day I'm pretty sure I saw a four foot frog sitting down in a chair with its legs crossed getting interviewed by one of the head scientists, like I said weird, anyway I just started working there and I'm basically just a glorified intern, I mean I am an intern but when I signed up I though that it would be really cool to work for the secretive science place but it's just been a lot of work I thought that i would just be getting coffee for people but they got me feeding some of the ""specimens"" writing up bios for them keeping track of there habits I mean I am getting paid pretty good so it's not all bad but its just really tiring either that or I'm just lazy, probably both. 

After I started working there it's gotten pretty hard to sleep so lately I find myself just watching vids on YouTube until i fall asleep, so here we are I'm going to be late for the third time in a row and I'm about to get an earful from Mr. Shaw then I'm going to lose my internship, I realize all of this after I hit the snooze button on my alarm for the fourth time in a row, so I jump out of bed with a new found energy that I never knew that I had and slip into my cloths like I'm Mr. Fantastic. There was not nearly enough time for me to make a sandwich for breakfast so I just grab to apples and I'm out the door forgetting to lock it, I live pretty close to the IEA facility which makes it so much worse that I'm late but, on the bright side if I were to run I could get there in five minutes.

You ever heard someone say you cant even walk and chew gum at the same time well what they should have said is you cant run at full speed and eat an apple at the same time because that is really tough, but some how I made it through one apple without choking to death on the run to work, so I'm running and I turn the corner and I see the building, now I know that I'm screwed but maybe if I'm not exactly thirty minutes late I can somehow save my job, so I put a little extra speed into my run even though it feels as if my lungs are going to implode and my heart is about to explode and my legs feel as if they are on fire.

I make it to the door with two minutes to spare and I clock in, in victory I take a bite out of my second apple feeling the satisfying crunch then taking another bite, but as soon as I did I felt my teeth glide straight through the apple like a hot knife through butter and the off taste of a bad apple, I spat it out into the nearest trash can then I looking down I saw that the apple was in fact bad with the flesh being brown and soft but something caught my eye, because of how soft the apple was when I took the bite it tore out the layer that separates the part that you eat from the seeds, but instead of the telltale black apple seeds there was something like a thick white cloth type substance, it looked like it lined the inside where the seeds were.

Being the curious person I was I poked it it was soft and stretchy and as I pulled my finger back it stuck to it, then all of a sudden the stem of the apple was gone it had retracted into the apple, I gave a short yelp then dropped the apple it rolled for a bit then stopped, cautiously I approached it then pushed it with my foot so that the part that I bit was visible, when I looked the cloth looking thing was writhing and wiggling like something was under it then it tore and as I stood there staring at my apple eyes wide, as eight beedie eyes staired back at me.

I recoiled back stumbling as an ivory white spider untangled itself and came sprawling out of the apple, the entire thing was white except the eyes which where a pitch black like I have never seen and one of its legs which was shorter than the others and half an inch of it was brown then it transitioned upward into the ivory white, stunned I just sat there staring at this thing that was inches away from my mouth recently then it moved it a started crawling towards me, I just sat there like a deer in headlights horrified, this thing was massive it was about the size of a kitten I was trying to figure out how the hell it fit in the apple, then i realized I should be asking why the hell it was crawling towards me and picking up the pace.

Before I could even move to back up it was already crawling up my leg needless to say I screamed like teenage girl in a trashy slasher flick and ran around like an idiot slamming myself on the floors and walls to try and crush this demon spawn that was crawling all over my body with little success I might add, then I heard someone shout ASP-55 stop that this instant and as fast as this albino hellspawn was on me it was off crawling towards the voice, I looked up and it was Mr. Shaw he stood there stone faced staring at that thing what's name was apparently ASP-55 I don't know if I had hit my head one to many times or not but the spawn of satan himself actually looked sad at the fact that Mr.Shaw was angry at it.

Oh how could I be mad at you, I though I had lost you forever Mr. Shaw said come here. Then the thing crawling up his leg then onto his shoulder, now as for you he said this is your third day in a row of being late normally we don't accept that type of behavior but you did get back my beautiful baby so you have one more chance and seeing that she didn't bite you she must see something special in your future, what do you think of working here full time and as a bonus you will be able to live in the facility so no rent, no extra bills and you're a lot less likely to be late if you live here, ummmm sure but just keep ""her"" away from me please. 

What would have happened if she had bitten me, oh you don't need to worry about her this strain of spider is very docile and friendly they have great instincts to, but if she had any reason to bite you, um let me explain what would happen, her diet consists of apple seeds and seeing that apple seeds have trace amounts of cyanide usually it's not enough to kill you but enzymes in her body heighten the toxicity, so if she was to bite you would feel like you are instantly being suffocated then you would die slowly eyes bulging throat tight like a vice is wrapped around it you know the usual, it is a horrible way to go but like I said this strain is very docile so you have nothing to worry about, so why did she attack me I asked, how would you feel if something bit a chunk out of your bedroom and started poking around, I don't know but I wouldn't start crawling all over them, well she did so I guess she has more guts than you. 

So that's how it went I don't know why the hell I said yes to a full time job offer but I did they also made me sign this contract it was super long so I didnt read it, so that's about it I will keep you posted, oh yeah and what I learned from this whole thing is that I'm pretty sure my boss doesn't have a soul, not only is the guy a ginger but I saw him kiss ASP-55 on what ever is the spider equivalent of a forehead and if there are two sets of people on this planet who don't have souls its gingers and people who have spiders as pets.



Carter: Briggs why the hell are we staking out a IEA facility?

Briggs: because the place is fishy 

Carter: listen man I could be doing something a whole lot better with my time but instead I'm in this hot piece of trash you call a car.

Briggs: hey watch it man, this car is a beauty and we are going to leave soon just a few more minutes.

Briggs: hold on what with that guy, hes running like a bat out of hell.

Carter: he must be late.

Briggs: there's got to be something.

Briggs: what the hell why is he slamming himself against the wall like that and who's the ginger, the guy looks heated.

Carter: I will admit, that was pretty weird but not weird enough for us to do anything with.

Briggs: wait what the hell is that thing on his shoulder?

Carter: who's shoulder?

Briggs: the ginger here use the binoculars.

Carter: I don't see anything.

Briggs: the other shoulder.

Carter: I still don't see any- holy gigantic albino spider batman.

Briggs: ok we're going to just walk past how cringey that was and focused on the giant spider on the guys shoulder. That ain't normal, I knew that there was something wrong with this place.

Carter: so what are we going to do?

Briggs: we need more proof, then we can get a full investigation on this place and find out what's really going on behind those walls.

I already knew that I didn't stand a chance but it's just dawned on me that even applying would be a waste of $75. I thought my academics would at least bring me to the point where AOs would not throw away my application before even reading it but this just feels ridiculous. These essays are so beautifully written and sincere and I KNOW that I don't possess the writing skills or even the life experiences to write something even on par with them. Heck, I can't even write a decent SAT essay.

I've learnt not to be bitter about the fact that I was never afforded, and *could not afford*, the opportunities that these kids had growing up because I couldn't change my financial situation. Nevertheless, time and again, I find myself falling into this void of despair that I never got to take Multivariable Calc and Linear Algebra at CC or have a research internship or decent guitar lessons. 

I spent 10 years at a school with no clubs, extremely egoistic teachers and uninterested kids. My attempts to start a Computer Club were shot down by the principal. When they made me CS Secretary in sophomore year, my friend and I planned a CS fest with over 8 competitions including a Quiz Bowl, programming, A/V editing and what not, which the principal had agreed to fund initially. Should've learnt not to get my hopes up, because she trashed all of our plans after everything had already been arranged.

Things haven't been much better at my new school. All of the clubs I was interested in rejected me since they usually don't let in new kids. I don't have the resources to do many ECs outside of school but I concentrate on the few things that still bring me joy: programming, playing my guitar horribly and reading. I'm nowhere near qualified enough to be able to make it to camp in the CS olympiad.

But she doesn’t need help. Maddie Weiss is capable, ambitious, an amazing sketch artist, and, truth be told, already on par with some of our best sculptors. She goes to Pace University and if she stays with our department through her graduation we already decided to offer her a fulltime position. 

Another thing about her is that she always wears one ear bud from an older classic iPod, the one with the wheel on the front. She doesn’t listen to music at work but she told us, over drinks at this crappy Irish pub, that she used to have a much younger brother who struggled with severe autism. When the brother would have an episode she’d be there and put in the earphones so the boy can listen to the theme song of this old cartoon show called Animaniacs. But then the brother died and now she keeps the headphones to comfort her and sometimes, even, she plays the Animaniacs song for herself when she gets stressed and anxious.   

Now I understand what I’m going to do is wrong, but I question how wrong. What happened to me, what’s going to happen to Maddie - invite her over to dinner, tie her up, and wait for the storm to come – are within the rules that were given to me. I’m playing within the parameters that seem to be allowed by the universe. There are no laws anymore. I’m not concerned with police. I’m not concerned with ethics. Those apprehensions were shattered when the great storm came and took my Katie away from me. Shattered like my heart into such small and fine pieces that you’d cut yourself if you tried to pick them up. 

The idea came to me when I learned from Robert, a co-worker, that Maddie might have a little bit of a crush on me. Nothing major. The way one develops a crush on a tutor or a counselor of some kind. And to be frank, I want to use this. 

“How’s school going?” I ask her, leaning on her desk. My arms are crossed. I’m wearing a button down shirt that Katie always said made my arms look big. 

“It’s going. Honestly, coming here is the best part of my week. I feel like I’m just spinning my wheels when I go to my actual courses,” Maddie says. She turns from her work station to face me. She’s wearing a t-shirt from Fright-Rags. It’s for that movie House of a 1000 Corpses. It hugs her form nicely. Her chest is bigger than Katie’s and her waist is smaller. Katie was thin, a petite girl who reveled in being, as she put it, fun sized. But Maddie is different. There’s a different sexual quality from Maddie. Her breasts. Her hips. She wears black jeans with her horror shirts. She wears Doc Martens wherever she goes. And she carries a bright yellow messenger bag with hundreds of pins and do-dads on it. 


I’ve always been bad at telling when girls liked me. Katie had to spell it out for me. But after Robert’s tip, I think I can see it. I can see it in how Maddie looks at my lips when I talk. How she inhales and waits for me to speak. How she fumbles with her hair tie and blushes when I compliment her work. This makes me feel powerful. 

“What are you doing Friday night?” I ask. I’m calm. I’m collected. I have not been aroused by anything since Katie left. I don’t get nervous or sexually clouded when I talk to Maddie. I feel like I’m playing chess. Like I’m rigging an intricate trap to ensnare her like a rabbit. 

“My friend want’s to see a show. But,” she picks up what I’m putting down. “I don’t think I’m going to go.” 

“You should come over to my place for dinner. We can go over the sketches and talk about the new Savoy project. I think it’s going to require a lot of forward thinking.”

I can sense Maddie’s excitement. She smiles. She tries to play it cool.

“That’d be cool. I’ll come over.” 

“Katie my, uh, fiancé, will make some food. She wants to meet you. I’ve showed your stuff to her.” 

“Sounds great. I wanna meet her.” 






The stainless steel XXL dog cage costs close to $300 dollars with same day shipping. This is fine to me. I assemble it in the attic next to the garret window that’s still broken. I buy duct tape. I buy rope. And for a moment I consider buying mickeys to put in her drink, but for some reason that takes on a different color. Something inherently sexual which is not what I’m going for. I need something practical. 

In the mirror of my bathroom I practice hiding a hammer behind my back and swinging it fast. “I’m so glad you came, you look,” and then boom. I swing the Kraft Tool drywall hammer across the face and, ideally, land it right above her eye brow. Send the brain reeling backwards. Catch her in my arms as she goes limp. 

I spend the rest of the work week smiling and talking to Maddie about some made up bullshit recipe that will be served on Friday even though I have no plan on even turning on the stove.







On Thursday night I get phone call and it’s from Father Rodriguez. I don’t know how he has my phone number. I don’t know what he wants from me but when I hear his voice I feel this immense pain and burning in my blood. Like someone is sticking needles under my nails. 

“I’m sorry about your wife,” he says. This is the first time I’m hearing his voice since I met him months ago. It sounds smooth. Old and leathery. Like he’s lived for 100 years and will live for 100 more. Like he’s crawled from beneath this paper earth and in him has an immense smoldering that will go on for eons.  

“We never married,” I correct him. For some reason I can feel an immense weight on me. I’m sitting in the attic checking the durability of the cage I built. I feel like sandbags are on my shoulders. With each word he says I feel nauseous. Like he’s whispering evil into me. 

“I hope you understand that I don’t decide who the storm takes. It’s not my responsibility. It’s just what happens. And it’s good that it happens. It seems like it’s just for this town. Our small little hamlet at the edge of the country. But it’s for much more. Much much more.” 

“Okay,” I say. “I want to come over and see you.” 

“My son, I’m not around. That little rectory is for my off days. I’m everywhere. Always on the move, you know how it is.” 

“People are suffering.” 

“They’re suffering so the world doesn’t. That I’m sure you understand.”

There’s a pause. Behind him it sounds like the ocean. Like I can hear seagulls squawking. 

“I know what you’re planning,” he continues. “I think it’s brave, if not a little short sighted.” 

I say nothing.

“Did you ever follow up with that Henry Monk? That nice man who got his son back?”

“He moved away,” I said. I feel light headed. My breathing is shallow. 

“That’s right. He did. Moved south. Carolina’s I think. I still kept tabs on him. You know, I always have to make sure townsfolk behave themselves. Do you know what happened to him?”

“No.”

“He got his son back. But his son was different. Touched. You see, the storm taketh but the storm does not giveth.  Not really, anyway. The boy had it all in his head still. Everything he experienced. Everything he saw. It was all still in his head like a water balloon about to explode. Do you know what happened then?”

“What?”

“They’re both dead. Henry. His son. I don’t know the particulars. If the boy, with his head so full, turned on his father. Or his father couldn’t stand to see his son like that anymore. Talking to the moon. Seeing more colors than everybody else. It’s a shame.”

I say nothing. There’s a drone from the other side of the phone. I feel like I want to vomit. A cold sweat is forming. My eyes begin to lose focus.

“I don’t pick. The storm does.”

“Okay.”

“And what of the boy Henry Monk stole? Stole in the cover of night. Took to the rain. His parents were devastated. His family, lost and inconsolable.”

“Like he was. Like the Bauman’s are.”

“So your empathy has entirely run out, huh? Swept away in the wind.”

I say nothing. 

“Katie was her name. Your fiancé. She was sweet.”

I say nothing. 

“I hope that whoever you’re offering isn’t a Katie to someone else. Sometimes we must suffer so that others don’t. I can’t think of a worse sin than passing off pain. Goodnight, my son.” 

And then he hung up and I passed out in the attic. 







It’s Friday night and I’m waiting in my car for Maddie’s train to come in from New York. The rain has arrived. Small droplets on my windshield. I can see static in the sky. Lightning shoot among the oncoming clouds. Thunder rolling far away, coming in from the Atlantic. 

Maddie is somebody’s Katie. I know this. This is indisputable. She probably has some thin, young boy waiting for her back at Pace. Or a best friend that wants to go to concerts with her. Or a family that can’t wait to see her for Christmas break.

But why am I the one made to suffer? Why can’t her family bear that cross? This pain and responsibility was thrust onto me, and I can’t handle it. I am weak. I am scared. And I want my Katie back. I’ve decided that the story Father Rodriguez told me about Henry Monk and his son was a ruse. A bluff crafted to keep me from breaking the system. Henry and his son probably moved away and are happy.  

The watercolor in my head has spread. The deep, rooted sadness in my soul is growing, reaching out and coiling around my veins and my heart. Blossoming into my brain and clouding out any other desire. I miss Katie so much. I need her so much. If this doesn’t work I’ve decided to kill myself. To hang myself from the garret window. 

I see the train come in. I flash my high beams as Maddie runs from the stop, covering her head from the rain. She’s wearing a dark coat with a gray scarf. She smiles and gets into the car and we drive to my house. The rain comes down harder. 

“I’m starving,” she says. And I nod in agreement. 






When we enter the house I expect her to immediately see how I live. See the living room in disarray, a comforter on the couch. Empty beers and bottles of Jim Beam lying around. I expect her to see the padlock on the bedroom door where the floor cracked. The kitchen dark and empty with no sign of any cooking. But she doesn’t. Instead she turns and takes off her coat and her scarf. 

She’s wearing a black skirt with black socks and Doc Martens. She’s wearing a type of dark yellow sweater that scoops low and shows her soft white cleavage. She then digs into her yellow messenger bag and takes out her sketch book. 

“I thought of some super fun things we can do if we get the animatronics guys on board,” she says. 

And then I realized the truth. She doesn’t think of me that way at all. This is a business move for her. Solidifying her work. Being validated for her talent. She doesn’t want to fuck me at all. Which is fine, we weren’t going to anyway but now I’m disgusted with myself even more. I feel the cold sweat I felt earlier when Father Rodriguez called.

This is somebody’s Katie.

“Hold on one sec. Sorry for the mess,” I say. I move to bathroom. I go to the counter where I left the hammer. I hold onto it and come back. 

“It’s fine,” she says. She clocks the couch bed. “Did your girlfriend make you sleep on the couch or something?” She smiles. 

“I’m glad you came,” I start, clutching the hammer behind my back. “You look really good.”





She’s now tied and gagged in the XXL stainless steel cage. The rain comes in from the garret window and the storm is almost upon us. She writhes slowly in pain, still dizzy from the impacts of the hammer. I botched the first one, just glancing off the side of her head. She stumbled back into the front door and I had to grab at her sweater and pull her in for the second blow. 

She’s crying and begging for help – or at least I suspect she is. I can’t hear her from the duct tape and as the thunder grows louder and comes closer I think even if she really did scream for help nobody would come. 

The rain coming in from the window and is falling through the cage bars. Her hair is getting wet and her make up is running. 

I say, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” And I try to explain that I’m doing this to save my fiancé. And with that her expression, for only a moment, goes from fear to confusion. Her eye brows furrow and she looks at me. And then she starts trying to scream again. 

Then I try to make things better. I go down to her bag and grab her iPod. I run up to the attic and I put the headphones in her ears. I put on the Animaniacs song for her, as a gesture, mostly. And she takes it in and starts freaking out even more. I’m too in her head. I’m the smoke machine. I am dark dense fog. 

I leave her in the attic. 

I’m now downstairs. Thunder cracks. The power has just gone out. It’ll be any moment but I grow tired. I suspect that the rain water has wet the duct tape enough because now I can hear her screaming for real. She screams and the wind howls and the house breathes. 

“Please!” She screams from above. There’s someone in the attic with her. Something. “Don’t touch me! What the fuck are you!! Stop!! Let me go! Let me go -

I hear her screaming until, all of a sudden, she stops. And then the wind howls louder. And I close my eyes.

- algorithms and data structures 1 (4hr lecture + 2hr lab)
- object-oriented programming (4hr lecture + 2hr lab)
- web development 1 (online class + 2hr lab)
- calculus 1 (4hr lecture + possible 2hr lab (depending on which section I can get))

I spend 1-1.5 hours in the gym Monday-Friday, which I want to continue doing.

I was also offered a contract to work in a help desk position 15-20 hours per week. It'll be in the same college I'm at so I don't have to worry about commuting.

The job pays well, which would help me with tuition and living expenses. I don't need it for experience. I've done an 8 months internship in that role already and it's not something I want to do as a career. I'm trying to become a software developer.

I also need to work on personal projects for my portfolio.

My question is, will I be able to work part-time with that course load? I'm worried with everything I want to do, it will be too much. I don't want my GPA to be hugely impacted.

Should I reject the job offer, and focus on school + personal projects? Or is it doable?"

I have been working in my current position for 7 months now, but I really would like to move back to my home state as this position is just very unchallenging/boring, the cost of living is much higher, and I would love to be back with my family and friends. 

In terms of my resume I have had several internships + my current full time role, a lot of involvement and leadership positions during college, and I graduated with a 3.9 gpa. I know that trying to switch careers after 7 months is probably one reason I am being dinged from the jobs I am applying for, but I am also sure the fact that I am applying out of state doesn’t help.

&amp;#x200B;

\- and honeslty, I feel a bit bad because I feel like I a mincapeable of writing it in a way that you would understand it right away.

&amp;#x200B;

let us say, Living within Monaco is the end goal.  this may be accomplished by earning money where I live, then move, or by taking an education inside Monaco. I feel for the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Denmark.

Tomorrow I am going to call to see if I can meet in person with a councellor for a school. This school is a shorter form of university, ap graduate.1,5 years and ½ a year internship.  it is to  financial economist (soldier in a bank or real estate company). they start in january.

I am worried if I am ready. I already spoke with my local university about geting a bachelors degree in something like business economics or commercial law. (..Which could lead me to a masters in IUM, see below)

But what I really want is a bachelors at IUM, monaco. last year I was down there visiting for open days. Ideally a BSBA or a BBA.

On paper I should have everything ""passed"" to allow me to theese three venues. I do not have the grade point average but should be able to work my way around it with letter of motivation and more.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Denmark, Europe. you get some 25 months of tax-paid money to study an undergraduate.  (called SU). But you have to get in. if its a part of Norden, the tuition should be completely free. Norden is Scandinavia. since Denmark is also part of eu, some additional things help out. I can take my  tax money with me to IUM because of collaborations with france. I'd have to live in Nice and study in Monaco.  plus I have some savings-

&amp;#x200B;

Basically there are three schools. EA Dania, BSS Aarhus university, and IUM - Monaco.

1. at EA Dania, in Silkeborg. starting in January 2019. there is one education: FInancial economist. its an education to become bankteller or real estate seller or financial advisor. all in one 2 year [education.](https://education.in) inside that is 3 months year internship.classes include commercial law and private and commercial finance advising.  but it is the laws within Denmark. and the tuition is Danish. I kind of want an international education, but I also don't want to fail anymore in my life. They start in January, and its almost guaranteed that if I apply, I'll get in.  I already have higher credentials than required,however those credentials are 5 years old. so on paper IM good but I haven't studied ofr a long time.

I CAN use this to get into the two oter possibilities. However this half year does ""eat"" off of my tax-paid financial pocket money tickets( SU).

application rely on letter of motivation and cv, relevant classes but grade point average is valued to a lesser extent then the following two options.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  At BSS AU, a bachelors degree  3 years. there are several possible bachelors degrees. Bachelors degrees are more widely recognized internationally, and could increase my chances of getting into a bachelors degree in Monaco IUM. Alternatively, I did intern for two days at a small but succesful wealth management firm. Anecdotally, I know a former classmate who was super smart verbally, and he is (alledgedly) employed at an esteemed wealth management firm in Aarhus.

Application rely on grade point average mainly, and secondly how I spent the last year, if I recall on  a Resume. Since my gpa is significantly lower, I'll feel like I have to get into option 1 for half a year, just to show that I have actively been someplace forthe last half year upon applicaiton and starting, in August 2019. They have degrees in various business related genres. from accounting , to commercial law, to finance, to international business etc.  they mostly have degrees in danish , with a lot of textbooks in english. they have a few degrees in english.

The thing is, I kind of burnt my fingers by having to drop out of bachelor in Molecular Biology. I had forgotten all chemistry, my work ethic went 100 to 0 real fast because I felt like I couldn't keep up.  And I couldn't. This doesn't mean that the other options will have guaranteed success. at all. its just hta I had a bad experience with Aarhus University. this is a different department but It will still be just as rigorous I think.another thing. I need to take ahistory high school class in order to fulfill acceptance criteria. It is a bit bogus but it has to be done. It might be possible to take venign classes or summer holiday classes so as not to interfere with the ½ year at option 1.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  BBA at IUM. after 1 year, if you have good grades, you can take on additional classes to get a BSBA. its 4 years compressed into 3 years. they start january and summer. the thing is, if you start in January, the programme is just last summers class, but you have to play catch up with summer classes and evening classes. If I want a BSBA, january is out of the question. On the other hand  I also would like to start as early as possible. I am 27 years old. a student councellor mentioned that most students should have a masters BEFORE age 25 in order to get a prper internship in Monaco. So I am already some 8 years late. This combined with my low gpa are the main things that hinder me.  The tuition is in english, and the structure is american, not european. Which means I have to work to get grades translated. I have already collected some stuff,  but I haven't gotten an official translator company to do this for me.

French: If you want to live in Monaco, you have to speak French. its a requirement. I already had french in middle school, and through Duolingo and an online tutor, I have managed to climb up from level A1 to B1 in CEFR.

English: I already wrote this post which should illustrate my proficiency. fluent if not native. ( so level C2 or C1). in Denmark we learn english at an early age, plus I have dated a girl for a year in english, and spent some summers in Canada and US. my official proof however, is some 5 years old, and not 2 years old. however this might very well be overlooked since I am danish and not from, say, Thailand or mozambique or Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

last year I made some calculations to fund my education.

3) IUM  living expenses and tuition would be funded with my own savings ($17K) and student loans from Denmark, and Student money ( SU). Opposed to the other options, I would with certainty be in debt upon graduation, but the actual funding while studying is covered. I'd have to live in Nice, and commute very very cheaply to Monaco,

or at least, according to last years calcualtions I should get some moneyfrom my father. tax-exempt pre-inheritance. I didn't get that because of a fight we had. I learned my lesson. But still, I am confident that I can find a way to pay for it. If I start as early as January I should still have 1,5 years to apply for European grants like Erasmus Mundus or other.

&amp;#x200B;

1)EA Dania  is the ""meh"" option. Its the wisest in terms of saving money, but might also be a bit more worthless because of its lacking credibility.  It is closest to my father, with whom I currently live. we run a tiny ranch together.  and it kind of works. I don't have to pay rent. and with SU money, I'd be able to save a bit more up for IUM. though I'd still haveto waste money on transportation and food and books.  this all eats into the actual paying for IUM. since it is in Danish, it might still, If I am lucky, lead to workign for a welath mangament firm. its just.. I don't like living in Denmark.

&amp;#x200B;

2) is a bit further away, but I can still live with my father. the tuition is also free since it is in Denmark. however, I think we need more books. and a tighter schedule might force some bought lunches. you can only mealprep so much.  IF I get into this and actually graduate, I might have a real chance at getting into the wealth management firm I Interned at.

Between 1 and 2, the public transportation time surprisingly, ends up beign the same. an hour to and from school. I could also buy a workdays only- apartment room. which would pay for itself since danes get a SU raise, if their postal adress are set to "" not living with parents"".  Regardless if they pay rent to parents or not.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I need to list application deadlines, obtian proof of courses from the molecular biology. I need to re-write the English CV, letter of motivation too.  I als oneed to write my danish cv.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, what is your impression?

Am I overextending myself? Sometimes I think to myself that I am too old. I should just give up. But that is not an option. So I try to work towards a worthwhile goal. and To me, living in Denmark is not worth it. Monaco. now that is something. A thing that bugs me a bit is that even if I get into IUM and pass, I'll still have lived in Nice while studying. not Monaco. this might derail me a bit in my goals. as opposed to workign towards becoming wealthy and then moving to Monaco afterwards. Somehow I just don't see that happenign here in Denmark. our taxes are way too high. But if I end up not being able to afford the super high rent in Monaco, it is all for nothing. "

&amp;#x200B;

I recently passed a coding challenge with a company that I really want to get an internship at. The challenge was not very difficult. The questions were fairly clear, but I was only able to get a brute force solution for each question. I was surprised, but they have contacted me and I am scheduled to interview with them in 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

To prepare for the interview I have been going over leetcode as many people in this sub suggest. I have never really done this before and I was surprised with how much I struggle with the questions, even many of the easy ones. I know that I am going to be asked medium-level questions, and I have found very few of those that I can complete.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm really struggling with is that I don't know how to improve when I come across questions I can't answer. What do you guys do? Do you look at the given solutions and just study why they work? Do you go back and study DS&amp;A? I have been going over solutions when I get stuck, but I don't feel like it's helping me to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

I also took my Data Structures and Algorithms course over a year ago now. While I did very well in the course at the time, I find it very very difficult for me to do basic things such as navigate a tree or do anything related to graphing.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you folks have any resources you can suggest in terms of interview prep that has more guidance than leetcode? Or something I can use alongside it so that I'm learning more as I go?

&amp;#x200B;

I really want this, I just want to be able to prepare for it in the best possible way.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."
9wta3f,1,2018-11-13,Company I interned at asked me why I would consider other companies?,tegehdeeldee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9wta3f/company_i_interned_at_asked_me_why_i_would/,"So just talked to the HR at the company (medium sized) I interned over the summer. They said they'll only give me a week to make the decision, but I asked to extend it because I have other interviews, and they were surprised.

The HR just asked me why I would consider other companies if I interned at the company, in a bit of non friendly way. I literally had to tell them that it's logical for me to apply to different companies even if I liked the internship. Don't get me wrong, I like the job, the projects, and my manager. The issue is that the HR thinks the market starting salary for new CS grads is $75,000, so they gave me an offer in the $85,000 range. I told them that was too low, but they said it was average. I would have been fine with this offer, but I feel really undervalued, especially considering it's lower than the average starting salary of a CS grad from my university (target school) is $96,000.

This is despite me exceeding the expectations of the internship, where I was being even more productive than my other senior engineer co-workers working on the same project. I was innovative, energetic, motivated, produced high quality code, and picked up concepts extremely quickly. I'm not trying to brag here, I'm just saying I felt very undervalued for my skillset. The other companies I'll be interviewing with give a total compensation of $130,000 - $160,000 a year, and I have an interview with Google coming up that I've been prepping for months.

Should I feel bad for waiting for other offers that pay nearly twice the amount? I shouldn't right?"

9wvhqx,1,2018-11-13,How can I avoid failing at getting a career again?,ThatBroadcasterGuy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9wvhqx/how_can_i_avoid_failing_at_getting_a_career_again/,"First off, I apologize if this isn't quite the place to post this, but I think it fits here. If there is a better place to post this, please let me know.

Now, let me get the basic informations out of the way. I'm a single 24M and I still live with my parents (I have been trying to change this but that's for another post somewhere else). I have never gone to college nor have I held a regular paying job. Also, if it's at all relevant, I've never considered myself much of a friends person.

I'll try to keep the story as concise and to the point as possible:

During high school I became interested in broadcasting (thus my username), more specifically radio broadcasting. To make a long story short, I became skeptical of college after watching videos and reading articles online which suggested that college is a waste of time and money. Going into broadcasting seemed like the perfect route (at least to me) to avoid going to college.

After high school, I enrolled in a one-year broadcasting school in hopes of becoming a radio DJ. I should mention a couple of things. First, the school is a very highly regarded broadcasting school and many successful broadcasting professionals were educated there. Second, while they do offer internships as part of the program, I didn't have my driver's license at the time (I do now though) so I couldn't do any internships.

I graduated from the broadcasting school in April of 2015. That same month, my dad got a job in a state on the other side of the US from where we lived at the time. I had no choice but to move there with my parents. This soon became a problem. While the broadcasting school I went to has career counseling services, they only have contacts in the state where it is located as well as the surrounding states. Being all the way out here, they couldn't help me much.

I managed to actually visit a radio station in the area with someone I know who is also interested in broadcasting a year or two ago, and even gave them my resume. However, the manager there said they had no need to hire anybody. Last year, I sent an email to another radio station in my area asking about doing an internship but they never contacted me back. To make matters worse, seemingly all the job listings I looked at both on Indeed and on my broadcasting school's alumni networking Facebook page all specified a certain amount of experience in the field that i didn't have and that I couldn't get.

This year, I decided that my pursuit of broadcasting was no longer worth it. I had failed at getting the career I thought I could get. In the meantime, I've become interested in IT Security and would like to switch to that career.

According to people that I've talked to, one needs to go to college to learn IT. However, in addition to the skepticism about college I mentioned earlier, I am haunted by my failure to get a broadcasting career. I'm afraid that if I go to college to try to get a career in IT Security, I'll fail to find a job in the field and end up back where I am now, and I can't afford to let that happen. I've heard the story one too many times of people who went to college and then couldn't get a job in their chosen field.

A couple of other things before I end this post. I took out student loans to go to the one-year broadcasting school which I'm still paying off, which in turn makes going to college and paying even more money less attractive. Also, I don't understand why I failed so hard. Yes, it could be that I haven't worked a day in my life and yes, it could also be that I'm bad at job searching. But as I mentioned I went to a very respected school.

Anyway, that brings me to the title question. What are some things that I can do to avoid (or at the very least decrease the chances of) failing to get into a career?

Thanks everyone for reading and have a nice day."

This company handles contracts like network installation and maintenance (general internet, security, etc) for local school districts  and private work for more affluent individuals such as installing home theater systems, installing and maintaining networks, etc.  I'm up in the air over whether or not to return as I don't feel I'll gain anything as the company bitch.  However, I noticed last summer that a lot of their monitoring software is shifting towards Linux (specific example being the Ubiquiti Network Management System--UNMS).  None of the current employees are very adept at Linux and most of them are resistant to it even though the software they require is only hosted on Linux platforms.  So my question to those of you have have a much better clue than me is:

 **Is it worth my time, and to the best of you abilities toguess, is it worth the companies time to hire me as a sort of watered down Linux sysadmin?**

&amp;#x200B;

Background is this:

Company has 6 employees and is currently doing extremely well.  Their bottleneck last summer was finding time to get every appointment in so, I see some potential for optimizing workflow and management.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18 currently in my first year of college.  I am studying engineering and CS and am not afraid to put time in to learning content on my own time.  Ive been running Linux on my laptop as my primary OS for about 6 months now and have been aggressively learning it.  By the end of second semester (which is when I'd be going back to work with this company),  I will have taken two classes in Java and have learned Python to near the same level as Java.  I've always loved data management, optimizing workflow, and diving into projects, so I think it'd be well worth my time to chase something like this.   I've been working on delving into the world of bash scripting recently as well, although I won't claim to be proficient in that yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any insight into whether or not you think I could feasibly chase something like this, I'd love to hear it.  And even if not, I'd love to hear from the professionals what sort of skills I should work on learning right now.

Thanks for the help and consideration!"
9ww2yg,5,2018-11-13,6 Month Internship as with big company as freshman - What do do over the summer?,vadbox,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9ww2yg/6_month_internship_as_with_big_company_as/,"So I was just accepted into a 6 month EE internship with the company that made the iPhone (my last posts got removed for having this company's name) from January to June. I have decided to move forward with this position.

The issue is that I'll miss two quarters of school. I'm currently a first year in my first quarter here, I'm worried that this will put me behind in my academics.

I'm studying EE and my position is also for EE, but I'm applying to many CS/SW engineering positions, specifically for front end web development, and plan to work in software engineering/embedded systems in the future. I really do love studying and practicing both EE and CS.

Because this position ends in June and the fall quarter at my school starts in September, I still have 3 months between the end of the position and when school starts again. I was wondering what would be best for me to do over the summer:

* Continue working with same company. This is not guaranteed, but my interviewers did mention that often times interns extend their internship to 9 months to work throughout the summer.
*  Community college course to catch up 
* Work at another company. If I chose this, I will need to continue applying. I am currently applying to software engineering positions and electrical engineering positions. If I choose this, would it be a good idea to update pending applications of my acceptance to the position? How will getting an EE position impact my chances for SW positions?

I attend a very respectable university for engineering/computer science. I need 195+ units to graduate. Because of this position, I will likely not graduate in four years unless I double up on classes and take summer classes.

I know experience is very important in this field, but does extra experience at the company outweigh going to college for an extra year (or two)?"

Figured I'd ask a more CS-oriented subreddit for advice on something that's been bugging me for some time.  


I am interested in pursuing data science as a career after I finish my PhD in chemistry, specializing in chemical physics. It's been a goal of mine ever since I had a chance to do a few internships for companies and really got to enjoy the entire experience, moreover using ML as a tool especially. My degree has taught me a lot of technical skills - especially in engineering, electronics, optics, and problem-solving - and I get to code a fair amount, albeit with no ML or big data packages and mostly just analysis (but that being said, it's quite non-trivial).   


I have been sort of on the fence about my PhD, because as a whole, I'm not happy with it. I know it's quite common for students to feel that way but after developing a passion for CS/ML/data over the past few years, I really am starting to regret not going to school for something more along that line and thinking about pursuing that desire. Do I have any chance getting a career in data science, or to a slightly different extent, development in general? I feel that my degree holds me back due to it being a natural science and not something related, despite me having experience with these topics. Otherwise, if that's not an issue, I can reset my mind in regards to finishing these degree as I hate the idea of 'quitting', despite wanting a change.

Thanks!"

I'm currently a fifth (senior) year Biomedical Engineering Major. I've worked two internships, and am personally unhappy with the job prospects of Biomedical Engineering. This is both fundamentally with the job availability, related job titles, as well as the salary. 


Before the *inevitable* flurry of ""quit complaining, it isn't all about the money,"" I do ardently believe in being paid what I am worth as an employee. This means: not being limited to a Biomedical Equipment Technician, with a $50k/py after going through five years of engineering hell, and debt.  


This being said, I have always been interested in Computer Hardware Engineering, and wouldn't find too much trouble getting into a Masters Program for it. My two questions would be - (1) How is the job market for CpHE's in the East Coast (specifically New York City, up to Stamford CT), and furthermore (2) is it feasible for a BME UG to be proficient enough to do CpHE on a Masters Level? 


IF I had to do a Masters program in Mechanical Engineering tomorrow, I know that I wouldn't really have too much of a problem; because of the fact that BME required curricula is a big chunk of Mechanical Engineering (Statics, Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, Materials Science, Thermo, Fluids...). But my circuits knowledge is limited to just a Circuits Lab, as well as one DSP class. The last thing I would want to do is turn this into a sunk-cost fallacy, but I personally don't know how Masters level curricula work for people not in that major, as all I am is a young, misguided, UG. Would it be harder to the point where it becomes unviable? 


Anyways, my apologies on the tangent-turned rants, and thank you in advance!"

Background:

 - Project A: Remote internship with a prestigious org. Unpaid, but not too much work expected. Unusual to be able to get access to this type of data. The type of work expected is that is popular/trendy and something I'd like to learn more about but don't know as much about now. 

 - Project B: Recently discovered that I'm fascinated by this topic. More coursework / final project. In an area where I can apply my skills

What they have in common: similar type of CS work, self driven, get to choose topic

What I like about each:

 - Project A: unusual data, potential to put into practice/publish in some form
 - Project B: have a specific goal, using skills I've learned, lots of options

Downsides:

 - Project A: feel disconnected from team, hard to read expectations, more abstract + complex problems, little guidance

 - Project B: hard to find data, no immediate practical use 

Any suggestions on figuring this out?"
9wxr9l,112,2018-11-14,The truth about gap years,IBslut,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9wxr9l/the_truth_about_gap_years/,"I’ve heard a lot of negative things being said about students who take a gap year. This is all the more prevalent in India, where even many of my relatives think poorly of me for taking one. But after being halfway through my gap year, I can safely say this, taking a gap year has been one of the best things to have happened to me and here’s why:

1. I took the ACT during my gap year and scored a 34 Cumulative. When I was applying to colleges last year, I had an SAT score of 1370. I was also able to take the SAT Math 2, which I didn’t take during HS, and scored an 800 on that.

2. My final grades are much better than what my predicted grades were (IBDP student)

3. I did an internship at an artificial intelligence firm which helped me decide to study Computer Science at uni. When I was applying to colleges last year, I was confused between majoring in CS and Business/Economics.

4. I was able to start a digital literacy initiative, where I educated the digitally illiterate children in Delhi, India. I’ve currently worked at two schools for underprivileged children and plan to work with the Delhi government in the near future.

5. I’ve been doing many online courses for Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence), Mathematics, and Business/Economics.

6. I have a lot of time to travel (that too, independently), which I barely did during High School. I also have a lot of time to learn new things like playing the guitar and boxing and improving myself as a person (I know it sounds clichéd, but it’s true)

It isn’t all fun and games though, especially when you see all your friends having the time of their life at uni (at least, that’s what their snapchat stories imply). During the beginning, I felt that one year of my life had gone to waste by taking a gap year. However, you have to look past that and keep engaging yourself in activities to keep your mind occupied. If you don’t, you will feel horribly unproductive. 

To be honest, I used to think ill of gap years and people who take them: they all looked lazy to me. However, my father persuaded me to take one as he himself took one after high school and also felt it was one of the best decisions of his life.

Don’t let anyone’s opinion on gap years stop you from taking one if you think it would really help you. Trust me, it ain’t at all bad as long as you spend that time productively. Even universities don’t look at taking a gap year negatively, as long as you have a good reason to take one (in fact, it can even help you with your admissions if you spend that time productively). I know I flexed a lot in this post, but that is to tell you all that taking a gap year can open up so many opportunities.

TL DR; Gap years can be very good for you if you use that time productively.

The objective on this is to convert the physical server to a VM machine. I already did that with the VMware Converter Standalone.

The problem is, when I start the VM on the VMware, It's terrible slow, so slow that Windows Sever automatically stops all roles that are running because CPU is almost all the time at 100% usage.

Can anyone see the server specs and tell me if this server can handle with VMware and the Windows Server VM ??

I'm an international student in Canada (Vancouver) and I need some advice to help me make a decision. Right now I'm doing an associate's in computer science at a local college. My intention was to transfer to one of the universities in BC after graduating to complete my (second) bachelor's but that's not likely to happen immediately after. My mum is a single parent who financially supports me (I have 2 more siblings at home) and the 60 credits for the associate's are expensive enough for her. If I want to do the other 60 credits for my bachelor's it'll have to come out of pocket.

So here I am finishing up 8 months internship as a desktop technician/help desk. I  couldn't land a software gig (I'm competing with students from 4 other universities) and I really needed the money so I accepted the job. IT is not a career I want though.

Anyway the new semester is soon starting and I'll be taking 4 courses (3 CS 1 maths) but I was offered the possibility to work part-time (20hrs) while I study. Should I take it?

Even though I'll be working part-time, it's enough money to pay half a semester's tuition fees, which means I can help my mum A LOT with finances.

At the same time, I don't want to be shoehorned to IT, you know? I want to be a developer even if all I have right now is an associate's. 

I'm working on freecodecamp and p1xt guide every day to build a portfolio so I'm thinking of it as a 5th course I'm taking alongside my studies.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel my prospects are not great tbh. I'm competing against students from UBC/SFU/BCIT/UVic and until I get my own bachelor's (I need to save money for it) I'm stuck with just an associate's.

If I take the job I get more experience which would increase my chances of getting an IT job after graduation and save money.

But I also want to try and get a software developer job still after I graduate.

I love learning about new algorithms and about how languages work. It's something I do every day because learning new things and increasing my skills gives me a lot of satisfaction. Reading code, really understanding it, and being able to figure out how to make it better is something I absolutely live for.

I'm still in university and haven't started looking for a real job yet, but back when I was a freshman/sophomore and was on that internship grind, the competitiveness was insane. There was palpable tension between everyone I knew who was in CS and was trying to get in at Google, Amazon, etc. I'm not a competitive person and feeling like I had to flex and sell myself to outdo other people made me very uncomfortable and was terrible for my mental health. I made it pretty far into a couple different interview processes, but I never got an internship.

I'm graduating at the end of this school year, and I am genuinely terrified of going through that again. I worry that I will be unable to find success because I just cannot perform at a high level when I am doing it for the purpose of appearing more capable than others.

Recently I've made the decision that, since I'm not competitive, all I will be able to do is present myself for who I am and what I know, and then let the cards fall where they may. Since coming to this conclusion I've been more productive than ever before and have been in a really good place when it comes to mental health. I've progressed more in the past year than in the first 3 years of university combined, but in the back of my mind I'm still worried. I'm worried that my attitude will make me less employable than others because it puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to performing in a corporate environment.

Has anyone with a similar mindset been able to make it? If so, how did you do it? Are you happy?"

Hello everyone! I'm a Materials Engineering student trying to find an internship but I haven't been having the best of luck. Every time I apply for an internship online I never get a call back. I have been told by many recruiters that my resume is impressive so I do not know what's wrong. I also went to my schools career showcase and two business contacted me, one for an interview and one emailed me. They seemed to be impressed by me and tell me it's my passion and resume that made them want to interview me but the minute I tell them my GPA they don't want to hire me. During the Fall of my sophomore year I was extremely depressed and went from a 3.45 to a 2.8 in one semester. I tell them this but they still don't care. Does anyone know of any companies that hire people regardless of GPA, I'm not trying to work for NASA or anything I just want something to get my foot in the door. Have any of you not have internships and was still able to get a job after graduation. I have done research at my school since the spring of my freshman year and plan to do so for as long as I graduate, professors have told me that that is sufficient enough if you can't find internships, is this true? I am just so frustrated and miserable and I heard for engineering it's internships that help you get a job not the GPA. Everyone around me is getting internships left and right, and I am getting really sad. Please help, any and all advice is appreciated. 

Also, what do employers think of you staying in school for 5 years instead of 4, like I stated in the previous paragraph above I have been so miserable at this school because of all the work they make me do, and being away from home; I just want to space out my classes. Will employers think I'm lazy if I tell them I was depressed with all the work and had to space classes out.

Thanks for reading this post, because it's about to be a crap ton of information. Also before anyone comments on the username, splitdecision was taken haha. I'll also post this into r/careerguidance, so apologies in advance for posting to both subreddits.

I'm a sophomore in college in the US who took advantage of exploring majors and career options, so I generally know what I absolutely don't want to do (which is just as important as figuring out what I like to do). I've always considered myself a jack of all trades, but a really mediocre one. I'm meh at science, meh at art (which I like), meh at human interaction, meh at managing, meh at business (if I had a job in any field, I'd be able to get by, but I wouldn't enjoy my work at all and I'd burn out). For example, I scored a summer internship in Human Resources, where I learned I'd prefer just about anything over working in a traditional cubicle job (I literally burned out after three months, but I kept working through it even though it sucked all motivation from me). I've gone through so many majors in college from Biology to Theatre Design (costuming). Now I'm an Anthropology and Film Production major, with a minor in Criminal Justice. 

I started out wanting to be a forensic anthropologist (identifying bodies from remains, esp. bones etc), but then I realized that they had too much impact over whether someone spent their life in prison or whether a family got justice for a victim, which horrifies me and is driving me away from that career. Also testifying in court with evidence is definitely what I don't really want to do, because knowing me, I am not good at formulating responses to fast paced questions especially when I'd be cross-examined.

**Actual Ideas**: After exploring film this semester, I want to be sort of like Guillermo del Toro. Starting off in practical effects, then moving onto bigger and better things. I also admire Stan Lee (Rip a legend) for his passion and his ability to nurture a subculture and nudge it to the mainstream through collaboration with others. This admiration for del Toro and Lee is why I'm studying Film Production, despite it being such a saturated industry.

I enjoy cosplaying (I'm not great, but I've definitely improved from where I started), and I love replicating characters as well as imagining my own. Originally I looked into costume design, then practical special effects and also visual fx (imagine Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean for what I was imagining for vfx), so I can see all the career options that interest me.

I dunno, I feel a bit hopeless because I have no experience in the film industry, but it's getting to the point where I need to start building a good portfolio and making connections if I ever hope to not be a broke, starving artist. It's difficult because you need to learn softwares, improve your craft, and learn your style... and I feel so behind on all of this compared to other students that started earlier... Also I'm limited to stay in my university because of financial aid reasons, so most of my experience is gained through classes offered, internships (which usually require a portfolio or previous experience), or through my study abroad office which may or may not be able to get me an internship abroad for the sole purpose of gaining experience...  I understand that in the industry, they couldn't care less about where you graduate from, but I'm sort of lost at gaining experience and learning things (other than from the youtube tutorials that I come across every now and then)

TL;DR: I'm leaning toward film pre-production (or post-production in VFX) with anthro-criminal justice (forensic anthropologist) as a worst case scenario back up and I don't exactly know where to go from here to achieve my plan A!

Any advice or ideas? Any paths that I should take? Any things I should study on my own (with links)? Any experiences that you have from your own life?

I just want to get this out there and see if someone can give me advice or be honest with me. 

\- I graduated cum laude with a bachelors in communication with a focus in video production and a minor in film studies. I graduated a year early. College was incredibly hard for me. I was reminded almost every day by several professors and peers that I was terrible and one of the ""shittier"" students, despite my GPA and work ethic being fantastic. I don't feel like the honors that I received are anything special.

\- While being scolded at college, I would work on several professional film sets in my local city. My work on these sets actually gave me the opportunity to apply for a SAG membership. While acting is one of my dreams, and the fact that I even got paid for acting is awesome, I don't know if I should apply for this membership and chase this dream. 

\- Applying for jobs have been.... odd? I will struggle to get jobs locally and nationally for entry level video production but big companies like TMZ, ESPN, and A&amp;E will discuss jobs with me. None of the job offers that I've received have come true yet due to my current internship.

\- I am currently working as a custodial intern at Walt Disney World. I am extending my program till May and even extended my location to an extra park. As much as I love this program, I've been feeling depressed. The pay isn't the best and, while I love my coworkers, a lot of them will come up to me and complain about incredibly petty work drama. I get that I can be in a worse situation but I've been thinking about leaving. I don't know why though.

\- While on this program, I received an acceptance letter for my masters at a film school that I've been looking at since high school. It's one of the best in the nation. As much as I want to accept it, the reality of student debt that's ruining my dreams. Financial aid did absolutely nothing for me and I am paying back a large amount. Most of my money on the disney college program is put into savings. I don't make enough to be able to reasonably pay back what they expect me to pay back while living down here. I do not want to defer my loans.

\- My mother, father, and two brothers are extremely supportive and I love them. The rest of my family have not. While showing promising success in my dreams of acting and filmmaking, the rest of my family sees me as a failure and discredits a lot of my success. The one thing they point out is my student debt. This bothers me greatly.

\- At the age of 21, I do not own a driver's license. I suffer from anxiety and depression. They were actually diagnosed by a doctor. As much as I want to drive, I get extreme panic attacks behind the wheel.

\- My dating life has also been terrible. I've only had one real relationship and she ended up cheating on me and telling me that I'm better off killing myself. I've tried dating afterwards but I hate it. I'm not comfortable with it and I find it petty. 

With all of this, I feel like a failure. I know that people would love some of these points in their life but I'm struggling with my self-confidence as of lately. Am I being spoiled? Am I too far ahead of people my age or behind? Why do I feel lost? Am I really a failure? How should I play my life?"

9x35lr,3,2018-11-14,How can I avoid failing at getting a career again?,ThatBroadcasterGuy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9x35lr/how_can_i_avoid_failing_at_getting_a_career_again/,"I posted this on another sub last night, but it as of yet has gotten no responses, so I'm posting it here where it might get more attention:

Now, let me get the basic informations out of the way. I'm a single 24M and I still live with my parents (I have been trying to change this but that's for another discussion for another day). I have never gone to college nor have I held a regular paying job. Also, if it's at all relevant, I've never considered myself much of a friends person.

I'll try to keep the story as concise and to the point as possible:

During high school I became interested in broadcasting (thus my username), more specifically radio broadcasting. To make a long story short, I became skeptical of college after watching videos and reading articles online which suggested that college is a waste of time and money. Going into broadcasting seemed like the perfect route (at least to me) to avoid going to college.

After high school, I enrolled in a one-year broadcasting school in hopes of becoming a radio DJ. I should mention a couple of things. First, the school is a very highly regarded broadcasting school and many successful broadcasting professionals were educated there. Second, while they do offer internships as part of the program, I didn't have my driver's license at the time (I do now though) so I couldn't do any internships.

I graduated from the broadcasting school in April of 2015. That same month, my dad got a job in a state on the other side of the US from where we lived at the time. I had no choice but to move there with my parents. This soon became a problem. While the broadcasting school I went to has career counseling services, they only have contacts in the state where it is located as well as the surrounding states. Being all the way out here, they couldn't help me much.

I managed to actually visit a radio station in the area with someone I know who is also interested in broadcasting a year or two ago, and even gave them my resume. However, the manager there said they had no need to hire anybody. Last year, I sent an email to another radio station in my area asking about doing an internship but they never contacted me back. To make matters worse, seemingly all the job listings I looked at both on Indeed and on my broadcasting school's alumni networking Facebook page all specified a certain amount of experience in the field that i didn't have and that I couldn't get.

This year, I decided that my pursuit of broadcasting was no longer worth it. I had failed at getting the career I thought I could get. In the meantime, I've become interested in IT Security and would like to switch to that career.

According to people that I've talked to, one needs to go to college to learn IT. However, in addition to the skepticism about college I mentioned earlier, I am haunted by my failure to get a broadcasting career. I'm afraid that if I go to college to try to get a career in IT Security, I'll fail to find a job in the field and end up back where I am now, and I can't afford to let that happen. I've heard the story one too many times of people who went to college and then couldn't get a job in their chosen field.

A couple of other things before I end this post. I took out student loans to go to the one-year broadcasting school which I'm still paying off, which in turn makes going to college and paying even more money less attractive. Also, I don't understand why I failed so hard. Yes, it could be that I haven't worked a day in my life and yes, it could also be that I'm bad at job searching. But as I mentioned I went to a very respected school.

Anyway, that brings me to the title question. What are some things that I can do to avoid (or at the very least decrease the chances of) failing to get into a career?

Thanks everyone for reading and have a nice day."
9x37re,2,2018-11-14,Flatiron Health vs. Etsy for SWE Internship?,UwUprincess,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9x37re/flatiron_health_vs_etsy_for_swe_internship/,"I've been fortunate enough to receive offers from both of these companies, and honestly have no idea what to pick. They are very similarly sized companies (although Etsy is larger). They are both in New York, and the compensation is approximately the same, so location/$ is not a factor. Both of their companies' work cultures sound extremely good -- I loved everyone I talked to from each company.

As for my current situation, I am a junior at a top 20 CS school. My resume/GPA isn't super strong, but I know both of these internships would look equally as good. I am primarily interested in web development, and both internships would have projects that would fit my interests (although I have not been given a specific team for either one). I intend to recruit again next year for full-time (I want to be closer to family on the West coast), but I am not opposed to accepting a return offer, if I really like the company.

For Etsy, their engineering culture seems more established (although Flatiron's is no slouch, full of ex-BigNers). They have been around for a while, so their practices and procedures are more set in stone. I love full-stack development, and all of Etsy's teams are small and consist of engineers, designers, etc. so I would get to learn a bit about everything. Also, working a platform which millions of people use is very appealing to me.

For Flatiron, their mission is most appealing to me. Cancer has taken loved ones from me and they are one of the only companies where I can contribute to cancer research. But I don't expect my impact as an intern to be really all that great so it's not the hugest factor."

For some background, I graduated college in May 2017 (journalism major) and was still in an internship with a local newspaper. I stayed with that internship for a year and a half (until June 2018) because they kept telling me it would turn into a full-time position.

It obviously never did and I ended up leaving and taking a part-time position with a local radio station doing digital news for them. I loved it but the pay hasn’t exactly been enough to cover my monthly bills so I took on another part-time job.

Fast forward to early October, I’ve been with the new job for roughly five months and then suddenly, one of the full-time producers announces he will be leaving in two weeks. I’m excited because this potentially means I’ll get hired full time.

He leaves and then sure enough, my boss comes to me and asks me if I will temporarily work full-time (taking over all his duties and working night shifts) while they work to fill the position. I ask if I will be considered for the position and they tell me yes and that I should submit my application. 

I submit my application and start working full-time and shift from the morning shift to the night shift while they hire another part-time worker to fill my old shifts.

I’ve been working full-time for a month now and they just started interviewing for the position I’m currently temporarily in. 

I’ve repeatedly been told that I’m doing a great job in the position, but have not been asked to interview for said position and I’m starting to get worried. 

I really love the company and I actually Have a good relationship with my boss. 

What more can I do to convince them to hire me full-time when I already show up early for my shifts, work late, build relationships with co-workers and go the extra mile in the tasks I’m given? "

Whenever I do these I try to do them early in the day while my mind is fresh and I'm not beat at the end of the day. I'm frankly considering just not doing some of them because chances are I won't get an interview anyway so what's the point.

Do you guys do every coding challenge you get?"

9x5skf,2,2018-11-14,Unpaid internship advice,Willpill38,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9x5skf/unpaid_internship_advice/,"Hi,

I will keep this as short and simple as possible: I am a junior (junior age wise, little behind in credits) studying Statistics and CS at a large state school with a decent program in both. 

I am actively looking for an internship for the summer in the data/software area (data analyst, data science, software dev/engineer, etc.) to gain experience, since my resume is pretty weak (one data entry ""internship"", no side-projects (WIP), customer service jobs, no clubs). I have applied to 30+ places and have gotten denied at about 10 so far. I am applying to a ton more to this day and will through the winter/spring.

I have heard back from a ""Data Science internship"" which is ""unpaid/for credit"". It is with my state's major league soccer team. I feel I am relatively qualified  (pretty familiar with R/Python when ""some experience"" is a requirement). They want to set up a phone interview soon.

I guess I am posting because I don't know if I should be careful since it is unpaid. I've heard very negative things from a lot of people about unpaid internships in this field. However, I am not too confident I will find anything better, and I really want to gain actual experience. I work a part time serving job and a campus job so I should have some kind of income for the summer. If I did end up getting offered a position, what can I expect? Is it worth it? Does anyone have any experience in these kind of situations? Any feedback is super helpful and I appreciate it.

**Note:** I posted in this sub because I wanted input from people in the actual field. If it would be better to post in r/jobs or a CS sub I will do so. Thank you!

edit: My resume: https://i.imgur.com/gIhELVi.jpg

9x68cw,5,2018-11-14,Choosing Final Internship,tempinternaccc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9x68cw/choosing_final_internship/,"I'm lucky enough to have three quality offers for my final internship and was hoping to get the thoughts of others on my choices here. I have two internships in the past, one at a big bank and another at a start-up with little name recognition. I'm leaning towards LinkedIn at the moment, but would appreciate any insight on any factors I may have missed. Thanks!

1. **Google**

Pros:

\-  Probably best name recognition out of the three, probably helpful for landing interviews during full-time search

\-  Unique opportunity to work on a research-based ML project (maybe I'll like it more than I think I will?)

Cons:

\- Lowest compensation. Not too far behind LinkedIn, but having to find own housing is a bummer.

\- Not really interested in working in ML long term, would have preferred a pure SWE project

\- Probability of a return offer significantly lower than LinkedIn (still have to re-interview)

2.  **Citadel**

Pros: 

\- Highest compensation by far (\~12k/month + housing)

\-  Unique opportunity to work in a trading firm, since there's little chance I'll want to after graduation.

Cons:

\- No control over team matching, and from what I've heard there is a lot of old, boring tech at Citadel (basically anything that's not in the HFT side of the firm).

\- Less name recognition in the tech world.

\- I've heard really bad things about the culture and work hours.



3. **LinkedIn**

Pros: 

\- Heard excellent things about the work environment and culture here

\- Full stack engineering project that most closely aligns with my interest

\- Very high probability of a return offer from what I've heard, which would take a lot of pressure off the job search next fall

Cons:

\-  Compensation is still less than Citadel (not as concerned about this -- I don't desperately need the money)

\-  Not really considered as ""prestigious"" as the other two

\- Even though the probability of a return offer is higher, from what I've read the offer would be significantly worse than either Google or Citadel."

9x6r0i,3,2018-11-14,I feel like ritalin has both saved and ruined my life. I'm dependent on it.,unhappypatient,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9x6r0i/i_feel_like_ritalin_has_both_saved_and_ruined_my/,"I have been a lonely, unhappy, low energy person all my life, (my God - the fatigue and social anxiety together razed me to dust) but it blew up in college. I was disgustingly acne-ridden, anemic, depressed, isolated and stupid. I very nearly flunked out of college. 

Between Accutane sapping my energy and depression/yearning making me incapable of being in my own brain, it is a wonder I did *not* flunk out by junior year. I still blew it - didn't intern, had to retake courses- but I graduated, thanks to ritalin. That is my single life's accomplishment. I have paid for it for a decade (there was a lot of horrible, worthless continuing ed thereafter, and now I have shitty contract jobs that will probably put me just far enough over the poverty line to lose my health coverage through the state). 

I can work, thanks to ritalin. I graduated, thanks to ritalin. I can get through a day without wanting to cry from tiredness and inability to focus, thanks to ritalin. Ritalin gave me life. 

And 10 years after my ADHD diagnosis and a life *completely dependent on it*, to the point where caffeine is useless without it - I also realize it has done a few things: 

- I am paranoid as fuck. I hate mornings as is - I'm so, *so* tired and so uncomfortable when I wake up in the morning - but that's the time when I think about intrusive thoughts most. It's scary. I can feel that awful adrenaline pumping as my body fights having to hurry to work. Perhaps it's fatigue and bodily pain. 

 Hurtful thing someone said or did? Painful loss of a person I care about, or social rejection? Painful or scary or infuriating memories?  Horrible thing I come across and read in morbid fascination - torture from a stupid blog page like ""HowItWorks"", porn that made me cringe inwardly in horror at the thought of people getting off to it (intense sadism), crime in my city, latent fear and the fear that people that don't like me will conveniently find out, laugh at me, and then see that happen? A general sense of powerlessness in a chaotic world - it was already there, before ritalin; a decade on ritalin and it feels like that's all there is. It's definitely gotten worse with work; that initial, excruciating anxiety and the struggle to be and stay employed in horrible jobs that barely pay above minimum wage, the sheer physical will it takes me to do something easy for other people - that's a big factor.

(I am not schizoid, even though I know like I sound I am. I realize, like, someone capturing and torturing my father to death when he goes on a business trip overseas or is not likely to happen or that I will be kidnapped and tortured to death and I won't know how to deal with it is not real - but the image is there. The images are there. That's what my mental health has always been actually. I can't remember a time where there weren't passive, horrible intrusive thoughts triggered by fatigue, or seeing something happening to another person - not even as a little kid. Just terror, and a sense of complete powerlessness to protect myself or help them. That's the full scope of my very existence for much of the day. It quiets at night, I guess, when I'm home and can be alone and lie down.) 

And I fixate on things that are horrible to me that viscerally make me feel powerlessness. I can't watch horror movies because of it. 

 - This is the biggest reason, and a scary one - sensorily - I am in pain much of the time. 

My skin, my bones, my muscles - I frantically try to imagine how to avoid feeling pain in the unlikely scenario I lose control of a situation of my body - someone trapping me and tickling me or touching me in a way that's painful and refusing my requests they stop, basic injuries from dodging bikes or cars, falling down metro stairs....I have carpal tunnel from my desk job as is, but banging a finger, stubbing a toe, banged shins, cuts...basic injuries in day to day life are more painful than ever before. I googled to see if studies say over time ritalin makes bones and skin weaker and I feel it's true. Perpetual back and shoulder aches related to an office chair.

What a joke on myself, I wasn't hearty before ritalin. 


I feel like I'm made of glass in a treacherous and malevolent world. And powerless. Fatigue, hating life in general since I was a teenager, feeling alone and the fundamental belief that if you give many people the opportunity to mock others' pain or fear, they will (great thing when you are fearful by nature - think of how many times you've seen a crowd laugh at something/someone being acted upon that personally upset you or scared you, but you couldn't say a word), and most of all, hating life with a 9-5 and no money - that was all there before. 

But I truly believe ritalin...was like gasoline on a medium-burning fire. *And I'm fucking dependent on it to function.* Shit - no one but my brother even knows I have ADHD, even though people used to giggle my writing style revealing I'm on it. 

I have had this emotional composition and sense of the world since childhood, even on antidepressants (which, LOL, I cannot fucking take anymore - everything from sertraline to prozac had horrible side effects like acne cysts). But this drug - which my very ability to drag my ass out of bed in the morning depends on - has put it on perpetual overdrive...maybe.

On the days I take less ritalin, all I want to do is sleep (to be fair, I don't get enough sleep during the week). And sleep. And sleep. I cannot focus. I cannot function. (Pain plays a part of it - what besets the body in pain, the fatigue of a basic shitty life squatting in a bad chair all day and running to work late, or this drug? Both?) I do not want to leave my apartment. (Not due to agoraphobia, despite my rantings - fatigue. Maybe a little bit of hating being around people viscerally. I live in a dense, obnoxious, noisy city and there are real threats from shitty passerby who do not look up from their phones, aggro bike delivery people, and cars that would rather roll over a person in a crosswalk than come to a full stop.)

I'm on 10mg per day at most.

Do any of you relate to this? If not b/c of this drug, b/c of ADHD, chronic fatigue, depression? Generally being allergic to life.

I hate this. I hate...being so weak. I wish I were normal, happy and healthy. And I wish my experiences and sense of life were not soaked and dripping in obsessive fear. 

I came into the world afraid, less-than, and generally someone people forget or see as a doormat; a scatterbrained fuck up. Ritalin lessened the consequences of that so I can be extremely mediocre, ashamed, and unhappy where I used to be actively suicidal and couldn't even fake a smile for a job interview. But my God - the tradeoff of just being mediocre (mediocre employee, specifically) and being able to do tasks is so high. 

If you relate, I'm listening. I had to put it out there. I HATE I HAVE ADHD. I HATE I NEED THIS DRUG. I hate my body; I hate my life.

However, I've only been taking CS classes for two semesters + a summer term, so I have less formal CS class experience than the average CS grad.

Another thing is that my GPA is currently lower than a 3.0 thanks to a bad decision I made over sticking around with an engineering major for 3 years that I turned out having 0 passion for. I have no prior CS internship experience. I did somehow get to the final round of the Amazon new grad SDE a month ago, but ultimately didn't make the cut. I'm growing depressed since I'm not getting many callbacks from other companies, and since the fall recruiting season is dying down, I'm thinking about taking another final semester of college. It would let me get my GPA over 3.0, which would let me apply to all the companies that I can't right now, and also let me take some advanced CS classes in topics I'm interested in (only have the minimum requirements for my school's degree).

Finances are not a problem, but I'm worried that it's a bad decision to delay graduation again instead of going 100% to find a job. Which one would you say is a better decision for someone in my situation?"

So I've been working as a software developer (Java language) for 2 months now, in a large international telecommunication company and I would like to quit because I don't like the job I'm doing in that particular department (nor do I like the company itself that much). But the thing is, I've only been working there for two months so I think it's way to early to leave. I am currently working part-time, on a student contract, because I'm still at college working on my master's degree (I'm 24).

Backstory: My mom also works in the same company (not in the same department, though) and she knows my boss, so she arranged the job interview for me. And I think we all had some misunderstanding in the process:  I thought I would be working as a web developer (Spring framework, for example). It turned out the team I had to work with (my current team), works on radio software testing, that is radio protocols (WCDMA, LTE...), radio devices testing, and similar things, which is something I basically have zero knowledge about, and nobody told me that, and I didn't asked, since I thought I will work as web developer. The applications used for testing are written in Java (JavaFX, used for desktop applications), so my job is to update/maintain/add new features to them (I have an access to their source code). I think that nobody in the interviewing process actually realized that I want to work as a web developer (which I actually mentioned a few time).

Here's another problem: the application's source code I have an access to has different authors, which means I can't apply changes to the modified code (to build and run changed application, basically). I mentioned that on the daily meeting, and my mentor said  he will call the original author of the code to come and help. And he did come a bit later, but half a minute later he said he will be back in a short while (he had to do something else first). Well, he wasn't back and after a while I went home. I came to work he following day and he still didn't show up, so I basically couldn't do shit.

Today I didn't go to work because of all this mentioned before, but I also have to do some things for college. I also have to say that the company's culture and mentality is basically the same as in previous paragraph (laid back not in a good way, everybody works like they have all the time in the world, etc. You an actually feel the slowness and hugeness, like you are a small gear in the huge machinery). I feel like I don't have any meaning there. I am pretty sure I would be more happy somewhere else.

This is my first real job, although I've been working in the same company as an intern a year ago, for three months, and I had to quit because I had some college projects/exams I had to work on. I also have some college experience in .NET, SQL, so I don't think I have to worry about finding another job. I also have some high school friends working in privately held companies (which seem a lot better to work in), so there's also that.

If you guys have some advice, please share, I would really appreciate it. I apologize for the length, but there was a lot of stuff involved."

I will be graduating with a BSc. in Comp Sci from a medium sized Canadian university soon. I have 16 months of internship experience using C# and .Net technologies, and would like to pursue jobs in this domain. I want to stay in my city of Victoria though, and I know the local job market for entry level devs is fierce at the moment.

I would love to hear from those who have been able (or not been able) to go remote straight out of college. Where did you find your job, and how did you go about the job search?

9xd19g,21,2018-11-15,Should I drop out of grad school?,Anon4DumbQuestions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9xd19g/should_i_drop_out_of_grad_school/,"Hey internet.

I'm a 2nd year CS Master's student (thesis). I received an undergrad CS degree with a 4.0 GPA, and am at the same school for my MS. I have maintained this 4.0 in my graduate courses, and after this semester I'll be done with my lecture requirements. The plan was to complete my MS next semester; however... **(1) I still haven't come up with a thesis statement, let alone started my research to be able to start writing a thesis.**

&amp;#x200B;

This would probably be a good time to mention that my desire is to go into industry.  And in the past 1.5 years of grad school and reading research papers, I've forgotten a lot of important material that is required for me to be able to pass technical interviews. I'm starting to think that, even if it's possible for me to complete a thesis in a single semester, **(2) my time might be better spent preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs next semester.** Otherwise, I may receive my MS degree but be worse off on the job hunt than I would have been if I had just gone directly from UG to industry. I'd also rather complete a thesis that I'm proud of, instead of one that just meets the minimum requirement

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely loved my undergraduate program. I was learning so much every day. When graduation grew near, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do, but I had sat in on some graduate courses and they looked like an incredible challenge that I wanted to experience. I knew *very, very little* about graduate school and research. Like, next to nothing. But I was invited to a couple different research labs, and decided to give it a shot. In my head, I imagined graduate research to be working with a team of other people that were equally excited about the same area, and having a mentor that could give me direction, help me navigate grad school, and give me expert knowledge on my field of research. While the lab that I chose had incredibly intelligent PhD students and a grad advisor that is renowned in the field, I ended up having a very hard time talking to him -- I think this was less about him and more about me being lost and just not knowing what to do.. and not bringing myself to just go ask for help. I spent the first year basically twiddling my thumbs. I learned a lot from being in the lab, but just didn't catch on soon enough. While I did well in my courses, the truth is that the lectures were *awful*, and I wasn't learning a whole lot from them. **(3)** **I started to fall into severe depression during this year, which started to compound my inability to come up with a good strategy and take decisive actions.** My momentum and confidence was depleted out of existence. I knew something had to change, so I sought out another lab and took an internship over the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

This semester has not gone much better. Depression very quickly crept back up (for which I am now seeing a therapist), and I've had no luck finding a thesis topic. I have a hard time setting time aside to prepare for technical interviews, because I feel guilty when I'm not reading research papers to find an area of research for my thesis, which feels like it should be a priority given that I need that to graduate next semester. But as mentioned in **(2)**, I now think I may be better off dedicating the winter and next semester to finding a job instead of making a hail Mary attempt at completing this degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the outcomes I'm seeing:

**Take next semester off:**

* Be much better prepared to get a position in industry that I'm happy with.
* Once I've secured a job position, I will be less stressed, less depressed (which clearly stems from my lack of momentum), and will be able to think more clearly about future desires for completing the degree.
* With a clear mind, I may be able to find a topic that I'm interested in researching, and there's nothing stopping me from beginning this research while I'm not a student. I could potentially complete my thesis MS while working, or complete a non-thesis MS degree while working.
* Have time to sort out my mental health issues.

**Stay next semester and attempt to complete a thesis:**

* I may come up with a thesis statement that I could complete in &lt; 6 months.
   * It wouldn't be my best work.
   * I'd receive my MS degree
   * I wouldn't have time to prepare for and find a good job. I'd have to settle.
* It seems more likely that I won't be able to complete a thesis during the semester.
   * I'd have to dedicate the summer to my thesis, as well. Hopefully that would be enough time.
   * I'm worried that I'll still be crippled by depression, and will just end up watching another semester waste away before my eyes.

**Switch to non-thesis MSc:**

* It will take two semesters to complete.
* I would lose another 6 months of potential salary
* I'd also have to find a job to pay for tuition, when I'd rather be able to dedicate all of my time to the classes I'm taking. I suppose I could take out more loans, but I never had a scholarship and already have so much academic debt that it's hard to justify taking on more.
* I originally planned on doing 4+1 for my master's. I switched to a two year program because I wanted enough time to do a meaningful thesis. The thought of staying for 2.5 years to complete a non-thesis master's degree when I could have completed it in one makes me sick to my stomach.
* I view these as glorified bachelor's degrees, and I'm not really keen on the CS courses / lecturers that are available. There are other schools in my university with very interesting classes that I'd love to take, but my math skills have depleted to the point that I would have a hard time being successful in them.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - I have one semester left for my MS degree. I'm burnt out and depressed. I think I should take next semester off to prepare for industry.**

I got my bachelor degree(elec. and comp. eng) this summer and I wish to pursue a career in network or application security. However, over the last couple months job hunting has been a bit frustrating. The main problem was the lack of experience. I had a one year internship doing software development but it wasn't helpful, at least in interviews, not sure about how it looks on resume to HRs. This is roughly the background. So here are my questions:

1. I noticed some postings require work experience in security field OR software development. It is easy to transfer to cyber security roles after working on software development for several years? If so, is this a common option for new grads w/o a degree or experience in security?
2. I have been reading books about web application security, linux administration, and posts in reddit. I am also trying bug bounty programs and wargames to apply the knowledge I've learned. However, I still feel incompetent mainly because I haven't discovered any bugs and I have no practical experience in configuring servers and firewalls. What would you recommend me to learn/do? Or if you want to share your story on how you started your career in cyber security, I would be more than happy to learn from your experience.
3. Are certifications really worth getting considering I have no work experience in this field?

Sorry for the long post. Any thought/comment is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!

P.S. I live in Canada"

* The people at FB seem like people I would get along with better on a personal level.

Pros:

* I feel like I could learn more. It seems the average engineer there is smarter, so I would be introduced to more proper engineering methods.
* More breadth of experience (although at FB I would be on a completely different team from last year, so maybe not much difference)
* Having a strong HFT/market maker on my resume could make me more attractive to NYC finance companies like Jane Street or HRT for 2020.

                         I am 28 years old single guy originally from Pakistan. Living in Copenhagen Denmark ( for 4.5 years) and migrating to Canada Toronto soon next year. A little timeline about myself 
- I did my 4 years college BBA(Hons) in Marketing from a good university in Pakistan. 
- Found a job in a local company as a “Market research officer “, the job was basically low key slavery, paid me 350$ per month and I didn’t learn anything from that job. I quit that job after one year and decided to try my luck someplace else. 
- Heard really good things about Denmark and decided to try my luck over there. Took admission in masters in brand management. Studied 2 years in a good state university. Had to take some part time jobs while studying in order to sustain myself(Denmark is really expensive to live). Couldn’t focus on the danish language learning because I was only studying and working and you can get by easily on daily basis by only speaking English. Couldn’t get an internship while studying because had to pay off some private loan I took in-order to get here. Graduated 2016. 
- Applied for over 100 jobs in sales and marketing entry positions . A few interviews and all with the same response that my danish skills are horrendous. 
- Found a job without danish skills as a restaurant manager. Pay was okay, work was stressful but I managed to survive for 2 years.  I tired my best to find a job in those two years in my field but failed. I felt stuck in that position and my visa was expiring  so I decided to immigrate to another country. 
- Applied for Canadian immigration and I’m now going to Canada early next year. 

 I really want to find my purpose, be a useful member of the society and find a career which would fulfill me. Tried a lot in last 2 years to work on my soft skills, read/listen advice from the likes of Dr. Jorden Peterson, Tony Robbins, Gary vaynerchuk Etc! 

Coming to Canada early next year and absolutely no Idea what to do. Reddit tells me that it is hard to find a job in Canada without Canadian experience or a degree from Canada. 

I will try again to apply for Jobs in Canada with the same education and if I fail to get one I have absolutely no idea what is the next step.  

Should I go back to college in Canada in a good university and get a degree in...I dunno finance maybe(my gmat score is: 630) and look into a career as financial analyst???

I have even considered joining a skilled trade and becoming a HVAC technician and start as an apprentice??  (Although working with my hands is not my strongest suit) 

To hell with I am even considering right now to become a Truck driver. 

I desperately need to start making some money, pay off my loans and do something which I am interested in.  Making good money right now is my top priority but I also want to go into a field in which I won’t be burned out after a few years. Long term career prospects are important to me. 
I chose my education in Marketing/ sales because I have decent interpersonal skills and enjoy interacting with people but I am open to all suggestions.  

Right now I am willing to work 15 hrs a days, 365 days a year, if I just know that I’m on the right track. 

So my question is only this, what should be my next step and career???"
9xhbka,20,2018-11-15,Last Year of Engineering and feel like I’m behind the curve.,LostWanderer96,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9xhbka/last_year_of_engineering_and_feel_like_im_behind/,"So I’m just going to add context before I tell you my issue. I currently have less than 30 credit hours of classes left before I achieve a BS in computer engineering. I initially switched to this degree from a pre-med major around 4 years ago because my parents (who are both doctors) wanted me to pursue medicine and I choose this major because I had an interest in computers and I thought the job opportunities are equally respectable as physicians and what not. I also want to be able to provide my kids (whenever I have them) the same opportunities that were afforded to me so maybe I’m comparing myself to my parents too much. So all in all I choose this major as a career decision and not because I had any real passion for it.

I had no coding experience beforehand but I was a relatively smart kid, I’d say top 10% in my high school class. The difficulty of learning to code on the fly hit me like a brick wall but in the beginning there were plenty of resources to aid students and it seemed like everyone was struggling together. First years performance was nothing to be proud of, but it gave me an idea of what to expect. 

Second year of engineering I came back with a vengeance. I was on top of all my assignments, and it seemed like any obstacle could be simplified in order to overcome any adversity. I still didn’t have any real passion in the work I did, I just felt really accomplished in getting it completed. I did well in most of my classes my second year and I felt pretty confident in myself.

Third year was a bit more difficult, but I felt like I had the right mindset at the time. I was pretty average compared to everyone else in the class and there is nothing really much to mention. 

I tried getting an internship over the summer but unfortunately had no luck. After failing interview after interview, I came to the full realization of how little I knew and how much more most people in my major knew more than me. I started questioning whether I’m just faking it and if I really should be here with people who are way more adept than me.

Going into my fourth year it seemed like any motivation I had to code was hindered. Everyone else seem to know more than me, I feel like I’m no where near prepared for most of the classes I’m in. I’ve accepted that I really don’t enjoy coding, but I have survived too much to quit now.  My classmates all seem to have a passion for this kind of stuff and I’m just here to get a good job in the future. And honestly I feel like a sub-par programmer and I really never liked coding so I don’t even know how I will even land a job. I guess I’m wondering if I’m alone in this mindset, will things get better, or am I just going to be miserable pretending I’m something I’m not.

TLDR: final year of computer engineering, never had a passion for it but don’t want to quit, everyone else seems to know more than me and have a passion, feel like a sub-par programmer, need advice … maybe encouragement."

Should I tell employers about my original non-CS bachelors?,FeelingActuator,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9xhfd4/getting_a_second_bachelors_in_cs_should_i_tell/,"I'm  currently enrolled in a second bachelor's program at a competitive  public university, soon to finish the first semester of sophomore CS  courses. I'm hoping to get an internship for this summer.

However,  I'm not a traditional student. I'm 27 years old and already have a  bachelor's degree in a liberal arts field irrelevant to CS. The school I  graduated from was a highly ranked Ivy. After I graduated in 2014, I  couldn't land a real career-starting job.

The  next part is just background information so you guys know the truth.  This isn't what I plan on saying to employers. I still haven't figured  out what I'm going to say: I grew depressed and stopped searching after 2  years. Mostly just sulked in feeling that I wasted so much time, money,  and hard work for it to not pay out. Lived at home, went on reddit, was  forced to go to a psychiatrist, etc. etc. Eventually, after being  exposed to a lot of tech things just through browsing reddit, I started  to explore it more until I eventually decided that I would pursue it. I  started to learn some programming until I made the decision to  officially give up on getting a job with my previous degree and go back  to school once more to learn computer science.

So  far, it's going great and I love it and I have a lot of regret for not  studying this the first time around. No one really knows that I'm 27  years old. Physically, I blend in well with my 18-20 year old peers.

I  have no idea what to tell employers though. I still  haven't had any work experience since I graduated. At this point, it's  nearly a 5 year gap.

Accounting into the travel expenses, parking, and trying to get into classes which are already small in their sizes, I am now seriously planning for transfer into OMSCS. Here are a few questions I have:

1. Is the program research/thesis based? Like do I need to do some sort of online research with a faculty, or writing some thesis before I can graduate?

2. How is the networking/office hours with peers and professors? Is it difficult to get to know each other compared to brick and motor schools? This is the top 1 thing that puts me off a little about online programs.

3. What is the likelihood of getting internships / starting my career while being in the program?

I am wondering what else can I do with my degree. I am currently an intern, I deal with web development. Mostly PHP, Javascript, HMTL and CSS. I like it and it's fun but since I'm still in the internship phase I'm wondering what else is there for me. 

All internships I find being posted are for either web development or software development. That led me to believe I may be looking for the wrong keywords or in the wrong place.

So anyone can help me? I'm interested in research for example, are there positions where I can do that? Maybe unite Computer Science with other areas like Biology, Math, Physics, Chemistry. I don't mind if I have to start another bachelor degree after this one since there is just one year left."

If my goal is to be a software engineer in Seattle or the Bay Area, should I stay at UW and major in something like math or EE (general math, not ACMS DMA- got rejected by that too, lol) or transfer to WWU and major in CS?  

Which is more important for getting interviews for internships and entry level jobs at a big 4 or other well-known tech company: school reputation or a CS degree?  Assume that my projects/extracurriculars/knowledge would be the same in both cases, as I can take non-major cse courses and study topics on my own at UW. 

I know that UW outside of CSE isn't prestigious, but it's the best school in the state, and big tech companies in the area seem to like to hire UW students.  Looking at Linkedin and each school's alumni employment surveys, most UW students in EE/ACMS/HCDE/Statistics/informatics/Physics get software or design jobs at  well-known tech companies.  Even some UW students with liberal arts degrees are getting engineering jobs at Amazon and Microsoft.  On the other hand, only a small handful of WWU students get jobs at BigN companies, and many of them are doing contract work. Most WWU grads end up working at smaller tech companies in Seattle or Bellingham.

So, what should I do? Stay at UW and major in EE or math, or transfer to WWU and major in cs?"

I was not given a clear ""reason for termination"" at the time of dismissal, but have some ideas as to what the final straw was (can discuss via PM if interested and necessary for helping suggest solutions). This was my first **real** job after graduating in May 2016 (bachelors in Mechanical Engineering), with a few internships prior to that and a small stint post internship and pre-this job.  
  
I'm not the kind to dwell on these things too much, and had even been off-and-on-again looking for a new job prior to this. Unfortunately, now I am afraid that I am damaged goods in the eyes of future employers. One of my internships was with the federal government (USA), and I hope to possibly return back to that sector, but I know many online applications ask if you have been fired from any jobs, and give a hard Yes/No option.  

How should I go about filling out applications (and even moreso interviewing) with this cloud hanging over me? I aim to be a very honest and upfront person, but I know that it's likely my application won't even make it past the first round if I click Yes to being fired at my previous employer. I really have no desire to go back to a sales role, if that is any consolation. I have a couple professional references in the form of supervisors from my time with the government, and even one in a coworker from my job that is in a different role within the company now and can attest to the working conditions in the sales' office.  
  
Any insight is greatly appreciated!"

While I dont like companies who ghost potential candidates I'm aware it happens often. This was certainly a funny case though.

So last semester I was internship hunting and got an interview with Cruise everything was going smooth and then all of the recruiters a d engineer I interviewed with etc fell off the face of the earth. I had done a technical and a hackerrank at this point. I didn't receive any feedback after the first technical screen I gave it a week and some change but I had an expiring offer from another company. I communicated this to the contacts I had and heard nothing back. I accepted the companies offer a month later they reached out to schedule the second technical screen and i said i had already accepted an offer.

The recruiter went on to ask why them over Cruise lol😭.

Anyways currently I'm interviewing for fulltime positions and got another interview with Cruise recently. I was over what happened last time because things happen and everyone's human. 15 minutes before the interview they sent an email to reschedule after taking a while to even respond to setup the interview. I thought it was quite unprofessional because if it was 24hrs or some more time I wouldve been ok with it but I was already on campus had booked a room to do the interview etc.

I politely responded that I was no longer interested in the role. If you can't communicate and respect another young professionals time I certainly do not want to be working with you on a daily basis. I know I might not be working with those recruiters but they just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Let me know if you've had similar ghosting/unprofessional experiences with such company."

1.**Take more CS classes (ml, ai, etc.) at my university** just so I can utilize the recruitment resource (i.e. career fair). Each course comes out to about $1000 and housing will be around $700/month.

2. **Take part in a 10 week web-dev bootcamp** (learn JS/Node) but it will end up costing around $8500. Housing is free since I can do it in my hometown. But to be fair, I'm pretty capable of learning shit on my own but its nice to have structure.

3. **Try to get any winter internship**. Cold email every company, even non tech one and convince them to create a position where I can work independently to try to build something for them. This way I can get paid to learn but I'm also adding value.

I am currently a senior undergraduate student who will graduate in May. I have done a lot of research projects and an REU, and I am hoping to one day get a PhD.

However, I am also worried that if I take one or two years off that I will not be accepted into any programs or will fall too behind. 

Has anybody taken gap years between undergrad and PhD? Should I try to be a student right now, or would I be OK if I worked for a few years first? I would most likely work in web dev, since I have an internship with a web dev company right now.

Absolutely any input or encouragement would be highly appreciated.
Been kinda depressed for a while.  I've overall been a successful college student studying business and econ, landing decent grades and scoring some amazing internship opportunities over the years including Toyota.  My resume overall is great and the investment I put in to my college and pre-career building has really paid off I'd say.

However, my internship experiences really just showed me how much I hate the working world.  Getting up at 6:30 every day to go sit at a desk all day and have my eyes exhausted by the end of the day because I've been staring at stupid computer screens all day, sitting around people who are grouchy and content with spending their life sitting in front of a screen for 30 years.  I've completely switched my career path to pursuing sales jobs at this point, because those would have me moving around and talking to people more, which I'd enjoy.  

Since beginning college, I feel like I've made very few friends and I've just gotten less interested in knowing people in general.  I used to feel like I had community in high school, and I miss that a lot.

Sad to say but I've also been really struggling to figure out if I want to keep moving toward marriage or breakup with my girlfriend of almost two years, even though I feel like I love her.

It's just killing me on the inside, because every day that goes by I know is another day I could be investing in whichever path I choose.

I guess I sort of have this plan A which is just marry my girlfriend, settle down with a job, and do the traditional route.  Work out my emotional problems as they come.  I am considering just going this route and never looking back.

And then there's plan B, which would be to pursue a new life.  I've actually been thinking about if the military, specifically air force, would be a viable option.  I've always thought of the military as a super honorable thing, and my dad and grandfather were both in the navy.  It seems like it'd be something that I could tell my kids and grand kids about one day and be proud of (not to mention veteran benefits).  Moreover, maybe I'm wrong, but the military would provide me a lot of opportunity to feel like I'm growing as a person and have a bit more excitement than just a boring ol desk job of some kind.  It would feel like it's not just all about pursuing money I guess, you know?

I just wish it was all clear, and I wish I could see 8 years into the future to know where I'd be and how I'd feel.  I'm a religious man, and I honestly also wish God would make it clear to me what would glorify him most, but he has been frustratingly silent on this for me.  Maybe either choice would, and he's just leaving it up to me.

Feeling really lost.  I admit I kinda miss living with my parents and sister a lot because I love them so much and enjoyed helping them live the best lives they could (my childhood was a little bumpy in my family, and I saw myself in a role of needing to keep peace and unity and encourage everyone in my family to live their lives happily).

I don't even know what I'm expecting to hear back from anyone.  I guess I'm just hoping for some kind of clarity, you know?  Life is hard sometimes, and I really hope I'll be happy again one day.  Maybe I'm just an ungrateful fool."

I'm having a lot of trouble transitioning. The code base is huge and just completely overwhelms me. I almost never understand what the code is doing or how it all connects together, which sucks but isn't the worst.

The worst thing is that I can't solve even the simplest of bugs. I won't go into too much detail, but basically every time I ""fix"" something, another problem comes up from my solution and this just continues over and over with no end in sight. It's my first task and I still haven't soIved it yet. This really wearing down on my confidence, I honestly don't think I'm even cut out for this anymore.

I spoke to a student (you know who you are - your name starts with P and ends with an A and I often introduce myself to you as the CGT student from California) who told me the class is going to be easy for me, especially since I have past web development experience (high school classes, silicon valley internships, etc). He also told me that the TA I get doesn't really matter because I probably won't be needing them anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

He continued to tell me that one of the TAs - David Hrusa - is alright but sometimes doesn't explain things clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know how the TA Mingran Li is, though? I'll probably pick the TA and time that is most convenient for me, but if there is anything really bad about Mingran Li that I need to know which would make it best for me to avoid her, I would like to know about it.

I have a BS in environmental science.  I recently discovered an interest in programming, and I want to switch careers and become a software developer.  I took a few semesters of into CS classes and am now teaching myself python.  I consider myself a novice programmer.

I am wondering if it would be worth it to go back to school for a second bachelors in CS or perhaps an associates in IT from a tech school.  Some of my friends do programming and say you don't really learn a lot in school about the actual job, and that teaching yourself can be a better route.  How do companies typically weigh type of degree vs a portfolio?  Would going for my associates be a good idea once I learn enough to qualify for an internship?  I know a lot of places want you to be a student, and I wouldn't have to take any general education requirements if i went to get another BS.

I recently got a new part time job that has generous tuition assistance and has twilight hours that would work around classes very well, so money inst a huge issue.  I just wonder where my time would be better spent, going to classes for a potentially redundant degree or teaching myself and making independent projects to build a portfolio.  "
9xsdme,3,2018-11-16,MongoDB or Mature NYC Startup for Internship?,intern_throwmeaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9xsdme/mongodb_or_mature_nyc_startup_for_internship/,"Sorry for yet another comparison post. This isn't meant to be a humblebrag or anything. 

I recently wrapped up internship recruiting a week ago, and I'm really grateful for having received two really great offers for next summer. I'm graduating in December 2019, so I'm also considering which would be best for full time. I won't be naming the second company explicitly, but it should be pretty simple to figure out. Both offers would be for NYC. Here's the breakdown:

&amp;#x200B;

**MongoDB**

\- 10 week internship

\- \~$40/hour, semi-monthly pay period

\- Choice of team (It seems that most interns get their first or second choice)

\- Free Housing in NYU

\- Familiarity with product (I've used it for a side project)

\- Larger intern class (maybe \~300)

\- Interesting tech stack.  C++, Python and the Stitch team uses Go

\- Clearly structured and visible internship program

\- High return offer rate, or so I've heard

&amp;#x200B;

**Location Intelligence Startup**

\- 12 week internship

\- \~40/hour, but possibility for overtime

\- I believe I will have my area of preference considered, but not specific team

\- No Housing, but Sign-on Bonus

\- Never used product before, but I've heard about it often

\- Small intern class (&lt;15)

\- Can't find much about the internship program anywhere, but I see people on LinkedIn who interned there have great careers after

\- Very interested in the tech stack here too. Scala, Javascript.

\- Very high return offer rate

&amp;#x200B;

I recently wrapped up an internship at one of {G, F, A, A} and wasn't extended a return offer. I know it was because my learning speed and technical skills weren't up to par with their standards. It was hard getting over it, but it's fine now. I know I have a lot to improve on, and I'm setting a personal goal to crush my next internship. That's why my priority for next summer is an internship where I'll be able to grow and set me on the path for my next goal of being a senior engineer in five years.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading! I'm also happy to answer questions about either company's interview process or related details.

I'm a junior enrolled in a non-cs program and don't have any programming classes on my resume, but I'm pretty solid on data structures and have a github (that I'd prefer not to share here) with a few personal projects, one with simple image manipulation, an extensible command line tool for creating and studying flash cards, and I put up a really simple bitcoin flipping bot last weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

As I understand it, it's hard enough to get an internship even if you're currently enrolled in a computer science program, so I wanted to see if anybody here has any input. I'm happy just programming as a hobbyist, but am curious to know how feasible it would be to make some money from it, and what steps would be necessary to make it a reality.

I've never posted before but I wanted to share my thoughts before I graduate this Fall. Warning: Its gonna be a long post. It's mainly the experience I've gained during my time at Tech, but also some advice that I wish I knew beforehand.  Some of it is common sense and has been said multiple times by other students and some are just my personal experiences/beliefs. Feel free to add on/disagree with the things I've mentioned 
1) During your sophomore year, get to personally know the professors in your major from major classes you take. Go to their office hours and sometimes just talk to them(if you feel like you're doing well in the class, don't be shy to tell  them that you'd appreciate a recom letter later on). whether you're applying for an internship, scholarship or grad school you'll definitely need those connections
2) Try doing research, even for a semester. Find out whether it's your thing or not. You won't know if you don't like something until you try it out. Finding a research lab during your sophomore year is recommended  because your courseload isn't as heavy. Plus, research experience looks good on your resume
3) join an organization you're passionate about. Leadership/volunteering positions are really important for your resume and you'll regret not doing it
 3)Social life. I cannot emphasize this. When you graduate, you won't look back and think, oh I wish I studied more for that second semester physics test I had. Instead you'll be wishing you spent more time meeting people and making friends. However, I will say that socializing is easier at the beginning of every semester, so try to have as much fun as you can in the first few weeks because then the semester gets crazy. Also, try to make friends with people you usually wouldnt consider.Whether its a different race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., get out of your comfort zone and get to know people who are different than you. Some of my best friends are people who are very different than me but I couldnt be more grateful for having them in my life
4) if youre still a freshman or sophomore, find  a junior  or senior in your major that you can ask class questions/registration questions. it'll make your life so much easier, trust me.
5) dating. I know most people have mixed feeling about this one, but I'll state my personal opinion. I don't want to say avoid dating, but as a female, I noticed the guys I encountered  at Tech didnt know what they want. Some didnt know how to talk to a girl, some were fuckboys or just wanted to ""hang out"", and some of the good guys were taken. If youre looking for something long term/serious, you can get lucky and find someone but generally most people at tech prioritize their academics and dont put in much effort into dating. Try your best not to get involved with guys in your classes (unless its getting near the end of the semester or you are SURE the guy is right for you) because if you do and things dont go well, youll have to see their face every week for the rest of the semester. so yeah.      
6) grades. Remember that grades are important, but they don't define you. I know people with low gpa's who have gotten jobs and even gotten into grad schools they've wanted. A lot of the times a good recommendation letter can compensate for a low gpa. Also, don't let 4/5 years of your life determine what you'll be for the rest of your life. I know Tech can be very stressful, but remember, you are one of the people who got admitted to tech. You are smart, valuable and beautiful. Don't let grades get to you and mess with your mental health or give you anxiety. Tech is hard, but you're stronger than that and you'll manage.
thats it guys. I hope someone finds the info I gave useful  and if you're also a senior feel free to add on to what I said. Hang in there guys, all of you are amazing and never let anything(esp grades) make you feel worthless or stupid. You got this!!!         "

I currently have offers from both Morgan Stanley(as a developer in their tech analyst program) and Comcast(software engineering intern) for this coming summer. All things considered, the offers are very similar and I really just want to take the offer that will be better for my career in the future. I have tried to do some research on this issue but I'm struggling to come to any conclusion.

Comcast honestly seems to be trying to turn into a tech company - they just spent all this money building a beautiful new tech campus(which is where I would work, should I accept the offer). It also seems like they do use pretty good software engineering practices. They do not seem behind, as I may have expected.

On the other hand, just from speaking to friends, it seems like Morgan Stanley is maybe more prestigious? I didn't think that working in tech for a bank was a very glamorous job but maybe thats the better option because Comcast has a kind of bad reputation with net neutrality and everything. 

I dont know. I'm really torn here and struggling to come to a conclusion. I would love some guidance from people in the field who could say which of these positions would better help me improve as a software engineer and would be more impressive on my resume.

Thanks!

I am a Software Engineering intern in one of the large telecom companies.

I am paid hourly. No benefits, PTO etc. 

I was originally hired for a summer internship. In August, I was offered an extension of my internship until I graduate in December 2019. HR also said that they would make me a full time offer at that time.

I normally work 30-40 hrs per week and I put a lot of time and effort into this job. My co-workers make me feel like a full member of the team, considering that I attend all the meetings and work very closely with my manager. I am expected to meet all the deadlines and complete tasks according to the company's standards.

Question: am I qualified for medical benefits, PTO, or sick leave at this point, in accordance with Federal or Maryland laws? 

At this point, this feels like a normal full-time job rather than an internship. I also wouldn't consider myself a temporary employee either.

I interned at a boutique consulting firm in the private research and consulting space, and have had difficulty with my hiring process. I was initially told I had a great performance review and would be given a referral by my immediate supervisor to our director to hire me. However, that director left the firm and I was left to find another team or sit and have a free ride for those last 3-4 weeks (internship is 10 weeks). I chose to do the former and luckily found a new team and project to work on. I established a close relationship with the director who left the firm (they were super interested in my well-being after leaving, and have kept in touch and seem open to me working with them in the future) and I have applied to work with them at the new firm, and I have been told I am under consideration with the team I joined later when that supervisor left. Both positions are great, and I would happily accept either, but the problem is that I have not been given an offer or even an interview and it has been a long time now, and all of my former co-workers were either given offer letters or accepted positions at other places.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to apply to other jobs, but some require a letter of recommendation, and I believe a letter from either of my old supervisors would make me look great at those places, but I do not want to appear disinterested and risk losing an opportunity I would really enjoy and find fulfillment in. Both have affirmed they would write me a letter of recommendation for grad school/other opportunities, but I am unsure if it is the right time. While they are both in a busy spell, it appears their unwillingness to give me an answer is because they are dragging their feet. It appears that after a few conversations with employees at the firm that signaling my intention to look other places might hurry them up to make a decision, whether for better or for worse. Is it wise to reach out to these people at this point in the hiring process for a recommendation letter? Part of me feels like it's that time of year to begin moving on and applying other places, but part of me thinks I am simply being impatient and should wait just a little longer/only apply for jobs that don't require letters of recommendation."

**UPDATE:**

This was specifically for the product analytics team. I don't think I can reveal the actual questions, but the recruiter provides you materials to study for such as basic SQL and a page about Facebook's various products (which you can find with a simple Google search). You can use Python or R for the coding portion too, but I've heard from others that SQL is the easiest. To be honest, the actual SQL questions weren't extremely difficult. I was given a sample table and two SQL questions. I would practice different joins (inner, left, right, etc.) and when to use what clause, such as GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

Then you are asked to provide a solution to a hypothetical product analytic question. An example I saw on Glassdoor was ""How do you determine if two users went to the same high school? (Assuming that it is not on their profile)"".

If you pass this first interview, you will be tested on basic statistical concepts in the second. Unfortunately I am unable to give insight on the second interview, since I struggled with one of the SQL questions. It was my first ever internship interview, and my first time doing a coding interview so I guess my nerves got to me :(

One internship is at an R&amp;D org and the other at a startup. What are my chances of landing relevant Internship during my masters? Would I be at an advantage at passing resume screenings? My masters Uni would probably be in top40 I reckon. 

Also, is the scene in US for data science becoming saturated? I've heard that there's a huge influx of inexperienced students wanting to break in the field. Is any of this true?"

TLDR: I'd like to work in Germany but I'm young and don't know how to do it properly.

So,  i'm from France, in la Lorraine, I've already been to Germany 3 times,  one for school trip in Munchen, and 2 times in school exchanges in  Karlshrue. That's all the experience I have with germany, and even  though I've learnt German for 7 years I have no capacity to understand  anything in german. I've been thinking about learning it again, and I  mostly sure I'll start at the end of the year because I'll be less busy.

The  thing is, I like to move allot and I've always been curious about  working in your country and i'd love it. I have a internship to do in  the end of the year ( i'm an Computer science student in his 3 year )  but since I can't talk any german there's a few chance I'll do it there,  can't even search for something. And if you add over that that i'm not a  very rich person it's not helping me, plus, it's only 2 mounths and  company don't really like that

Searching  info about that on the net it's mostly cancerous to be honest. It's only  full promoted website that are really vague about everything.

So few questions come to my mind.

Is IT really search there ? I know there's allot to do in Paris and Luxembourg.

Should I search in particulare cities ? I'd like to go to Stuttgart cause i've never had the pleasure of knowing the city.

Is  perfect german really mandatory ? I know people who where told that  english is enough but nobody would talk to them in english after coming  in the company :c

Do I have any chance if I don't know anyone there ?  
Would you recommend it ?  
What do you use to find a appartment in Germany ? Is it expensive ( appart from Berlin ) cost of living ?

Is there temporary thing ?

Do you know people who did that ?

Maybe i should get closet to Strasbourg before doing anything. Or no ?

So many questions.

I'm sorry i'm really a poor doubting soul that doesn't know anything."

I have my associates degree in Information Security, where I basically took half the networking courses and passed computer science up through data structures in C++ (without the math requirements, did not take math)

Im fairly prepared to take any of the certifications up through network+ and CCNA. Confident i can pass them with little/no coursework (although cisco related stuff i may have to do at college due to lack of equipment to learn on, and i havent done anything at all related to making wires and doing wiring)

I am fully willing to pay for courses if necessary, as long as they are less than $10,000 {prob going to do this for cisco, or go to my local community college)

its mainly like -- where do I start? I have my associates degree...

I was thinking I should start with Security+ and Network+ -- but im not sure if i should do CCNA instead of net+, skip security+/A+ altogether or what I should do.

I currently have zero work experience as well -- so once i get a cert, are there any companies that will let someone who is NOT a college student work for free on an internship? will work 12 hour days with no pay 7 days a week if someone would let me do it.

Basically I need to turn my InfoSec degree into a Networking degree by getting my initial certifications and work experience entirely on my own. I have broad enough knowledge to do it -- i just need to know the right first steps as far as certs, and how i can overcome the gap in experience.

I know almost nobody offers themselves up for internships outside of college, but i dont have any other way to get that experience, and nobody is gonna hire me as a network engineer without it. I dont \*need\* to start there, but i definitely am NOT interested in &gt;lvl 1 helpdesk as a permanent position.

one idea i had to get around it was to offer myself up for $30,000-$40,000 less than the going rate for whatever position i applied for (say they pay 80,000, i was gonna ask for 50,000 or 60,000 instead). Even if i have to survive on bread and peanut butter and live in the slums, idc, as long as i can find a way into the industry from the outside.

I appreciate any advice given."

I got a somewhat unusual job offer that I'm really excited about. Basically, it combines hard and soft skills in a way that I haven't seen other jobs in the industry offer. It's a very small company, but it's been around since 2003 and has worked with some very high-profile clients.

Anyway, they sent me the offer. The benefits package is awesome (including a profit-sharing plan after working there for a year), but unfortunately they only wanted to offer my around $67000 as a starting salary. Where I live, especially for a CS major, this is kind of low. Of course I'm going to give negotiating my best shot. I really want them to give me at least $75000, so I thought I'd make my counteroffer $80000. But I've never done this before, so I'm not sure if this will sound ridiculous. I really don't want to scare them away and make them revoke the offer.

Additionally, the job title is a bit strange—""IT Analyst"". There's opportunity for traditional development work, but the client work is supposed to come first.  First of all, that job title is generally associated with low pay in the industry. Secondly, I don't want to be pigeonholed in case things go sideways with this company at some point. I think having ""IT Analyst"" on my resume might be extremely stifling. 

I mentioned a strong interest in doing the development work, so I'm wondering if in my counteroffer email I should also ask that I can be guaranteed at least some part in their development work so that my title can be Analyst/Developer or something a little more promising, and so my skills don't totally get crammed in the analyst work. They require and pay for continuing education, so my hope is that any classes I take as a part of this should also prevent me from getting stuck in the ""lowest rank"" of CS majors.

I'm definitely not the world's most competitive CS grad, but I'm at least midrange if not higher. I've had a couple of internships (one somewhat prestigious, and the other with a wide variety of resume-building work), and my GPA isn't terrible by any means (above a 3.0). I also excel in the soft skills this company is looking for. I am totally convinced that they would be very glad to have me on their team.

Any advice guys? Thanks!

Over the past couple of weeks, I was presented with 3 internship offers and need help on deciding which one to accept. I'm a Junior majoring in Computer Science from a top 50 college in the US and am hoping to work as a software engineer for a tech company post-graduation. Ideally, I would work on the west coast, since my family is planning to move out there after I graduate. I'm also minoring in Finance and am interested in the subject (more for personal finance/learning how investments and markets work), but I don't think I will pursue it as a professional career. I'm looking for an internship where I'd be able to learn a lot, gain experience partaking in the software development lifecycle, and add solid industry experience to my resume.

**Citi ICG Technology Summer Analyst Program - 10 Week Program**

* Location: NYC (I'm from NYC so I would not need to worry about housing)
* Pay: Based on a $90,000 yearly salary (comes out to around $43.27/hr)
* Housing Stipend: $2000 that I would use on commuting

**Citrix Software Engineering Internship Program - 12 Week Program**

* Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL (They also have headquarters in Santa Clara, CA)
* Pay: $33.56/hr (But no state income tax in Florida!)
* Housing Stipend: $1000, which probably wouldn't be enough so I would have to pay from my paycheck

**JP Morgan Chase Software Engineering internship Program - 10 Week Program**

* Location: Columbus, OH (I don't have a car, which might be a problem)
* Pay: $31.49/hr
* Housing Stipend: $1500

Currently, I'm leaning towards Citrix, because it's a tech company and not a bank, but I'm not that interested in the stuff that they do (IT products, Desktop-as-a-service, Networks, etc). On the other hand, I've also heard some things about how company culture isn't the greatest at banks, with previous interns taking forever to gain access to certain things, having nothing to do some weeks, and managers not really knowing what is going on.

I also don't think I would return to any of these companies if I were to intern and receive a return offer (I don't know though, since my views might change after working), so I don't know if I should prioritize getting a good name on my resume or choosing the place that I would like working for full time the most.

If anyone has worked for any of these companies in a software engineering role or has any insight to offer, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Company A: I interviewed ~2 weeks ago with the district hiring manager on a referral from a friend of mine who works for the company and my school's career services advisor. She offered me a job on the spot at a location 25 miles from my house, roughly a 30 minute drive each way. Funny thing, my house, my school, and this location are like a triangle with each one minimum 30 minutes' drive from the other two. It is in no way a convenient location. But it pays $17/hr with an estimated 12 hours per week. I accepted the job immediately because I historically have a very difficult time finding a job so I'd take anything I could get. On Wednesday, I got a phone call from one of the store's managers to set up a time for onboarding. On the same day, I got an email from the pharmacy manager (with all the store managers and even the district hiring manager I interviewed with CC'd) that was very friendly and welcoming like ""we're so glad to have you,"" blah blah blah and it was super sweet and endearing.

I'd previously been burned by Company A this summer when they offered me a position and kept me hanging for 2 months saying they were waiting on some paperwork. So my mom advised me to keep applying for other jobs in case it fell through with them. She said Company B was looking for an intern.

Company B: Located about 2 miles from my house, pays $14/hr, estimated 8-10 hours per week. Also where I normally fill my prescriptions. I applied online and then, since I was already in the store to pick up a prescription, on an impulse I asked the pharmacist if they were looking for interns. We got to talking, she took my name and phone number, and that was that. She called me last Friday evening to see if I'd heard anything (I hadn't) and by Monday I had a job offer.

On Wednesday (yes, the same day as the phone call and email from Company A) I met with my career services advisor because I wasn't sure what to do. I hardly expected to get one job offer out of either company, much less two. She told me that Company B is currently doing very well and expanding, whereas Company A is…not. They have declined to offer full time employment to their graduating interns and put hiring freezes on pharmacists, leaving many of their interns without a solid plan for post-graduation. Company B even included this in their offer letter: ""You are receiving this offer based on your interview with [name], and the intention of your placement in the [my current city] market as a grad intern and pharmacist upon graduation."" Mom says I shouldn't worry about post-graduation right now, and I see her point. Freshman year of undergrad I was 110% certain I wanted to be an elementary school teacher. I think I want to work community/retail, but I could change my mind again.

Other things to consider:

* I calculated out the average cost of gas to go to Company A should I choose that one. Based on my car's average MPG and a high estimate for average gas prices ($3/gal), it would cost about $7.60 every shift (just for gas, not counting tires, wear &amp; tear, etc). Assuming two shifts per week, that's $15.20 extra per week spent in gas. Weekly pay difference is approximately $64-$92 during the school year.

* Since Company B is where I fill my prescriptions normally, I feel kind of screwed either way. If I accept, then my coworkers know my medications. If I reject, then I still have to see that pharmacist who helped me every month when I go to pick up my prescriptions. I don't know. I hate disappointing people.

* I asked my dad for advice and his friend happened to be listening in. Dad's friend said that the email from Company A was sent with the purpose of making me less likely to turn down the job. I think that's a little cynical; I like to believe people are generally well-intentioned and it was sent genuinely.

* I'm told both companies offer education credits (i.e. they pay a portion of tuition) after working there a certain amount of time, but I don't know the exact amounts. I know my interviewer for Company A told me what they offered; it's either $3k per semester or per year.

* I currently live with my mom rent-free. My dad lives ~3 miles from Company A's location and I know he'd let me move in if I asked. But he has a cat and I am allergic. It's not life-threatening or anything, but I do require a rescue inhaler sometimes when I'm there. I am not currently willing to get my own apartment. Even with Company A's pay and hours, I wouldn't make enough to cover rent, much less utilities or other living expenses.

I'm the kind of person who wants there to be exactly one right answer for everything and there's clearly not one here. I've changed my mind at least three times in the past week. Reddit, please help. I don't know what to do. Which one do I take? How do I deal with turning down the other company?

TL;DR - Am pharmacy student. Company A offered me an internship and I took it. ~1.5 weeks later Company B offered me an internship too. Each have pros and cons."

### Our Intrepid Crew
**$AYMITG:** A 27 yo Army vet in the American SE.  Currently run a small startup home automation and MSP service by night while working in one of the Big Insurance 3's Operations Center by day.  Focus mostly on finding my clients high-quality, open-source (read low cost), and secure software to fill their needs.  Use a lot of Unifi gear, raspberry pi's, and off-the-shelf stuff.

**$Coworker:** Employee at Big 3 but in a different line of business, from $AYMITG's former call center life.

**$8Mile:** Employee in Big 3's Ops Center with $AYMITG. Right hand and pea in a pod. 8Mile consistently wears hoodies/beanies and vans and has 8 certificates. Doesn't use them, yet.

**$Wifey:** AYMITG's wife. Great with layer1 work. Could punch down a 100 lines an hour given a tool and a Vizio diagram. Grew up on a farm and can carry you and a 4u server at the same time.

**$Intern:** 15 years old, uses the internet the way you'd expect a 15 yo boy to. Which led him to learn enough about Windows to be dangerous. Trying to round out his abilities and put him on a path of light. $AYMITG's Pastor's son.

**$Seguro:** A primarily Spanish language insurance provider, car, house, life.  Serves a huge cash only subset of society.

**$MaryMagdalene:**  Owner of $Seguro.  Early 50's, highly conservative, but lives out her New Testament Christianity with an almost infectious quality.  Endearing but aloof.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Firewall

&amp;nbsp;

After finishing his network discovery, $8Mile wrapped up his documentation and decided to shut down the firewall first. After some probing, we were generally convinced that it was the Dell Poweredge chilling on top of a filing cabinet. $8Mile grabbed a monitor and keyboard off of a client pc that was being packed and headed to it.
$AYMITG followed behind. After a few minutes fumbling with the keyboard with no response, the two went to find a mouse. Once the mouse had awoken the device, they were met with an unsightly green and grey Untangle screen. 4 options presented themselves. `Login` `Terminal` `PowerOff` and `Reset Session`. All options presented a login prompt except the `PowerOff` button. This gave an ""Are you sure?"" prompt.
Equipped with *The Documentation* they split the document into separate piles and start searching for anything labeled ""firewall"" password.


&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** Got it!  
**$AYMITG:** Hmm...me too. What do you have?  
**$8Mile:** *biblecharacteryear*  
**$AYMITG:** *sighs heavily* *differentbiblecharacteryear*.... Ok, lets try them and any combination we can find listed.  

&amp;nbsp;

$8Mile and $AYMITG begin brute forcing the password on the firewall. Nothing seems to provide them any traction and the timeout between each attempt is painstakingly slow.  
**$AYMITG:** Let's just power it down. It's not like they're under any threat here, and worst comes to worse, we'll do a hard reset and put new rules in place since there's no way to know what they have now.  
**$8Mile:** Sounds good.  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG's finger hovers over the return key for a moment, as the server whines along. Just a few moments of downtime wouldn't hurt it...right? Surely not. And they're only transporting it a mile. Heck, probably not even a mile. It'll be fine.
**click**. As the button depresses, the server lets out an exhausted sigh and comes to a stop. For a moment there is peace. A calm before the storm.

&amp;nbsp;

**$Jo:** ($Seguro worker, ancillary to Part 1) Hey $AYMITG, um...the internet is down? We were just closing the last accounts.  
**$AYMITG:** I thought you were done.....never mind, it's out?  
**$Jo:** Yeah, the whole building's down.  
**$AYMITG:** No problem, we'll have it back in just a minute. We were just turning off the old firewall.  
As he's saying this, $AYMITG reaches over and turns back on the Poweredge as it begins to whir to life $Jo leaves. $8Mile and $AYMITG look nervously at each other as the old machine begins to whine, click and then sputter out a resonating **beerp**. If you've never heard this noise, its somewhere between a *beep* and a *death rattle*.  
`Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)`. $AYMITG drops a hard poweroff on it and tries to boot again. As `GRUB` loads, I choose a much more rudimentary kernel. The **beerp** rings out again.  

&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** I think those ABCD bubbles on the front are a sort of ""beep code"" but with lights. My grandmother had a Dell I worked on at Christmas and it had a similar setup. But with ""1-4"".  

$8Mile begins browsing Dell support forums and eventually comes across a look up for the bubbles. Sure enough the green and amber lights are illustrating a permanent drive failure.  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** $8Mile, $Wifey should be here momentarily, when she is, there is an emergency router in the truck. Grab it, wipe the config and throw it in the demark room. There should be a probe in my backpack to trace these lines back from the bedroom.  
**$8Mile:** Sure thing.  

&amp;nbsp;

As $8Mile leaves the room, I can hear $Wifey and $Intern making introductions with $Jo, $Coworker, and $MaryMagdalene. ""Great, this will distract $MM long enough for us to get the network back up.""  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG walks into the lobby and greets $Wifey and $Intern.  

**$AYMITG:** Stick with $Coworker, he's breaking down the client pcs and packing them for transport. $Wifey, did you bring the extra router and such? $8Mile needs it. $MM....you know the server in the bedroom. The one on the filing cabinet you said wasn't *doing* anything?  
**$MM:** Yeah it just makes a racket all the time.  
**$AYMITG:** Well, it's not making a racket anymore. And it probably won't ever again. We had to shut it down because none of the passwords you gave us worked. It's showing hard drive issues now, and I'm not sure you'll want a full 1U server at the new building anyway unless you have a cabinet with a rack?   

**$MM:** A cabinet? Yeah, of course we have cabinets with racks!   
Worried she's going to lead $AYMITG to a yet undisclosed and undiscovered server room, $AYMITG braces for the worst.  
**$MM:** ""See! Plenty of space!"" *triumphantly* As $MM goes to the bedroom and throws open the doors of a large 1800's era wardrobe. ""You could put it right here!""  
**$AYMITG:** *Shakes head and stifles a chuckle* Not quite what we had in mind. Tell you what, $8Mile is going to get the internet back up so we can keep working and I'll start on the domain controller. Maybe we can figure out a new firewall once we get you guys moved over.  
**$MM:** No worries, and if the firewall is down, you can have it. We didn't think it was doing anything and its loud. We don't want it.  

&amp;nbsp;


### Epilogue:

&amp;nbsp;

$Wifey began helping $MM pack and label any electronic thing laying about the office. One filing cabinet was filled topped to bottom with assorted PC peripherals, old install disks, and assorted wires. $Intern helped $Coworker pack up the rest of the client PC's and $8Mile set up a temporary network to keep us spinning.     
Not one to be easily defeated $8Mile spent some time fiddling with the firewall in an attempt to resurrect it. It appears that the only thing keeping it alive was whatever portion of the machine that interpreted traffic was either loaded into ram, or stored on another disk before it blew up. As $MM didn't remember anyone touching the device in years.  


**$AYMITG:** to $Wifey and $8Mile, Maybe this isn't going to be too bad after all. She seemed to take the firewall dumping the bed pretty well.

9y6hm7,1148,2018-11-18,Tales of Ted: the cables,khaomanee,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9y6hm7/tales_of_ted_the_cables/,"This is very short, but very ~~distressing~~ fun.

Ted was on phone duty that day. Someone called because he had a problem with his monitor and Ted correctly guided this person to check for the cable connections behind the monitor (electricity, audio, video).

Except, it's Ted... I noticed he walked around his desk still wearing his headset and talking to the user. He knelt behind his desk and started guiding the user while using his own monitor as a visual guide. I mean, it's not the most egregious thing he has done, right?

Well, yes, until we noticed he was starting to panic: he kept repeating that he didn't see any kind of white connector and was asking the user to please check more carefully (you know where this is headed right?). He was increasingly agitated, but none of us intervened, because by then we were all fed up with his attitude and thought letting him squirm a bit wouldn't hurt.

Eventually our intern, a high school boy who was doing a summer internship, took pity on him and intervened, since he had understood that the user's flatscreen had a DVI socket, while Ted had a VGA blue socket/connector, and that's why he couldn't find anything white. I then asked the intern to dispatch an on site tech to try and replace the ~~VGI~~ DVI cable and that was indeed the problem.

So in the end we had a very happy user, a very frustrated Ted and a very proud of himself intern that felt like he had saved the day (he was a brilliant young boy so it was kind of sweet to see him feeling so accomplished because he had solved a ticket and dispatched a senior tech! Ah, the joys of youth!)

Bonus post-credit scene: Ted had a double monitor and the second one, the one he didn't bother to look at, had a DVI connector.

EDIT: fixed VGI --&gt; DVI :P"

I'm currently a returning student getting a bachelors degree in CS and will graduate May 2021 (3 years from now). My first and second year will be jammed packed, but for my third year I only have one class per semester (damn pre-reqs). 

If I did a post-bacc, I'd be done in two years with not many classes in between. If I did this route, I plan on trying to intern every semester (and summer) since my schedule would be more laid back. 

The question is which would make me more competitive in the job market? Would there really be any big differences to employers? If anyone went the post bacc route, i'd like your insight too if possible.

Thank you for your time.

I'm graduating my last semester for Game Design and I'd just like some help getting placed in the industry.

I'll link to my portfolio below but also give some context here. I've been applying to different studios for junior developer positions, as well as QA internships and junior gameplay programmer internships. I'm just worried I won't 'stack up' to others applying and wanted someone else's opinion. I switched majors and came to programming a little late. I have intermediate knowledge of C++, Javascript, and Python,(As in, I can read/write to files, create/maintain objects and functions, as well as data structures). Still, my main expertise and comfort area has been scripting in Unreal Engine 4. I'm still going to apply for those, ""what if"", scenarios,(cause' why not?), I'd just like from insight from anyone who has it. If not, what would be some steps to making myself more marketable/applicable to these positions? Thanks a bunch.

9y965s,14,2018-11-18,Need a lot of advice on a few questions. Applying for an internal position after a short amount of time. How to get a living wage,kindalost101,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9y965s/need_a_lot_of_advice_on_a_few_questions_applying/,"Throw away account here. I need a lot of advice, and I appreciate any one who reads all or part of my post here. Please respond if you have any advice, even if you don't have an answer to everything in my post.

The first piece of advice I'm seeking is about applying for an internal position at my current employer. I have been in my current job for a little under five months at this point. While I like the company and don't have many issues with the work environment/people, this is a very low-paying job, in fact, it is the least amount of money I have made in the last two years, unfortunately my previous two jobs were temporary positions. A position opened up in a different department from what I am currently in and the skillset/experience required matches my own. There is no possible way the position can be less money than I am making right now, I am making $1 more per hour at this job than I was at a retail job I worked in college. 

I took this job on promise of having mobility in the department, however, I have seen seven new people hired for my position, including myself, in the time that I have been here. Yes, I have spoken to a couple of people that have moved up from my position, but to see this many people hired for the position I don't see enough higher positions to ever be available to accommodate all of these people with higher aspirations. I think the truth is most people just use this job until they realize it will be more difficult to move up and they leave. 

I want to also add, this is one of the most stressful/time consuming jobs I have ever worked. I constantly work 10 hours daily and do not get paid overtime as I am salaried. So, this new position seems like a good opportunity for me to be able to advance myself with the company, make more money for myself,  and better utilize my skillset. I am concerned, that my current department will be upset at me for applying so soon for a different department and this could ultimately lead to me being mistreated/let go. When I took this job, they did tell me to wait a year before applying for other positions, however, if I have to wait a year, I don't think i'll end up staying here, even though I would like to. The pay is too low and the workload is too high for me to not be looking for other opportunities. What would your advice be for me in this case? Should I still apply, or do you think that could do more harm than good for me? 


While I am here, I'd like to ask for some general career advice outside from that opportunity. Some background on me, I am in my mid-20's and hold a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication. My dream while in college was to become a journalist, or do anything in the media field. I had a preference to do sports, but any kind of journalism/media would suit me just fine. I wanted to work in media so badly, after I received my bachelors I went back to a vocational school for a broadcasting certification. It still hasn't turned into anything. I was able to get one internship at a news station, but that was about it. As I am getting older and still working a job that doesn't even provide me enough money to rent a small apartment, I have become VERY open to compromise on what I can do for work. I've realized that the journalism/media field is a shrinking field losing jobs and wages. While I still apply for positions I see, I am still applying for just about anything I feel I can do. I did work doing computer repair/technical support while I was in college and I later worked a technical support role for a software company in a temporary position. So, aside from my education, my resume probably looks more like an IT guy than a communications guy. Although, I am much more confident in my communications skills than I am in my technical skills. I took my current job as it somewhat relates to the communications field, at least in title. The work is really just a glorified customer service position, a very high-volume, high-stress one at that. That would be fine if it paid well, but as I mentioned, I can't even afford rent on my own. What do I do now? I've done my education, I have worked hard, essentially I have done everything the ""right"" way, but I am unable to make a living wage. Am I doomed to work high-stress, low paying jobs for the rest of my life? 

Thank you for reading all of this. "

The field is already small and quite hard to get in, and I think I would only qualify now for QA tester, which is low paying, but still, there are no real openings here in Massachusetts. I put that idea in the back since realistically it wasn't going to happen in the current time, or I would have to move to another state, which is not plausible. So I was trying to find work in my backup field in IT but I'm still having a hard time getting a job.

I, unfortunately, have only work experience at a grocery store, and never worked with computers. So I'm having a difficult time having someone hire me. I have a lot of personal experience helping others with their tech issues, PC's, and anything related. My resume, posted below focuses on this since I don't have professional experience in the field, and I worked with my school's career center to build that resume. The person also was quite knowledgeable who helped me too, helped get other students at another major school find internships and work. But I'm still having a hard experience finding a job in IT after graduating this past June.

I'm not sure what to do really since I feel I'm not qualified for anything in both fields really. I actually had a meeting for a non-student internship this past week for IT but the way they were talking to me was they probably thought I went to school for specifically IT, but I majored in Game Development. I was quite nervous to myself that they expect me to know what software and how specific things worked in their company with their networks and servers. I only have self-taught experience with helping others with their problems and always used Google to figure out on how to fix their issues, the majority of the time. 

I don't know if I should just continue school for Game Dev at a local university https://www.umassd.edu/programs/animation-game-arts/, but that would set me back as I am 29 and hoping to find a career to move out or continue to look for work in IT hoping that someplace would hire me without actual experience. I won't be able to do a CS degree because I really could never understand programming. Hasbro is close near where I live and I would be more than happy to work in a place like that, so that's why I was thinking of continuing with the game degree. I asked about outcomes at the school and they said this 
""Former students have interned at Hasbro, Arnold Worldwide, Cramer, Turbine as well as many smaller studios both local and in Boston. Employment ranges from students working in game studios, again such as Turbine, or animation studios such as Blue Sky — we have two alum who worked on Ice Age. Job titles that students feel well suited for include: animator, 3d modeler, 3d sculptor, texture artists, environment artist, charter designer, level designer and game designer.""

 I was told by the ITJobs reddit that some got hired without any degree or experience in the field. I have been jobless since graduating and trying to find work, only to have interviews and been told they were looking with someone with experience in the field of IT.

This is the last thing I do before I graduate in January. 

Just as I walked in the front door last week they tasked me with setting up a Hyper-V cluster. We have just acquired another hosting company with a Hyper-V host and around 40 VM's. We only have VMware and Xen for virtualization right now, so they need me to set up their first Hyper-V so we can atleast backup these machines until they are completely migrated. I was thinking of using Hyper-V Replica for this, since the machines are at remote location.

I've been provided with two HP ProLiant DL360 which I installed Server 2016 Datacenter on and updated them and joined the domain. 

But feel so humble about this, it's feels like a mega project and there are 1000 new things I need to think about. I had a Hyper-V course in school where we set up a cluster, but I already notice that it's nothing like doing it in the real world in a sharp environment. But since this is an internship - and there is a chance for a job offer, I really want to perform good. I'd take all the advice I can get.

Here are some questions I have: 

Networking - I currently have two NIC's per server from the servers motherboard. How should I setup this? Should I have another third NIC barely for management? Is it a standard to use NIC Teaming? Should I have seperate NIC's only for the iSCSI-SAN we are going to use?

Storage - In school we just used the internal 500GB HDD's in our workstations when we setup Hyper-V cluster. Now this company says I need to prepare for atleast hundreds of TB's of data. At this scale I really don't know what to do. We have an iSCSI-SAN, with a lot of storage, so I don't need to worry about that part. But how am I going to get all this storage inside the server? How big LUN's can I use? Should I just add everything to the Cluster Shared Storage (CSV)? Is there any guides out there for adding this amount of data to a Hyper-V cluster? How big should the cluster witness disk be?

Thanks in advance!

I actually had a meeting for a non-student internship this past week for IT but the way they were talking to me was they probably thought I went to school for specifically IT, but I majored in Game Development. I was quite nervous to myself that they expect me to know what software and how specific things worked in their company with their networks and servers. I only have self-taught experience with helping others with their problems and always used Google to figure out on how to fix their issues, the majority of the time. 

I don't know if I should just continue school for Game Dev at a local university https://www.umassd.edu/programs/animation-game-arts/, but that would set me back as I am 29 and hoping to find a career to move out or continue to look for work in IT hoping that someplace would hire me without actual experience. I won't be able to do a CS degree because I really could never understand programming. Hasbro is close near where I live and I would be more than happy to work in a place like that, so that's why I was thinking of continuing with the game degree. I asked about outcomes at the school and they said this 
""Former students have interned at Hasbro, Arnold Worldwide, Cramer, Turbine as well as many smaller studios both local and in Boston. Employment ranges from students working in game studios, again such as Turbine, or animation studios such as Blue Sky — we have two alum who worked on Ice Age. Job titles that students feel well suited for include: animator, 3d modeler, 3d sculptor, texture artists, environment artist, charter designer, level designer and game designer.""

 I was told by the ITJobs reddit that some got hired without any degree or experience in the field. I have been jobless since graduating and trying to find work, only to have interviews and been told they were looking with someone with experience in the field of IT.

9ya5f9,6,2018-11-18,Never have been in a relationship,FFrog101,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9ya5f9/never_have_been_in_a_relationship/," I posted this in another subreddit, pardon me if you are seeing this multiple times.

I currently attend university and have had life long problems interacting with my peers. I have generally had few friends due to my niche interests and some AS troubles. I really shot myself in the foot in Highschool and up until last year I was almost completely awkward and fumbled around in the dark with interactions.

Now I strive to improve my dress, speech, make myself sharper in social interaction and try to make friends. embarrassingly I still live at home due to the cost of rent and a few maturity issues.

This year I have:

tried to join campus groups but have struggled to do so enough because of a commute and limited time in the city

tried two meetup groups over the summer one focused on comedy and the other on having nights out

tried forming study groups with my peers in my classes

tried going to house parties at another university

tried clubbing, going to bars

tried tinder,bumble, and ok cupid

tried cold approaching girls with a few decent interactions but nothing lasting (as expected)

This year I have achieved:

gaining a much better understanding on social game and the nature of peoples' attitudes

how important a setting and an audience are (context)

Working as an intern over the summer and learning some professional behaviors

getting some stylish clothing

losing 12 pounds (i'm overweight)

picking up some basic social cues

gaining experience and some comfort talking to girls

making a new friend

went on \*one\* date

getting my name out there a little/ having acquaintance contacts.

curbed my neediness partially

smiling more

starting more conversations and being more engaging, asking questions

I can go into detail about any of these adventures but for the sake of the length of this post I'll answer any questions in the comments.

I fear that I still have a lot of work to do.

1)I can't relate much to my peers culturally through music or through shows/movies. I enjoy more obscure things and have unfortunately not allowed myself to explore culture in years prior. I generally am indifferent to rap and prefer rock and electronic dance music. I have been forcing myself to listen to eminem, P diddy, and Lil Peep for example, and am trying to get into shows and watch movies that aren't cartoons, ytp parodies, or weird YouTube videos. I like intelectual things which are generally more masculine so joining a science club would not be the way to network and meet girls.

2) I might perhaps lack the full ability to convey emotion on my face or through my voice. I have been told I sound like I read off a script when I talk when I asked a female friend of a friend. I may not vary the tone of my voice enough or show interest and emotion on my face and unfortunately there is no way to document that. My family says my voice is not monotone but they know me. My new friend says he has no problems with the way I talk.

3) I am overweight and not lean/toned. I feel inadequate because of this and realize that this lowers my ""market value"" Part of the problem as I mostly will exercise to look attractive but not out of passion.

4) A few girls flirt a little but I don't know how to act. Not that I am too needy but that I can't reciprocate or play games with girls my age. I'm too honest and still need to learn subtextual communication and leave them with good feelings. I generally catch the memo but do not take the right action and before you know it they give up on me and stop flirting. Because few girls show interest I have a scarcity mindset which I need to overcome. because of my differences I feel I can't connect to them and I worry that I will not find a girl as unique as me. Also how do I deal with situation where most girls already are in relationships by the time I meet them?

5) I lack a developed identity or passion. two things crucial to attraction. I go to school and major in a STEM subject so I do have a life but don't have a thing that I wake up eagerly for each day. I have a few interests and used to have hobbies and I am still trying to work on that. in its place sexual addiction and addiction to the internet have taken over. I struggle with lust and this can come through. I want to get to know who I am really but school takes that time away from me, my addictions to escapism and substances also compete for my attention. my escapes ironically were born out of my loneliness as a coping mechanism. I need help here and need help learning to enjoy life ( I'll ask another subreddit about this as this is its own subject I could go on and on about).

My Therapists says the key to finding a girlfriend is to live well. I don't fully understand what that means bu I figure it has a lot to do with passion (which I lack)

I'm worried about the lack of attraction I get from girls and how I could become someone they find appealing. I worry about not getting any younger and being at the age where love is fun. maybe my mind is warped by romcoms.

any advice is very much appreciated."

9yagxg,57,2018-11-18,Do sysadmins search for the solution to a problem on google?,Herbia,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9yagxg/do_sysadmins_search_for_the_solution_to_a_problem/,"A couple days ago I got hired as junior sysadmin by a company. The IT manager told me that he will be training me for the first three to six months, after which my contract becomes internship (before that it's called ""stage"" here where I live, I don't know if it's the same anywhere else) and after another six months I'll become a regular employee.
The job consists in setting up PCs, laptop and other devices such as tablets for the company, setting up printers and scanners, and from what I could gather, also setting up networks and eventually working on on the servers too.


Now the problem is: I'm panicking. This is my very first experience like this, I have no degrees in IT if not that I attended computer engineering for a year, but that's it. I'm good with this kind of stuff, I've always solved things with my pcs or tweaked here and there on my own, even done that for friends or co-workers (in completely different fields), but I'm no sysadmin, not right now at least.


Now I don't know if this question might sound dumb and absurd to you and I'm embarrassed to ask, but do sysadmins look on google to find a solution when can't get something to work? The thing is, I know how to install a printer, or format an hdd and install an OS, do backups and so on, but sometimes some problem occurs and for as much as I can try to solve it, I won't get past it unless I look somewhere for a solution. I can imagine that doing the same thing over and over at work makes it difficult for a seasoned sysadmin to encounter a problem he hasn't already solved in the past, but what about when he first started? I would like to know if you ever relied on the help of internet during your work as sysadmin.


I know I'm not making much sense, I'm just so anxious that I'll probably pass out on my first day.

Please, don't bash me for this."

I have read a lot on this sub and Glassdoor about the internship, and there are a lot of mixed reviews, some saying it's a waste of time and others finding it rewarding. The hiring manager who selected me seems pretty chill and nice. 

The pay is great and is not a concern, moreso the experience. I'm a social guy who loves hanging around diverse people (I'm Indian myself), but I've heard that BAML, especially outside of NYC is overly Indian in the tech division. That really concerns me, because I feel like I might hate life there being surrounded by a toxic culture. Obviously, I'm only a sophomore, the internship is only 10 weeks, and tech experience is tech experience, so this probably would be a good experience for my resume? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience in this position and know anything about my concerns? Can anyone also talk about BAML does for interns outside of work, like for bonding, etc.?

I’m a French student in physics and I’m thinking about ending my studies to start others. To summarise I started in a preparatory classe to prepare the competitive exams of engineering schools. However it wasn’t a success and I finally decided to join university in order to get a degree at the end of the year. I’m currently in physics-mathematics at 3rd year but I hope to change next year. I don’t like physics anymore and I don’t see the professional potential and benefits of these studies. I don’t enjoy working anymore and I don’t see what job it can give to me.

I talked with many people and they have lot of different opinions about this because I enjoy a lot of things. However, one of my friend who study computer science recommended me to study computer science. He said that I would be good (because of my math skills and my logical thought), that it’s well paid and that my problem is probably the French system (he studies in England and think that the French system is catastrophic, which is kinda true). I also talked to a lot of people who said that it’s a good investment, and one said that he also left his physics studies for that. Thus I would really like to have information about the topic. Firstly you need to know that I just know python and algorithmic. I don’t master other things, except some basis in C, bash and swift.

My first question is : what do you think about this situation ? What’s your personal opinion ? Can you share me your experience and thoughts ?

Then I want to know who should do that type of studies. Because I heard a lot about the topic. I know it’s cliche but many people like to say it’s very social and that you’ll not only do computer programming. However it seems very focused on that. I have an experience with a school one time and it was only programming day and night with other students. Thus not a cool atmosphere. Nevertheless it could be an exception because my friend seems to often work at home.

Finally I want to have details about these studies. I know it’ll depend on the country and school but all experience is good to take. How many hours of courses ? personal work ? Internship ? Besides, is it possible to pursue directly in a master after a physics degree ? My friend seems to say that it’s possible but I find this really weird. Moreover, how to apply in a foreign country ? What’s the best one ?

Thanks in advance for your help."

Like, I'm really split on if I should apply to MIT, because their low score is like a 1400, and I'm so far below that threshold, however I don't know if the other activities I do redeem such a bad score (relative to the school, I know it's a good enough score in other contexts).   I also have to take two SAT subject tests next test session, and that's the deadline, so I don't think there's a way I can improve my scores.

Little extra information about my transcript, my freshman year I messed up pretty badly with grades, but it got better and better until junior year I took 4 ap classes which pulled my gpa up. So hopefully admissions will look at my progression as a sense that I'm getting better and better.

**Extracurricular/Leadership/volunteer:**

\-I founded a Rotary Interact Club at my school which was sponsored by Rotary International. My club participated in community service opportunities such as Rise Against Hunger.

\-Was in marching band from 9th-11th, and was a High-Ranking officer who taught new students how to march, also a first chair trumpet. We won division 4a champions, and achieved top 5 in our bracket every year I preformed.

\-I volunteered at local middle school to teach basic music for an entire year. Worked with their pep band to teach marching etiquette.

\-Took part of a Cyber Patriot team where we competed nation wide with other teams on cyber security in VMWare scenarios. We basically were given a window where we had to solve a bunch of security issues, and protect PCs. We get points per issue we solve.

**TL;DR: How do I bridge the gap between natural resources/field work (jobs I enjoyed) and town planning (job I'm getting experience in)? Other career path ideas, graduate school ideas, things I should do in meantime?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

College was really difficult for me (had a ton of stuff going on with family / self and neglected my education completely). I graduated with a Political Science degree (not on purpose). My only work experience was fast food and my stepfather got me a job working at an RV repair shop post-grad (never turned a wrench in my life prior).

I did that for 10 months before joining AmeriCorps NCCC (at 23-24 years old). The program lasted 10 months. I went from project to project, not specializing in anything in particular. After this program ended, I joined another AmeriCorps program, this time focusing exclusively on wild land fire fighting (24-25 years old). I was working under one of the country's top Fire Management Officers. I learned so much here, felt confident doing the work and enjoyed the work (I got to set forests on fire!!!). I ended up not doing firefighting after because I talked myself out of it. I feel like I have a different mindset than a lot of the people who work in field (I definitely don't fit the stereotype). Also, it takes a huge toll on your body, and I already have back and knee injuries. Lastly, it's difficult to have a ""normal"" life in the profession. You aren't employed year round at the same place, so you have to move a lot. Some of these are excuses I understand, but otherwise it seems difficult to make a career path of this.

After that, I got a job working part-time (16 hours a week on average) at an ecological restoration project and nursery (25-26 years old). I did some volunteer management here and data collection and field work, but honestly I was friends with the woman who ran the project (a previous americorps service partner) and it mostly seemed like just hanging out when I was there. I also worked part time on a horse farm, but just because I needed extra cash. Did this for 10 months before doing a summer internship for regional planning. Here, I did field work, collecting data on stream crossings and traffic counting equipment. It was sort of interesting, and an americorps friend tagged me in a job posting for entry level planning job. I applied, and got the job, starting right after my internship ended.

This job is a desk job, 8-430, working for a town government. I have benefits, time off, etc. The pay is a little bit lower than I'd hope to be making in my mid-20s, but I guess beggars can't be choosers. I'm in a new town, know nobody, and it very much feels like customer service / clerical work. I mostly send emails, schedule stuff, contact permit applicants, and answer questions regarding our planning and zoning bylaws. I've been here only since September, but I'm already questioning my decision to take this job. **It's worth noting that all of my previous jobs had end dates when I applied, and this job does not have an end date.** I could do it forever if I wanted to, but I was told that it would be understandable if I left after a couple of years.

I'm in a college town and considering graduate school. Wondering where the hell I should go from here though? My education is political science, my prior work experience that I enjoyed was in ecology / natural resources, and I am currently working in the planning field.

I intend on further developing my Software Engineering and Machine Learning skillset (especially Python libraries) on my own using Coursera and other online materials so I can possibly make my way into CS or DS for grad school later in life, but as for my EE coursework I wanted to know if it would be better for me to focus wholly on embedded/signals processing/control systems so I can leverage that knowledge to get an internship/ starting career in industry possibly working on hardware or firmware related to Machine Learning like GPUs or other ASICs, before I decide if I want to try shifting fully over to software or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current programming languages and familiarities:

Data Structures and Algorithms (no projects yet) (C++, Java)

Time Frequency Analysis, Dimensionaliy Reduction (PCA, SVD), Basic Perceptrons (MATLAB)

&amp;#x200B;

With regards to classes, which out of the following electives should I take?

Senior 1: Digital Signal Processing OR CMOS IC Design

Senior 2: Power Systems Analysis AND/OR Control Systems

Senior 3: Image Processing AND/OR Embedded Systems Design

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, do any of you have suggestions as to what I should focus on either inside or outside of class to make the most of what I'm learning as an Electrical Engineer to move towards my intended career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who reads and comments!

I've sent out application after application, been through several phone screenings and maybe 4 in-person interviews.  3 times I've been given a code quiz and each time I somehow screw up by overthinking the details and running out of time or I get so overly nervous I forget things and have anxiety attacks(I've been going to therapy and have been put on Prozac in the last couple days to combat this).

Now it feels like Entry Level Jobs have just dried up all of a sudden whenever I look through Glassdoor.  I had been considering a job with Revature(the only company I've managed to get an offer from) but after reading all the skeevy things about them I've seen on both this subreddit and other places I declined the offer from them back in July.

I don't like the idea of packing up and moving to Virginia from Washington State to work for a company with no guarantee of a job and a two year contract hanging over my head.  But at this point...I don't know anymore.

I have a support system here so I don't need to worry about food and housing at the moment, honestly the worst of it is that I'll need to start paying back my student loans starting January but I have savings built up and I could always get a part time job where I'm at.

Revature seems like my only option for right now for even getting a goddamn foot in the door. I don't want to work for them but at some point I have to ask if I even have an option anymore. One of the reps contacted me a month ago saying that the company had made changes to their salary policies, but honestly I'm still skeeved out.

Yeah I could always work on projects and stuff like that(Though honestly I wouldn't even know where to start), but will companies even look at stuff like that or will they just look at my Resume and wonder why I haven't gotten a coding job in the past 5 months?

I just...fuck man, I don't know anymore. I've been depressed for months now after rejection after rejection, and all I want is a chance.

I'm currently a sophomore in college studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Over next summer, I have two opportunities I can pursue.

The first is an unpaid research internship at a lab in my university. The professor I would be under is a big name in the artificial intelligence field, and if I do well and get a good reference from him, I think it could really propel my career in research. A (slightly unrealistic) dream of mine is to be an academic research scientist, and this has the greatest potential help me get there.

The second option is to take a paid internship at a tech firm. I'm still deciding between companies, but the two offers that I would take both pay around $55-60/hour including benefits (\~$120k prorated annually). The money is pretty good, and it would really help me pay my tuition money.  Also, it would set me up well if I decided to skip grad school and  go straight into industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I have around a week to decide and really appreciate any advice y'all have!"

I've been in working and going to school for a while now. I've had to really fight to get to the finish line but I am finally here. I am 28 and I'm graduating with a BS in Computer Science from Fort Hays State University. 

Yes, it took me longer than most to graduate but circumstances made things more difficult for me. 

Anyways. I am graduating with a 2.6 overall gpa and a 3.0 major gpa. I didn't get any internships and even if I got accepted it would have been difficult because I have had to work full time all of these years. 

I am concerned with being able to get a job. Some have advised me to start working on big elaborate projects to showcase skill. 

I'm interested in Full Stack Dev, VR Dev, and Mobile Dev. I figure a project in each might entice employers to give me a shot. What do you guys/girls think? 

Is there any advise any of you may have that may help in my situation? "
9yi41w,7,2018-11-19,I’m scared of becoming an addict.,bewildereds,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9yi41w/im_scared_of_becoming_an_addict/,"I’ve been on stimulants for 2 years. I’ve been on and off them quite a few times. I remember when I went to my first appointment. My psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall IR 5 mg and my life instantly changed. I was never diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger and I find it weird how no one picked it up. I had social issues when I was younger and I was diagnosed with aspergers so I find it weird how all these years no one caught the fact that I could possibly have ADHD. When I think about it, I never had trouble concentrating on tasks when I was younger. The worst thing that happened was my teachers complained that I daydreamed all the time and drew in my notebook during class. They also noticed my social issues and were concerned about me which led me to get tested when I was young. I know there can be overlap with aspergers and ADHD but I think they would’ve known if I had both for sure. The psychiatrist hat diagnosed me didn’t even mark any symptoms of attention deficit in his report. When I got to my 3rd year of college and my first year of pharmacy school, that’s when I started exhibiting ADHD like symptoms. I couldn’t focus in class. Everything was sincerely boring. It was torture to sit in class for 2 hours every day or every other day. Eventually I went to see my psychiatrist for other issues, she gave me an ADHD quiz, she said I was being too literal with myself, and that I *do* possibly have ADHD, and she started treatment.

I just wrote that paragraph to give some background on my life and how stimulants changed my life. I didn’t need them before my third year of college. But things started getting harder and my executive functioning started to act up. Throughout the next year, I was on Adderall IR and then I started Adderal XR. My highest dose was 20 mg. I took it faithfully and did not abuse it. I only once took double of my IR afternoon dose and I don’t remember why. I think it was because I thought I could take extra since I skipped my last dose. That was dumb of me. But aside from that, I took my meds exactly as prescribed. However one day, my doctors office mistakenly wrote me a script for 15 mg Adderall XR instead of 20 mg. I didn’t remember my dosage at the time so I just said 15 mg, because that’s what they told me. I immediately started having symptoms of stomach pain after taking it. It was so bad that they told me to get off of it. Then I had the WORST symptoms, possibly from withdrawal. I was tired and hungry all the time. I wasn’t myself. I was scared that my body would never return back to normal.  

This event with the Adderall happened over the summer and I was without stimulants for about a month or so. It was grueling. I thought “why is this happening to me? I didn’t abuse my drugs.” My psychiatrist told me it was withdrawal symptoms, and all she told me to do was drink green tea which barely helped. In retrospect, I don’t think it was healthy for me to just stop taking them cold turkey but she wouldn’t prescribe me a lower dose of stimulants for the time being.  A month passed and school started again. She put me on Ritalin LA 10 mg which gave me me massive headaches when the drug wore off. For a month I had to go without meds because she refused to change them for me. She was getting frustrated with me for constantly changing my medication at this point. I was taking abilify as well and I asked for a dose decrease since I felt tired, even on the Ritalin and I thought ability could cause tiredness, but she refused to change my Ritalin. 

A month later, I was honest with her and said I don’t think stimulants are for me. She put me on concerta. Concerta 18 mg did not work for me after a short period of time so she put me on 36 mg which still didn’t work after some times. At this point, she refused to change my prescription to another drug because she was frustrated with me for complaining about side effects or for the drugs not working. . I wasn’t taking the drugs everyday because I was scared of getting dependent on the drugs like I did with the Adderall. I was scared for my life so I thought I was doing something clever by taking drug holidays. I even read posts here that encouraged it. Regardless my drug holidays were miserable. I told her about my drug holidays and how I didn’t want to be dependent on it, since she asked if I’ve been taking it everyday and when I said no as well as what I said about only taking the drug as needed and that I didn’t want to be dependent on it, she thought I was playing games with her, and was clearly very frustrated. It really hurt my feelings when she was so rude and accusatory towards me. I even apologized because I felt guilty for being a difficult patient. I told her about my trouble tracking symptoms and she suggested that I write my symptoms down, which I subsequently did. She decided to try Adderall XR on me last time but at a smaller dose and if that didn’t work, she suggested that I go see a neurologist. The dosage was 10 mg and it worked but only a little bit and for a short amount of time. It worked for 4-5 hours maximum and then I would feel it wearing off. 


The situation got worse when I started my summer internship for school. I was working at least 8 hours a day and 10 was the maximum. I felt the meds weren’t working as well as they should be and that I needed something stronger because I was so stressed with work and I noticed I had a lack of energy that was needed to work for 10 hours with only a 30 minute break. I told her my concerns and she just said my fatigue was due to just working and my med dosage had nothing to do with it. We then decided that I would stop taking the meds since they weren’t working and she wasn’t going to increase the dosage even though I told her my meds weren’t working. She was actually surprised that the small dose wasn’t working too. She said she would try Vyvanse as a last line resort. I was curious to try *something* despite the withdrawal effects I was scared of getting, and I agreed to try it. I just had to wait for a prior authorization from my insurance. In the meantime, I was off stimulants for a month and a half. Time passed and I felt terrible. I was overeating and I gained stomach fat. I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror. I couldn’t do the things I love to do. Even surfing on the internet was a chore for me. I couldn’t do chores at home without wanting to sit down or lie down. I knew that even if stimulants made me feel like crap when I wasn’t on them, my brain was too used to taking them and had still not recovered from my usage. I was so desperate for relief from my stimulant withdrawal that I took an old concerta tablet, which just made me more irritable when the drug wore off. I awaited my Vyvanse, which was torture, and the PA was finally approved. 

Vyvanse did wonders for me. She started me on 30 mg. I had to titrate up to 40 mg because the drug stopped working in a few days. However she told me that this drug isn’t a magical cure all, and I agreed with her, but with me, it was either all or nothing with and without stimulants. I’m in my second year of pharmacy school and I’m forced to take a very tough course load/curriculum. The professors have high expectations of us and the voluminous amount we have to read as well as the boring lectures really compounded my need for stimulants for motivation and especially something to help with my executive functioning, because they give me drive to succeed in my clases. This was especially the case when my insurance was canceled due to financial issues with my school, so I could not refill my Vyvanse on time. I became emotionally apathetic to my grades and school, and I just ate all the time and watched videos in bed. I even overslept for two exams!!!  I just didn’t have the internal motivation to study hours of lectures without Vyvanse. The dosage increase made a huge difference too because when I didn’t have access to a new refill I used my old Vyvanse 30 mg pills which did not work, much to my chagrin. 

I know that stimulants cannot solve anything and I need to have internal discipline for them to work efficiently, but I don’t have the natural discipline at this moment in time to be a good student and daughter to my parents while fulfilling all my responsibilities. It’s all too much. It doesn’t help that I’m not even sure if I even want to stay in my current major. Even when I took stimulants, I found I was late to or missing class multiple times, which started because of another situation and what happened is that my school blocked me from my Blackboard account, leaving me unable to access my lectures and take notes. I subsequently became discouraged  because I didn’t take notes in class previously because I was under the assumption that I could always watch them online. I couldn’t study for my exams without good notes so I just threw my hands up in the air and gave up. I fell more and more behind because even after I was unblocked, I had days of lectures in multiple classes to rewatch. During the time I was blocked, I even stopped going to class because I was so discouraged about everything and I didn’t think it was worth it to go to my classes if I had missed things in previous classes anyway. In retrospect it was a big mistake, but it all started when I didn’t take my Vyvanse. I was disorganized and not in my right state of mind.

Now I’m in a good place now. Ive been on 40 mg for 2 months now. The problem is I realized I get really bad withdrawal symptoms when I don’t take my Vyvanse everyday. The pharmacy refilled my prescription late because of computer problems so I was without Vyvanse for the entire morning and afternoon. I felt like utter crap. It was even worse than the Adderall withdrawal. I felt like fainting, sleeping, and eating and my stomach was having issues too. I previously took a drug holiday for one day because I wanted to see if I could take it only as needed and nope, I had drug withdrawals twice. I told my psychiatrist that I feel terrible when I don’t take it and she simply agreed with me. I don’t know if I’ll be on stimulants for the rest of my life, but I’m scared of that prospect. I want to be able to function without stimulants. Is that even possible? At the moment, taking a drug holiday, even on thanksgiving, is asking for trouble. I won’t be able to spend time as effectively with my family or schoolwork. I’m required to study everyday and unless I’m just sleeping I will always want to or be required to do something whether it be a hobby or chores. It’s not like I can tell my psych to stop the medication when it’s working. If I don’t take them, I’ll be in a disastrous state and I won’t be able to get my work done. If I do take them, I am able to get my work done, go home, eat normally, control my appetite, and have some control over my own life and actions. Without it I am just a mess and I hate that. I’m taking vitamin supplements like D3 and B12 to help my brain recover from the stress it has endured  but even that wasn’t enough to help me during my withdrawal. What do I do?? Do I just keep taking it faithfully making my dependence even worse? I feel like crying, which happens very rarely for me. I feel stuck in between a rock and a hard place. 

I’ve heard people say withdrawal can take 3 months to fully resolve but that it can even take YEARS! I don’t think I can wait that long. I don’t want to be driven to suicide because the thought of me gaining weight from overeating or failing my classes is almost enough to push me over the edge. I can’t afford to let my parents down since they are funding my education. I also can’t afford to let myself down by being a bundling mess all the time and not being able to do the things I love. "
9yigmw,1,2018-11-19,Graduate school plans changed. How should I tell my professors about this?,musiquesublime,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9yigmw/graduate_school_plans_changed_how_should_i_tell/,"Hello! 

I originally had plans on applying to graduate school back in mid-August and early September. I already prepared my personal statement essay and also reached out to two of my professors to see if they were willing to write recommendation letters for me (both know me fairly well and said yes). However, lately I've been having a lot of second thoughts, and I've come to the conclusion that I don't think I'm ready to commit to a graduate program yet — especially for the program I originally wanted to pursue.

Recently, I was offered a full time job in the field that I studied for undergrad – which was very unexpected. I did some thinking, and I think it would be a really good opportunity to get some work experience, especially since I've been I've been in college for so long, and have never had an industry internship before. Furthermore, the company is willing to offer grad school financial assistance when I feel ready to pursue grad school. I ended up accepting the offer, and will be starting in a couple of weeks.

I'm really excited for the job opportunity, but now I'm not sure how to tell my professors about my change of plans. I feel terrible since I asked them early-on if they were willing to write a recommendation letter for me, and I'm afraid that by telling them — especially around this month (The application deadline is in late January), I wasted their time and I'm worried that this might burn a bridge with both professors (I'm also friends with one of the professors on facebook). I was planning on sending them an email about this, so what would be the best way to address this? Or would there be a better way to go about it?

Thanks!"

I somehow grinded my way through Data Structures &amp; Algorithms with a B, and this semester I'm taking Discrete Math and Systems Software, which I am expecting a B- and a C in, HOPEFULLY. I don't even know if I like programming anymore with the way these classes are kicking my ass.

I never really wanted a job like those at Google, Microsoft, etc. because they seem like software engineering full time. I am perfectly fine being a code monkey or doing some more bland stuff, as the plan is to work to live, not live to work.

I am taking a statistics class and am liking it so far, but I don't want to fall into the same trap of CS, where I like the intro class but not so much the rest of the major. I could be wrong, but it seems like a Statistics &amp; Data Science major would be more in line with what kind of job I'm looking for. The SDS major also requires a minor in something else, and since I've taken a bunch of CS classes already I almost already have a minor in CS. I would have to transfer colleges because my current school does not have this major, but that's ok because I was thinking of transferring anyway for different reasons. Is a stats major a good choice in today's job climate?

I have a Computer Science internship this summer at Raytheon, so maybe that'll shed some more light as to whether I should switch or not. However, I kind of need to make a decision soon, because I need to transfer for this major and I can't wait till the end of the internship for that.

I'm just feeling stressed out and stuck and not sure what to do."
9yjpy6,4,2018-11-19,[22M] My mind tells me I don't love my [19F] girlfriend and I don't like my friends,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9yjpy6/22m_my_mind_tells_me_i_dont_love_my_19f/,"Hello, before you read this its' going to be very long and probably off topic. I'm going to be as honest as I can. I really want someone to understand me. Before you say just break up with her, I believe I actually do love her (i think). The thought of being with her forever does scare me, but it scares me to be with anyone forever. I love living alone, I feel like a child. I don't like any of my friends either. I don't live with all of the basically. I have one other friend that I used to highly respect, but my opinion is changing.

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I'm very introverted and I have bad social anxiety. Being alone is when I feel the most comfortable. The reason I don't like it is because I feel like I'm being judge by friends, family, etc. I feel weird when they are all hanging out or something, but I would rather be alone. I like going out like every other weekend for about three hours, but people don't like that and don't want to be friends with you anymore. I'm scared one day they will all get married and just judge me that I'm not. The main reason's I wanted a relationship was to have someone care about me so much (but I learned I don't like it) and so I could tell people I do.

I was popular growing up, I got more social anxiety as grew up. Like I don't know why people liked me, I guess I was nice and didn't judge people. I acted kind of wild too. In high school I was pretty popular, but I was still scared to talk in front of the class. I was the only one to freeze up and didn't make sense, people told me. I actually really liked high school. People were nice to me and I was nice to them, but the best part was living at home. I had all my time to me. I could talk to my parents when I wanted to, but they left me alone when I didn't want to.

My immediate family is very diverse too. I'm the youngest by a lot. My oldest sister is 16 years older. My mom was married once before my dad. So I have two half sisters, a brother, and a sister. One sister is a doctor, another works for my mom, another is a social worker, and my brother recently became a sex offender. He has terrible mental problems. He had took special classes at school. My father is a farmer and my other is veterinarian. My mom works all the time and my dad is always outside.

One thing that really messed me up was liking a girl too much in high school. I would have done anything for this girl. I paid for her speeding tickets and even basically gave her a car for nothing. Anyway this girl invited me to a party. I just turned 16. I never drank before or anything. I got my license the day of the party and went to it. I got very drunk and cried the whole time. I was kinda mean to everyone but I did like it, because I felt like I could be myself. Then I started drinking very heavily at 16. And I was a good quiet kid everyone thought. I was an honor student and I respected my teachers. But then I started drinking and driving my dirt bike. I did it for a months. I hosted a party once, I invited the girl I liked. I told her I liked her before the party and she just said I never tried to make a move on her so she didn't know that. Well that night I kept talking to her and touching her, but she told me to get off and then later was making out with another guy. When then I got sad again and ended up pissing everyone off. Well later on she invited me to anther party, but instead of riding with me she just told me to come to it. I ended up buying her alcohol too. That night I drove my dirt bike drunk again and this time got pulled over. Instead of stopping I ran though. But eventually stopped long enough to get tasered by the police. I had to do community service I was kicked out of sports. Everyone asked what happened to me, I used to be so good and now look at me. But that some how faded and I was treated the same. But I changed a lot after that. I was put on probation and had to be home by 8pm. I never liked talking about what happened but people would always ask me. I was alone most of the time and just did push ups and sit ups in my room (like 1000 a day each). Then when ever my probation ended I still stayed home a lot. I didn't drink for a long time.

I didn't have a lot of relationships in high school. I was very horny though. Oh yeah that girl I really liked, I paid her to have sex with me.. I liked her so much. I told myself if I ever got the chance I would to anything to have sex with her. I also thought I would die a virgin and be alone forever. Then everyone found out. Nothing really happened though, it was just really embarrassing that I did that and I lost my virginity that way. I did go on dates somethings and had a few hookups. But whenever a girl would want to date me and I just couldn't do it. My friends would say she's not pretty or something and then I could never date them. But I also didn't like running on someone else's schedule. I had routine that I loved. I would program a lot and dating someone took time away from that. One girl I was about to have sex with her clothes off and everything. I just said look I can't date you and said I can't do this. I liked her but I just didn't want to be tied down. Then girls i didn't care about I would hookup with them. And others would just stop talking to me.

In college I haven't made any friends after 3 years. My first semester I did the best in my classes. I didn't party or anything. I was on the cross country team but quit because I didn't have any friends on the team. I barely talked, they said I was quiet. But i never talked because I didn't really know what to say. It's not that I'm holding anything back, I just don't know what to say. It was hard telling the coach I quit. He let me on the varsity team as a freshman. My second semester I partied every weekend. I was happy though I finally had my own room. I did see some cross country people at a party and talked to them, and they said that's the first time they heard me talk. When I'm drunk I can actually talk to people. After that semester I only partied once a semester. I became super strict again. Anyway, all my friends are all from high school. I barely talk to anyone else. I mean I don't, unless I have to. And i just don't know what to say. Like in my classes I've always felt so lost. Like I feel like a literally retard. I don't know how to study and I don't understand what I'm reading. I'm a computer science major and I get C's in all my classes. My parents are even paying for all my schooling.. I've had an internship and they want me to work there. Even there I feel weird. I barely talk and they point it out. All the other interns talk to each other and talk to the employees. I just talked to my boss and my face turns red when talking to anyone else. I felt stressed whenever I was talked to. I mumble bad, I'm quiet, I have a very small vocabulary ( so I can't understand a lot of people), and I can't think whenever someone is talking. I usually just say yes or no.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend:

I've been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 years. She is great. She is beautiful, funny, smart, and everything I was looking for. She's my first real girlfriend. We live 2 hours apart, but see each other every weekend and talk about an hour on the phone every night. Most nights I would say I don't want to talk to her. Usually I just have to listen and say yes. I don't really care about talking about my day, I never have. I tell her this. If I do have anything to say, it usually turns around to her talking for 30 minutes straight again.

We have lived together before. About 2 months after we first started dating she moved in with me while I was on an internship. I told her I didn't want her to move in with me, but she convinced me. It went better than expected, but it was still not ideal. Whenever I live with someone, there is like a small pain in my head that makes me have to control what I do. I don't like people asking me why I'm doing something. Or having to tell them when I'm about to do anything. When I spend the weekend with her. I sleep a lot more and feel more tired.

Also I don't like going to her family events. I don't like going to mind either, but she is very close to her family and we spend a lot of time there. Her brother is nice to me, but also says I never talk. Especially at the family events. Once I got drunk at her mom's house and then I started acting stupid. But him and his girlfriend was there. She said that's the first time she ever heard me talk and asked why I never talked. She said I usually just mumble something or say yes/no. When I was drunk I just joked with her. But the next day it kinda hurt. Because usually when I talk in front of them my face turns yet and try to get the attention off me.

But anyway when my girlfriend wants to go places, I tell her I don't really want to. Like she wants to travel and I do too, but for some reason I don't want to with her. She wants to go to my sister's house out of state, I like going there. But I don't think it when she's there. I feel embarrassed or something with my girlfriend (not of her). I have no idea I just like going alone. It's terrible for my girlfriend I know.

My girlfriend also wants to get married and have kids. But I don't really want kids or marriage. She's religious and I'm not. I want to change for her and I would. But I know I won't like it. But I know she's great and if I broke up with her I would want her back. The grass is always greener on the other side. I love just hanging out with her, watching movies and stuff. But I just can't image having to spend 24/7 with her.

I know I would feel this way with any partner. Like I don't want to see someone everyday after work. Have to sleep with them and share my stuff with them. I think I shouldn't be a relationship. I romanticize it in my head, but I don't like it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

My Friends:

They are all fine people I suppose. There are four that I'm closest to. 1&amp;2 of them are pretty normal, I feel like they are too judging but I am weird. 3 is just a terrible person. The 4th is just becoming too strange for me. 1,2 want all of us to fail, besides theirselves. Like if were are trying to study they come in and try to get us to go out with them or something. They've said in person that they hope we fail our tests and stuff. Or me and friend 4 have money in the stock market. They tell me they hope friend 4 loses it all. I kinda fail the same way, but I don't act on my thoughts. I tell them to study even though it makes me happy for some weird messed up reason when the fail. But I make sure my actions help them in the long run.

Friend 3 is kinda a terrible person. Like he was engaged, cheated on his girlfriend, she forgave him and he continued to do it. He would steal bikes and give them to her. He sends snapchats of him having sex with girls. He's an attractive guy and gets a lot of girls. He lies all the time and then we find out. Sometimes he says he has a problem. But people that don't know him love him. But people that do hate him. He lied about going on a date with a 40 year old, she calls me just to say how much she hates him. He doesn't care at all though. He got a DUI continued to drive without a drivers license. He sent my girlfriend's mom a message on facebook. But in the end nothing happens to him. He got a summer pipeline job made $70k in one summer. He's good at making friends though. I respect him for this. He can travel alone some where and make friends with people. He does seem interested in other people's stories.

Friend 4 is probably my best friend, but lately I don't know. He's a year older. Has a career. Doesn't want to get married or anything, which I respect. I went to high school with him and he knows friend 3. Friend 4 is started to love friend 3 now though. Friend 1 and 2 hate friend 3, but continue to hang out with him. Friend 4 know's the bad stuff he's done, but I think he wants to get girls like him. Friend 4 has done a lot of drugs too. I was recently with him and he's so cocky now. Him and friend 4 were just trying to top each-other's stories. Friend 2 doesn't know friend 4, but thought he was a complete idiot and drugie. In front of people he will just talk about dropping LSD and doesn't listen to anything you say.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I don't really like anyone, outside of my family. I'm worried the problem is me. I'm uncomfortable spending lots of time with anyone, everything over 10 hours a week is too much."

However, I also have another company that I'm interested in who have signaled to me that they plan on offering me an intern position where I could start as early as January. I believe that it will be a year-round internship.

I'm very interested in both of these companies, but I would hate to burn bridges with the company offering the year-round internship by leaving for 3 months during the summer. 

Is there an appropriate way to explain my situation to this company? Should I just straight up tell them I already have a summer position lined up and that I can only work during the winter and then following fall semester, or is there a better approach?

Thanks."

I emailed them back and asked if there was any other time this week and after looking at my class schedule they asked if I could come immediately after my 12:15 class ends, and that the second interview wouldnt be long at all.

. The organization its self is very close to my campus so a 5-10 minute walk wouldn't be a huge deal for me to get there. I'm just trying to decide whether or I need to dress up (suit and tie) or just business casual for the second interview. The atmosphere of the non-profit is really relaxed but I don't necessarily want to have to wear my suit to my classes in the morning and then rush over to the organization for the interview in it.

Should i just stick to a more business casual or should i go for the suit and tie again? "

### Our Intrepid Crew
**$AYMITG:** A 27 yo Army vet in the American SE.  Currently run a small startup home automation and MSP service by night while working in one of the Big Insurance 3's Operations Center by day.  Focus mostly on finding my clients high-quality, open-source (read low cost), and secure software to fill their needs.  Use a lot of Unifi gear, raspberry pi's, and off-the-shelf stuff.

**$Coworker:** Employee at Big 3 but in a different line of business, from $AYMITG's former call center life.

**$8Mile:** Employee in Big 3's Ops Center with $AYMITG. Right hand and pea in a pod. 8Mile consistently wears hoodies/beanies and vans and has 8 certificates. Doesn't use them, yet.

**$Wifey:** AYMITG's wife. Great with layer1 work. Could punch down a 100 lines an hour given a tool and a Vizio diagram. Grew up on a farm and can carry you and a 4u server at the same time.

**$Intern:** 15 years old, uses the internet the way you'd expect a 15 yo boy to. Which led him to learn enough about Windows to be dangerous. Trying to round out his abilities and put him on a path of light. $AYMITG's Pastor's son.

**$Seguro:** A primarily Spanish language insurance provider, car, house, life.  Serves a huge cash only subset of society.

**$MaryMagdalene:**  Owner of $Seguro.  Early 50's, highly conservative, but lives out her New Testament Christianity with an almost infectious quality.  Endearing but aloof.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Domain Controller 

&amp;nbsp;

After the failed attempt with *The Firewall*, $AYMITG and $8Mile decided to approach the domain controller with a little more caution. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** $MaryMagdalene, has anything ever been done with this DC?    
**$MM:** Yeah, about 12-14 months ago. We had to call $PreviousITGuy because it quit working. He told us he'd have to replace 4 hard drives in it. Does that sound right? I'm not sure that he actually replaced anything or that it's actually taking backups.  
**$AYMITG:** Hmm...It's unlikely that he'd have to replace all 4 at once. But its possible. Was it running at all when it broke?   

&amp;nbsp;

$MM goes on to explain that it had quit working all together and digs around in a back room for a minute producing a box full of 5 3.5"" drives. To this day I'm not quite sure what was on the drives, how she came to have them, or what $PreviousITGuy had done to/for the DC.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Well $MM, we're going to start shutting this down. Do you have that card from the other day? The one in the vase that read ""Domain Password""? We need it to bring the DC down.   
**$MM:** No, I gave it to you.   
**$AYMITG:** *puzzled* No mam....oh you took it out of that little vase and then you put them back. The only thing we took was the copy of *The Documentation* you gave us.   
$8Mile is flipping through *The Documentation* as we talk.   
**$8Mile:** Hey $AYMITG, there's a password here.   
**$MM:** *half to the room, half to herself* I know I put those back... $MM heads off in search of the password.   
**8Mile:** *typing in password* **beerp** and it doesn't work.   
There isn't much surprise in his voice.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Great, fire up Metasploit, we should have write access from one of the client pc's. From the label on the box, it's Server2012r2. I doubt if it's ever been patched. We can try to drop a RAT from there and maybe at least power it off.   
**$8Mile:** Sure thing. Hey, you sure you want me to break into their domain controller? She says she has the password.   
**$AYMITG:** Man, we've got less than 24hours to move everything and insure they're up and running. We've already been here close to 2.5hrs and I've got 8 pages of ""passwords"" from *The Documentation*. Break it, but not badly enough that we have to fix it. Besides, we have this.   $AYMITG: sorts through his bag and pulls out the ""Hold Harmless"" agreement.   
**$8Mile:** Alright man, if you know an exploit you want to use, send me a link.   


&amp;nbsp;

$Wifey and $Intern enter the room shortly after. $MM is still looking for a password.   
**$Wifey:** Hey babe, it's almost 8. We've got to eat something, want me to run out?   
**$AYMITG:** That would be great, ask $Intern, $8Mile and $Coworker what they want. This is going to be a long one, we'll just cover dinner for everyone.   
**$Wifey:** *quietly* How bad is this?  
**$AYMITG:** Bad. I'll explain later. It doesn't look like anything's been patched in over a year, the POS is showing 350k in the drawer, all the computers have PII, none of the passwords work so far and we killed a firewall. Can you get me a frisco with a large Dr. Pepper?   
**$Wifey:** Sure thing *kiss* You got this.   
**$AYMITG:** God I hope so.   

&amp;nbsp;

As $8Mile prepares his RAT, $AYMITG goes to talk to $MM.   
**$AYMITG:** Listen, we've already lost one server. I'm not trying to lose the other. If we don't have the password, maybe we should check with $PreviousITGuy.  
**$MM:** No. See, he's friends with my ex, the one with the embezzling? Did I tell you that? Anyway, there's a history there. He probably wouldn't give it to you. And I know it, it was %huntertwo or something like that.   
**$8Mile:** *snort laughing from the next room* $AYMITG isn't that the [thing?!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hunter2)  
**$AYMITG:** *cracking up* Yeah, $8Mile. Try it!   
**$8Mile:** *trying Hunter2* Nah, not it. That'd have been good!  
**$AYMITG:** *still chuckling* Too good.   
**$MM:** Well, I know it was something to do with hunting or camping.   
**$AYMITG:** $MM, we've got to get that password. I know you signed the Hold Harmless, but we really can't lose this server. If something happens to this one, you're DOA. Your whole business is going to be gone until we can stand up a new DC or rebuild this one. Since we can't login there's no way to know what's going on and the front LCD is showing a message to contact support. Maybe we should just call $PreviousITGuy. What's he going to do if I ask for it? Come beat me up?   
**$MM:** He'd probably try. He's a bit of a crazy person. Besides, I *know* I have it here.   
**$AYMITG:** We've already tried the ones in *The Documentation* nothing works.   
**$MM:** No, no. It's here. I *know* I have it.   
$MM begins digging through the 5"" thick stacks of assorted papers on her desk. Muttering to herself about having *just* seen it the other day.   

$AYMITG returns to the lobby and waits to let in $Wifey and $Intern from the dinner run. The silence is staccato'd every few minutes by a cry from $MM. ""I've got it! Wait no. That's something else, never mind!""  

&amp;nbsp;

$Wifey and $Intern return with several bags and drink carriers of burgers, fries and cokes.   
**$Wifey:** Still no password?   
**$AYMITG:** No password.   

&amp;nbsp;

The Crew begins to enjoy their dinner, stopping between bites to listen to the rustle of pages as $MM searches frantically through her desk. $MM, ""Found it! Wait no."" Everyone continues eating silently.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** $MM I appreciate you trying to find it, but I'm going to go ahead and let $8Mile start attacking/exploiting the thing. We don't have any way to shut it down, and if its unpatched, there's a high chance he can break in fairly quickly. The other option is we call $PreviousITGuy.   
**$MM:** I *know* you need it. But these servers and my ex are my last link to the past. I just want to be done with them. Just let me keep looking.   
**$AYMITG:** $MM, we're on your clock. We'll keep working but at some point you're going to have to make that call (to $PreviousITGuy). 
$MM goes back to searching. Suddenly the rustling stops and $AYMITG sees $MM sit down and start flipping through her phone through the open office door. He looks away. Everyone deserves their pride.   
**$AYMITG:** *to crew* Thank God, It looks like she's going to call $PreviousITGuy. Maybe he can tell us about the past failed drives, the DC, and the PBX.   


&amp;nbsp;

Everyone continues eating *slowly*, almost 2 hours have passed when finally $MM comes shouting from the back.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$MM:** I FOUND IT! Wait, I'll try it first! Keep eating!.......YES! Yes! Yes! This is it! I told you I had it!   
**$AYMITG:** *startled and more than a little surprised* What? How? What was it!   
**$MM:** Well, a year ago, when $PreviousITGuy  was checking on the hard drives, he asked me to send him the DC password so he could log in.   I just sat down and went through 14 months of iMessages, and I had a picture of where he'd written it down!   
**$AYMITG:** Really what was it?   
**$MM:** `!PasswordOnDocumentation!`   
**$AYMITG:** Wait. So it just had `!`'s on each side?     
**$MM:** Yeah!     
**$AYMITG:** *sighs* Thanks $MM.   
**$MM:** No problem! I knew God would provide!   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Well, lets see what we've got.   

As $AYMITG logs in, he's presented with a grey themed Metro UI tiles. Server 2012r2's familiar face loads. Among the issues are months worth of patches and security updates that have never been pushed.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Quickbooks server doesn't appear to be running? Where is it hosted?   
**$MM:** Oh, we moved it to POS1. But it's files are still on the DC.   
**$AYMITG:** *shakes head* Ok. Well, good job finding the password. Lets shut her down and see whats up. Popping the `win+r` shortcut.   $AYMITG hits it with a `shutdown -r -t 10` and listens for a restart. The machine fires up with no problems. After shutting it down and   bringing it back several times, $AYMITG decides its safe to transport and directs $Intern to carry it out to the SUV.  

&amp;nbsp;

### Epilogue

9yklas,5,2018-11-19,"My shyness is getting me potentially fired from my internship, which is slowly making me depressed.",MindlessSkyline,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9yklas/my_shyness_is_getting_me_potentially_fired_from/,"So I'm a psychology master student, who is doing her clinical internship. At this moment I work 32 hours at a mental health institution, but due a conflict at my internship I'm slowly slipping into a depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously I worked in several mental health clinics, so it was a logical decision to start my internship in a mental health institution. In this institution I have around 110 colleagues in my department. So when I started it was quite overwhelming, besides that due shortage in office space, my office was at another floor away from the department and my colleagues. This resulted in that I had problems with meeting and getting to know my colleagues, this takes quite a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a quite social awkward. But once you get to know me, I'm a friendly and cheerful girl, but the ice needs to break and I need some time. Three weeks into my internship, my mentor had ""doubts if the company fits by me as a person"". I was surprised and scared at the same time. Losing my internship, would result in having 1 year delay with my studies. Besides that.. I wanted to figure out through the year if this company is something I would want to work at when I graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that week I had to have a conversation every week in which they made comments like: this company is not right for you, you're to vulnerable, you are to shy etc. When I explained my point of view in which I just need some time to get to know people, I get comments like: you can't take critique These conversations used to be in my mentoring-sessions. I also got comment's that colleagues would approach my mentor, because they were worried about me. If I asked about who, where, when, about what etc, I would not get answers. This made me very scared to be around colleagues, because I was wondering who would approach my mentor. I really want to work about my shyness and why my colleagues are worried, but I couldn't get grip on the exact behaviour or signs I was sending. I really wanted to improve myself, so I was making reflection rapportages, models, asking feedback. In the feedback some people commented about my shyness.. I never try to apply every feedback I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck in this spiral that every time I try to relax, they start doubting again if the internship is right for me, which causes me new stress in which I can't relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week I got an invertation to talk about my internship with the management and my mentor. When I asked them about what it was they told me it's about my dysfunctioning in my internship. The management is somebody who hires and fires people, so when they get involved it's serious business. 

&amp;#x200B;

The conversations made me really stressed, I also cried last week at my internship. Besides that I'm having physical compalnts and a chronic headache due stress, have trouble waking up and want to sleep whole day. I'm familiar with depressed episodes, and I'm slowly falling into depression again. 

&amp;#x200B;

My advice questions are:

\- How do I start being less shy?

\- How do I break the circle of shyness -&gt; mentors doubts me -&gt; more stress -&gt; more shyness -&gt; more doubts?

\- I'm also worried about my mental health. Is it better to quit my internship?

\- What do you guys think about the situation in general?

I am in a crossroad trying to decide what to do as I get ready to graduate this May. 

I am a finance major with a track in Investment Mgmt. My GPA is 3.69. 
I am in the Financial Analyst Program where I have taken advanced security analysis courses.
And I am a Management Information Systems minor (learning Python, SQL).

I have experience interning for a commercial bank where I worked on commercial real loans, doing underwriting and analysis for loans. I interned for a start up doing sales. And I also interned for a tech company doing business development.

I have been recruiting this entire semester, but it hasn’t been panning out. Around 15 interviews w/ private equity, real estate, consulting, corporate. Some big name companies also, but have yet to receive an offer. 

I am starting to get a little nervous as my graduation approaches. I am considering staying longer in school to potentially double major for an extra summer to intern and another year to recruit.

I am posting on here for advise on what I should do. It would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

Someone who had been trying to help me land a job suggest that I may want to try getting an internship, considering that the thing that I may be lack in actual experience. I balked at this because I have always thought of the people getting internships where college kids or people fresh out of college with no experience who could still afford not getting paid to work. so I assumed that even if I applied to something that my resume would be rejected.

Is this the case? Or are there companies hiring 30-somethings with some level of experience still trying to get a bit more so that they can land a stable full time job?"

However, I feel sacrificing the hardware component of my studies may not be worth it (despite all my internship experience being software).

Would it be worth it? Am I losing something that I'm not seeing? Transferring to another University is not really an option, and I really dont want to work on a BS for 6-7 years (Despite going at a good 15-18 credit pace)."

1. Offer from a well known IB (think GS/JPM/MS), but not at their main UK office (think Glasgow, Bournemouth etc) since I applied a bit too late.
2. Offer from a less globally prestigious IB, but which is still comparatively strong in EU (think CS, UBS, BNPP, Barc), but at their main London office.

I would definitely prefer to live in London after graduating, however I don't really mind the location for the internship.

The Cybersecurity classes covered security +, CySA, CEH, and CCISP.

I am currently working as an intern in my schools IT department and also the president of the computer club, which runs a pc repair clinic that services students and staff personal computers and various tech devices. On a personal level I have been using computers since the 80's and have experience in every windows OS.

I am really terrible at taking tests and am not sure if I would be able to pass any certification tests.

Asked professors for recommendation letter for PhD applications but no response,motivated_daydreamer,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/9yskky/help_asked_professors_for_recommendation_letter/,"Hi, I want to apply for PhD and masters programs in CS in North America. Recently I took the GRE and the TOEFL. A week ago (1 month before deadlines) I e-mailed some professors and asked them my intentions and kindly asked them if they would like to write me a recommendation letter for that cause. They haven't replied yet and the deadlines are on 15 Dec.

First professor is a professor I did research internship with (in another country), and a PhD student of him advised me. We wrote a paper together and we intent to submit it to a conference in two weeks. He is my main trump card and without his letter I don't stand many chances.

Second professor is my Bsc thesis advisor. Our relationship is very lukewarm but given I did my thesis in his lab it seemed appropriate given alternative choices as well. I explained to him back then that I would apply for US programs.

Third professor is a professor that I took As in his 3 of his courses (in two of them I was one of the few students that got that grade). We don't have any relationships further than that. I'm counting on him for my ""Did well in class recommendation"", not much but it's something.

I'm scared now because one week has passed and none even said ok, no reply. I've wasted more than 1000$ on exams and preperations at this point, plus 3 months of my life and I'm scared I won't be even able to apply. I'm worried that I sent them an email too late (even if it's 1 month + before application deadlines).

Are they that busy that they can't even reply a yes I'd like to or or no?

I thought I wanted to maybe make games, I have all these ideas (like everyone else) but the more I look into it the more it seems that working in the games industry isn't as fun and idealistic as it seems on the service.

I consider myself a good programmer for the point I'm at, and I know I want to be a software engineer of some sort, but I don't know what area will give me the best opportunities to achieve the life I want.

I'm a creative person and want to work in a place that will let me express this creativity somehow. 

I'm a pretty outgoing person and would like to work with people who share this nature.

but most importantly:

# I want to make cool stuff

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure that goes without saying for the most part. But I don't think I could ever see myself doing something that doesn't excite me even a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of a area I would love to work on is the personal AIs like Alexa, Siri, Echo, etc...

But with that in mind how would I start a path that leads me to working on projects like those in the future?

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)?**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build?**

Primary for gaming, this is my first build so i want to try every genre of games. i used to play only League of Legends because my old laptop couldn't handle anything else but I’m pretty tired of it, i just want to come home, play a couple hours and relax so I’ll try games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077(Later). I’m also pretty interesting in FPS tho, so I will definitely try Overwatch, CS:GO and maybe PUBG.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

I want to game in 1080p and 144Hz i have no problem in tuning down settings to achieve 144 FPS.

**What is your budget ?**

i'm from Colombia and doing my internship so i do not have a great budget ($900) USD, but i can be flexible with this since I’m already told to stay in the company with better salary.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Although I’m from Colombia i will be buying the parts in the US and they will be shipped to Miami, from there i will get the parts shipped from a friend.

**$AYMITG:** A 27 yo Army vet in the American SE.   Currently run a small startup home automation and MSP service by night while working in one of the Big Insurance 3's Operations Center by day.   Focus mostly on finding my clients high-quality, open-source (read low cost), and secure software to fill their needs.   Use a lot of Unifi gear, raspberry pi's, and off-the-shelf stuff.  

**$Coworker:** Employee at Big 3 but in a different line of business, from $AYMITG's former call center life.  

**$8Mile:** Employee in Big 3's Ops Center with $AYMITG.  Right hand and pea in a pod.  8Mile consistently wears hoodies/beanies and vans and has 8 certificates.  Doesn't use them, yet.  

**$Wifey:** AYMITG's wife.  Great with layer1 work.  Could punch down a 100 lines an hour given a tool and a Vizio diagram.  Grew up on a farm and can carry you and a 4u server at the same time.  

**$Intern:** 15 years old, uses the internet the way you'd expect a 15 yo boy to.  Which led him to learn enough about Windows to be dangerous.  Trying to round out his abilities and put him on a path of light.  $AYMITG's Pastor's son.  

**$Seguro:** A primarily Spanish language insurance provider, car, house, life.   Serves a huge cash only subset of society.  

**$MaryMagdalene:**  Owner of $Seguro.   Early 50's, highly conservative, but lives out her New Testament Christianity with an almost infectious quality.   Endearing but aloof.  

&amp;nbsp;

### The PBX

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG and $8Mile slowly make their way to the demark room.  Among all the horrible things in the building, this is the worst.  

&amp;nbsp;

The demark room sits on an exterior wall and is lit by a single bulb in a utility lamp with a small clamp.  As the door swings in, its necessary to take turns entering the room.  
$8Mile steps in, closes the door, shimmies between an A/C return and the wall, and opens the door.  $AYMITG does the same.  On the other side are 40 years worth of datacom and security equipment.  
Old PBX's, 110 block punch downs with mangled and detached wires, Security systems from companies that boomed and burst before $8Mile was born, and among it all hangs a waterfall of multicolored CAT3, 5, and 6 cables that end in a 24 port punch down panel.  

&amp;nbsp;

To the left is a deep sink with a small attached shelf for mixing chemicals.  A set of thin stock shelves go from eye level the 10+ feet to the ceiling.  And situated underneath, covered in splashes of dried unknown fluids is *The PBX*.  

**$AYMITG:** What.  The.  Hell.  They mounted it under the sink!?  
**$8Mile:** Looks that way.  There's a Cisco unmanaged switch down here too.  Looks like that's where all the patch downs run to.    

&amp;nbsp;

Following the cables, $8Mile locates a single cable not coming from the patch down panel.  It is connected to the LAN port of a Netgear $40 Walmart special.  Luckily, $8Mile had already cut the network over when the firewall failed.  Running a line from the ONT, directly to the emergency router.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** How do you want to handle this.    
**$AYMITG:** Do you remember the BOFH?  
**$8Mile:** Yeah?  
**AYMITG:** *With a devilish grin* Cut em.    
**$8Mile:** Cut em?  
**AYMITG:** Yep.  Cut em.  I'll leave a card and a note that we didn't wire it but we'll be happy to re-wire it.....for a cost.    
  
$8Mile smiles back and starts cutting through the cables.    

**$AYMITG:** Once you get the cables cut, and the patch panel and switch down, we'll figure out how to shutdown this *PBX*.    
**$8Mile:** Good deal.  Think they'll call us to rewire it?  
**$AYMITG:** If they think we wired this mess...they'd be crazy too.    

$AYMITG leaves $8Mile to his task and goes to find $Wifey.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Hey bb [Read bee-bee], did you drop the rack over at $NewSeguro?  
**$Wifey:** What rack? Oh.  No, I haven't bought it yet.  Or the oscillating multitool.  [This was a necessity as $NewSeguro had Plaster? Or some other odd internal wall covering.]  
**$AYMITG:** What!? We've got to start wiring ASAP and I've got to have a rack to put all this stuff in.  We can't just lay it around on furniture....again.    
**$Wifey:** Well, I was running late picking up $Intern and you needed the probe's and everything so we just came straight here.    
**$AYMITG:** Please just go straight to the store and grab everything.  We're going to move the PBX and then we're done here.  We'll spend the rest of the evening at $NewSeguro.    
**$Wifey:** Ok, well it'll probably take me an hour.  I'll check at the store local, but I'll probably have to drive across town to the larger one to find it at this time of night.    
**$AYMITG:** No worries, just try and meet us over there by 10?  *groans* Oh God, we've already been here 4 hours and we haven't even started the other building.  Bring back some cokes or snacks or something to.    

$Wifey and $Intern depart and $AYMITG goes to check on $8Miles progress.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** It's a Samsung.  There was a model number on the front.  OfficeServ something or other.    
**$AYMITG:** Did it show up on the NMAP scans?  
**$8Mile:** Not sure, let me grab my laptop and see what it says.    

&amp;nbsp;

As $8Mile departs, $AYMITG crouches next to the PBX and begins to examine it.  Years of abuse are accumulated on the case.  The phone lines run from somewhere above and appear to have their genesis in a small 66 block on the far wall.    
The case features smears and stains from assorted chemicals that have slightly corroded the case, and it appears that the battery and grounding cable are long removed or never installed.  A single power line runs to a 600VA UPS mounted nearby.    

&amp;nbsp;


**$8Mile:** Hey, the PBX is in the scan.  Looks like 8080 and 443 are open.  I'm going to plug straight in and see if I can hit them.    
**$AYMITG:** Great, I'll start googling for default credentials and flipping through *The Documentation*.    

&amp;nbsp;

As $8Mile types in the IP address, Chrome greets him with the ugliest interface this side of the dotcom boom.  A sickly grey thatched background with neon red lettering reads ""ORACLE JAVA RUNTIME 5+ IS REQUIRED TO DISPLAY THIS PAGE.""  
$8Mile groans and navigates to the Java site.  Downloading the latest Java package, $8Mile attempts to coax Windows and Java to play with Chrome enough to get at least a login screen.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** $MaryMagdalene, can you log in to the phone system?  
**$MM:** Like on my phone? Sure, I have to.  To check the voicemails.    
**$AYMITG:** No, like on a computer.  To turn off the phones at night, or set a holiday message or something?  
**$MM:** No! But that would be *really great*! Can you do that?  
**$AYMITG:** Well, if I could find a password.  But I'm not having any luck yet.  $8Mile is trying to log in to it.  Then we're going to shut it down.  If we can't find the passwords though, we may have to just pull the power and pray that it is set to auto-start after a power outage.    
**$MM:** What? No! You can't unplug it.  If it gets unplugged and breaks I'll lose all my messages and I haven't listened to them all today!  
**$AYMITG:** Well, there can't be that many.  Go ahead and listen to them while we're working on it and we'll see what we can do.  
**$MM:** There's no way.  I've got a 170 messages on there.  Plus, all my saved messages.  
**$AYMITG:** *mumbling to self* 170...because of course you save business critical voicemails to the pbx...  
**$MM:** What was that?  
**$AYMITG:** Nothing, was just remembering an IT saying about ""Outlook not being a file storage system.""  *ignoring $MM's puzzled looks.* ""Look there's another possibility if we can't get in to it.  It appears there is a battery backup on it.  If we can't get in, we'll move it powered on.""  
**$MM:** Really? You can do that?  
**$AYMITG:** Well.  We don't really have a choice.    
**$MM:** Thanks $AYMITG.  $Coworker said you guys were geniuses.  
**$AYMITG:** Yeah....something like that.  

&amp;nbsp;


$AYMITG wonders back to the demark room.  
**$8Mile:** Any luck?  
**$AYMITG:** No, not quite.  She's got a 170 new messages and a bunch of saved messages.  How about you, Java working?  
**$8Mile:** Not yet, apparently the 5+ means ""Not any version you might be able to easily find or download.""  
**$AYMITG:** Hmm...I'll go take a look.  Maybe Oracle has an archive or something.  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG puts his google-fu to work and comes up with an Oracle archive full of old Java packages.  After a 15 minute process of registering for an Oracle account (of which he'll never use again) and waiting on a confirmation email (which he had to accept before he could use the download manager), he had a copy of what purported to be Java 5.  
Throwing it on a jump drive, he heads back to the demark room and passes it off to $8Mile.  After a few installs, uninstalls, and restarts, $8Mile throws up his hands.  

&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** It's not working.  Chrome won't play nice with Java.  Java doesn't like Windows.  And the web interface doesn't believe I'm running java.  
**$AYMITG:** *throwing up in his mouth a little at the thought*  did you try IE?  
**$8Mile:** Yeah, I had to re-enable it, but even that didn't work.  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Alright, we're going to do something crazy.  Let me go clear a path.  Go ahead and photograph, label and detach everything except power from the PBX.  

As $8Mile began to extract the PBX from the mess of cabling, $AYMITG began to prop open doors, and clear outlets between the lobby and the demark room.  
**$AYMITG:** $Coworker, come here real quick.  Move these boxes off this desk.  And help me prop open the doors.  $8Mile and I are fixin' to do something really stupid.  

&amp;nbsp;

Back in the demark room, $8Mile has successfully extracted the PBX from its ""cupboard under the stairs"".  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Alright man, we're going to run it.  
**$8Mile:** Run it?  
**$AYMITG:** Yep.  You're going to carry the pbx and I'm going to detach the UPS from the wall and we're going to run.   
**$8Mile:** Where?  
**$AYMITG:** To the lobby.  There's a desk there and a plug-in.  If it survives that long, we're going to put it in the car.    
**$8Mile:** In the car?  
**$AYMITG:** Yep.  It's our only hope of keeping it up.  And I'm not going to keep screwing around with Java.  Ready?  
**$8Mile:** As I'll be.    

&amp;nbsp;

$8Mile disconnected the PBX from it's mounts as $AYMITG removed the UPS from the wall.  Both ensured that the power connections were seated as well as possible.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** *yelling* $Coworker, Are you ready?  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG reached for the UPS cable and started to give a slight pull.  At that moment the A/C kicked in and $AYMITG and $8Mile jumped.    

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** *breathlessly* Oh.  God.  I think I peed a little.    
**$8Mile:** Yeah it got me too.    
**$Coworker:** Did you hear me? Are you guys coming?  
**$AYMITG:** Yeah! Here we go!  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG yanked the power cable from the wall as $8Mile and the PBX navigated the in and out game of the demark door.  Running through the lobby, employees and $MM looked on as the duo ran in between the corridor of boxes and gingerly set it down on the desk.  As $AYMITG plugged in the UPS it made a soft **beerp**.  
The room was breathless for a moment as the UPS gave a second happy little **chirp** and stayed powered on.  The PBX seemed to be unphased by its recent journey.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$8Mile:** Wow.  It worked.  
**$AYMITG:** Yep, Now lets see if the messages are still there.  And pray it'll do it again.  In a car.  Down the road.  About 5 times the distance.  

&amp;nbsp;

$8Mile grabs a phone and begins to navigate the oddity that is the PBX.  After a few punnet squares and a few trashed diagrams it dawns on the pair that the phones are agnostic.  It only matters to the phone which port it is in as to its extension assignment.  
Knowing this, the pair is quickly able to establish which extension go to which part of the media card and label everything up.  Once the ports found, it shows that there really *are* 170 New Messages on $MM's phone.  $MM who was standing nearby nervously watching lets out a quick exclamation and says, ""See.  Geniuses.""  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Alright man, $Wifey should be at $NewSeguro with the rack by now.  I'm going to call her and have her prop open the doors.  Also, there's a 12v inverter in my car.  Grab a bunch of the UPSs.  Daisy chain them, and plug the lead into the inverter.  We're going to get stupid.  
**$8Mile:** Wow. Ok. Let's do it.  


&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG makes the call to $Wifey and explains what's going to happen.  She disapproves but any sane person would.  $AYMITG props open the doors on his sedan and helps $8Mile with the daisy chain.  
As the UPSs get plugged in, the engine starts to let out a strained cry.""Come on, hang in there.  Just one more time.  And you'll never have to do this again,"" $AYMITG lies.  

&amp;nbsp;


$8Mile and $AYMITG finish the chain and head inside to pickup the UPS and PBX.  They explain to $MM where they're going and that they won't be back.  She understands and wishes them luck as they head out to the car.  
With both rear doors open, $AYMITG scrambles across the mess of cables in the back seat and out the otherside, plugging in the UPS as he goes.  $8Mile gingerly rests the PBX on the back seat and closes the doors.  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** You riding with me or driving separate?  
**$8Mile:** If we're not coming back here, I'll drive.  Good luck, and be careful.   
**$AYMITG:** *laughing* Aren't I always?  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG jumps into the car, slams the poor stick in Reverse as the engine roars.  Not because he has any super performance vehicle, but because he hit a 2 bed 2 bath pothole the other day and the downpipe from the exhaust tore loose before the cat and its essentially straight piped now.    
As he makes his way into the busy road, the UPS makes an audible *click* noise as the battery engages.  The car lets out another soft whine and the lights dim momentarily.    

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG begins to pray. ""God just let me make it to the rack.  I can't lose the firewall and the PBX in one night.""  

&amp;nbsp;

As the UPS sets into a rhythmic ticking of battery on - battery off, $AYMITG imagines sand falling through an hour glass as the Tech God of Death sits at his computer, clicking delete in time with the UPS.  

&amp;nbsp;

*169 Messages.* *click*  
 *delete*  
*168 Messages.* *click*  
*delete*  
*167 Messages.* *click*  
*delete*  

&amp;nbsp;

$AYMITG slams the pedal down and the cars lights go back to a normal brightness.  The UPS clicking stops and the exhaust screams as $AYMITG speeds down the road.  Consequently $NewSeguro is barely 3 minutes away, so $AYMITG jumps into the turning lane and whips into the handicap parking outside $NewSeguro.  
$8Mile is waiting and immediately swings open the rear door.    
**$AYMITG:** HURRY! Its *CLICK*ing!  

&amp;nbsp;

$8Mile picks up the PBX as $AYMITG monkeys across the back seat, unplugging the UPS as he goes.  $Intern is waiting at the door and immediately points the way to the rack.  As the PBX is slid onto the rack, it lets out a soft whine, and the UPS makes another loud *click*.  
**$AYMITG:** NO.  No no no.  Grab a phone.  Right now! Get a phone.  
$Intern comes running into the room with a phone.  Without thinking to pull up the diagrams, $AYMITG starts plugging the phone into each port.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Initializing.**  
** 6 New Messages**  
""Nope, wrong port.""  
**Initializing.**  
** 4 New Messages**  
""Damn it.""  
**Initializing.**  
** 170 New Messages**  

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** Oh God.  Thank you.  Wow.  It was clicking.  I was sure it was over.  Man.  $Intern.  $8Mile.  $Wifey.  Thanks.  
**$Group:** No problem.  

&amp;nbsp;

As $AYMITG comes down off the adrenaline of his crazy ride he starts to look around the room in $NewSeguro that is the equipments new home.  
On the ground is a single DVR, a single CAT5 drop, and an unplugged Unifi Edge Switch.   

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** What the....I thought this was a business!? It's basically a house.  And where are the drops? Did you all see any in the rest of the building?!  
**$Wifey:** No.  It's all plaster and power on the baseboards.  There's a single AP in what was probably a living room but it doesn't connect to anything down here.  I put the rack here because I assume this is where the WAN came in.  It's the only drop we found.  

&amp;nbsp;

As $Wifey speaks, the light suddenly goes out of $AYMITG's eyes.  There's no drops.  This means we'll have to wire drops for every room.  For phone and internet.  He only asked $Wifey to bring one box of cable.  He'd hoped to find a lot of untermed cables he could punch back down.  But something inside him knew better.  It'd known all along.    
This is the job that never ends.

9yty70,1,2018-11-20,Switching from Computer Engineering to Software Engineering?,AssClapper,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9yty70/switching_from_computer_engineering_to_software/,"Long story short:

My university's CompE program is WAY too long! (167 credits / unrealistically 5 years).

The Software engineering program is newer and has less credits (12 less). By switching I can basically move a semester ahead.

I had an internship last summer and I'm going to another next summer, so I don't THINK I'd be affected job-hunting wise (they are both software engineering related anyway...)

However, I feel sacrificing the hardware component of my studies may not be worth it (despite all my internship experience being software).

Would it be worth it? Am I losing something that I'm not seeing? Is one regarded with more respect than the other? Transferring to another University is not really an option, and I really dont want to work on a BS for 6-7 years (Despite going at a good 15-18 credit pace).

Thanks!

9yty98,2,2018-11-20,I'm at a Crossroads and not sure what to do?,DenseRepresentative,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9yty98/im_at_a_crossroads_and_not_sure_what_to_do/,"So I'm at a crossroads in life where I have to try and decide what I need to do and I'm not sure what I want or what the best decision is?

A little backstory, I moved from the state I lived in for most of my life to a state on the other side of the U.S. because it gave me the opportunity to go to college and live with my parents so I could escape a dead end job and no chance of moving up in life really.  After some experimenting I decided on an IT degree and now I'm two semesters away from graduating, I've also learned how wrong 18 year old me was and how much I love school and college and doing well in it.  Now I'm working a part time job with small company where I do marketing while going to school and I actually can say I like going to work.  I'm 26 and still live with my parents and I'm just trying to get back into world and be independent again.  My crossroads starts here though as I have a few different ideas what to do and I'm very unsure of what to do I'll just list them in bullet form that way it's easier to pick them out.

* The company I'm with has offered me a full time job if I want, it's not a field I'm crazy about but I like it and the people I work with, the pay is decent for the area where I live which is kinda low income, if I chose this I'd find an apartment maybe ten minutes from where I live now because I could afford it and despite loving my parents, I can't stay with them much longer without going insane. 
* I intern with a Internet company as part of my degree and even though they're not offering any kind of job when I graduate, the guy I work underneath has told me to apply for a couple IT jobs that have popped up in our local area.  He has good community connections and he said he'd give me a good recommendation, i'd finish my degree while working this job if I was lucky enough to get it that is. 
* I've been wanting to go to main campus of my college where I would start a secondary ED degree in history which is something I'm very passionate about but it would mean starting from nothing again and accumulating actual student debt which I don't have from my current community college.
* My final thought was to act on my long term goals and just continue working on my degree while living with my parents and then apply for jobs in Washington state where I want to live out the rest of my days once I finish. I know an associates degree won't matter much there but still I'd like to try and i'm not trying to be rich.

Basically the problem is I don't know if IT is for me or not, at my internship  I feel incredibly dumb and incapable of the skills of any of the current employees have and this makes me think I don't like or that i'm just not smart enough to do it.  I kinda confided this fear to my mentor there and he said that's fine and that you pick up a lot of skills working jobs and getting in there as he felt that way until after a few years working part time at a pc repair shop.  The thing is IT would be easier to get a job with in Washington or any other place instead of second ed because of certain state limitations.  I'm just not sure what to do but I do know long term I want to get out of this state as it is not for me and just makes me feel horrible all the time so the sooner I can leave the better. 

I'm not trying to outsource my problem for other people to solve for me I was just hoping for some advice on methods of how I could go about deciding what I really want and what would be the best decision for me, it's funny how I now have opportunities and  I'm overwhelmed with them and  I kinda miss the simplicity of that dead end job and just struggling to pay bills.

9ytyhj,5,2018-11-20,Should I do internship in Ruby on Rails instead of Mean Stack for 6 months?,Rkpandey123,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/9ytyhj/should_i_do_internship_in_ruby_on_rails_instead/," 

So I bagged internships in Full Stack Developer role at 2 startups.

The first startup has an enterprise SaaS product. My work is going to be on Ruby, RoR, ReactJs, Nodejs, Scripting (on Python, Bash), PostgreSQL, Linux (Admin commands, user, process and memory management, shell scripting, sed, awk), AWS and web server. They are paying me $285 (I will save just $140 as it's in a better city, 3 hours away from my home).

The second startup has a small e-commerce website and they also work on building websites acc to clients needs. So acc to the client requirements, they will make me work on any javascript framework, any css framework, any php framework, any database and linux. They are paying me $150 (and it's in my home city itself).

I am very confused. Please help. The stipend is not really an issue for me. I just want to choose what will be better for my future and career."

I started working there in May 2017 as an intern, worked as an intern until May 2018, and then came on full-time in June 2018. I love my job, my team, and my boss.

I've been approached by two different people (although informally / unofficially) asking if I would be interested in a manager position. It's the next level up from my current job. I don't think I'd enjoy the  manager position as much as my current job - I don't consider myself a client-facing person and the manager position would require that often. It also is a very stressful and hectic job where people often work longer than their typical workday or at odd hours whenever things go wrong.

I know that it's smarter to take the position - the fact that I would be a manager at 22 and would receive a salary raise have big implications. But I also don't feel like it's a job I want to go into or would enjoy.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? What did you do? What do you recommend I do or consider to make this decision?  


UPDATE: I've declined the position - the timing is wrong and I don't feel ready. u/stormbytes was right about me needing validation to decline instead of actual advice. Our department is always hiring for managers and I know there will be plenty of opportunities in the future for me if I choose to pursue it. Thanks to everyone who replied!"

I haven't found a comprehensive list or blog that posts such things to the fullest extent. There are search engines for STEM programs/competitions but they don't include a lot of what I find scattered elsewhere on the internet.

Major GPA: 3.59 on 4.0 scale

Threads (basically concentrations): Intelligence &amp; People (AI and HCI, basically)

I have not yet taken the GRE. What would be a solid score to get me into good programs like Georgia Tech, UC Berkeley, or UW? If it's worth anything, I managed to do really well on the SAT in high school with enough practice. I assume the GRE will be a similar game.

Industry experience, if that matters: Software Development Intern at Amazon (current), Summer Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs, Software Engineering Intern at FICO

Teaching experience: Web Development TA for Duke TIP

9yvf9w,9,2018-11-20,Capital One vs Two Trading Frims (Internship),skippy_the_dolphin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9yvf9w/capital_one_vs_two_trading_frims_internship/,"Hi everyone! I'm currently a sophomore and have been fortunate enough to get a few great offers, but am still having trouble deciding between three companies. Can anyone give me any insight on what they'd pick?

##Location
#####Capital One: NYC

I grew up close to NYC, so it's very familiar and comfortable to me. The biggest thing drawing me to stay is the fact I have so many friends that will be in the area

#####Trading Firms: Chicago

I've only visited Chicago a couple times, but it started to grow on me. I'm mostly worried about the fact that I won't know as much people in Chicago, especially given that the intern classes for these two companies are no more than 4 developers.

##Compensation
All are in the low six figures, where Trading Firm 1 &gt; Capital One &gt; Trading Firm 2, though not by much. However, Chicago taxes are also lower than NYC. Additionally, Capital One and Trading Firm 1 both offer free housing, but Trading Firm 2 does not.

##Culture
I definitely enjoyed and fit in most with the culture at Trading Firm 2. Additionally, I liked their office the best, which is an upper level floor and patio that overlooks Chicago. Capital One definitely has a low stress culture and the laid back office with ping pong tables and arcade machines are a manifestation of that. Trading Firm 1 seemed a little more stressful given that it's the smallest of the three by far and it seemed to have a very ""work first"" attitude, though I still got along with the people that worked there.

##Work
I love working on low level systems, which is what I'd be doing at one of the trading firms. None of the projects that previous C1 interns told me they worked on excited me as much as having the opportunity to do core development in trading.

Right now, my thoughts are around trying to balance pay vs culture and work enjoyment vs location enjoyment/low stress. Can anyone offer their insight on what they'd pick or what they think is more important? Thank you!"

I'm a 23 yr old finishing my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology, and after my curricular internship, I realized I don't want to spend the rest of my life inside a laboratory and that I should've follow throu my dream since high school, which was IT (I was completely stupid because I wanted to get in IT in a specific school and only applied to it, it backfired and i didnt get in so I took another course, biotechnology).

&amp;#x200B;

I have decided to get in the IT world no matter what but now I'm left with three options that I can see at least;

\- Get a new bachelor's degree in IT and waste 3 years, getting only into the working world at 26/27 yrs of age;

\-Get a master's degree in Big Data Analysis and Engineering (going into IT masters is impossible since I dont have a IT background in the bachelors) that will take 2 years, the last one being a dissertation;

\-Be a self-taught programmer that will take who knows how long to get into the first job .

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to get into a job as fast as possible so I can start building curriculum, but i'm quite lost at what to do really.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been watching cs50x as means to introducing myself to programming, got a couple of courses at udemy, one of them being about hadoop and spark I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone shed some insight or lay some information unto me?

Thanks!

A couple of notes on this:

If a cell is blank I couldn't find any information on it from the school and didn't want to trust a website

Most of the salaries and bonuses are medians but 3 or so are averages because that's what the school provided

A lot of schools don't have acceptance rates on their page just applicants and enrolling class so I haven't filled that in

The cost is for tuition and anything else that is required and can't be waived because living expenses can fluctuate a ton from person to person so that is up to you to determine

Does anyone know where I can find average scholarships/aid info from each school to include in this and create an ""adjusted cost""?

I decided to accept that. 

I only had this guy's cell phone number, and since I was taking the other position, I didn't want to waste his time. The interview was at 3, and it was already 1. I couldn't call earlier because I couldn't pull away from work. 

I called, and he didn't answer. I left him a voicemail thanking him, apologizing for canceling the interview, etc. Left my info for him to call back if he wanted. He didn't.

From a previous internship I love working at company A, they have amazing benefits (9.5% company contribution to 401k, free lunch, basically free health care, etc) but testing is about 60/40 manual/automated and I'm worried that I'll get stuck in testing if I go that route. Company B/C have no noteworthy benefits, and I'm worried CRM will pigeon hole me into that field, especially as they described the first 6months being basically configuration, no real coding. Taking a full time offer at my current company would be positive in the sense that of the 3 it gives the most SE experience, but the work is quite boring and the team is disorganized since the division is new to software development.

If it did indeed happen, is there any way to confirm whether the decontamination procedures were properly and fully implemented? [UT]",SubductionZone125,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z0jic/recently_heard_from_a_neighbor_that_the_house/,"My friends and I rented this house for college over a year ago. One of my roommates recently started an internship with our neighbor who informed him previous tenants in the house manufactured and used methamphetamine on the property. There was some mention of a shed on the side of the house that is no longer there, though even if the lab was located in that shed, I’m sure there was bound to be some exposure on the inside of the house, especially if they were using on the property.

None of this had been mentioned to us prior to signing the lease last year. I know in some states the realtors, property managers/owners, etc have to tell you if drugs have been used and/or manufactured on the property prior to selling or leasing you the home, but I’m not sure if this is the case in Utah. The house is owned by a gentleman from out of state who we have never met or had communications with and is managed by a local property management company we’ve had regular communications with. They’re the ones who had us sign the lease. This company manages most of the rental properties in town and I’ve heard some negative reviews about them, though our experience hasn’t necessarily been bad.

The house is older but it’s also fairly nice for a rental home. We were told it was remodeled within the past decade by the owner himself, who lived on the property at the time. That much is obvious, especially when looking at the interior which looks much newer than the actual age of the house. I certainly would never have pegged the place for a former meth lab, even now, but whether the remodel occurred before or after the exposure I am not certain.

Which leads me to several questions:

Where can I find the information to confirm/debunk our neighbor’s inferences about the house and what are the processes I would need to go through to gain that information?

Would it be worth going through the city and/or the police for police reports on the possible incident, or am I restricted from that information?

I know there are certain decontamination procedures that need to be undertaken in order for the house to be re-approved by the Utah Department of Health as livable after meth exposure. I also know some of these procedures sometimes get short-cutted from time to time due to expenses or overlooked for one reason or another. If the contamination did happen, how can I make sure it was fully and properly dealt with?"

I have been lurking for a long time here now, and only been reading and answering sometimes, but now i come to you with questions, since im breaking my brain on this matter for a couple of weeks now. 

I am currently working for an app development company in Europe, and i manage the networks and servers. Also devices for co workers, cellphones, AV, the whole thing. 

I had a colleague for the last four years, but he got fired a week ago without any reason. Now i feel like i really want to go, every week a couple of people leave the company because of the management.

Also my budget has been cut to almost nothing and i can not hire an intern or something to help me. So basically i am a sysadmin that has to maintain 9 pretty big networks and all the gear, 50-70 laptops, 250+ servers, a LOT of other stuff as well.. Sometimes i work 12 hours a day all week to keep up. When i'm typing this i think, why do i even ask for help, it's obvious.. leave them.

But i love the company and my coworkers, i never went to work with a bad feeling. At least not about my colleagues. I guess im just wondering what the IT people think about this who have been working in IT for longer.

I'm only 23, and this is my first serious job in IT. Just looking for advice, as i feel a little scared to quit a job. (On LinkedIn recruiters are stalking me any day so no worries if i leave)


Greetings. Thanks in advance, senpais."

If you could give me an overview of the industry right now and what are the trends that would really help me out. Any sources are appreciated. I also have to propose a research topic on a complex business issue such company could face, so if you could give me some directions what could that be would be helpful.

9z3y92,1,2018-11-21,In search of a fresh perspective,MrNeverwinter,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/9z3y92/in_search_of_a_fresh_perspective/,"Greetings fellow redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

As I announce in the title, I am in search of a new perspective, be it through a personal comment or a recommendation of a good book. I'd like to start by shortly describing my situation. I promise to keep it short and that it won't be an essay.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24 years old male Frenchman who finds himself, not quite at a dead end in life, but more at a crossroads. I am a law graduate and currently pursuing an LL.M. in fiscal studies and estate planning. Having studied law for 5 years already, I can safely say that I absolutely love what I do. I love getting to the bottom of a case, unraveling all the legal knots and serving up a coherent and transparent solution to a client's problem. At least I think I do. On paper, behind my desk I can certainly say I do, but what I can tell from the practical experiences I've had during internships in court or with a civil notary, it's pretty much the opposite. It just drains me completely. The problem lies in the fact that I have poor social skills. In my line of profession that is considered quite rare. The typical lawyer is the more outgoing/extravert/assertive/no bullshit kind of guy or gal. While I consider myself assertive enough to act in my clients interest, I am dreadful at making any significant human connection. It's like my emotional brain short circuits as soon as I find myself in a situation that is completely without structure and requires spontaneity. I do however manage just fine in professional context where preparation is required and appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

My second issue is that preparing myself (and the remainder year of studying) costs so much of my time, that any selfimprovement on the social domain, I feel is too much. Maybe I ought to post to /r/getdisciplined instead, I'm not sure, but I am in desperate need of a tiny bit of instant gratification after a day's hard work. That means there isn't, I feel like, much room left to read non-fiction regarding selfimprovement. I have taken up going to a support group for 'shy' persons in my area, which I think has helped (gaining some sense of relativisation). But when I do try taking up on improving myself I usually tend to overdo it for a while (I started taking up German again last month and physical exercise after a period of illness) and usually get burned out, because I find it hard to combine it all with my studies and still have my brain generate enough dopamine to get through the end of the month. This has resulted, over the course of the last years, that I have very few good friends, no girlfriend (or any significant romantic experience in my past), no real hobbies and no sense of wonder or adventure. I just have my Magna cum laude degree in law. Yay me (I truly am happy about that achievement though, don't get me wrong, but you get the point).

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, I grew up in a family business, focusing on an area in a completely different direction from my own and my father hates my guts for choosing so fervently for the study I've been investing so many blood, sweat and tears in over the past few years. Being a student, I am still somewhat financially dependant on my parents and especially my father, since my mom has enough issues of her own. The man's a real narcissist so any chance he can get to get back in control, by means of financial support, he takes with both hands. He says and does everything to get me to continue his business, but I have no interest in it whatsoever. I respect the man for what he has done in his life and the success he has had, but I feel like it should not dictate my course of life, if I feel like I'm not cut out for that kind of business. Recently I had a big fight with him, where I clearly stated my intentions with regard to a career in law and through his manipulations I felt like shit for about two weeks afterwards because he always so expertly succeeds in invalidating everything I feel like I have achieved and is important to me. He should have become a politician I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my conclusion: although I absolutely adore my line of work:

\- I have to work my ass off to get where I want to be;

\- I feel like I don't have time to do anything else that matters in life;

\- I feel like life is rushing me by;

\- My father tries to invalidate all my achievements and he is a major factor in my life;

\- I have poor social skills and hardly any time to correct them (to the extent that they can be corrected);

\- When I do find some free time, I like to spend them doing activities that grant instant gratification (watching an episode of Mad Men for instance)

Am I still on the right track here or have I lost the right direction somewhere along the way? I don't know, I guess I am in need of fresh perspective. What do you guys and gals think?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you kindly"

### Our Intrepid Crew
**$AYMITG:** A 27 yo Army vet in the American SE.   Currently run a small startup home automation and MSP service by night while working in one of the Big Insurance 3's Operations Center by day.   Focus mostly on finding my clients high-quality, open-source (read low cost), and secure software to fill their needs.   Use a lot of Unifi gear, raspberry pi's, and off-the-shelf stuff.

**$Coworker:** Employee at Big 3 but in a different line of business, from $AYMITG's former call center life.

**$8Mile:** Employee in Big 3's Ops Center with $AYMITG.  Right hand and pea in a pod.  8Mile consistently wears hoodies/beanies and vans and has 8 certificates.  Doesn't use them, yet.

**$Wifey:** AYMITG's wife.  Great with layer1 work.  Could punch down a 100 lines an hour given a tool and a Vizio diagram.  Grew up on a farm and can carry you and a 4u server at the same time.

**$Intern:** 15 years old, uses the internet the way you'd expect a 15 yo boy to.  Which led him to learn enough about Windows to be dangerous.  Trying to round out his abilities and put him on a path of light.  $AYMITG's Pastor's son.

**$Seguro:** A primarily Spanish language insurance provider, car, house, life.   Serves a huge cash only subset of society.

**$MaryMagdalene:**  Owner of $Seguro.   Early 50's, highly conservative, but lives out her New Testament Christianity with an almost infectious quality.   Endearing but aloof.

&amp;nbsp;


Also, Kudos to /u/SadieWopen for the information re: *The PBX*. That PBX is actually still in service with the client, and being able to access it after the information you gave is going to be much easier. *Reddit Silver* for you! 
Now back to our regularly schedule program...  

&amp;nbsp; 


### The Building 

$AYMITG begins to walk around the building looking for any signs that it ""Used to be a business."" Among the evidence is...nothing. There's no evidence this single story building from the 1960's was anything besides a home. 
A single AP sits in the open front area that is likely a living room. Wood floors line the building, met at the walls with power outlets in the baseboard. A cursory check under the building during the initial walk around had shown that almost all the power was ran *under* the house. 
Hopefully this meant not accidentally locating a power line with a drill bit. 

&amp;nbsp;

**$AYMITG:** *taking a deep breath* Okay, you guys have already marked out where the drops/desks are going? Where's the attic access?   
**$MaryMagdalene:** *having just joined the group at $NewSeguro* Oh, it's in the bedroom. I mean, the side room. *hushed tone* I don't want anyone to know that I'm staying here, especially with all the cash.   
**$AYMITG:** No problem, show me where it is? $Intern, go grab the ladder from the truck.  

&amp;nbsp;

$MM leads $AYMITG, $8Mile, and $Wifey through a small kitchen off the main dining area, and through a kitchen. The kitchen features an exterior door that matches the rest of the home. When opened, it leads down a set of block steps into a finished out garage.  
A previous tenant has turned the former garage into a makeshift bedroom of sorts. Minus the concrete floor, block walls, and frigid air, the bedroom is almost cozy. Centered above is a large heavy wooden door with gate shackle hinges. Two screws jut out of the frame of the door appearing to anchor it in place.  

&amp;nbsp; 

Climbing the ladder, $AYMITG puts his shoulder into the heavy door and begins to push against it. The door barely moves and groans under the pressure.  
**$Wifey:** Uhm...babe, I'm pretty sure it comes down. I don't think it goes up.  

$AYMITG investigates the latches and sure enough, the hinges are meant to swing down into the living area, not up into the attic. $AYMITG applies pressure to the door again and begins to remove the two screws securing the door is resting on. 
As the first screw is removed, the door starts to sag slightly.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**$Wifey:** Watch out, that door looks pretty....   

At that moment the second screw breaks free and the large door comes swinging from the ceiling. Knocking $AYMITG square in the face, he reels and takes a step backwards off the ladder, landing 3 feet below on the concrete floor. Dazed but other wise unscathed. His head throbs slightly.   
**$Wifey:** heavy. It looks pretty heavy. Are you OK?   
**$AYMITG:** Yeah. Just a little shocked. *$MM looks on slightly mortified.* I just let it get away from me. $8Mile, you ready? $Intern, grab some flashlights.   

&amp;nbsp; 


As $8Mile and $AYMITG ascend into the attic, they find the usual collection of hobo piss jars, old avon catalogs, and vintage wood floor scraps. Ok, so no piss jars, but there is a bed pan, A hospital urinal, and a small plastic washtub. Evidence suggests that someone was staying here for extended periods of time, but are since long gone. 
Nothing else of interest awaits. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**$AYMITG:** Go back down to the office, I'm going to poke some holes next to where I think the wall is and push a fish tape through. If I'm in the right place/cavity, give me a knock or call my cell. I should have service up here.   

&amp;nbsp; 

The next several hours would be a haze of drilling, fishing, and punching down, 20 drops for Phone and Internet. While $Wifey cut holes, $Intern helped feed cable, drill holes in the wall plates, and feed lines to $8Mile. Once the lines were all ran, $Intern gave up and laid down in the front room. Declaring himself ""Off the clock"". At that point, no one had the strength to bother arguing with him. 
$8Mile began to cable manage the rack. $Wifey began punching down each of the individual keystones and $AYMITG worked behind testing cables, labeling and diagramming, putting on faceplates and other finish work. 

&amp;nbsp; 

At 7AM EST, after 14.5 hours $NewSeguro was ready for business. All the desks were covered in phones, desktops, and peripherals. The phones worked, the PBX had survived, and the DC was performing as best as possible.   

&amp;nbsp; 

For those who asked, we never had to shoot anyone though several of us did draw down on somebody trying to force their way in the front door around 4AM. It turned out that a couple of clients who knew $MM was moving saw the lights on at $NewSeguro and the cars out front and thought they'd POP in to say hi.  
When they saw the guns, they said ""Bye"" pretty quickly. $MM had already left for the night and I'm not sure my spanish was good enough to explain who we were and why we weren't going to hurt anyone. But a smile and a re-holster are pretty clear in any language. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Driving home from $NewSeguro we all stayed on the phone with each other, making sure that no one fell asleep. $8Mile and $AYMITG had been up for 27 hours at this point. 

&amp;nbsp; 

### Aftermath 

After breakfast and a shower, $Intern, $Wifey, and $AYMITG sat down on the couch and waited for church time. $AYMITG and $Wifey teach Reformed Protestant Theology on Sunday mornings and $Intern was one of his students.  As the clock ticked, all three fell into a hard slumber. Around 3p the three awoke to tens of calls, text messages, and the like. Mostly from $Intern's father, the Pastor. They started normally enough, ""Where are you guys?"" ""Are you coming to teach your class?"" ""Where's $Intern? He's not answering his phone."" 
$Intern's parents weren't too happy when he spoke to them. Apparently neither party had bothered to call or text the other the previous night. So while they knew the job might run late, they didn't expect him to be rolling in around 3pm the next day.  

&amp;nbsp; 

$Wifey and $AYMITG actually went back to $NewSeguro around 6 that evening and helped $Coworker get $MM's tv's hung around the building. The Cash Recycler had been severely damaged by the moving crew, and when they'd moved it, it left 2 beautiful 15"" curly-ques of wood ribbons on the hardwood. We never were able to get it running again. I assume $MM reached out to the retailer in Chicago for assistance. 

And now dear readers, while I thank you for your time and kind comments up to this point, I'm afraid our time has come to an end. We're working on a contract with $MM to provide her IT services after the first of the year on an MSP basis. There's talk of password vaults, encrypted NAS, a new DC and failover DC, new user accounts that actually belong to the users they name, and getting a quickbooks update from the last 5 years.  
But who knows, maybe we'll get another call from $MM in the future or another IT wasteland who needs our help. And when they call, we'll answer.

I currently just finished an internship at one of the big 4. I didn't enjoy my time there and I decided not to return for the full time position despite a great offer, 110K base, 50K sign on, and 200K RSU. 

I currently have an offer from American Express which I am actually really excited to work for as I have a love for finance and tech. But the salary of course isn't as good. It's 90K base, with 11K sign on. No mention of equity. I could find any other forms of compensation other than a bonus.

I currently have a deadline to respond but I don't think I will get any competing offers within that time frame from other companies to give me leverage in negotiation for my compensation. So the the question is that I really do want to work for American Express but is there a way to negotiate better compensation. I dont want to come off as greedy, I just want to make sure I am getting paid what I'm worth. Do banks offer different type of compensation that I just don't know about? How should I go about this?"

I was supposed to have a few nights where I spent the whole time with someone else and a couple day training sessions as well. 

So I ended up being sick and missing a couple day training sessions and the night training was left up to the other interns (yeah that's a good idea, have one intern train the other).  The day training sessions were not rescheduled and I had my first night alone coming up.  I expressed to my manager that I wanted at least one more day of training before that night.  She didn't respond until the day after that night. 

So the dreaded night comes.  Everything seems fine so far.  Then boom! A bunch of tickets flood in for servers in Europe going out at the same time.  I had no clue what was going on and I started to panic.  I searched the company's documentation to see if this was routine or not amd who to call.  I remember the other techs said that with any outage give it about half an hour to determine if it wasn't maintenance.  So a half hour came and went and there was still no ticket update saying they went back up.  I started trying to call the contacts and nobody answered the phones.  Eventually I was able to get ahold of one of the full time techs (I'll call him FTT) over IM. 

Me: Hey the servers are down for [company] and I don't know what to do

FTT: Oh that happens every Wednesday night, don't worry about it. 

I was super relieved but also a little bothered there wasn't anything to notify me that was normal. Regardless I let out a good laugh and the rest of the night was super slow. "

I’m currently a sophomore in college and I’ve decided it’s finally time for me to make a final decision on what I want my major to be. Keep in mind both of these majors have the same requirements and I’ll be on track for both. My choices are in between marketing and computer information systems.
For marketing I’m currently in an internship revolved around social media marketing and I really enjoy it! It’s definitely something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. But I’m not stupid it’s not a STEM major so I know I won’t make a lot of money unless i move up the corporate ladder quickly. 
For CIS I’ve always had a knack for computers and have been very good at understanding them if I put in effort. Since this is a STEM career there is more money here and the job market is stable. I’m just not sure I’d enjoy it as much as I would marketing. Since I want to decide by next semester I won’t have an internship to tell me which I want to enjoy better.
Any advice or personal experience would be much appreciated!

Thing is my gpa reset once I did, the school I go to only calculates gpa on the classes I took with them, and I haven’t done too well. 

I’m in my third year, currently my GPA sits at less than a 2.0. I did just well enough to really qualify moving into my third year. I’m retaking some classes I’ve not done great in and some new classes, and as the the first semesters ends  it seems like I can get my gpa to slightly above two. I’m applying to internships over the summer because I hear that GPA really doesn’t matter, but even when it’s this low? I don’t have projects besides class work, and if you take out non core classes my gpa 2.5. 

I guess what I’m asking is, should I bother applying to internships, seems like they’ll like my resume, and like me but the number will put them off. "

I just wanted to get some opinions from people on whether or not I'm just being too picky with what companies I'm applying to. For context I will be graduating in spring 2019 and have done a cyber security internship and currently doing a software engineering internship.

My current employer will not consider a possible full time offer till closer to my graduation date and only if there's a position open. I have decided to apply for full time positions in the mean time. Based on my local area, a lot of software engineering jobs that open for applications deal with creating software for gambling, which I have no interest in doing so. 

I wanted to see if anyone had any similar issues with applying for jobs that they may not necessarily agree with or would be interested in and if I'm just shooting myself in the foot by limiting myself to the number of companies I can apply to if I wanted to stay within the area. 

Thank you for any suggestions or information."

I've applied to a bunch of internships, some freshman/sophomore oriented, some generic internships with low requirements (1-2 years of experience in Java), and I want to prepare myself in the event I get an interview.

 A recruiter recommended preparing with leetcode so I took a look at the site and... holy fuck I'm in over my head. the easy ones I can potentially do if I give myself an hour +, but doing the mediums is out of the question.

 Do they actually expect freshman undergrads to be able to solve these? I am willing to learn them and spend the time reading the popular data structures books but the level of difficulty was really shocking to me. I guess I'm hoping people who have interviewed as a freshman/sophomore can weigh in and talk about their experience with technical interviews.

Some programs, such as Facebook University, target people with very little coding experience. I find it hard to believe that they would create a program that rapidly teaches you to code iOS but have a super high barrier to entry, but I'm not so sure anymore."

Hello,

I am a 20 yr old junior currently attending college. I was able to get an internship this semester which I am very happy about but they require me to stay in my college town for the entirety of our winter break(about a month and a half long). I live in a house with 6 other housemates who I am very friendly with, and not one of them will be around this winter. 

I am completely dreading it. Been thinking about it the last month and I honestly don’t know what I would do with myself.  My schedule would be 9-5 and I would be going to the gym every day after work. I don’t know how to meet new friends there, considering 99% of the students are all going back home. 

I was thinking of talking to my boss and seeing if I would be able to just work mon-thurs so I can go home on fridays for the weekend since I am only a 2 hour drive away from home. Not sure how that talk will turn out, but I will be telling him how I think I might go crazy being myself here and how I need to be with my family and girlfriend back home for the weekends. 

Any words of advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I don’t do well by myself. I don’t mind being by myself, but I don’t know how I can handle an entire winter of it. "

I really want to go to NYC (was in the bay area last year and didn't like it) so blend and quora are probably out unless someone has a glowing review on one of them. Bloomberg seems to have more low-level C++ and systems related work which is what I want to do, but Yext is a much smaller company with fewer interns too. I feel like I'd have more interesting work at BB but more ownership over my work + an easier time meeting interns at Yext (something I struggled with at a big N last summer).

If anyone has any input on any of these companies, especially if you interned or worked as a full time engineer, I'd appreciate hearing about it! Thanks so much"

Regularly, I come across opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) that I would be very interested in applying but all of them require 2-3 academic references (letters of recommendation). As a result, I have not applied to any of them because I am hesitant to ask my professors who have taught me for less than 4 months for references. I’m pretty sure they don’t know my interests outside of their classroom and would likely say no if I asked.  Plus, I don’t want to ask them every single time I come across an interesting opportunity and want to ‘save’ their references for those critical opportunities.

How do you go about asking professors with whom you don’t have a super established relationship with for academic references? What is the general norm in the academic world in terms of how many times you can ask a professor for a reference?"

Everyone knows that guy in the office who just barely skates by while getting done as little work as humanly possible in order to keep their job. I’m that guy. The one who spends hours each day cracking jokes and using their phone in the bathroom stall. It was during one leisurely stroll through the building that I discovered the room that allowed me take things to the next level. 

I was looking for a place I could safely spend a hour here and there taking a nap when needed. Previously, I had been using the new mommy nursing room. But Debbie coming back from maternity leave shut that avenue down. 

The room was out of the way, to put it mildly. Down two long corridors I didn’t even know existed and then around another corner. There were boxes of paper, pens, and other office supplies piled high and I figured I could just weasel my way back there and relax for as long as I dared to. When I got past the boxes, I found the door to the room. It was unlocked and there was just enough room to squeeze my way in after opening it. 

The door closed shut automatically thanks to a spring loaded door closer and I was left in the dark. After searching around for a bit, I found the light switch oddly positioned on the side wall. When I was finally able to see the room I found it was surprisingly spacious. Around the size of a standard hotel room. It was empty besides a large old couch pushed up against one of the walls. I had found the promise land. 

There was also another door on the far side of the room. I checked it and found it locked. The couch was the real find and boy was I ever glad to find it was super soft and comfortable. 

That first day I was smart and set my phone’s alarm to wake me up after an hour so I could get back to my desk and be somewhat productive. As the days went by and I starting making more frequent trips to the room, there would be times I’d forget to set the alarm. During the longest of my nap sessions, I spent nearly the entire work day sleeping on that couch. 

I was especially stressed out that day because I sensed an end to my cushy job. My manager was constantly upset with me and if I didn't bring up my sales numbers that month, I’d be out of a job. The end of the month came around and I wasn’t even close to the goals they set for me. I stayed up all night trying to think of a way out of this, working harder than I ever had at the office. But no last minute idea came to mind. So when I got to work with red tired eyes, I said fuck it, and went straight to the room to catch a nap. Might as well take advantage of it while I still could. 

I slept for six straight hours; only waking when my stomach started growling because of missing lunch. I sulked as I left the room for what I thought would be the last time and returned to my desk. I was greeted with a puzzling email with the subject line of “Congratulations to our Employee of the Month!” 

It was me. The ultimate slacker had not only won employee of the month but had set record breaking sales numbers for the month. I looked through the records on my computer and found scores of sales that I never made. Not just throughout the month. These records went back to my first date working here. It was like I was the ideal salesman from day one. 

The next day I decided that the best course of action was to continue on like nothing happened. Clearly I had somehow landed in a goldmine and I didn’t want to do anything that could mess that up. Spending more time around the office would certainly be the last thing I wanted to do. 

So I spent the vast majority of my time sleeping on the couch in that far off room. This time, when I exited, I was greeted by a text message from that cute girl in customer service asking me if we were still on for dinner. I had never actually spoken to her before, but here I found my phone suddenly had months worth of text messages between us. It appeared that we were dating. 

I started to piece everything together the longer this went on. Every time I spent significant time in that room, the world around me changed in little pieces. Usually just one or two things at a time. My car might be a different color, suddenly people were surprised that I was no longer a vegetarian despite my memory telling me I’d always been a rapid meat eater, or I’d come home and find a pet dog I had never previously met. I started getting in the habit of checking my driver’s license before going home after one time learning that my apartment number was different than the one I had left the day before. 

Overtime, I discovered that there were rules to using the room. There seemed to be a cool down period that needed to be past before it would work again. It was roughly one use every 24 hours. And you had to spend at least five hours in the room. If either of these rules were not followed, the room didn’t do anything. You’d walk out into the same exact world you entered from. 

From what I could gather, I was switching places with another version of me who also had access to that interdimensional nap room. I’d enter the room in my world and they would do the same in theirs. When we exited, we’d be switched. It worked out well for me. I always seemed to be trading up, while another version of me was getting stuck with the shitty version of our life that I had led. Or at least that is what I thought for the longest time. 

I must have used that room hundreds of times before anything went wrong. I got my first “bad trip” when I exited to a world where I had risen to upper management in the company. This seemed great until I received the phone call from the lawyer I didn't know I had who told me that we needed to meet and go over my sexual harassment case. Apparently the version of me that I took over this world from had a habit of forcing himself on interns. Needless to say, I made sure to shift to another world as soon as the 24 hours was up. 

Things changed forever when I entered the room and found the other door, on the far side of the room, ever so slightly ajar. While it seemed that everything on the outside world was up for change, the room itself had never varied in any way before. Without even thinking, I went through that door. 

I didn’t find myself in another section of the office. I was outside. The desert stretched out before my eyes as far as I could see. Quite a shock considering I had just come from an office in a major east coast city. To the left and right of me were copies of the room I had come from. Like an old roadside motel; the kind you see without hallways and the doors are just open to the world. It was just walls and doors for what looked like miles. 

Each door had a name on it. I took note of my door, with my name written in weathered white paint, and set off to the left. I wanted to see just how far this went on for. I walked for hours, just blown away by how many doors there were. Each one with a new name and presumably another person just like me jumping from one reality to the next with ease. 

As I got further along, I did find doors without names. I don’t know if these were placeholders or if their occupants had passed on. Maybe the rooms are are non transferable. Obviously, I still had a lot to learn about how this whole thing worked. But I did eventually reach an end. The last door had the name Elizabeth McCormick on it. I jokingly knocked on the door and when no one answered, I turned around with disappointment and headed back. I started counting the doors on my return trip to get an idea of how many others there were, but lost count when I realized I wasn’t alone. 

I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw someone patiently standing outside of a door. They wore nondescript cloths, had an oddly greyish skin color, and were completely bald. Don’t misinterpret this and think that it was an alien. It was human. I am sure of that. Have you ever seen one of those scientific predictions of what humans will look like in the future? It was like that. Just a mix of every race all at once.

There was nowhere to hide, but I didn’t want to freak the thing out, so I slowly crept up towards it. I inched my way closer and the thing never moved an inch. The wind lightly blew its loose clothes around, but there was literally no motion in its body beyond the rise and fall of its breathing chest. When I was about ten rooms away, the thing suddenly reached out and opened the door in front of it. The quick movement caught me off guard and I tripped over my own feet. 

Just before the thing walked through the door, it looked at me. It’s eyes widened, but it never stopped its forward motion, and before I knew it, the door was closed once again. I stood there dumbfounded. What the fuck had I just seen? 

I was snapped out of it by the sound of another door opening behind me. An identical nondescript human creature stepped out of the door not twenty feet from me, and immediately made a beeline towards me. I ran. 

Doors suddenly opened all around me. Some just as I passed, but more than once I had to dodge an outstretched arm as a door opened just as ran past it. Behind me, dozens of those faceless monsters ran after me, pumping their arms and legs in bizarre angular motions that were at odds with how fast they moved. They made no sound besides the smack of rubber soles on dried sand and dirt. I was quickly running out of breath and had no idea how close I was to getting back to my own door. 

I found it just as my lungs began to burn and I knew I had very little left in me. I was able to throw open the door to my room and slam it shut just as the first group of humanoid creatures made it close. They slammed into the door and continued to pound fists into it as I laid on the floor trying to catch my breath. Their completely vocal silence made the pounding of fists on that wooden door even more terrifying. An angry mob without the shouting.I knew the door wouldn’t hold long, so I forced my aching muscles to get me to my feet and rushed out the other door and back into the office. 

I must have looked like a maniac. Drenched in sweat, completely out of breath, and fear wrapped around my face. I didn’t bother trying to explain anything to my co-workers and just left the building to return to my home. 

After that experience it should have been easy for me to avoid using the room ever again. Hell, I didn’t even want to go back to work in that building again. But I didn’t exit into a good world. 

In that world, my parents were long dead. They were violently killed by my own brother seven years ago in a robbery gone wrong when he needed drug money. I found myself in debt from legal fees trying to help this demonic version of my brother out. And on top of that, his junkie friends still thought I was rich. They constantly came by my shitty apartment looking for handouts or to just flat out rob me. I couldn’t take it and headed back to the room for a redo. 

The door on the opposite side of the room was the first thing I checked. It was locked solid but I still had no idea how this worked. I stood by the door, tense with fear, ready to book it at the first sign of the doorknob moving. When it started to jiggle three hours into my stay, I did just that. I returned the next day with a knife and ready to fight off those creatures if they dared to enter my room. 

This time they surfaced after just over an hour. The door slowly opened and one grey hand reached inside. I sliced it long and deep and the hand retracted without its owner making a sound. More followed and I carved these up as well. It gave me comfort to see that they bled red and after a few more tries they seemed to give up and gently closed the door. But they didn't retreat entirely. I could hear them scratching and pawing at the door until my five hours were up and I exited out into the office and another world. 

It didn’t work. The next world was worse. And the one after that. I seem to be going deeper and deeper into hell with each trip through the room. The creatures on the other side of the door are getting more aggressive and increasing in numbers. Even after purchasing a gun, I don’t know how much longer I can hold them back. 

The only hope I can cling onto is that the alternative worlds are not endless. The rooms didn’t stretch on forever, so I’m betting that the worlds they connect to are finite as well. I’m hoping that if I go through the room enough times I will eventually start to loop back around. If I can hold those things at bay long enough, I may be able to get back home. Or at least somewhere that I can accept as home. I’m still looking for evidence to support this theory, however. 

So every day I come back here and tell my story again. I pray that one day someone will tell me that they’ve heard this before. Please tell me this isn't the first time these words have reached you. Please. "

I am a fifth year undergraduate senior in the midst of graduate school applications, however I have been struggling mightily with burnout and stress. Currently I am dealing with an incredibly abusive PI in my undergraduate research lab that I cannot get away from - he texts, emails, calls, etc. constantly, gaslights and threatens religiously, and is holding my grade(s) and scholarships hostage to ensure I remain working for him. Although I have thought about pursuing a title 9 complaint against him, I also know he will retaliate and that my doing so will have serious consequences that I will then have to deal with. My credentials / CV are such that I am fairly confident about getting into a graduate program, however after having to deal with my current PI, I am burned out and depressed, and the thought of filling out graduate applications is overwhelming, especially since every time I get started, my PI dumps more work onto my plate ( I even just got an email with more things to do today! ).

At this point I'm lost as to what to do - this past summer, I had a research internship at a completely different institution and loved it, but the thought of filling out applications and going to graduate school right now is overwhelming. Most of my applications are due Dec. 1, and although I have done the normal preparations like securing letters of rec. and taking the GRE, I haven't started the personal statement portion at all. 

Do you have any advice? My main worry is that I will go to graduate school and end up with an abusive PI again, at which point I will most definitely quit, or I will go and not even have the energy to do well since I am so drained currently.

Thank you to anyone who responds! :) "

By this point, however, I've heard all sorts of opinions on what I should consider important and what I should focus on. I'm having a hard time making sense of it all and maintaining my personal well being. I mean, it's not possible to satisfy everyone and to act in a way that checks all of the boxes. Feeling confident in myself and trusting that I'm doing the best I can is difficult when my actions always seem to disappoint at least one person. Here are some of the topics I've been made to think about:

* Grades/GPA *(i.e. figuring out how to test well even if it means not understanding the material on a deeper level)*
* Understanding of course material *(i.e. really exploring the material even if it means not receiving the best grades)*
* Understanding of a discipline outside of course material *(i.e. not limiting yourself to the small subsection of topics taught by a course)*
* Technical skills
* Soft skills
* Lab work/hands-on skills
* Projects
* Engineering clubs/volunteering
* Engineering competitions
* Internships/co-ops
* Undergraduate Honours Thesis
* Graduate school
* Personal health and well being

Depending on how I allocate my time, I could prioritize some of these while neglecting others, as it's not really possible to do everything well. It doesn't help that some factors in each category are beyond my control *(for example, the teaching abilities of the instructor)*. I'm never quite sure if my choices are appropriate because everyone I meet has a different opinion on what should be considered high priority. I'd expect all of you reading this have unique perspectives on this, too. I'm just a bit worried I won't be able to build a life I love, because I've listened to the wrong person and inadvertently prioritized the wrong thing.

I've done a chance me before, but it was only for 1 school. I thought I'd get everyone's thoughts on the other places I'm applying.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already submitted apps to **Georgetown (my top choice), Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern, Emory, UNC Chapel Hill, and USC (South Carolina)**. I've already gotten into USC. I haven't submitted my other RD applications yet bc I am waiting to hear from Georgetown before I pay the fees. I am also applying to **American, George Washington, Trinity College, UPenn, Dartmouth, and Gettysburg College**. I want to major in government/political science.

&amp;#x200B;

ACT: 34, 35 superscore

&amp;#x200B;

SAT: 1480 (740 both)

&amp;#x200B;

SAT Subject Tests: US History 780, Literature 730, and Math II 670 (math isn't great, but I also sent in my 5 in AP Calc, and since I don't want to do anything with math, I don't think it will have too much bearing)

&amp;#x200B;

AP: AP GOPO 5, AP Calc AB 5

&amp;#x200B;

IB: German 6 (we take our foreign language exam early)

&amp;#x200B;

Course load: I am at an IB school, so I have taken basically all of the AP classes they offer in addition to my IB course load, so I won't have many APs to send in (since IB exams are taken at the end of senior year) but they will still see I have been taking the most challenging classes I can... I am actually doing the hardest IB option possible, where you take 4 HL courses instead of 3, which is very unusual

&amp;#x200B;

Unweighted GPA: 4.0

&amp;#x200B;

Weighted GPA: 5.303 (my school does weighted GPAs super weird, so my rank is probably a little more revealing than my GPA)

&amp;#x200B;

Rank: 6/261

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurriculars:

&amp;#x200B;

Mock Trial, all 4 years of high school, became captain my junior year; I have 11 most effective attorney awards as well as a most dependable award

&amp;#x200B;

Student Activism club, founder

&amp;#x200B;

Intern at our local chamber of commerce every week

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteered on a congressional campaign this summer against 3 term incumbent until campaign ended

&amp;#x200B;

Work as a runner at a local law firm about 7 hours a week

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteer at our local museum where I help with kids activities

&amp;#x200B;

Member of the National Honors Society, Science National Honors Society, and German National Honors Society (these are all the ones my schools offers).

&amp;#x200B;

Beta club

&amp;#x200B;

Math team (1 year) and soccer (1 year) - not that important but I think I checked the box on the application

&amp;#x200B;

Junior Marshal at our school, which only the top 20 students get to do

&amp;#x200B;

Awards:

&amp;#x200B;

Mock trial (mentioned above)

&amp;#x200B;

Silver on the National German Exam

&amp;#x200B;

Varsity letter in academics (I know it’s weird, but my school gave them out so I listed it)

&amp;#x200B;

Essays: Good, I think they conveyed that I am passionate about government and life

&amp;#x200B;

Recommendations: I think my recommendations should be good. One is from my 9th and 10th grade English teacher. She liked me a lot both years she had me, and she definitely knows I am a hard worker. She is also the mock trial teacher, and I am (I'm pretty sure) the first junior at our school to ever become captain, and I have broken the record for awards, including leading our team to state for only the second time in a long time. So, I think she will be able to speak to my leadership skills and my just overall extraness. My other recommendation is from my 11th and 12th grade english teacher (idk why it always ends up english). She has known me for a while and I consider her a friend. She also taught my Theory of Knowledge class for IB, where I actually got so into a conversation about the National School Walkout that I organized a group of students and got an article published in our local newspaper about it. Because of this, I started the student activism club with a friend, and she is the teacher supervisor for that, so she has seen my be very passionate about things and be a leader.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t have any amazing hooks or anything. No legacy, but I am from SC and I know that is usually less competitive than like California or NY, so that could be good.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I have been reading CTCI and practicing Leetcode for a month and already finished about 100 problems (62 mediums and 38 easy).

**And today I had my first technical interview with Google for the summer internship (so excited).**

**And then what?** Got a coding question and totally bombed it. I felt really dumb and disappointed.

**The interview:**

After the interviewer wrote down the question, I read it twice and thought out loud about how I would approach it. Then, he immediately asked me why I would do that and I realized that I had totally misunderstood the question - my hands and legs started shaking. It was not hard **(because it was the first question)** but I barely finished the code in 40 minutes (7 LOC) (with a bug) and in the end, my interviewer said we were running out of time and he was happy with what I had been doing.

The Google interviewer was really nice, he gave me some hints and intended to show me the bug but I was so dumb and nervous to realize it.

**After the interview:**

I laid myself down on the floor for 10 minutes then went back to check my email with a hope of receiving an instant rejection email. After that, I opened Leetcode playground and eventually came up with a working solution in 5 minutes - felt like the dumbest person since the question was not hard at all.

I've seen a lot of people on reddit ace the phone interview. How did you prepare for it?

Here's the timeline of events (All employment was with the same company):

1. School only (Aug 2013 - May 2014)
2. Software Engineering Internship (May 2014 - Aug 2014)
3. Software Engineer I + full time student (Aug 2014 - Aug 2015)
4. School only (Aug 2015 - May 2016)
5. Software Engineer I (May 2016 - Aug 2016)
6. School only (Aug 2016 - May 2017)
7. Graduated (May 2017)
8. Software Engineer II (May 2017 - current)

So I can think of a few ways to show this work history:

1. Separate everything
    - 3 months intern | 1 year engineer | 3 months engineer | 1.5 years engineer
2. Separate internship from engineer (ignoring breaks for school)
    - 3 months intern | 4 years engineer
3. Combine it all (ignoring breaks for school)
    - 4.5 years engineer

Any suggestions on how to keep the ""experience"" section of my resume concise while also honestly conveying my employment history with this company?

Thank you all in advance! Feel free to ask any clarifying questions about this situation!"
9zofjd,8,2018-11-23,I fear I’m going to be fired over chronic lateness issues - what are my options?,sukhdeeep,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/9zofjd/i_fear_im_going_to_be_fired_over_chronic_lateness/,"**Edited to add a location**

I’m writing this on my lunch break so apologies for any spelling or grammatical errors in advance. This is also my first time posting in this sub.

I got the news this morning and now I think I’m set to lose my job.

I work in a big UK city at a predominantly desk-based job. My commute is between usually between 1h10m and 1h20m. The best way to get here in the morning is to leave between 7.20am and 7.40am, boarding a bus and two trains.

I’ve been at this job close to a year and a half, joining as an intern last summer. I work in a team which splits into a smaller team - comprising four other people. One of those other people is our supervisor (our third this year due to huge staff turnover in past months).

A problem that I’ve had throughout is lateness. Every other day of the week I’m late by 10-15 minutes. The problem with my commute is that if I miss a certain train service then I’m automatically at least 10 minutes late.

This has been going on through all three supervisors and I guess this is the final straw. There was one day a couple weeks ago where I was 30 minutes late after not being in on time four out of those five days (I think). So close to an hour late when combined.

In a one-to-one he warned me that if I was significantly late again then I’d be reported to HR.

I made a concerted effort thereafter to be on time - and I was. I got in the office at or before 9am every day this week, with the exception of Monday when everyone (and I mean everyone) on my team was late due to overrunning engineering works on services.

It was this time that I overslept with 40 mins to go to be in the office. At that point I knew I was fucked and there was no way I could be in there sooner than 9.30.

What I fear now is that HR will just saw my contract has been terminated because of this chronic lateness.

For the record, the only other time I’ve been referred to HR in this job is when I had a few sick days bunched up and they started to get suspicious. I have a bowel condition which sometimes flares up so those days become extremely difficult when it makes its presence known.

What do I do? What can I expect? I’ve never had a HR warning before and I really do enjoy my job. But I have a problem with being on time and it’s something I have been actively working on.

**TL;DR: I am chronically late to work and now I have been reported to HR. I’m scared I’m going to lose my job.**"

If you've read that other tale from tech support, you might know how my story ends.

So I've been a web developer for over ten years. A while ago, I made the step towards a new company and, due to circumstances, I am now the only developer in an e-commerce company (read: we're a webshop) of ~20 people. I never chose to be the only developer and have never wanted a position like this, but alas, here we are. The fact that I'm the only developer in the company, also made me a first line tech support.  
This story is about an intern ($intern) and me ($me).

&gt; $intern: Hey $me, do you know why the screen in the conference room doesn't do anything?

I am surprised by his choice of words.

&gt; $me: 'Doesn't do anything'?  
&gt; $intern: Yeah it only shows Google and nothing else.  
&gt; $me: So the screen is working?  
&gt; $intern: Yeah, but maybe the computer... I don't know.

The screen in the conference room is indeed connected to a computer. I become worried about the computer not being connected to the office wifi and I start thinking about where the hell we documented the wifi password.  
I walked with $intern to the conference room and see the screen with a Google Chrome startup page.

&gt; $intern: Yeah, so when I click any of these links...

And the Chrome dino game appears. I take the keyboard, press the Up key and start playing the game.

&gt; $me: So what's the problem here?  
&gt; $intern: ... I had no idea you could do that. I didn't know it was a game.

I'm entertained by his surprise, let the dino run into a cactus and start troubleshooting. I notice the OS says there is no network connection and I start worrying about the wifi password again.  
I look at the back of the computer to see if there is a network cable to be found.

&gt; $intern (while playing the dino game): Yeah, I already checked all the cables. What's your high score by the way?  
&gt; $me: Oh, I don't know. I never remember such things.

To my great relieve I notice a network cable and check if it's plugged in right. The clip seems broken. I pushed it back in, asked the intern to check if he can click any link and the correct website shows up.

&gt; $intern: Oh. Thanks.  
&gt; $me: Yeah, the cable fell out. By the way, could you surf to `about:dino`?

I let him do his thing and walked out smiling."

I've already got 2 great professors lined up, so I just need a third. Here's my options and a little information about all of them.

1. Option 1 is my boss for my off-campus work-study position. I've worked with her the longest, and she is a licensed clinical social worker in our state. I guess I'm kind of worried that this position and place of employment wouldn't stand out as much as my other options, though.

2. Option 2 is a supervisor I had for a summer internship. This internship was with a national program that's fairly well-known, and I've already been asked to come back next summer so it wouldn't be out of the blue. However, this supervisor's background is business, so although the internship is with a non-profit I'm not sure how much grad schools will look at her credentials and background.

3. Option 3 is the supervisor for my current internship. She has a PhD in a similar field, but not social work. However, the work I do there is particularly related to what I would like to do with an MSW and the population I would like to focus on. The only issues are that I know she's pretty busy usually and that our schedules don't overlap a ton so I'm not sure exactly how comfortable she'd be with giving me a strong recommendation.

Anyone have any opinions or something else I should be considering to make this decision? Thanks!"

I have a relatively light course workload thanks to having taken a lot of humanities APs in high school. I'm still currently in my first semester, but if I take 4 classes/semester for 4 semesters and 3 classes for the last two I will be able to graduate. If I wanted to, I could take three classes for the remaining semester and graduate in 7 semesters (I'll be a full-time student for 6/7). I do not have any interests in minoring/double majoring, and would rather have time to work on pet projects.

That being said, I don't think I'll land an internship this summer. I am only completing my first programming class and everywhere I have applied I have been rejected. Instead, I plan on taking math classes at the local community college. So, if I were to graduate in three years total I would have only one internship. I'm not a huge fan of college right now, so I would like to graduate earlier + the semester would be a semester's worth of pay. Hopefully I come around.

TL:DR: 6 semesters w/ 1 internship or 7 semesters w/ 2 internships? Could I even do 6 semesters, graduate, then do another internship???

EDIT: From purely a hiring standpoint.

EDIT2: Looking around this sub and others, not a ton of CS majors even have 1 internship. If I wanted to be hardcore, I could graduate in 5 semesters, assuming a workload over the summer when I'm a rising third-year."

The job is part-time/internship, so I would be working remotely from my campus as well as at their office in Delaware during breaks and over the summer. The original hope is that I would secure this position, and then hope they hire me after graduation.

I've heard, however, that this internship/position really just sets you up for back-office work at JP in operations - something that I really do not want to do. If I did get it, I would have to sacrifice this upcoming summer to work with JP and wouldn't be able to get an internship anywhere else. I still think it would be great to have on my resume, but I dont want to set myself up to just secure a back office job with them. I also heard that its very difficult to move from a back-office job in finance to a front office one.

I guess my question is, if I get this JP part-time/internship, would it be in my best interest to stick with JP and then hope to make the transition into some front office work with them and hope that I can work my way into a different department? Or should I just try to get directly into an internship in a front-office position so that can set me up with a smoother transition into what I really want to do? 

Thanks!"

I live in Staten Island and I'm currently a senior in high school. I'm having trouble deciding between RIT and SUNY University at Buffalo. I want to pursue a Computer Science degree and hopefully work as a Software Engineer when I graduate. If I go to RIT, I can graduate with a Software Engineering Degree but if I go to UB, I would graduate with a Computer Science degree. Here are a couple of other key points that are affecting my decision.

**RIT:**

*Pros:*

\- In the course is a mandatory co-op program. I don't have to network or anything. RIT provides great companies such as Amazon and Microsoft to intern at.

\- Graduates from this school obtain jobs within 6 months.

\- Graduates roughly average 90-100k starting salaries.

\- It is a tech school, so networking within that field would be great.

\- Great campus

&amp;#x200B;

*Cons:*

\- It's a lot of money. Roughly 30k - 40k a year, not including any scholarships. ( Not sure if I'll get any )

\- My closest friends want to go to UB for the Computer Science program so I wouldn't be with them.

&amp;#x200B;

**UB**

*Pros:*

\- There is a scholarship that I'm guaranteed to get that will allow my tuition to be free. Financial aid would cover room and other things. ( I would go there for nothing basically )

\- The majority of my closest friends would go that school. We're like a family so the college experience would be more fun.

\- Well known Computer Science program with good professors ( I think )

\- Cost of living off campus is lower than Rochester.

&amp;#x200B;

*Cons:*

\- I would have to network and hustle to get my own internships.

\- I would miss out on a better program (education wise) at RIT.

\- Party school. **( Don't know if this is a pro or a con yet )**

I'm in a tremendous bind, even if it doesn't look like it on the surface. I work 25-30 hours a week and, twice a week, I go into NYC for college, 3 classes a day + 6 hours of trainrides.

It is absolutely abysmal, to say the very least. I work retail at a big corporate store, am basically just a step above a disposable teenager (M, 21) and make basically nothing even though they try to tell me otherwise (about $12/hour.) The problem is that because my job is retail, there is no such thing as a weekend for me, and for the last 4 years I have not had a single break from work that wasn't explicitly a personal vacation and it is actively destroying my chances of leaving my shitty job. I work holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, I work overnights, evenings, early mornings directly after late night closings, wherever they want to throw me.

I'm going to an extremely expensive school for art and I think I have a lot of promise. I'm currently looking for internships but they are incredibly hard to focus on, because they require a stronger portfolio. But I can't so much as work on my schoolwork effectively, let alone a professional portfolio to potentially climb out of this hell.

Usually my hours are anywhere from 230 pm to 11 pm, sometimes that shift exactly, but with enough 7 am to 5 pm shifts that I can't rely on any kind of assumed schedule. My classes are compressed, 6 in 2 days, and because they're in NYC I have to leave my house at 6 AM and don't come back until just under midnight. Those are the only two days a week I have off of work unless they just happen to schedule me for an additional day off, which is neither predictable nor common, especially as the holidays set in. I have absolutely no time to do schoolwork effectively and so nearly every project I've turned in has been a rushed, awful mess, whereas my classmates who live on campus and don't work have all the time in the world to focus on their art and are clearly growing because of it.

I'm doing nothing. I want to spend what little free time I have with my girlfriend, and it further limits the amount of time I can spend on my schoolwork. I've tried to call out explicitly to get things done but any sick leave, especially around the holidays, is treated as a great slight against corporate and is heavily discouraged.

I need money to at least take me from point A to point B, gas and food and supplies and car insurance payments to my parents, student debt from my previous college, and emergency funds because my last few cars have either broken down or have been destroyed in accidents I wasn't responsible for (snowplow destroyed trunk of my last car, before that I was rear-ended at high speed on the highway) so I'm stuck with a 2k lemon with a transistor that could fall off at any moment, and it's basically impossible to save any money at all faster than $50-100 once or twice a month.

I absolutely need money to continue moving forward with, basically life I guess, but my current job is disrespectful of my time and I've worked plenty of entry-level shit jobs to know that it's exactly the same everywhere else. But if I stay on this track, I will have flushed thousands of dollars down the drain getting a half-assed education and going nowhere fast.

The glimmer of hope I have comes in the form of a $2,000 student loan check that wasn't spent at the beginning of the semester. I've made just enough money through this terrible job to deflect all expenses up to this point and maintain about ~$2k in my checking account because of it, and I think that if I get another one next semester, I could potentially comfortably get myself through without having to rely on my job to support me at all, but I want or need to leave as soon as I possibly can. Any time spent fatigued, over-worked, and incapable of performing for class is money flushed down the toilet.

Should I just quit my job and grit my teeth for now? Or am I just fucked?

9zxbmn,2,2018-11-24,How do I obtain an office job in my situation (details down below)?,Sorietei,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9zxbmn/how_do_i_obtain_an_office_job_in_my_situation/,"I need a bit of help right now as I feel I've done a piss poor job of adulting and getting myself accustomed to the job market. Right now, I just want to pursue an office job - basically anything in an office environment (admin, reception, marketing etc). That's literally my dream job for now, for all my other ones involve hobbies (like writing and getting my first novel published). But, here's the problem: I'm completely directionless with regards on how to pursue this.

I'm a 23M situated in Vancouver at the moment and graduated in May 2018 with a degree in Human Geography from UBC. I was the kind of immature kid that just wanted to go to college for the overall experience. I wasn't dead sure what major I wanted to pursue job-wise, so I bounced from one to the next. Started off with history, then cycled to economics/business/international relations when I saw how poor the job market looked. As all three majors at my uni were highly competitive, I couldn't get in mainly because my study skills were extremely poor when it came to anything math or business related. So I barely passed those courses. In the end, I settled with Geography in my third year because of the prospect of GIS seeming like a promising industry to work in. I was enjoying my decision immensely in my third, but then the summer before my 4th year came and everything changed. First, I managed to obtain an internship using GIS that ended poorly because my supervisor had to leave and didn't manage to appoint anybody in his place. This coupled with the death of a beloved family member (which caused me many sleepless nights) had led to me straying away from the field as a whole. I had seeped into a deep depression, cutting off contact from most people in the process. Now that I've graduated at 23 years of age, I feel my degree is absolutely useless, my GIS skills completely obsolete and my job prospects low. The first job I got was 4 months after graduation, working at an airport as a baggage handler for a storage company. I was doing a solid job, but then after a month and a half, I got a call saying that I wasn't suited for the position (I was on probation at the time).

It's not only because of that that I wasn't able to secure a good enough gig upon graduation. I was drafted into the military in my home country (Thailand) and had obligations to return there in April 2019 to partake in the ceremony. Because I had obligations to move back home for military service, it was difficult to find a full-time employer willing to take me on. So, I had to settle for part-time positions in the meantime. I tried temp agencies, but they were of no use to me. I basically waited months without hearing back from them, and this is with me nagging them on for jobs.

Fortunately, I do have experience. I worked two part-time jobs during the summers while I was in uni, did almost two years worth of an internship with a non-profit company in event planning and I did various volunteering gigs in the past. I'm currently employed as an event assistant for a staffing agency, partaking in temp gigs on behalf of them. However, while it is in an industry I want to get a career in, the pay is low and the hours are very infrequent. Plus, most of what I do is grunt work. There'd be a week per month where I'd spend them not working. I'm also supposed to do marketing for a non-profit organization, but they've told me they need to fix their marketing department first before I get assigned anything. So far, my goal is to obtain a job that at least makes use of a bachelor's degree, so I can apply for my PR card here in Canada. I'm fine with settling with anything as long as it helps me obtain a full-time position that will allow me to apply for it.

I know a lot of people have stated that fast food and retail is what I should get started in, but I feel this will hinder my chances of getting into the field rather than improve them. Besides, I already have customer service experience with my event assisting job (despite the inconsistent and sometimes infrequent hours) and all my friends who have arts degrees have all found office work without much experience or having done much networking for that matter. So it makes me wonder if I actually need to get another bachelors degree. This is really all I want to do for a job; just be a desk jockey for a living while I pursue my hobbies on the side.  I just need advice, that's all. I've been feeling nothing but pain and envy seeing all my friends enter into stable relationships and obtaining good jobs that make use of their degree, while I'm stuck here, alone and with a crappy temp job that pays peanuts. I don't want that hole to be dug any further for me. 

Also, one more thing... is it too late to get an office job? I know I'm 23 and all, but because of the rampant ageism everywhere in the world, I feel I've missed the boat entirely. I feel like the equivalent of an 80-year-old man right about now.  A wise man once said: “Some **people die** at age **25** and aren't buried until they're 75.” I don't want that to be my future. "

To preface, I'm 21 and in a long distance relationship with someone from the US for almost 6 years now and I'm working on getting my degree here in Argentina and at least a little work/internship experience before moving to the US. Note that we will likely get married for me to immigrate there and I won't need an H1B or similar to have the right to work legally, so that's out of the way (spouse or fiance visa should lead to green card or citizenship which will grant me the right to work).


My question is more regarding how employers will recognize my degree. I'm studying for an information systems analyst degree, which is a 3 year degree here (about 20-25 hours/week of class for 3 years). The degree itself is a mix of the usual engineering math, programming and IT systems analysis/management at a highly recognized national public university.


Aside from that I'm also working on a couple personal open source projects and I'm planning to complete at least one internship before starting my immigration process to the US in a couple years. I have experience with basic back end Python, SQL and C from personal projects and I have no issues learning any new languages (I'll probably start with Java, C# and some web dev soon).


I know it's not the usual 4 year CS degree, and it's not explicitly called a bachelors but it should be very similar (we don't have bachelor degrees here). My biggest concern is will that + personal projects + internship be enough to at least get my foot in the door in any decent job? I'm not looking for any high paying jobs necessarily, just anything in the CS field that is like 40k+ a year full time (trying to manage my expectations a bit). I know the field can be competitive. Is it even worth getting this 3 year degree or should I just focus on getting work experience?

PS: I'm completely fluent in english and spanish and I'm also a EU citizen (not sure that will help, but seems worth mentioning).


Thanks for any insight!

I'm a 3rd year CS university student and this is my last 2 semesters. 

A lot of my friends are starting to look for jobs right now, or are planning to do so during next semester. Some of them find more success and secured internships in Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Intel.. While others have less luck.

As for myself, I don't have a lot of resume under my belt except studying at a good university so my CV is pretty generic. I have never had an interview before. I'll surely love to secure an internship at Microsoft for example, but I'm afraid to screw my chances by it being my first interview. How can I up my chances to nail that first interview?  
I have ""Cracking the Coding"" book and a friend suggested leetcode. Are these enough? If so, how much should I invest in them before I hand over my CV to Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc? (I have friends from university who can pass my CV inside the company).

I'm pretty much have no idea what awaits after university since the last years were study 24/7. I'm not even sure which job I want since I have no previous experience, but from how students take it, working at a big company is the ideal start.

Help me out &gt;.&gt;

Accounting is easier in university

But CS grads makes more at their first job

I  think it's easier to get a job in accounting if you graduate with  mediocre grades and no intern experience than if you graduate in CS with  mediocre grades and don't have any side projects

I think there's less age discrimination with accounting as you get older

I  think there's less work in actual programming jobs than there is as an  accountant where you have a ""busy tax season"" and you're at work all day

but in accounting you can work in a lot more cities... with CS you're pretty much can only work in toronto or ottawa

maybe  with accounting you'll have knowledge to take more control of your own  finances... but with programming knowledge you can work on personal  projects and make good money

Sorry if this sounds idealistic or sappy but one of the few things that I'm truly passionate about is the preservation of the planet and I feel that if my job can relate to that I'll be more motivated to work hard and less likely to burn out.

However, I wasn't able to get an internship then and due to attempting to do both school and live it up socially, I screwed up my GPA, which is now an unimpressive 3.00. I'd appreciate advice from those experienced that have made similar mistakes as mine. How did you proceed? What is your advice? It seems difficult to even get an entry level job. My present plan is as follows:

1. Review accounting/finance fundamentals.
2. Find finance/econ related companies I want to work for. Find out their values.
3. Find people who work at these companies through my small LinkedIn network (planning on buying Premium), UCSB friends, cold emailing and cold calling, networking events, coffee meetings, going physically to offices, and hitting up the popular job hunting sites such as [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com) and Monster, etc. and network/form connections with them; then ask them to connect me to those hiring.
4. Improve my Excel skills and learn financial modeling; possibly learn value investing.

What else would you recommend? I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

Wrote my main one about writing a rap album with friends. Funny, provided a good outline of who I am, a bit philosophical at times. Counselor said it was one of the best he has read. My “Why Duke” was good, basically said every reason why I loved Duke. My other Duke essay was about being a ginger, rather lighthearted and funny but also had some introspection about dealing with bullying as a kid.

a0gkzq,36,2018-11-26,Working at Northwestern Mutual for a Year,NYEnigma,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/a0gkzq/working_at_northwestern_mutual_for_a_year/,"Hey guys,

I know this topic has been covered a lot in the past, but its been weighing heavily on my mind and I felt the need to create a Reddit account and share with you my concerns and ask from the community some feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

I got recruited into the Northwestern Mutual Internship my Senior year of College. I really love finance and I went to school for it and I thought this would be a great opportunity to get some experience, **it being a top 10 Internship at Vault.com and what not!** You need to pass your insurance license exam and then when you reach a certain sales quota they allow you to pursue a Series 6 and Series 63 License so you can include IRA and investments in your clients' planning.

&amp;#x200B;

After almost a year of working here as an intern, I've had a few concerns about this career path/company that I wanted to share with you. I've read many posts on here, and it seems like the general consensus is that this is a bad company which uses aggressive sales tactics to rope your family and friends into buying whole life insurance policies with high annual premiums. That right there might have already answered my question. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is this: I really love financial planning/advising, and I think it is an important career and its professionals offer vital services, but there is something inside my mind that tells me I am not doing good to my community like everyone at NWM tells me I am. There is something about calling all of my family and friends and pressuring them into meeting with me and buying expensive life insurance policies that I find immoral.

&amp;#x200B;

The people who have worked at NWM have all told me that I am doing a service to my community by providing them financial plans, but how I really feel is that I have tricked the few clients I've made to get a quick buck, I have strained the relationship I have with my close friends and family, and that I am in debt because it is a commission only job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm beginning to feel like this company is not right for me, but the reps in the office are telling me to not give up and to keep pushing. What should I do? Should I quit this company and find another? **If Northwestern Mutual is in fact a good company to work for please someone convince me otherwise. If it is a bad company to work for then please tell me.** I am young and I know I want to have a successful career in finance, but I need some guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

And if the answer to my first question is ""Yes, leave this company"", my follow up question is this: **Would it be any different at another company like Merrill Lynch or Charles Schwab? If I worked as an advisor at a different company, would I still be using aggressive sales tactics on family and friends and inevitably damaging the relationship I have with them? Is it any different at all?**"

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been working on and off on this SOP for like a month (which is awesome because I'm using it as a model for all of my SOPs, not using the same one, but using the idea of it, and deadlines are fast approaching and honestly I just want to sleep.) If any of you lovely people have the time (or inclination) I would love some feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

 

I’ve been telling stories since I could speak—writing since I could spell. My goal for an MFA in Creative Writing is to take my skills and make them better. I think the best place for me to get the most out of the program, is Florida State University. 

&amp;#x200B;

I write stories about characters who are trying to muddy through intense moments in their lives. I incorporate comedy as a method of release from both the intensity of their emotions for the reader and a break for the characters themselves, which is one of the reasons I would love to work with Robert Olen Butler. His work in *Hell* melds a confused and tired individual with the absurdity of how death and Hell can tear someone down, but he can still appreciate the ironies and comedies that are portrayed in the story. I tend toward mid length short stories or drawn out longer ones, and I think that Virgil Suarez would help create a better, concise flash fiction, which is something that I have been striving for.

&amp;#x200B;

Professionally, I interned for the (edited out), a literary and art magazine at (Edited out) Community College. I worked as both a Poetry Editor as well as the Layout Editor. I oversaw interns at my first job out of college; I instructed them on creative ad copy and graphic design. That was when I really learned that I love teaching—seeing the interns grasp and utilize the lessons I taught them was intensely satisfying. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to my professional experience, I co-organize the (Edited out) Writing Group. Helping someone improve their writing, and getting that help in return, is just fun. Writers sometimes need the reminder that a reader can’t see what is in our heads, and having a group to ask why something is important and what’s the point of such and such, makes for better and stronger revision. I definitely forget sometimes, that people outside of my brain don’t know the joke. Being in the MFA program would give me that focus and reminder on a larger scale.

&amp;#x200B;

My undergrad was at (Edited out) University. I received two degrees, one in Creative Writing and the other in Media/Communications. I took three Fiction Workshops: Two with (Professor) and another with (professor). All three of which, I received A’s in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Florida State University has one of the most diverse faculties that I have found in my research. In particular, Robert Olen Butler and Virgil Suarez are the ones who I think I could work with the best. Butler crosses genre lines with disparate tales, like the comedic macabre of *Hell* and the somber stories of *Severance*. Suarez, similarly, has variety in his *The Soviet Circus Comes to Havana*, but his stories feel fast paced and to the point,  I want to learn. Writing, learning, and teaching is what I love to do. Florida State is where I want to continue my education.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel good about it. It's at 487 words (cut off is 500). I just don't know. I'm second guessing and feeling insecure.

&amp;#x200B;

The prompt was Explain your goals and experience (essentially, that's not verbatim).

For some context, I've been doing some thinking and I want to get to a level where I can design web-applications five to ten years down in my career. I realized that I don't know why I might pick say React over Vue, or if I'm doing Mobile Development, would I stick to Swift/Android or just opt for React Native. Why might a person use GraphQL over REST? I've made a small starter project in React before and I have encountered terms such as Apollo, MobX, Redux, Relay etc. Although I do not know what they mean and what these libraries do specifically, I do want to learn about them. I know that as a beginner it is easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of different libraries etc. However I guess what I'm trying to learn is, how do I develop this intuition on what tool is perfect for a specific task?

&amp;#x200B;

On a bigger scale, from the perspective of a Software Engineer and not as of a Web Developer, I'd like to know the answers to these questions as well. What language is good for a backend service and what's the difference between say using Python/Node/Go/Java for this purpose. When would I want to use Functional Languages?  What kind of database do I need to use? If I'm making a desktop app, would it be better to try Electron or go with something more traditional, Java/C++. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a particular resource/guide/write-up explaining the purpose of each major framework/library and the differences, and when to use what? I feel that would be pretty helpful for someone trying to navigate their way through the JavaScript eco-system. I realize that building this said intuition will take years and years of experience and working with various technologies. I'm just looking for a quick overview however. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a interview with Microsoft earlier this year for an internship, and one of the questions they asked me was what's the difference between Java and JavaScript. I talked about how they were completely different languages, and how they only shared the ""java"" in the name. I also talked about how JS is mainly used with web technologies, but beyond that I couldn't really list any more differences. This is also one of the main concepts I want to understand - what is different between one language and the next, one framework and the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone can point me to books as well for Systems Design or some sort of guide on how to architect apps, that would be great. I feel that once developers start to understand why they have to use a specific tool and not some other tool, they can gain a better understanding of not only whatever they're working on, but be able to develop a solid grasp on all the tools that are available. Not only that, but I feel that this understanding will allow other beginners to answer some of their own questions, such as what stack to use? They'll ask better questions such as what problems they want to solve, and with the understanding of what to use when, they'll be able to pick a stack for themselves!

I live in Dobbs Ferry, NY, and I currently attend Mercy College as a Finance and Data Analytics double major. I am moving off campus into an apartment with two of my close friends. Rent is $850 a month w/ utilities costing an additional $50-$75 a month. Anyone from the area will know that you can't find anything much cheaper than that, so I have already committed to the apartment in order to reserve myself a spot. I move in sometime in January and start paying rent Jan 1st/Feb 1st (I'm not sure how first month rent works, this is my first apartment). 

I would ideally like to find an internship in one of the fields I am majoring in, but Spring internships usually don't start until late February/early March and I need to be able to pay rent before that. What I am looking for are ways for me to generate $1,000 a month without being employed, or methods of finding a job and getting hired within a week or so of applying. Any advice with this issue would be extremely helpful. Thank you!

My group and I asked a prof to be our supervisor, and he said that he wanted to work with us (good sign!). Then he said that if we took a year for our final project, we can publish a paper.

Is it worth the extra semester (I would graduate in 2 years, instead of 1.5 like I originally planned)? And I don't know if this matters, but I'll be 26 years old by the time I get out.

I’m a undergrad at cs. I keep applying for SWE internships for at least 3 months but I got few feedbacks or interviews. I went to GHC this year and left a lot of my resumes there but barely any companies gave me followed up. I interviewed with one company which I really like but they sent me a rejected email said they’re full of this position at 2am yesterday. I’m super upset and have no idea what to do. 

I changed my major from math to cs two years ago. I didn’t have any previous internship experience that’s why I really want to have one before I start to apply for full time job. Probably because my resume is not strong enough since I only have one hackathon experience and others are all class project. 

Can anyone give me any suggestions for my situation? I’m super discouraged recently and feel so unsupported being a women in tech. :((

Any advices could be super helpful! 

Thank you in advance. 


Update: 
Thank you so much for those who gave me the advice. I would like to post my resume and hopefully someone could give me some advices. 

Thank you sooo much. I appreciate it :)))

However, i really hate doing this study. Instead of this i want to do a master in philosophy. Only problem is: i have to continue with my current study (my parents want me to become teacher like them), and i'll be 25/26 when i'm done. If i do the master after this one, i'll be 30 years old until i'm done with both. And at that time i would have one degree in something i don't want to do (teaching) and one degree in something i can't find work with (philosophy). 

I also play in a moderatly ok band that has certain potential to make it bigger, but thats one big gamble. 

I actually just want a easy job that i don't take home, i don't want to think about work all day like i'm doing when i'm teaching (i had to do internships as a teacher. The work is astronomical, and i don't get a single moment of peace in my mind the whole time during the internship - not bc i couldn't do it, it was a very good internship, just because i can't get it out of my mind). I don't want it to be like this my whole life, so i don't want to become a teacher. 

But what else can i do? My parents won't be happy when i'm doing a 'simple' job, i won't be happy if i have to be a teacher. I want to make it with my band, but thats more luck than anything else.

There is also something else: i havent had sex in 4 years, and i'm kinda getting a bit crazy... I feel like i'm losing my chances to meet someone. I've tried to date a couple of girls, but it al turned out like shit. 2 of these girls went to study abroad and came back with some1 else, another didn't really want to go further. Even if a say so myself, i'm quite ok looking, deffenitly not ugly. And i guess i'm kinda interresting. But i just kinda don't know how to put myself out there. When i'm going out i don't want to 'disturb' girls bc i don't think they'll like me. In my school i'm to scared to become a laughing stock for asking some1 out that doesn't feel the same way about me. i'm starting to get really anxious to go on dates, because it has been a while since i had sex, and i would perform bad. 

And one last thing: i have a severe weed addiction. I have been smoking 3/4 joints every single day for the last 6 years. I don't know how to stop, and i don't even know if i want to stop. I just feel like it's starting to dictate my life. 

I don't really know what kind of advice i would want, just wanted to write this out. If anyone has some advice or shares the same problems, feel free to comment. "
a0lyj6,10,2018-11-26,Observations of Mine in the Internship Application Process,jptboy,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/a0lyj6/observations_of_mine_in_the_internship/,"I started applying to internships late September, just got my first offer 11/22/2018 . I go to a well known State School, around rank 40 in CS and I am a sophomore (in CS obv). Applied to pretty much every big name company and a lot of local companies. Probably 80-90 Companies total. I got about 6-7 coding challenges, 5 first round interviews, 1 final interview, and 1 offer. My offer is from a big medical devices company, and its for an embedded systems internship for 25 dollars an hour. C++ and C code for embedded Linux.

An interesting observation is that the company that I got the offer from, I had put my preferred name as a Caucasian name on their application. My real name is Indian, and I took some advice from /r/cscareerquestions  and put a white sounding name as my preferred name. Might just be random , but maybe that might actually increase your chances if you have a foreign name. I am a US citizen though.

If I have any advice for freshman entering their sophomore year next year or anyone applying for internships next year, I would say to do interesting side projects (not stuff that's generic and has been done), practice Hackerrank/leetcode for coding challenges and interviews, and really know the fundamentals about CS from your classes (Systems, DS, Algo). Also start applying early(latest by mid October), don't apply through LinkedIn(only 1 company contacted me back from LinkedIn EasyApply), and just be patient with the process.


Also, it is Paramount to get a PERFECT score on coding challenges, so practice a lot of Hackerrank, Leetcode,  and old coding challenge problems that you find. Along with that type of practice, study system design and general theory, I know some people perfect at DS and Algo who got destroyed in System Design questions."

I am a bit embarrassed to post this in this group, but I am hoping to meet others. 

I am a female with Aspergers or high functioning Autism, was just diagnosed this year and it explains so much that I have struggled with. 

I have networked and interviewed for Investment Banking and I have relevant experience as well. 

However, I am struggling with networking, keeping in touch and having deeper business conversations with people. 

One of my weaknesses is interviews. Most of the interviews I have succeeded in are over the phone. The feedback that I have gotten was the typical bs like that I need to read the Rosenbaum's Investment Banking book (which I have many times) etc.. 

I am great, however, at meeting people and having small talk, informal interviews, because I know there is always a set list of things to talk to with people. Most of the networking events I have succeeded in were ones at bars (haha) 

I maybe have succeeded with one formal in-person interview with a huge bulge bracket firm, and I am not sure why. Maybe because I was an art history major and the MD was a history major at my school. 

My last internship, my coworkers would kinda make fun of me for being and jokingly call me snobby because I would talk about when I lived in France, but that is all I really have to talk about besides finance and other cultures and things I am interested in. 

I had a phone call with my old boss today and I said a lot of the same things to him like ""oh that's interesting"" or ""I will definitely look that up"" because I don't know what else to say. 

It was my first phone call in a year because I took a break from recruiting for health reasons and I am getting back to it. So I am a bit nervous to finally get back into it. 

Any advice? I actually like being social, I just struggle with it at times. I don't know really how to be likable, which is honestly something I can't always pick up on.  I also don't know how to keep in touch with people. 


I am not going to let this stop me from getting what I want, I just need a little extra help and I want to work on it so I can succeed and kill it! "

My options are:

(1) Use a BMO USD credit card (my main bank is BMO): https://www.bmo.com/main/personal/credit-cards/us-dollar-mastercard/

Does the no foreign transaction card process transactions the same as a USD credit card (i.e. I buy 20USD meal. It shows up as 20USD on my credit bill for both option 1 and 2)?

Next week i will be interviewing for the job of Programmer/System Administrator at the community college I received my AAS at, the degree being ""Computer Programming &amp; Web Design"". I have not had any full time or part-time jobs since graduating from the college in May 2018, partially my fault for not putting more effort into job searching, I am very excited at the idea of working in the field I studied for but at the same time i am very nervous because I am not a strong Interviewee.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few concerns that I'd like your opinion on. When i received the call asking for an interview the HR representative said ""you were the most qualified applicant"", some people would think ""hell yeah!"" but I'm thinking more along the lines of ""really?! are you sure?"", allow my to explain my thought process, while I am somewhat versed in front-end and back-end coding languages and I have had an internship earlier this year involving quite a bit of database work, I do not have a lot of networking experience or knowledge(aside from what some would consider the basics, formatting drives, fixing the router, etc.) which I thought was kind of the main thing for a System Administrator so I am concerned i am under-qualified for the job, but I am more than willing to bust my ass to learn all the required skills.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize my rambling, which i do apologize for, how should I approach this interview if i feel as though I am under-qualified? do you have any recommendations in general for my upcoming interview such as attire, should i bring a copy of my resume and/or a letter of recommendation, how do i properly answer the questions ""what are your weaknesses"" and ""where do you see yourself in 5 years""?

Just got rejected from a company I was referred to after *three* separate interviews plus a coding challenge. I even met with the CEO of the company during my final interview. It was looking very promising. Hella pissed off I wasted my time with them. Talk about misleading.

I'm already trash at interviews to begin with, but one question I don't particularly know how to answer correctly is ""What is your process in figuring out a solution if you're stuck on a problem?""

I was wondering, @ all the CS veterans out there, is it bad to mention I refer to Stack Overflow for very tough problems I've spent days working on? I'm definitely not copy/pasting the code I find on Stack Overflow. I look at what the code does and then write my own rendition of it for my program. I would tell the interviewer(s) I do that if I'm truly stuck.

I'm thinking the worst they can take from that is I'm not very creative or something since I'm referencing how someone else solved a problem and then altering it. But first of all, I'm an intern so I obviously don't know as much as people who are full time coders. I'm there for the purpose of learning. I'm also getting paid to solve a problem, not reinvent the wheel. That means I should use all the resources that are available at my disposal. So it shouldn't be that bad to mention.. right? 

Sidenote - If you guys have additional advice as to how I should answer that interview question and maybe tips on how to get better at interviews, that would be great too.

Thanks in advance!"

a0rsi8,2,2018-11-27,Math major/CS minor -- would I be fucking myself declaring a major as a senior?,MusicTechBro,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/a0rsi8/math_majorcs_minor_would_i_be_fucking_myself/,"Hey guys,

Title is pretty self-explanatory. I'm currently a junior at a liberal arts program who's a double major with math and music and a CS minor, and I was not originally planning to declare a CS major. However, I took all of the courses which counted for both CS and math (Intro, Data Structures, Systems Programming, Algs, Linear Optimization, Discrete). When I applied to Summer internships in multiple fields, I was surprised to hear back mostly from SE gigs. I've been doing well on the HackerRank prescreenings and in a few in-person interviews, so I'm reconsidering. I could potentially graduate with a triple major, but I realize I would probably have a higher GPA if I stuck with the minor (which the CS chair at my school advised me to do). My reasoning for not dropping the other two is that there isn't a music minor and I'm close to finishing the math major. (However, if I dropped math after this semester, I'd still have a math minor.)

My classes for next semester are locked in, and I'm taking an AI class which'll finish the CS minor. If I triple majored, my senior year would look something like this:

Fall: Probability, Programming Abstractions, Theory of CS, two music major classes

Spring: Group Theory, Advanced Algs, Computer Architecture, one music class

Another concern is that most math majors at my school do more than the minimum requirements, and if I ever did want to go to grad school for math, then I would take more math. On the other hand, I'm feeling pretty done with school for the time being.

I know these classes are different everywhere, but are any of these horrible ideas to take at the same time?

* Migration of on-premises Hyper-V machines to Azure. 
* Cisco switch management from layer 2 to layer 3 routing.
* Working on internal networking projects alone such as creating new DHCP scopes and ensuring that all other networks (Data Centre, Azure subscriptions) are reachable from our clients.
   * Adding IP policies, static routes, VLANs.
   * This includes Wifi management, configuring RADIUS authentication to our internal DCs.
* Atlassian Jira and Confluence management.
* Creating SOE images based on different department requirements.
* Standard internal IT support (from standard software related issues to hardware issues).
* Liaising with external vendors. 

Next year I'd be moving away from the corporate team and moving to the production team or possibly even a cloud team that is yet to be formed.

I'm based in Melbourne Australia. If you add any salary comments, I'd appreciate if you include the currency you're talking in.

I'm a first-year in a top liberal arts college, and am also an international student. This semester, I fell into a very bad depressive episode (and attempted suicide) because of a ton of factors, and needless to say I fell behind in class for a few weeks. I'm doing pretty badly on my introductory CS because of it, and my uni and class professor haven't been helpful either despite me explaining the situation (I was forced to go get treatment by them, but could not get an extension for my missed CS homework). I have also been doing average on its midterms despite not having the energy to study or do anything at all or really going to class

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really frustrated at how my attempt has caused this and my grade now is around a B-/C. I know I could do a lot better and get an A if I retake the class next semester, and am fortunate enough that I can withdraw from the class up to next week and won't have financials or delays affect me. However, I'm unsure if a C is better than a W, or how badly it would affect me in seeking internships esp. because I'm an international student. (I'm assuming it's more competitive?)  My other classes are fine since my individual professors there were understanding of my situation but yeah I'm definitely pissed and don't really know if I should. In terms of internships, I have a lot of side projects too and hopefully that compensates a bit? idk i just really messed up bad because of the thing. My mental health is still pretty taxed now but is getting better, but I doubt my last homework or final could pull my grades up and it's just really really annoying that it's got this bad--I know I could do better and I love cs. Any thoughts on if I should just withdraw and retake?

**Background**

I just finished a four year degree in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science. At the end of which, I can program in C/C++/Java/Python. But I haven't had an internship. I'm not sure how to use some tools or even work with some IDE's. I've never programmed anything with UI elements. I don't know how to Unit test, only passing familiarity with Agile or Scrum or any other Software development practices I keep hearing about. I've never shell scripted or used Cmake or Maven or Gradle or Eclipse. And I'm not even that sure how important those things are. But I can program. I know about variables, variable scopes, data types, data structures, loops (for, while, dowhile, etc), exceptions, various sorting algorithms, recursive functions, object oriented stuff like classes, interfaces, etc, etc, etc.

**Question**

How realistic is it for me to be able to find a job as a software developer? I'm in a panic here because I need to find work **now** and I actually feel like I'm in no way prepared for whatever job I jump into. I've thought about looking into embedded systems programming because that'll utilize the electrical engineering side of my degree, but I don't see any local positions for that and it's very important to stay local where I am while my wife finishes her schooling and that leaves mostly software development.

Well, 3 years have passed since then and while my raises have been *relatively* substantial, I am still 5% under the median salary for my area. My area is also 20% below the national average for this position and that doesn't even take into consideration that my experience now covers both front and back end.

Anyway, I'm trying to move somewhere around Denver and find a decent paying job but my current salary is making it very difficult to actually save the sort of money necessary for that move. Does anyone have any experience with moving to a new state for better opportunities? 

My initial goal was find a remote position, move, and then maybe a year or two down the road see if i can find a better position locally, but remote positions like that seem few and far between...

I know that the question of ""to get a masters, or not to get a masters"" has been asked a lot before, but I couldn't find good opinions on a case similar to mine. I have a year and a half left until I graduate, and I will have the option to either get my Masters in the year after I graduate or hunt for a good CS job this year that I can intern in and then transition into a full-time job. Basically, I can either have my Bachelors + Masters in 4 years total of education or just my Bachelors in CS (Software Eng.) in 3 years and look into a software engineering job.

However, a lot of answers surrounding this subject have to do with taking costs into consideration. That's not a factor for me. I'm on a full scholarship at my state university which is guaranteed, according to my uni's website, to be good for use even if I do a masters, as long as it's within the 4 years that the scholarship is good for. As long as I stay on-track with my current degree, I could very well get a masters too for free - I'd just have to take a fourth year to get it. 

A lot of arguments against getting a masters seem to factor in the cost, as it can range anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000 at the high end. That is significant enough to offset the theoretical income boost from getting a masters. However, since I wouldn't have to pay for it, would getting a masters in one year be worth it for me? If I don't take the masters after I graduate, that will terminate my scholarship. 

If it's a good idea to continue my masters, should I look out of state or stick with my state's university to keep the scholarship guaranteed? I know that, if I end with a competitive GPA, I could look elsewhere, but scholarships aren't guaranteed. However, I've heard some bad things about my university's masters program. Do employers care where the masters comes from, as long as it's an accredited common university?

a0xlem,5,2018-11-27,"23 y/o, been in same temp position for over a year and seeing negative effects. Is it time for a switch?",thenappyginger,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a0xlem/23_yo_been_in_same_temp_position_for_over_a_year/,"I'm 23 years old, graduated about a year and a half ago from a top 15 university with Latin honors in psychology and English. Some other experience there - president of Fraternity, two years as a university English tutor, assistant internship at a recording studio, and event planning and social media with non-profits.

Out of college, I was pretty convinced I wanted to work in entertainment, but didn't realize this until late and didn't have time for many internship opportunities. I was panicking and accepted the first one offered, even though it was a horrible fit and didn't give me any connections. That didn't prepare me well and I was applying to a dozen jobs a day and never got an interview. Then I went to a temp agency and they placed me in an admin assistant role at a very well known company in the industry. That was in Sept. 2017.

Since then, I've been at the same exact position with the same pay ($16/hour, no PTO/benefits). The communication with the company is lacking at best as I've tried to get better ideas of when my contract might expire or what my opportunities are in the company. This communication issue extends beyond the temp/company relationships and seems to be a large issue here. I've also reached out to other departments to see if I could help, write an article (something!) and emails go unanswered and, if I pop in for a quick word, they either are out-of-town or tell me to come back later. My assignment, however, has been extended through April 2019.

I do have a fairly vital role in my department and they have given me responsibilities and permissions that (imo) temps should not have. Work is always busy, but it's not strenuous most of the time and there's usually plenty of chances for OT.  It is extremely repetitive, however, and, as I'm in customer service, there's a couple folks each day who get quite angry and I'm never there to give out good news.

Other factors: my coworkers are fine. The team of eight I'm in never really talks to each other and we never socialize after work (or share lunch since we have to stagger breaks). I do commute around 50 minutes, but it's easy public transportation access so I just read there and back.

Also, the biggest plus, I can work on other stuff in between my office responsibilities. I am someone who probably loves his side hustles too much, but I run a small eBay business (which I can't scale yet because working on knowledge of goods) and looking to start selling on Etsy. I also love researching and learning so, if I have a thought, I can always search it, read a 5 minute article, and learn more about it. Channeled that love through a music podcast, but the time commitment for that was causing me to burn out fast, so I had to drop it.

So that brings me here, what in the world do I do? I'm tired of never seeing the sun or walking around. My vision cannot focus when I'm at work and the computers I stare at for 9 hours a day are usually just a blur (I never have this problem at home on my computers however). My body aches from sitting all day. I wake up almost everyday and drag through my morning routine, thinking the entire time ""I don't care about this job, just go get the paycheck"". I have no pride in my work and if my family or girlfriend asks how was work, I usually just say ""It's going, I get paid"". I honestly don't know if I would accept a full-time position in my current role if offered.

This is also all coinciding with some mental health issues which I am working to resolve, but seeing a professional has been difficult due to my 9-5 schedule and insurance restrictions (still get it from my mom). I know I'm too critical of myself and sometimes excessively ambitious. The job adds to the stress and anxiety I have and I often lay awake at night thinking ""I did not do anything important today"", which I would at least like my job to partially fulfill. Also, music has always been something I turned to for stress relief, but even now that is jaded because it reminds me of my job.

I've applied to probably 40 other jobs with no luck (around one app a week). The only interview I have got was from an in-company position and was never even sent a decline (learned I didn't get it through a company email welcoming the new hire). The idea of working at a desk with no sunlight makes it hard to send out apps for assistant gigs or other jobs. I have also been thinking about contacting my temp agency to see what other opportunities they may have.

I love reading, writing, working with my hands (woodworking and yarn crafts mostly), numbers and finances (taught myself stock trading), and problem solving. I'm trying to work towards freelance writing, but I don't have the focus or mental stamina to work on it after work and my erratic sleep makes it next to impossible to wake up early to write (either I get home and immediately fall asleep or lay awake half the night).

No one in my family has a positive relationship with their careers and that's all I want. I don't need massive paychecks or the fancy car. I just want to have a position or career where I can grind away and be rewarded for it, and not have to twiddle my thumbs and brown nose, hoping someone maybe recognizes it and sees it fit to give me a paid day off. A job where I'm eager to tell my friends and family about what I do rather than skirting around it and changing the subject.

PS. Holy hell, I'm sorry for the word vomit. This has been cycling in my mind for 6 months and looks like I really just needed to get it out with the nuances. I've tried to keep this all to myself because I don't want to seem ungrateful of my position or entitled, but it's getting harder to not let the frustration take over as I see my health degrade. Thank you so much for any help! You have no clue how much it will be appreciated."

I'm an italian 22 y/o Computer Science student. A couple of months ago I graduated with a bachelor degree in computer science and now I'm attending a master degree mostly oriented in data science and algorithm engineering. I've had few working experiences in the fields (short internship) where I've worked mostly in web application development.

My problem is that I can't find my path in the field, I mean a lot of people ask me: ""Cool, you are a CS student, what job do you want to do when you will get (hopefully) your degree?"" and I don't know what to answer. A lot of my friends who also study in this field can answer this question with ""I'd like to work as Data Scientist"", or Software Engineering, Security Expert and so on. I very like CS and I'm extremely passionate about this field but this is also the problem. There are too many fields and things that I like and I can't decide what is the best field that fit my needs and my skills. Given this indecision I can't even choose a programming language that I could master and this is resulting in studying different things (Java, JS, Python, C++) but at a top level without deeping down to the inner mechanins of a specific language.

So what do Ilike? I like back-end development but I don't like front-end expecially thing related to UI so I think ""I should go with Java"" (because in my area it very used and therefore requested by company) but then I think ""I also like artificial intelligence and machine learning"" (fields that I'm currenlty studying so pretty new for me) so ""maybe Python is better"", but then Mobile development arises with React native and Javascript comes into my mind pretending to be the selected language. Also C has its part with Arduino that is, with robotics and Internet of things, another field that I find interesting. I really don't know what to do, I'm 22 and I think that I should have already decided my field, but what is it?

Help me with some advices pls."

I thought it went pretty well and I was able to finish my project which would be actually integrated into our software aka not a throwaway project. 

Towards the end of the summer, I asked my manager about the possibility of staying on part time as an intern and doing work remotely. He told me that I could, but I wouldn’t be doing software engineering - I would be doing IT stuff (automating infrastructure in specific). Despite not really being interested in the position, I took up the job because the pay is amazing for me as a college student and I could keep my foot in the door.

At the end of summer, I expected a return offer and I figured letting me stay on was a good sign. But now it’s almost December and despite having worked for them this whole time, they have not extended an offer.

I want to ask if they plan on giving me an offer but I’m not sure on how to go about the situation. If they don’t plan on having me back, I don’t really want to keep working for them. How do I ask what their intentions are?

Tldr; I interned for a company over summer and they kept me on as an intern for remote work, but they have not sent me a return offer and I don’t know how to ask about this."

I do not know if what I have learnt so far is enough for me. I have very basic knowledge of Python, SQL, Android App development somewhat intermediate knowledge of Java, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. I have also worked with JDBC/Apache derby and Tableau. My degree is not a full on CS degree. Its like a Hybrid between Business and CS. I looked at what my friends are learning in CS and what I learn is nowhere near the level of stuff they do. To put it in perspective what I learnt in my Senior year they did that in their Sophomore year. I do not have a lot of elective options and I am stuck with very basic courses. I expected my degree to be not as detailed as a CS degree but this just seems lackluster.

a0yzpv,4,2018-11-27,Does he like me?,cache_cache14,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a0yzpv/does_he_like_me/,"Hello and welcome to the probably 3482934th post with a title like this.

We're both in our late 20s and work together, I'm an intern until the end of this year. He's doing an internship as well but one that takes longer. In general, he has more work experience than I do.

We weren't introduced to each other at first but he always smiled at me when we saw each other in the corridor. When he was introduced to me, he immediately offered me to help him with his projects if I want to. I didn't say yes at first because I had an employee who was assigned to officially give me tasks but after a few weeks, I noticed that I had actually a lot of free time during work and that I could easily have a look at the projects he did so I approached him and asked if he still wants me to help him with his projects. He agreed and we were working together on his projects which worked out well because we go along really well and make jokes etc. He didn't ask me a lot of personal questions and we only talked occasionally about personal topics. Which was fine for me because at work, we're almost always surrounded by coworkers and I don't really want them to notice that I have a crush on him. We had lots of eye contact during our conversations and talked about kinda deep topics as they were related to our work which was sometimes kinda awkward as we both began stuttering.

Two weeks ago, he texted me that he needs to bring that one project to an end alone but that after we could continue like before. He asked me if I'm okay with that. I replied that I'm absolutely okay with it and that he doesn't have to feel obligated to work with me as I have an assigned employee. He said that he really doesn't want me to take this the wrong way as he liked working with me and joking around during work. I replied that I also liked working with him and I wished him good luck for the project. He didn't text me after this.

During the following day, we didn't talk a lot until this week. On Monday he came to me with the occasional small talk and was asking me for my opinion on some work-related stuff. I told him that I'm going to take an exam next week and he wished me luck and jokingly said that if the professor is mean to me, I should just tell him and he would beat him lol. 

He's a really friendly person in general which means that he gets along with lots of his coworkers and he jokes around with them as well. That makes it really difficult for me to tell whether he treats me different than the other people. The thing he said on Monday makes me think he's trying to flirt with me as my platonic friends wouldn't say something like this, even jokingly.

Has someone an idea? As we can't really talk openly during work, should I initiate conversation by texting?"

I didn't have CS experience prior to my masters.

I'm consistently not passing coding screens/white boarding interviews. I think I am 2/15 at this point and a lot of these are at big companies (think big 4 and up and coming tech companies). Of the two I passed, one I was completely surprised, as I only got one of the two questions. The other one I looked up the answers while doing it.

I'm frustrated because I keep going through the process and failing (once for a summer internship, then new grad right after college, and then again 6 months later for new grad). So my standard method of preparation doesn't seem to be helping. Simply doing leetcode isn't working. Going through CTCI is not really helping either. Unless its a really easy problem (check if a string is a palindrome, reversing a string, etc), I often find I don't really know how to approach a problem and end up looking at the answer.

It's very annoying because I don't think I am the worst programmer, I've just lost a lot of confidence and the interviews are starting to piss me off. I did decently well in college I just didn't really learn problem solving. Would an interview bootcamp like Interview Kickstart be a good idea? I am considering flying up to the bay and doing that before sending out any more resumes."

 I have two problems my first problem is that my resume is horrible because I don’t have experience in the IT field since I could not get an internship while I was in school. plus my past jobs have nothing to do with IT and while I was in school I change changing majors from nursing to MIS. so I want to know if it is okay to put school projects in the resume and how much in detail should I give. 

Here is my resume [resume](https://i.imgur.com/b7V5alX.png) if you can give me some feedback I really do appreciate it. 

My second problem that I don’t know what jobs should I be applying, is it only help desk that I should look for or am I qualified to other jobs like data analyst. I know that I am asking a dumb question but I switch to MIS from nursing without doing really any research in the field, I was kind of peer pressure from my friend to do MIS because he was in the process of completing it. my friend knew I like to mess with computers but that I did not have time or money to really go in-depth like he did before I change my major to MIS.  I do love everything I did in my school from making database queries to making a EHR server with a raspberry pi. What my problem is now I don’t know what jobs should I be applying for so if you guys can tell me what jobs will be good to start applying for or to keep an eye out for. 

p.s. another reason I am freaking out is because I can’t move from this city that has a population of 700,000 (no big tech companies here) people so I need to get a job her with my degree. And I apologize for my grammar English is my second language.

a10rpa,3,2018-11-27,SRA and IST graduates how hard was it to land a job after graduation? And how do you feel about your degree?,Madler84,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/a10rpa/sra_and_ist_graduates_how_hard_was_it_to_land_a/,"So I'm currently double majoring in SRA-ICS and ISDEV, but I am wanting to finish my degree faster to enter the workforce.  I should preface that I'm a World Campus student that lives in Oklahoma City with 60 credits completed at the end of this semester with a 3.8 GPA.

My dilemma and why I am reaching out to you all is that I am thinking of just doing the SRA major only  with the IST minor.  Because if I did, this would essentially knock off at least a semester for me until I graduate.  I wouldn't have to take 3 foreign language classes (which I love that those are no longer needed) and one of the Math requirements gets knocked off as well. However, I also want to be as fully prepared for the work world as possible.  I will be getting an internship as that is required in order to graduate and ideally I will also have at the bare minimum the Comptia A+ completed with hopes of having the Security+ completed as well.

My main questions to you graduates are, how hard was it to find a job after graduation?  Do you believe you were at a disadvantage compared to other applicants that had Comp Sci degrees?  Did you feel you were prepared for work?  Does the dual major give an advantage over just SRA?

What I would prefer to have a career in is security consulting or pen testing, and would also like to have web developing as a backup option.

I started applying in August for summer 2019 internships and started having some break downs in October because every time you come on the forums you see someone has been hired for FAANG and is making 200 K. 

People on this forum cuss and curse you out, they will tell you your resume is shit, even though everyone has the same damn resume, just different names. What is pretty common is the majority of this forum is filled with liars. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today (and the past few weeks), I got my Amazon coding challenge for software development interns summer 2019 and it clearly states. 

"" You will be contacted by our team with the results of your assessment in the weeks to follow your assessment completion. SDE Intern interviewing will not begin until mid-December and will be scheduled on a first come-first serve basis. ""

Meanwhile I think Ive seen over 30 posts on this thread for people claiming they already have offers for summer 2019 and internships are closed theres no hope (For amazon) .  So I decided to have a run in with a Snapchat recruiter, who also said, Im EARLY. Many many internships havent started interviewing. This was confirmed when I spoke to two recruiters at career fairs with Lockheed and Boeing.

Then onto the salaries: Almost everyone here is a Big N making 200 k on their first year. Meanwhile growing up in the bay area, I know 13 friends between apple google and microsoft, all have been working 2 years and their salaries do not cross 175K. Most in the 150 range (Total comp)

I thought there was no way I was gonna get an internship with the way everyone was talking about their stats here. For context, I only switched to cs middle of my second year and am a current third year at a T10 CS school. I was really scared of applying because of the inevitable rejection of how sucky I thought my stats were. I have no side projects, did some cs work for 2 clubs and have a sub 3.0 GPA. Because of how scared I was, I gave up trying to get an internship second year because I felt underqualified.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be working at Facebook this summer, and have interviewed at 3 of the Big N, 2 unicorns, and 10-15 well known cs companies as well as 3 startups. I did about 120 leetcode, 100 easy and 20 mediums. I however, also did apply to 200-250 applications and just clicked on everything that popped up on my Linkedin feed.

The advice I would give to everyone is to really network and go to career fairs. I had about 5 referrals and I got to know the recruiters at career fairs really well.

a12vp8,0,2018-11-27,I feel like shit for not getting into an Ivy (or other equivalently good) university.,iwantIvy,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/a12vp8/i_feel_like_shit_for_not_getting_into_an_ivy_or/,"I grew up in New England, around an educational environment where if you didn't give 110% you were considered to be slacking off. Admittedly, I did slack off in highschool. I didn't have any kind of frame of reference from my parents as to what success would mean. The scholarships, the social life potential, the career improvements. I graduated with a 2.89 GPA and got into a middle of the road college in the DC area where I have struggled socially. Most of my friends from back home, meanwhile, went into the UC system, NYU, Cornell, Princeton, or some other big name school and are loving it. I don't keep in touch with them that much personally, but I wish I did. I just feel intensely inadequate. 


Socially my school is dead. There's nothing to do on weekends unless you're on a sports team, I need to go into DC for everything. Most importantly I don't feel as though I'm getting the best career preparation from my professors or the institution. We're barred from using the internship office unless it's for a for-credit internship, and even then their applications open appallingly late in the semester. I don't have much of a social life, and I've been told by multiple people who live on campus who were seniors when I was freshman that that's just how life is here. If you don't go to a university in DC to socialize you don't have much. I mentally can't handle it, and I've expressed as much to my parents but they refuse to let me drop and I reluctantly agree with them. I had multiple mental breaks during freshman year, had no roommates, and was pretty much a hermit except for an event I participated in at a university in the city twice a semester and still participate in. It's become a running joke that I wish I was in as much debt as they are if only to be surrounded by people who can lift me up and encourage me to always stay competitive and never let that down.


While it doesn't make me feel like any less of a failure, I want to at least finish this degree (politics) with a 3.6 and get into a good grad program. By ""good"" I mean an Ivy, Cornell, a UC school, Georgetown, even an equivalent overseas if it can save me money. I'm aware that I'm lucky to have even gotten into a college, but I feel I was stifled in highschool. I was put into remedial classes due to a learning disability that wasn't even diagnosed, and when I actually did well I had those classes get dropped in favor of a study hall that I wasn't allowed to drop. It eventually became wasted time. Even when I was allowed into my IEP meeting (late senior year) they refused to drop it and put me into a programming class. My highschool wouldn't let you take any AP classes without guidance counselor permission, and I was always told ""maybe next year"" until graduation came round, so the only non-general class I had was 2 years of Honor Latin where I consistently got a C+. Great teacher, I just had a rough time understanding the intricacies.


I don't have much of a social life. I feel like this next year and a half I have left I *need* to do the absolute best I've ever done in classes. 4.0 or bust, pretty much. I don't really connect with anyone here, my program is fucking tiny and we don't have many avenues to talk with alumni or even fellow current students. I've never heard anyone bring up the existence of an alumni network. Since so many people commute, are athletes, international students, or are continuing education, there's really no sense of community. I feel like there's no point in being here outside of getting out. 


I know one thing, I'm not going to let my kid (if I even have kids) get into anything less than an Ivy or equivalently good college. Whatever passion they want to pursue, I'll encourage it. I'll bring them to those universities that I didn't want to see when I was looking at colleges, that my parents didn't take me to to show me how things were. Was I stubborn? Yes. Does that excuse them not taking me or encouraging me to at least visit the high-ranked colleges? No.


To those who went to Ivy or equivalently good colleges, I guess... how are things? Is it worth it? I guess a lot of the pressure I put on myself is that I'm scared I'll end up in low-wage retail or without much to show for my 4 years outside of the piece of paper that has my degree on it. I grew up with such high expectations, getting into a high-ranked school like my friends and that just didn't pan out.

I am interested in software more than hardware. 
I prefer to go to UTSG because the location is better. 
However, the comp sci for UTSG has no co-op?
The comp sci for UTSC does have co-op. 


1. When I was looking around online, people talked about PEY for UTSG comp sci even though einfo only says paid internship and practicum was available? Isn't PEY for engineering only, or unless they are talking about the internship?

2. If PEY is in fact not available for UTSG comp sci, is the paid internship any good compared to the 
co-op of UTSC? Should I go to UTSC just for the co-op or stick with UTSG for the internship?

3. Should I take computer engineering instead of computer science because of the PEY? How different are the two anyway? 

4. I am considering engineering science, but I've heard it was extremely hard. Is it a bad idea to take it and drop it for computer engineering if I don't like it?



Anyway, I am trying to get into comp sci if possible, what should I do?

I did however, ended up getting an Admin assistant internship where I worked for a couple of months. I really want to get into HR but because I do not have any HR experience I seem to get passed over a lot during applications. I've had my resume looked at professionally a couple of times and have had some interview tips as well. I've tried to reach out to friends about jobs but nothing so far. 

Do you think it's better/beneficial to apply to other office admin/assistant jobs in the meantime (because that's what I DO have experience with) and get working asap then keep looking for HR entry level jobs? Or would it be better to just give it sometime and keep applying for entry level HR positions? Also how long is too long waiting and applying for HR entry level positions before moving on? I've been applying for a couple months now and have not heard anything. I think this is really difficult for me because if I do choose to apply and manage to get an admin role, would I still have an edge when I apply to other HR roles? What do you guys think? 

Do you guys have any experience working with temp agencies that hire new grads without exp and send them to temp HR jobs? I'm really interested with this as well, I'd take any HR role in a heartbeat if I can just get the experience even if they only want me to work there for 1 month. I've tried searching for temp agencies around my city but none of them were looking for HR jobs.. it was mostly labor/manufacturing work and trades or data entry roles.

Right now, I just want to pursue an office job - basically anything in an office environment (admin, reception, marketing etc). That's literally my dream job for now, for all my other ones involve hobbies (like writing and getting my first novel published). But, here's the problem: I'm completely directionless with regards on how to pursue this.

I'm a 23M situated in Vancouver at the moment and graduated in May 2018 with a degree in Human Geography from UBC. I was the kind of immature kid that just wanted to go to college for the overall experience. I wasn't dead sure what major I wanted to pursue job-wise, so I bounced from one to the next. Started off with history, then cycled to economics/business/international relations when I saw how poor the job market looked. As all three majors at my uni were highly competitive, I couldn't get in mainly because my study skills were extremely poor when it came to anything math or business related. So I barely passed those courses. In the end, I settled with Geography in my third year because of the prospect of GIS seeming like a promising industry to work in. I was enjoying my decision immensely in my third, but then the summer before my 4th year came and everything changed. First, I managed to obtain an internship using GIS that ended poorly because my supervisor had to leave and didn't manage to appoint anybody in his place. This coupled with the death of a beloved family member (which caused me many sleepless nights) had led to me straying away from the field as a whole. I had seeped into a deep depression, cutting off contact from most people in the process. Now that I've graduated at 23 years of age, I feel my degree is absolutely useless, my GIS skills completely obsolete and my job prospects low. The first job I got was 4 months after graduation, working at an airport as a baggage handler for a storage company. I was doing a solid job, but then after a month and a half, I got a call saying that I wasn't suited for the position (I was on probation at the time).

It's not only because of that that I wasn't able to secure a good enough gig upon graduation. I was drafted into the military in my home country (Thailand) and had obligations to return there in April 2019 to partake in the ceremony. Because I had obligations to move back home for military service, it was difficult to find a full-time employer willing to take me on. So, I had to settle for part-time positions in the meantime. I tried temp agencies, but they were of no use to me. I basically waited months without hearing back from them, and this is with me nagging them on for jobs.

Fortunately, I do have experience. I worked two part-time jobs during the summers while I was in uni, did almost two years worth of an internship with a non-profit company in event planning and I did various volunteering gigs in the past. I'm currently employed as an event assistant for a staffing agency, partaking in temp gigs on behalf of them. However, while it is in an industry I want to get a career in, the pay is low and the hours are very infrequent. Plus, most of what I do is grunt work. There'd be a week per month where I'd spend them not working. I'm also supposed to do marketing for a non-profit organization, but they've told me they need to fix their marketing department first before I get assigned anything. So far, my goal is to obtain a job that at least makes use of a bachelor's degree, so I can apply for my PR card here in Canada. I'm fine with settling with anything as long as it helps me obtain a full-time position that will allow me to apply for it.

I know a lot of people have stated that fast food and retail is what I should get started in, but I feel this will hinder my chances of getting into the field rather than improve them. Besides, I already have customer service experience with my event assisting job (despite the inconsistent and sometimes infrequent hours) and all my friends who have arts degrees have all found office work without much experience or having done much networking for that matter. So it makes me wonder if I actually need to get another bachelors degree. This is really all I want to do for a job; just be a desk jockey for a living while I pursue my hobbies on the side. I just need advice, that's all. I've been feeling nothing but pain and envy seeing all my friends enter into stable relationships and obtaining good jobs that make use of their degree, while I'm stuck here, alone and with a crappy temp job that pays peanuts. I don't want that hole to be dug any further for me.

Also, one more thing... is it too late to get an office job? I know I'm 23 and all, but because of the rampant ageism everywhere in the world, I feel I've missed the boat entirely. I feel like the equivalent of an 80-year-old man right about now. A wise man once said: “Some **people die** at age **25** and aren't buried until they're 75.” I don't want that to be my future.

TLDR: want to ease myself into a full time office job but my obligations to return back to my home country as well as my degree choice is limiting my chances and I've resulted to doing side hustles to cover gaps. "

So I'm a french student in engineering in telecommunications.

So it will add another year before my graduation. 

I'm trying to know if it is worth it. I want to work abroad, and the degree could help me to start working in Asia, at least more than my french degree.

I went to school, got a degree in advertising / minor in graphic design because I like to write and I enjoy illustration. I graduated at the top of the program. A’s down the line.I thought a career in advertising would be perfect. I spent that first summer after graduating applying to jobs, but I had no experience. This was 2011. Every entry level job required 1-2 years experience. I did not receive a single call back. I knew I should have tried harder, looked for internships, but I became angry and depressed when I wouldn’t even get a call back for those. I was bitter at the school I graduated from as the program did not provide internship opportunities, and at the industry in the area for being so clicky. I don’t make friends easily. I know networking is key, especially in advertising, but I’m not the type of guy who likes to hang out and talk with people. I keep to myself, avoid co-workers out of work, and generally not a people person.

That doesn’t mean I didn’t try. I met with a older man in advertising through the school and hoped he could be a mentor. He looked at my portfolio and said I had a good eye and I could be an art director one day. He was less impressed by my copy, which I was disappointed with. We only met twice. He said after first meeting he may have some work for me. The second time we met it was all about him and his life in advertising. Towards the end he started ranting about the school I went to and how they have professors teaching advertising that never worked at an ad agency before. He said he kill to have a cushiony professor job. He seemed bitter about it. At the end of the meeting he said that he has done me a favor by meeting with me and now it’s my turn to do a favor for him. He asked me to email the department head at my school and tell her how he had mentored and taught me. I felt weird doing it. Wrong. I thought maybe this was how networking worked. I agreed, we parted, and I sent the email to the department head. It only dawned on me after I left that we never talked about the possible work he had for me. A couple of days later I emailed him and thanked him for his time, saying if he had work for me I’d like to work with him. I never heard back. Around the following October I looked him up out of interest and found he taught advertising at the school I attended.

So he used me to bolster is rep with the department head so he could get a professor job. I was so deflated that I gave up looking for work.

I increased my hours available at my retail job and put in everything I had. Working doubles, overnights, anything. I did this for a few years and was offered a promotion to full time. I took it. In my new role I kept up the work ethic. I can’t say I ever really enjoyed the work. It just felt good to be doing something other than looking for work and failing, I was succeeding at something. Eventually I was offered another promotion to manage the store at night. The pay was a good increase, and I liked second shift, so I agreed.

I’ve been doing this role now for 5 years. Since then there were prospects to advance, which I went for, but I did not get. I had to send an inquiry asking why I did not get the promotion. The company I devoted myself to couldn’t do that much for me. It upset me. At the very least I thought they’d have the decency to want to see me succeed, so they’d tell me what I needed to do to get to the next step. When I got my answer I can’t say I was happy. They told me I wasn’t dressed like I wanted the role. I was wearing the damn uniform! It’s the same uniform I’d be wearing in the new role. I wore it because I had to go right to work after the interview. It was a button down shirt with black pants. I ironed both. It seemed like a shitty reason. Six months later another opening came along. I applied and never heard back. No interview. I inquired about it through my manager, and he said he’d ask about it, but even he didn’t hear anything.

So here I am. A year later. Depressed. Angry. And becoming increasingly stand offish at work. I’m starting to reexamine the amount of energy I put into this job. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I’m being asked to do more with less every night. I can’t stand the manager I work under. He keeps telling me to smile more. Or “it is what it is.” I know that he knows that I’m not happy. I told him blankly that I’ll smile when there is something to smile at. I’m avoiding job duties, simply because I have less time with the amount of work they expect of me. I come in every day to see my two managers sitting in the office laughing and talking, meanwhile milk and water are empty in the shelf, the deli department has cooked chickens that have been out since 8am and should have been pulled at noon, which was thee hours ago. Oh and some lovely customer dumped a carton of eggs all over the floor, and it’s probably been like that all day. When I identify a problem to fix things, and I bring a solution to my manager, there is no follow up, just a shrug and a “I guess we suck.”

I can’t stand it anymore. My dentist told me I’ve been grinding me teeth in my sleep. I go into work every night with a white rage of wanting to scream at every shitty part-timer on their cellphone standing around while I bust my ass, while tell off every customer asking me inane questions about food that could be solved with a simple google search or a read of the packaging, but nooooo I have to walk across the entire store tel tell you that it takes 1 day for every 5 pounds of frozen turkey to thaw, which again, google can tell you, or the freaking packaging. 

I feel like I’m stuck. I’m 29. I’m married. My wife wants kids, but we won’t be able to afford day care. Being a second shift manager works out because I have the days off and can watch the kids until she gets out of work.

I’ve talked to her about it. She suggests I go back to school, but I mentally can’t do it. I don’t know what I want to do as a career. I can’t network for shit. Any job I look into will still hinge on that. I know people do it. My mom went back to school when she was 32 with four kids and for a degree in nursing.

My only piece of sanity is before work when I walk the dogs and write or draw a little. That’s not career worthy though. I’m clearly not good enough to have my work speak for itself.

I’m not suicidal. but I haven’t shaved in 2 months. I feel like that’s the start of my emotional health affecting my appearance and I’m on the verge of a mental break down. I don’t drink, smoke, or so drugs, but I’m a stress eater.

Help."

I'm a rising junior studying CS/Math and currently applying to various internships. There is a company that I would really like to work at (not Big4) but I may be doing work that is not really coding-intensive and more data analytic and statistical.

 I've been interning at this said company during my fall semester, doing data science and ML work, and have been interviewed for a position that is regarded as more competitive and would most likely result in a job afterward, but not necessarily coding-intensive and more data analytical.
I'm wondering if it is better to work initially in the company and then move within to a sector that better fits my skillset, or apply to a completely different position/company doing something more coding related. 


I guess this is more based on my longterm goal which consists of working for this said company, hopefully doing something coding intensive (though not really set one which field), and making at least the average pay for a software engineer/data scientist.


Sorry if this is a vague question, I just wanted to hear people's views and experiences!"

a19ut1,1317,2018-11-28,Why UCF has (so far) been the best decision of my life,riverdanced,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a19ut1/why_ucf_has_so_far_been_the_best_decision_of_my/,"Hey, guys.  Some of you may remember me from last year, when I, like you, was losing my mind over essays and test scores.  I was even sent to therapy over it. Good times. 

Well, I'm at UCF now, and I feel like a different person.  I'm so incredibly happy here.  I'm 100x healthier.  I now love school, and my anxiety has decreased dramatically.  And since I feel like state schools like UCF get overlooked/looked down upon by this sub, I feel obligated to express why it was the best decision I've ever made. 

For some background, I was a Class of 2018 National Merit Scholar.  I got a 1590 SAT and a 4.0 UW / 4.8 W GPA.  Multiple low-level awards, decent ECs.  I'm a math major / CS minor. 

1) Money. I went to UCF on a full-ride National Merit scholarship.  I absolutely do not have the words to express how much better this makes the experience.  I never, ever have to worry about student loans.  Hell, I don't even have to think about paying tuition.  I live in a 4-bedroom fully furnished apartment with 3 other people at arguably the best location on campus.  My scholarship guarantees me free on campus housing for all 4 years.  And everything, from tuition to books to housing to food, is free.  I even get a ~$2500 refund each semester which goes directly into my bank account. 

3) Quality of Education.  Yeah, I know, surprising that I'm saying this about Florida's biggest party school.  But let me tell you...UCF's honors college is LEGIT.  They give us the best professors and the smallest class sizes.  School doesn't even feel like school anymore.  The classes are very challenging and work intensive, but I'm enjoying myself so much that I barely notice.  I went from someone who hated every minute of school last year to someone who jumps out of bed every morning psyched to go to class. 

3) Opportunities.  I'm in an Honors Calc class with this amazing professor.  There's only like 17 of us, so he knows all of us really well and what we're capable of.  One day, he asks me to stay behind after class.  He says he thinks I'm really talented and he wants to work on an research project with me, which will culminate in me publishing an original thesis my senior year.  (At UCF, this is called doing an ""Honors in the Major"" thesis).  I'm not telling this story to be like ""yay me"" but more to stress that I hear about this happening almost every day in the honors college.  A similar thing happened to me in my CS class, which interestingly enough is NOT an honors class but rather a 200 person lecture (which is awesome, btw, it's actually my favorite class this semester).  

Aside from this, UCF and the honors college host internship fairs, advising sessions, and the like on a weekly basis.  I currently have three different advisors assigned to me.  I don't think I'll ever feel at a loss for opportunities--I already have a research position, as well as a software engineering internship lined up for this summer. 

4) The people.  This is already super long, so I'll just quickly mention that I've gotten the chance to make friends with so many brilliant, successful students both in and out of the honors college.  If I was under any sort of delusion that the ""best students"" would be at the ivy leagues, that was gone within the first week.  I am daily astounded and challenged by the intelligence and diligence of the students that surround me.  

So...yeah.  I'm the happiest I've ever been.  I barely remember the application process from last year.  I love UCF with all my heart and soul.  I wanna encourage you guys to stay strong, and please don't overlook ""lesser"" schools.  At first, I thought that because I was this ""amazing student"" who everyone thought was going to go to Harvard, I'd be ashamed to say I was going to UCF. Fuck that.  I'm proud as hell to be a UCF Knight.  

Go Knights, Charge on! "

I am currently rounding the corner of graduating and obtaining a degree in Computer Information Systems from a University. This is a Bachelors of Science degree from the college of business at my school.

Throughout school I have done 3 different internships. 1st at a large and well known Wealth Finance group where I learned a lot as it was my first IT gig. 2nd job was at a large Fortune 500 company where I got a lot of experience in a ""big business"" environment. 3rd and current job I am working as an IT Technician for a small MSP that does a lot of hands-on work with servers/desktops/hardware. All in all I have almost 3 years of experience in the ""Help Desk"" and ""IT Support"" roles through internships and experience.

I am about 6 months into my new job, and although I still enjoy it, I am starting to realize I am more of a ""business person"" rather than a ""techie"". At my first 2 internships, I was very involved in the company and went to meetings, was constantly meeting new faces, had to look and act professional, gained lots of friendly relationships and contacts... 

I believe I have a gift of interacting with people and building relations rather than just be a ""break/fix"" guy that sits in the office. I really enjoyed my experiences at the business internships rather than my new position where I am kind of in a small office on the phone all day, with occasionally getting out in the field.

Since my degree is going to be technically a ""business"" degree... what types of roles should I be looking for the lean more on the business side of IT rather than the technical side. I believe all the internships with reputable companies in Help Desk related roles will help my resume pairing it with a BS in Computer Information Systems... it's just where to go from there. Sales? Analyst? Administration? Manager?

Anyone have a Computer Information 
Systems degree... or work more on the business side of IT? 

Appreciate all input!"

I have good grades and have a solid amount of commercial experience. The time came to placement year applications and I now have a hard decision to make.

I am a dual national (UK &amp; USA) so I have the choice of the two countries. 

I applied to a lot of UK companies and I heard back from all, however my final choice for the UK is GE Aviation and they have offered me a full paid (year long) internship / placement year in Cheltenham UK. The salary is £18k. I would be working on more specialised systems (mention of software to control a new GUI for cockpits) and I am not sure if it would be the best internship for growth as a software engineer. But something about software engineering for commercial airplanes amazes me. Also, Job security is high.

I have received an offer to move to the USA for a year and work for a smaller company, but the work I would be doing is so general and I think I would learn a lot. They need a full system, including database, API, front end, middleware etc and I would have the chance to shadow and interact in every single element of the system, furthering my experience in several areas. They work would begin when I start as an intern (June/July 2019). The salary is minimum $30k ranging upwards. I would live in a beautiful city on the East Coast (where my mother lives also) so I would be close to family. However, job security is less than GE, still good, but less.

&amp;#x200B;

So...

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to compare, I have no doubt that my overall experience in terms of quality of life would be higher in the USA and the pay is better. However, GE Aviation as a company has a much bigger impact. I am stuck and I have until Friday this week to decide. What would look better on my CV, where would I gain the most experience... what do I do? I have so much to think over and I don't even know where to begin. Do I disregard the chance to travel, earn more and live in a new city for a year for the amazing opportunity given to me by GE, or do I follow my heart, take a risk and work for a smaller company?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

Do I work at a smaller company that pays more and gives me an overall higher quality of life (and offers more general software engineering experience), however higher risk... or do I work at a huge company in a more specialised field and get their name on my CV?

a1bsw2,2,2018-11-28,When should I start applying for jobs as a 1st semester senior? What else should i be doing to be preparing?,itinterncis,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/a1bsw2/when_should_i_start_applying_for_jobs_as_a_1st/,"Should I wait till January? I heard from people that december is a bad time to apply as companies are doing end of year statements figuring out their budgets for next year. 

I'm currently a Computer information systems Major, graduating in next spring semester. I have 2 internships, first one I did helpdesk for around 6-7 months, the 2nd one i'm currently still (approximately a year or so, full timing during the summer), where i was also helpdesk but given more responsibilities and taught as I completed more work.

 I was told for my current internship that I might have possibility of hire but they can't give anything concrete until next year (because of politics and finances). 

I'm worried that if that internship falls through and can't offer me a hire (although it looks good so far for me), that i need to make a backup plan. So I was wondering when would be a ideal time for me to start applying to job openings? 

Also, in the case that my backup plan nets me a offer, and my current internship nets me a offer, should I use that as leverage for a higher salary? Or because as a entry level worker, I shouldn't bother and just take the better offer? 

To prepare, I've been updating my linked in, my resume, working on my homelab and looking at possible certs to complete (only have A+ right now). To be honest, I've been very limited in my own free time since i've been part timing 30 hours or so a week while being a full time student so I've been slacking.

The day finally came today and I do think it went well, but 2 of my classmates are also interviewing there. I have to wait 2 weeks for them to interview and for them to make a decision. I really want this internship, it's an awesome opportunity with real responsibilities and I would get a lot out of it.

But there's a place I've been emailing for 2 months just to set up an interview. I'm interviewing there later this week. I'm not sure if they will offer on the spot or not, but it is possible. I am desperate for an internship because the deadline has already passed and it would start in just over a month. I've put a lot of effort into this place, emailing, leaving voicemails, passed between different people. I think it's a good organization, but it isn't as well-known and is much smaller. 

My question is: if they offer on the spot should I just accept it, or should I ask if I can get back to them? I wouldn't hear back from the other place until December 10, which is a ways a way... I feel like if I get offered this other one on the spot, I sort of have to take it, cause there's 2 spots at the other one and 3 of us interviewing and I might be the unlucky one. But I really think the health place would be a much better opportunity and be really good for my resume. I hate how much timing has to do with everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick backstory:

Since my Sophomore  year (when I fell in love with a subfield) I have not focused on classes, doing just enough to get A s (3.99 GPA) but spending minimal effort. I didn't have ""favorite"" classes where I performed exceptionally, if they were from my sphere of interest I knew most stuff already allowing me to spent the least time on it. If I liked the professor's research I generally found a way to arrange collaboration rather than excelling in the class.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have multiple publications,projects, and collaborations to show for it. I've also been  teaching and research assistant.

It has been a wonderful journey and I wouldn't change a thing about it. My problem is that all of my recommendations are from research advisors (2 from same group, but different projects). I am wondering if this might be a red flag?

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be advisable to include a recommender with purely course based interaction even if I haven't gone ""above and beyond"" in their classes (was top 3 student in most classes)? (I have very good relations with multiple faculty so I am pretty sure I can find one in time for the applications)

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I know that my application (multiple conferences/journals, high gpa, gre, internships) is ""highly competitive"" I am just wondering what is the best approach for maximizing my chances. Field is CS, I am aiming for some of the most competitive CS PhD programs, coming from a top 50 school."

I suffer from ADHD and have had trouble focusing ever since. Whenever I try to focus, I loose attention quickly and it is a mental strain to get back on task. I have struggled with this my whole life. I know it is wrong but I have not been able to find a way to pay attention to my schoolwork. My parents have always told me to work harder but it has never worked for me. I enrolled in a four year University this year but am already struggling to complete my classes. I had a mental breakdown last month due to academic stress and failure to complete the work for my courses. I withdrew from all my courses to avoid low grades and academic probation but I am not sure what to do now. Should I just drop out and go straight into the work force? Before coming to a University, I did attend my nearby Community College and did complete my Associates Degree in three years and believe me, it was a struggle to complete it but I managed. So I really want advice, is it really worth for me to continue college or should I just go and work? I do have a little internship experience as well. I do not see any point in paying more money if I am not going to be able to succeed in college. What should I do?"

I think that’s a terrible idea and the sign of a failing company, so I’m running and not looking back. Already accepted another offer and all. I’d mostly like to know if anyone knows of companies that actually survive doing this?

First off I hate these happy assholes that live, breathe, and shit Christmas, specifically the ones that feel the need to start playing Christmas music 2 weeks before Thanksgiving and decorate the house and get their tree on Thanksgiving weekend. I'm fine with Christmas and I celebrate it myself but these fucking people want you to know it and they don't give a shit how much of their Christmas cheer goo they get on ya.

Then there's my family that I used to tolerate that I don't no more. My old man treats me like I'm a little kid (I'm 20) and no matter how much I tell him to cut the shit he always goes back to it in a few days and every holiday he wants to talk about inappropriate shit at the table and I end up getting embarrassed cause he says shit so loud that everyone starts to listen and I'd rather not have everyone listen to every single word I say (oh the irony). Then there's the same shit my family talks about every year, there's never any new conversation and they always try to bring it all back to me, asking me all sorts of questions and giving me the most attention like I'm the second coming when really I just want to be in the background having quiet conversation with family that don't do that shit.

Then there's the one woman I know I love but never realized it until now, she's halfway across the country and not in the state I live in anymore and now that she's not here and I'll never get to see her again I've been depressed. I've tried dating but I absolutely hate my options here, all the women I've tried talking to all turned out to have abhorrent lifestyles that I just didn't like and didn't want to stick around for and that's when I realized this woman I knew from high school had what I was looking for but it was too late. She's gone and I want to reconnect with her but she doesn't actively use any social media and I doubt that if I sent her a message she'd respond.

Then there's the state I lived in all my life. I've always hated it and now that I'm an adult paying taxes I hate it even more. My money goes to this stupid fucking state that goes to some overly paid desk jockey intern and the state refuses to cut their 90k a year salary to make room for other shit in the budget that we need like infrastructure cause our roads are fucking crumbling and our bridges average a D-. Those people work for the government doing menial shit, they shouldn't be paid that much and yet they are and our state is dying because of it and no one wants to do jack shit about it. Their genius idea to fix our budget is to further increase taxes and introduce new ones like an Entertainment tax and get this: toll roads. My state has fucked up traffic just getting from point A to point B and toll roads will just slow everything down even more making me and more people fucking angry on our way to and from work. Seriously fuck this shit, I'm making a plan right now to leave to a neighboring state that doesn't have this mouth breather mindset, and when I do leave I'm gonna be petty and not take any fucking toll roads, then I'm gonna flip off the state sign when I get out, and go on the highway the next state over that has toll roads. That's how fucking petty and childish I'm gonna be and I don't give 2 shits how hypocritical it sounds, I hate my fucking state so damn much.

And that brings me to the next thing I can't fucking leave all willy nilly cause my friends and family are still here. Every time I talk about leaving my mom gives me mixed signals cause she knows I'm unhappy here and that I wanna leave but then she guilt trips me saying shit like my grandparents are getting older and that we have to take care of them. Yeah I know that but I'm gonna be 2 hours away, it's not like I'm gonna be a 6 hour plane ride away I'm still in driving distance. The only thing that eats at me though is that I'd leave my friends behind and I know damn well with my anxious ass that I won't make friends as easily in this new state or open up with them as much as I do with my friends here and I don't want to be even more lonely than already am.

Then there's my friends. I love them to death but we've grown apart since we graduated as they've all gotten jobs or went off to college. They never have time to hang out anymore and when we do hang out it's only for 2 hours until they have to get ready for work or school the next day. I just miss them and I wish we could spend more time together.

I'm not going to college either, I was going a year ago but left because it was a dead end for me and I didn't want to spend thousands of dollars just to be out of work. These motherfuckers wanted me to take 5 different calculus classes for computer science which was gonna be my money maker later on, but that fell through cause I'm a dumbass with numbers and so I tried switching majors to history but my shitty community college didn't offer a history major and they wanted me to take 6 years to work toward it, 2 in community, 4 in a big uni, which I wasn't about to do cause I fucking hate school and I probably would just drop out anyways. Thankfully I dropped out after one semester so I only wasted $2k instead of however much I would've had to pay by now if I was still going.

My life is hanging by a thread, I'm done with trying to please everyone, I'm done with everything. I just want to catch a break for once and actually experience what it's like to be happy again, haven't felt that way in years. I hope it will all work out but I doubt it.

Later."
a1f3x4,0,2018-11-29,Should I take this co-op?,sudsinme,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/a1f3x4/should_i_take_this_coop/,"So a little background on my position and where I'm at. I applied to the resume book with my school for a spring co-op, kinda mostly to get my resume out there. I was not really anticipating getting any offers from it but a pretty reputable company reached out to me and asked if I could interview. Well, the interview went great and they offered me a job and while I'm excited about it I'm not sure if I should take it.

First of all the job would be in the south and I go to school in the north. I'm already paying for an apartment and while the company pays pretty well, they do not offer housing stipends so I'd be paying for 2 places. In addition to that, my mom is alone and I would feel horrible knowing that she's here mostly by herself.

I'm also waiting to hear back from some companies regarding internships, but since it is a spring co-op they want to know relatively soon. If I got an internship I could go to school in the spring and stay at home in the summer. However, there is no guarantee that I will get an offer for an internship. 

I'm not too worried about postponing my graduation and I would only miss 1 semester. I understand this is a huge opportunity but I also might get just as good of an opportunity at home. 

I'm just wondering what all of your thoughts on this were. Everybody seems like they love their co-ops and I'm sure I would too, I just dont know from a financial and personal POV what I should do."

I want to stay as close as possible with my degree towards machine learning (already did an internship where I worked with MS Azure and enjoyed it). Considering stat minor, worth it? Second question, what job prospects for comp math (want to do either software development or ML stuff. and ik ultimately it rests to skills, but what courses would help me the most. Thirdly, anyone with such motive in CM major, please share your course routine, like which courses you took which term.}  


So, I came to uwaterloo despite getting deferred from cs coop to math regular. Thought, like every other high school kid that would be able to pull off a good % to get both. Anyways, it was hard for me as I screwed up my first sem (but doing quite better now). However, I always had this thing for CS courses and I really enjoy it. However, soon, the courses will become quite different after cs246 and cs245, as I will not be allowed to pick those courses. Also, CM majors cannot even choose courses to their will because most of the required CS courses for CM requirement is restricted to CS major students only. Afaik, from the CM advisor Pei, I should take stat courses if I want to stay close to machine learning stuff. However, I am thinking since CS minor can never come as an option for me, should I just go for stat minor and then may be do masters in CS.   


Secondly, whenever I think of this CM major, obviously lots of questions come to me asking, what are the job prospects. Well, i know that ultimately it is the skill which will get you hired, however, choosing the correct courses, i guess, may help with the path I want to pick. I have heard data science as an option, but I guess by the time I would try to pull of my grade, the data science option will go off, as I am a 2A student, and pulling my CGPA up would be a tough deal which would require another 2-3 semesters of hard work. Can anyone help me with the courses I should choose to stay close to my target.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, I am seeing that CS230 is offered winter and spring, and not on fall. Also, in the fall term cs 245,cs246 is taken most by the cs students. And as a non cs student, i will be allowed to pick the courses after a week the class will have started. Eventually, there may  come a situation where I may not have any cs course to study that term. 

The courses I will have completed by this December are : Math137/138, Math135,136, CS135/116, Phy121, Chem 120, Sci206, Geog 207, Fine130, Stat230, Emls101/102  = These 14 courses. Anyone in CM, care to share a plan for me, since I was not really helped by the advisor with the stuff.

First time posting here but have been following this community for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for any investment advice or corrections to my current investment strategy. Some information that may be relevant:

&amp;#x200B;

\- My goal is to retire early (40 or earlier)

\- Currently have no kids, but would like to have 2 eventually

\- Income is \~90k a year with 10-20k bonus (works out to be $2700 semi-monthly, plus bonus)

\- No debt, scholarships covered my schooling expenses

\- Rent is $750/month, no utilities as my roommate covers all that

\- Discretionary expenses are \~$500-700/month

\- Remaining funds are invested into my portfolio (see below)

\- Fiance makes approximately the same that I do, similar expenses (we are very alike). He also has no debt and has net asset of approximately $50k

&amp;#x200B;

My investment portfolio consists of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\- $250k in is XAW, VCN, and ZAG, allocations are roughly 60/20/20 respectively. Max'ed TFSA contribution and remaining in a taxable account

\- $50k is in an RRSP, allocations are long term etfs

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:** **Am I have too invested in index tracked etf's. Should I be more diversified?**

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering buying a condo in the neighbourhood of $350k and condo fees of 400/month. However I have not done so because I am likely to move due to my job and likely won't have a place to settle in for the next 3-5 years.

Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Although I am not required to, I will explain the path I took to get to my current net worth for those interested

&amp;#x200B;

\- Started working at the age of 13, at a fast food restaurant. This was a pretty typical working age for fast food/retail jobs as it was before the financial crisis and it was very easy to find jobs. Almost all of my co-workers were in the 13-16 age range. My shifts were Saturday and Sunday 2pm-10pm. I always saved half of my money if not more. During the summer break, I would work 40 hours a week. I was not forced to do this, in fact I really enjoyed going to work because I had good friends (same age group). Had $10k by the time I was 18 doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Started tutoring at the age of 16-23. I was very good at Math and Sciences and thought this would be better than fast food as it's higher pay and I won't need to commit as many hours. Originally was charging $20/h, went up to $40/h as I gained more experience and got references. Most of this was side money as I would average 5 hours a week, but this can go up to 10 hours in busier times (when report cards went out).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Got a large scholarship and several smaller scholarships. Totaled roughly $40k. Went to a local university and lived at my parents house until I graduated. Tuition was $6k a year. Still tutored off and on during my entire time at university. Had $50k before I started my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Got a very good internship. Made $60k a year roughly. Still lived at my parents house. Still tutored during internship about 5 hours a week. Had $100k after my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The company I interned at extended my contract to part time for my last year of university. So I would go into work before/after school. Not many hours though I kept it at around 10 hours a week so that I can still survive school (lol). Had probably still $100k after graduating, went on grad trip, etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The company hired me back full time when I graduated. I was very lucky and am still grateful to this day because this was not typical in my graduating year. Was (and still am) saving &gt;80%.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This year at work, I took on an out of town assignment which gave me nearly $40k in bonuses, in addition to my regular bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

It's 50% luck and 50% hard work. And for those still wondering, I travel 2-3x a year (it's one of my passions, budget travel usually) and go out with friends."

a1l6av,1,2018-11-29,I'm 20 and I think I'm wasting my life in college,Valronbalron,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a1l6av/im_20_and_i_think_im_wasting_my_life_in_college/,"I recently transferred to a huge public university. I also switched my major from CS to a double major in Communications and Chinese. I switched because I hated CS and I sucked at it but Communications is so easy so far and I'll be graduating a semester late. I stuck with Chinese because I love the language but now I'm worried that I'll never have a chance to use it.  


Neither of my parents went to College and neither of them are helping me pay for it at all. As a result, I don't have any time to internship because I have to work full time during my summer breaks and my winter vacation. I work my ass off at these shitty jobs and then all of it goes to tuition. I can't even afford a car and despite receiving a huge amount of financial aid, I still need to come up with 2k a semester and I'll be 40-45k in debt, depending on if I need an extra semester.  


In my freetime, I play guitar and read books. I've joined outdoorsy clubs but all the trips are always full. I've tried to get involved but I just feel so out of place and now that it's winter I'm starting to get depressed with it getting dark at 5 pm every day. I'm learning Chinese but I don't think I'm ever going to be fluent. I'm just not really great at anything or special in any way. I don't know if I belong here.  


I started dating this guy who's from a pretty wealthy neighborhood and his parents are all over him and getting him snacks all the time and getting him internships. Sometimes I just feel like I'm never going to be as successful as someone who's meant to succeed like that. What's the point of me working my ass off if I'm going to have half the resume, someone, like he has?   


Hell, I think part of the reason I'm not as smart as some of these other kids is because of an untreated concussion I got in a fight with my dad's ex-girlfriend when I was 13.   


Idk, sometimes I feel like I have no chance at success and I look around me at this safe place where I can just learn and have my own room and unlimited food even if I have to work my ass off for it, and I worry that I'll be totally fucked after graduation. But if I dropped out, I wouldn't even have anywhere to go. My godmother who took me in wouldn't let me stay with her and I'd have to work at some grocery store or something again.   


and that's my rant! "
a1ldff,2,2018-11-29,2nd Debtor Examination (What should I ask for),throwupandaway910,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a1ldff/2nd_debtor_examination_what_should_i_ask_for/,"(California)

So quick back story. Won a case over a fake production company for work I had done. Sued the owner and won. He's been super difficult. Skipped first debtor examination until they threatened to issue warrant and when he showed up claimed he had no money and such. Got his paystubs at least and am currently in the process of garnishing his wages. We are coming up on 120 days and I am going to do a second debtor examination and I have much more stuff id love to subpoena but I also want to know exactly what I can ask for.

&amp;#x200B;

1. He claimed he had no car at the debtor examination but I actually followed him when we left the courthouse and snapped pictures of him getting into a car and driving away. Got the license and everything. Can I subpoena the registration for this car?
2. He has a cell phone and the judge made a comment about how I could garnish his phone payments so that any payment he sent would be sent to me. He scoffed and said ""good luck finding out whose name its in"" (the guys a scumbag) So could I subpoena him to bring in his phone records if I know this is a phone he uses? I was kind of unprepared for my first debtor examination and only after I left did I realize I shouldve just made him tell me whose name the phone was in right then and there.
3. His ""company"" is still out there shooting things so I've seen quite a few social media posts of things hes shooting with high dollar video equipment as well as some posts that have cars in them (license plates visable). Since this stuff has to do with the company he is the ""owner"" and ""CEO"" of could I subpoena anything with that?
4. I discovered that his son goes to a private school in the area. If he is claiming he has no money but his son goes to private school could I subpoena his sons tuition payments? See how he is paying for this.
5. Saw that he didnt put down all his bank accounts on the debtor examination form. There is actually a bank account on his pay stubs he uses for direct deposit which is different than any of the ones he gave me. Its just the last 4 numbers and I have no idea what bank it is but I also want to subpoena that.
6. 2017 tax returns. Just to see how much hes paying and how much he claims. Thats just for overall understanding of his finances. Can I subpoena that?
7. 2017 Business filings. Kind of same situation. Just to see if he has any business dealings he is hiding.  Is that too broad? Also would love to subpoena this because he has ""interns"" he has hired so I dont know the laws but pretty sure you cant have interns working for you if you arent a business. (correct me if im wrong on that though)"

First option is an internship at a very small startup doing mostly backend web dev. So far this is my only internship offer (although I'm hunting for more and ideally I would have a choice between multiple companies). 

However, I'm really interested in working on ML. I know that ML is currently super competitive (and honestly kind of overhyped) but I've been learning it anyways from Ng's online course and am planning to take more courses after I finish this one. I'm planning to apply for undergrad research in ML. 

If I'm lucky enough to land a research position working on ML, what should I do? Options:

-Research during school year, internship in summer
-Research all year, no internship

Of course in the likely event that I don't land an ML research role I would simply do the internship.

I'd appreciate any advice on which one would suit me better and also any advice on trying to land ML research. Thanks!"
a1m2mc,1,2018-11-29,"Two, three or four week notice?",hehehehee05,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a1m2mc/two_three_or_four_week_notice/,"Hello all, 

I will be including a TL;DR at the end of my loooooong essay (just trying to explain my situation as clear as possible).

So basically I got an offer that I liked A LOT which actually involves relocation (to which I don't mind). My scheduled start date is Jan 7 and due to relocation (Lots of luggages) and ticket price, I will be taking the train and leaving my current city on Jan 1st. 

I am very grateful for the current job I have. People there are very nice and I've been with them since my internship. However, I am scheduled to work on Jan 1st. On top of that, I have accepted a replacement post of 1 month and a half in the beginning of January (the worker in question that I am replacing is going on paternal leave). The department I am working at is also VERY small (four workers) so I know I'll be putting them is trouble (understaffed) once I leave. Regardless, I have accepted the other offer I've been eyeing on for a while so I will be leaving.

Now here's the problem: Because I don't want to put them in too much trouble, I've considered giving them a three week notice or even one month notice. However, last time when a collegue left, they bullied her for the last two weeks (she handed in a two week). Everyone basically ignored her, even our superior when she went to see him for more discussion. This is why I am hesitating between a two, three weeks or one month notice, but they do need to find another person to do Jan 1st and the 1 month and a half I have accepted in the beginning of January. 

Just a little more background to not make me seem like an ass: I have accepted the 1 month and a half replacement in October and everything involving the new job I got was in November (sending CV, interview..., not to mention I was looking into it for a few months and they finally posted a job offer online and I jumped to the chance). In addition my current title is 'part time' with a full time hours because I gave my availabilities. In order to get hours and stable seniority at the place I work, I accepted the parternal replacement post.

TL;DR: got another offer elsewhere, hesitating between giving a two or three or four week notice because of work place bullying but also putting work place understaffed. Saw another worker got bullied for two weeks when she resigned.

Critics and suggestions are greatly appreciated!"

My adviser made me drop down from a PhD to a masters  back in mid-October and life has been pretty shitty since and I swear my adviser is out to get me. Here’s basically a list of things he has done, is doing that I need to rant about. 


-He threw me under the bus during my presentation for him and the rest of my PhD committee back in October that is the reason I was then forced to step down to the lower degree 


-He tried to force me out of taking the capstone class and the guaranteed internship I get with the program  (two of the biggest reasons I chose here over somewhere else). I had to go to my program’s director to pretty much to get him to change my adviser’s mind and luckily he was actually on my side. 


-I found out he is also trying to keep another one of his students (a friend of mine) in the same program from taking the capstone class with really no reason for it.

-During our weekly meetings he’ll belittle me and basically accuse me of never working if I don’t get something right or get stuck either my research. 


-Has demanded perfect grades (something pretty much no other adviser does) and has lectured me for getting a high B in a class. 


-Just today and the reason why I need a serious vent, I got stuck on some coding earlier this week and asked another one of his older students for help. Unfortunately, said student was really busy this week and I couldn’t get the problem fixed in time for my meeting with my adviser tomorrow. When I emailed my adviser about this and suggested waiting skipping this week and waiting until next week, he accused me of waiting until the last minute to talk to his other student for help. I emailed back that, no, I talked to the student Tuesday morning and he didn’t get back to me on the issue until today because he was busy. My adviser still hasn’t responded and I am just so stressed and aggravated by this. I work hard dammit and I’m tired of being told I don’t work hard enough. 

My depression and anxiety have just been so bad since I was forced to drop down. And I know “boo boo poor me complaining about grad school”, but dammit it is so normalized for graduate students to constantly feel miserable that no one even cares if someone is depressed and dealing with anxiety. You’re just told “welcome to grad school” and are expected to just deal with the crippling depression and anxiety. 

I’m tired of it and I guess this master’s is turning out to be almost a blessing in disguise considering I’ll hopefully be out of this pain soon. 

Update: Of course right after I post he finally emails me back. Ha! He agreed to cancel our meeting, but doesn’t know why I waited so long to talk to his other student when I know we meet on Fridays! Y’all I emailed his student TUESDAY. Last week at our meeting I said I would email his student on MONDAY and that was fine. I was a day late emailing and all of a sudden I waited SO long and should feel bad for being so irresponsible. I’m done. "

But I just need somewhere to vent. I had my first technical interview today for a summer internship. It was a job I really wanted and I worked really hard for it. The interview was suppose to be an hour long but was cut short at 30 minutes. Basically they were suppose to give me two coding problems. One easy and one tough one. The easy one had a part where you had to convert a decimal number to binary number. I just didn’t know how the conversion went. I didn’t ask the interviewer for a solution. I just wanted to know how one converts between the two systems. For some reason, he seemed really disgusted at the fact that I didn’t know the two systems. After trying to explain it to me for a bit ( I didn’t pick it up cause it was a really hasty explanation) he said something along the lines of, “let’s move on from the coding stuff”. At that point I knew I had blown it. The rest of the interview was just him dragging on the conversation till he could officially hang up the Skype call. What happened today really hurt and was super demoralizing. I know as a cs student I should be able to convert between the two systems very easily. But I’ve just never come across the conversion before. And I studied so damn hard for this interview. I put assignments and stuff on the backseat and now I’m behind on all my work.

I've narrowed it down to 2 internship positions A and B.

**Company A**

* widely known technology company (non BigN)
* 12 week internship
* ~$28/hr, 40 hr/week
* housing with fellow interns which is paid for
* Location: RTP

**Company B**

* investment company
* 10 week internship
* $35/hr, 37.5 hr/week
* I get no housing since its in my hometown
* Location: Financial city in NC

I'm kinda conflicted because A is a tech company and I'd be networking with fellow interns, but I would be the only intern on the team I would be working with. B's offer is monetarily better but my last internship was in my hometown and I don't know if I should branch out from that and not live at home while interning. I also want to consider the more prestigious company name in terms of the tech industry. With A I would have a networking focus while with B it would be a web dev focus.

https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/a1cho6/chance_me_for_stanford_berkeley_mit_cornell/

Thanks to everyone that commented, I appreciate your kind words and comments.

First some comments about my results and high school experience. Like many of you, I was somewhat obsessed with college acceptance during high school. I willingly dedicated 4 years to focus entirely on school (no social life of course), sleeping 2-4 hours per night, trying to max out in every way possible. My goal was MIT from a very early age (9). A few weeks after having received my results, I felt like a failure and became suicidally depressed. For several months I wallowed in self-loathing, but eventually made my way out to feeling somewhat normal again over the course of the next year.

Now, I am doing pretty well at Cornell and enjoying my projects and my life. Time heals all wounds, and remember that high school is only a short 4 year phase of your life. Although it is tempting to focus your life entirely on getting into the best university possible during high school, try to focus on your purpose beyond high school and find meaning in life beyond just college acceptance.

-----------

Let me also briefly discuss some of your comments and potential reasons for why I was rejected. As people have pointed out, I think the two biggest factors were probably my essays and lack of major awards.

In retrospect, I think my college essays were not that great for purposes of admission. I tended to make most of them focused on computer science or math. I wrote about things like being hooked on computer science every since I started programming at the age of nine a few months after my parents got me my first laptop; and my passion for seeking truth and knowledge in the pursuit of studying pure math. Such topics may have come off as potentially arrogant and apparently essays focused on academic topics tend to do rather poorly (in contrast to more personality-based or life experience-based essays, at least from my experience). However, I feel they were authentic to myself at the time, and even looking back now, I don't think I would have done them differently.

Regarding major awards, yes I do agree that this was definitely a big flaw and the biggest difference between me and many of my friends that are now at MIT, Stanford, and Harvard. The bet I made during high school was that if I took the hardest dual-enrollment courses possible and focused a lot on my software internship, my results in these categories would make me stand out enough to get accepted at very elite schools.

This bet was very wrong, and let me explain why. Both hard courses and the software internship are subjective to the region you are in. By this I mean that when an admissions officer is looking at your application, he can't tell if the hard courses you are taking at a local college are impressive or not because the college might not be that good. The internship might not be that impressive if it was just a small local company looking in desperate need of labor, for example. The admissions officer has no way of knowing how legit you actually are (nationally) based on this information, and this was my greatest miscalculation.

Instead, to determine how legit you are on a national level, admissions officers look for reliable, nationally recognized stamps of approval. In other words, they look for major awards. Often times these can be boiled down to a list of buzz words: RSI, Regeneron STS, ISEF international, USAMO, IMO, IOI, etc. Admissions officers know immediately that you're legit (on a national level) if you have these awards, whereas with regional awards, or even national awards that are not as well-recognized as the awards I listed above, they will remain in doubt.

If I were to give advice to my past self who was just entering high school, it would be to focus a ton on attaining major national awards and not focus much on taking the hardest possible dual-enrollment classes or spending a lot of time on an internship.

-----------

Some caveats about the above advice and about my experience in general. The above advice is for people looking to get admitted primarily for being academically talented.

Categories of people that do not need to focus much on academics to be admitted include scouted, nationally recognized athletes, people whose parents are well acquainted with an admissions officer of the school they are applying to, or people whose parents are principal donors to the school in question (&gt;= $1 million donation made).

Also race is a very big factor. I am writing the above from a white male perspective applying for computer science, which is one of the worst racial categories to be in, second only to asian male. I have talked to a lot of people about their admissions results, especially during high school. Basically all of my friends were asian males, and a many of them with similar or better stats performed similarly to me as far as acceptance goes. Some of them did even worse (i.e. Cornell reject, Duke reject). The only people from white male or asian male categories I knew that got into Stanford/Harvard/MIT had major awards. Females tend to do a lot better for the computer science category, and minorities also do very well (as expected, due to diversity initiatives).

-----------

Okay, that post was pretty long. Regardless, I hope you all do well and get into schools where you can achieve and unlock the next stage of your careers. Try not to stress too much about school if things don't go how you wanted them to go. Even if you don't get into the school you want, you will still eventually get the career opportunities you deserve - many of my asian male friends that didn't do too great during college admissions are now interning at Facebook/Google and other top tech companies. See you on the flip side :). "

I have seen a lot of people solve complex programming problems in their head and in the editor in no time whereas a lot of us are struggling to get the gist of it.

a1tgn5,2,2018-11-30,"I love my mom, but she continues to boundary stomp her way into my adulthood by way of weekend trips and vaping.",Throwaway0923840385,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a1tgn5/i_love_my_mom_but_she_continues_to_boundary_stomp/,"Just want to start off by saying I (26f) do sincerely love my mom (57f) and my grandma (88f) (her mother), but I need some serious advice on how to handle my mom when she's around. Throwaway account because a lot of people that I know personally follow me and I honestly just don't want the possibility of them knowing all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, I am my mom's only child. She divorced my abusive and alcoholic father when I was very young - he and I do not have a relationship. I was raised by her and her parents. She did her best raising me, and she had her good moments, but it definitely wasn't a perfect scenario. I'm only pointing out these things to give an idea of how she reacts to certain situations.

&amp;#x200B;

She was always depressed and sometimes that made her neglectful, yet she made every attempt to buy my love. Some extracurriculars and hobbies that I chose to partake in growing up were my choices, but she also forced me into taking part in social groups I openly expressed a distaste for the entirety of my childhood. Every now and then she's understanding of something, other times she is unrealistic. If I was upset when I was young she would often try to make it about her. She married another man with similar issues to my father who would also scream at me if I was upset and just make things worse and I have no memory of her stepping in she would just allow it to happen. She coerced me into thinking I couldn't go to school too far from her and guilted me into coming home every other weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used my degree program which required an internship in order to insert myself in a big city because I knew I would not be able to reasonably afford it or get away from our small town without a solid reason. At first, she even tried to convince me to move back home anyway. After my internship was over, I fought really hard to stay where I am. During that time, I came down with a serious gastric condition and almost died, and spent some time admitted to a hospital. She drove up with my grandmother and stayed in my apartment the entire time and took care of my cat, who I adopted in college. He has kept me safe and sane and fighting this whole time. He means the world to me. If everyone is awarded one special animal in their lives he is definitely mine. I promise this is going to be relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I live a few hours from them, so not too far that the drive is unreasonable. My mom still has her issues, but I have done what I can to ensure we have a good relationship. I call her a few times a week and we always have a nice conversation, and I try to do what I can to help her through her depression. She's supportive of me, my friends, and life choices despite the fact that she used to be much more narrowly minded. These days she is a better communicator than when I was a kid, but it has been a difficult process over the years to get her to learn how to listen to me, and over some things, she just isn't willing. That brings me to the whole point of this post - the weekend trips and the vaping.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is comfortable, I have a great set of friends and a wonderful healthy relationship that I have cultivated in what I consider to be my true home. I do not go back to my childhood home much anymore because I love my life and where I am, and that's pretty much the opposite of how I felt growing up. I'm going to be in my late 20s soon and enjoy my independence. When I do go home, it is to check in with my grandparents as they are getting very old. They're in their late 80s and early 90s. My mom is also still extremely depressed. She does not take good care of herself or the house I was raised in which she still occupies with my stepdad who has his own medical conditions. To be honest, I don't think she wants to be there but I don't think she wants to be alone either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I don't go home much and don't live far, my mom and grandma have started taking weekend trips to see me, maybe once per quarter. If I lived in a larger place or if they could afford to stay in a hotel, I think I wouldn't mind as much, but I live in a one-bedroom apartment. They always cart a carload of shit with them even though they will only be here for two days and before I know it I feel like I'm suffocating in my happy little pocket. I have one couch and a queen size bed, so I either have to share the queen bed with one of them or hurt my back on my couch. This also means that I can't enjoy my usual nighttime TV activities as late as I normally would unless I sleep on the couch which my mom insists on doing anyway because she never sleeps in a bed even though she owns one. It's the strangest thing, I don't know why she does that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is bad enough, but the thing that really gets under my skin is that my mother has picked up the vaping habit. She used to smoke, but now she does this and she insists on doing it inside my apartment and in my car when I drive them places. And I abhor it. I smoked almost a pack a day from 19-24 and I ""quit"" about a hundred times during that length of time. When I left my last relationship, which was extremely abusive, after almost dying, I finally kicked the cigarette addiction the curb too. It was extremely hard work but I haven't had one since. She knows this and yet she does this anyway. I hate the smell and the heaviness that it adds to the air, and the glycerin in the juice is really bad for cats, and I have told her this countless times. Her reasoning is that her cat seems fine and so mine must be fine too, but they live in a large house and I live in a 700-sqft apartment. If I try talking to her about it she gets extremely defensive and pulls the ""I am your mother"" card on me ""I'm not bothering you,"" and I just give up out of instinct. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last time they were here, I stupidly attempted to compromise on their last day here and said she could do it if she left the sliding door in the living room slightly ajar and the screen door closed so my cat couldn't get out. She had been vaping in my apartment the whole time anyway so I wasn't getting anywhere with this anyway. She was ANNOYED?! but agreed to do it. After this discussion, I took a shower and left my mother and grandmother to their iPads in the living room right in front of the door. When I got out I started looking for my cat because he usually follows me everywhere and I hadn't seen him. I saw the door and was floored with panic, he had used his paw to open the screen and to go on an adventure. He's never been an outdoor cat and he is very small. I asked what happened and I was visibly upset, but my mom acted like this was about her. Of course, I became even more upset. This isn't about her, this is about the safety of my cat who means the world to me. Luckily he came running back to me after I stepped outside and started screaming his name in panic. They left pretty shortly after that.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma is very sensitive, but she's usually a perfectly respectful house guest. She even insists on helping me do the dishes and always has a smile on her face about it. She's too old to make the trip on her own, so I tolerate this sort of behavior from my mom so I can see her. If I go home, I stay with my mom to avoid hurt feelings but that's not pleasant either. She's glued to the couch all day watching the same movies she's seen a thousand times and I have to sleep in my old bedroom that's become a hoarding den. The only time I truly enjoy my mom is when I speak with her on the phone, and I hate that that's the case. I know this was a really long, rambling post but I'm just not sure how to handle any of this anymore. My therapist is very good at big picture stuff, but I haven't seen her in a while because I've been working more hours and trying to get a passion project off the ground which is going to get even busier next week. They are coming today to go Christmas shopping this weekend, and I wish I was excited for this but I'm filled with dread and concern about the sanctity of my boundaries. I'm crying at the end of writing this post this morning because I want to kindly set up some kind of expectation before they arrive but I don't even know how to do that anymore because of how defensive she gets. I feel totally helpless. Best case scenario for me would be if she goes outside to vape but I know she's just going to throw a fit. What should I do? About this? About any of it? "

So, I am redoing it using his working setup as a reference.

I created a new Deployment Share in MDT and did all of the stuff to add the OS image, task sequence, etc, and updated the deployment share with a complete regeneration.  All looked good.

Then in WDS I removed the Install Image and Boot Image that he created and pointed them at the ones in the new deployment share.  Again, everything looked good.

Then I removed his old deployment share (just unshared in Windows, it still exists in MDT so I can refer back to it.)

But, when I boot a PC with PXE boot, it pulls what looks like the right file out of WDS and the MDT splash screen shows up.  Then I get an error that a connection to the deployment share could not be made.

And the share that it is trying to connect to is the old one.  So the error makes sense, but it shouldn't even be trying to connect to that share.

So, it looks like I am missing a step in the process and that WDS is still serving up the old boot image.

I've checked a couple of guides and there doesn't seem to be any step that I have missed, except obviously there is.

Can anyone suggest what step I may be missing, or offer a known-good guide that shows how to do this click-by-click so I can trace down where I am going wrong?

EDIT: Ok, I purged everything out of WDS again and re-imported the images, and it looks like it's working!  I'm getting other errors, but at least they are new and interesting ones that I can start working out.  But, proving that I have the ability to break this means that I have the ability to control it, which is what I was lacking before.   Thanks!"

I have a bachelor's degree in International Relations and am currently undergoing a PG in CyberSecurity. I have undergone ""The Complete Cyber Security Course"", by StationX and am working on their “The Complete Python for Hacking and Cyber Security” as well. I am also studying for my A+ certificate, and will study for S+ and CySA later on.

&amp;#x200B;

My post is in regards to an internship at NOKIA. Today, I've gone through the first interview via mobile with Human Resources, and I passed through to the next fase: I'm going to be interviewed by the Chief of the Cyber Security Architecture department this Monday or Friday!

I'm very happy with this, but I must admit that I am quite afraid about what will be asked and what they expect of me. They've read my CV, they know my background and lack of experience and expertise, but I still want to give it my best and show that I can be a good asset to the company.

I'll be taking the role of  Security Data Analyst, which entails that I :

* set-up the right interfaces to collect all relevant security data sources
* ingest the relevant security data sources into the appropriate platform (Azure)
* define the right parameters and algorithms to understand and interpret the data and filter out any false positives
* create the right metrics and reports/dashboards (using PowerBI)
* define the relevant processes and tools allowing to trigger the necessary actions for security operation and CERT teams

As I've stated, I do not have qualifications in Computer Sciences, Information Technology or Software Development and Planning, and so I fear I am going to flunk the master interview.

My plan is to spend the weekend studying and preparing for the interview, and I was hoping some of you could advise me on what to focus on, what to say and ask, special key notes that will make my interview shine above the others.

Any help will be much appreciated guys, I am a bundle of nerves right now, but I am soooooo excited for this!!!

Thank you!"

I am so unhappy here. The pay is so bad and the work is honestly overwhelming. This place is so miserable.

I’m leaving in a couple weeks to go back to school but these next two weeks are going to be so busy and I am so done with it. 

I’ve been applying absolutely anywhere for my next rotation and I’m just feeling lost. I feel like every single place I work at is going to be like it is here. My boss quit for a better job and so I’ve been working on a BIG project completely unsupervised and I just have no idea what I’m doing. 

I’ve learned so much here but this is just awful for my mental health and I’m dreading going back to work anywhere because I’m scared I’m always going to be sexually harassed.

I graduated my local junior college with an AA in Computer Science and an AA in Language and Rationale and now I'm at a state college getting my BS in Computer Science. However, I feel as though college is getting in the way of me learning programming. The only reason why I am even getting my BS is because it will determine my pay grade someday when I get my career position. But that about it. Everything I've learned so far in college hasn't helped me in a real world sense. Maybe the only thing I can point myself to that it has actually benefitted me is it has taught me to be more resourceful and how to find the answer on my own. So I'll give it that, but in every other way, it hasn't done jack crack for me. All of the programming I currently know has come from 100's of hours of my own self-teaching and courses that are specifically geared towards programming for places like Udemy and Youtube. I got an internship at a local company as a Software developer because of my hard work I have done on my own time, not from college.

&amp;#x200B;

So with all that said, I feel like college is getting in the way of me really learning my craft. I'm about 2 years away from graduating and all I can say is, gosh darnit, I wish I was done already. I can't do full-time work as a software developer making the big check because school is getting in the way. So I hope that someday, getting my BS will benefit me somehow more than the guy sitting next to me that didn't get his BS. Maybe? Maybe not? I won't know until I get there."

It is obvious from each class that my professors do not care enough to be there, it seems like they prepare slides 5 minutes before class and often from other well known sources.  A lot of courses are taught by adjuncts, even some upper division.  TA's are often unwilling or unable to help you understand the material or prepare for projects.  Professors do not care to involve undergrads in research, even ones with A's in their course.  That is unfortunate because many of us are interested in grad school down the line.



Meanwhile, all of my favorite courses have been under the math and EE departments.  Professors enthusiastically lecture on their topics, and TA's are incredibly helpful during office hours.

However, I'm not sure when to start actively look or stay in this position for a while. 

I am going to graduate from school with a associate in Network Infrastructure Technology this June. On the side, I am required to  get a internship. I found a position a few weeks ago that is primarily hardware with very little software centered job and I applied and got it! I haven't had much luck with getting a help desk position over the few months. Didn't help with the fact I was casually applying over time though.  

So my job is basically just relocating offices. I disassemble equipment and anything that is on the technology side and assemble them at the new location. I document what kind of equipment, what is being moved etc. It pays really good, and there is a lot of overtime. I make approx $16-18 by doing these things. Customer service in this job is primarily setting up the equipment to the layout they want. 

However, I'm worried about forgetting how to work with networking, Window 10 and 2012R2. I already am forgetting them.  So, I'm wondering when is it acceptable to change jobs? I'm hoping for Desktop Support Technician or Desktop Analyst since they seem to need some hardware experience as well. Keep in mind, I just literally started. I don't want to stay in this position for months and months through. In 2-3 weeks I'll be done with school and only have to take one class in spring. So full time is absolutely fine. I'm asking because I really am passionate to learn but I don't want to be stuck! 

If it helps, I live in Washington in Seattle. My girlfriend is going to attend school for 4 years, so I do need to find a position that pays good and a good work environment that I can be happy and learn! Since well, Seattle and the areas are expensive to live! There's a lot of IT jobs here but again, that means a lot of people are applying! So if I stay for a bit, will I have a better head start despite the fact what I am doing is hardware centered? I'm wondering because I'm not sure how IT recruiters feel about entry level IT hardware jobs. 

Since my degree is focused on sysadmin, networking, virtualization and Linux.  ( Linux isn't my thing though) I had a LOT of hands on labs on these. I realize that I won't be able to jump in a middle entry jobs and I have to start from the bottom. I'm just not sure when is it acceptable to move up the ladder. I don't want to seem/look like a job hopper. 

Sorry if I'm jumping around. If I'm not clear on something please ask! Also, burning some bridges are OK as long it won't screw me over in the long term.
