They told me they would get back to me prior to the weekend and now it's Saturday evening and I haven't heard from them.

I'm getting a little anxious now but I don't want to sound too desperate. Should I send them an e-mail? The position is supposed to start on June 3rd and it's getting pretty close."
26zxwu,4,2014-05-31,PowerPoint Tips for Consulting Interns Looking to Succeed On the Job,TaiCroon,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/26zxwu/powerpoint_tips_for_consulting_interns_looking_to/,"First off, remember that your KEY function as a new hire or intern, is to make your boss look good! Why? Because the better your boss looks, the more experience they are going to pass along to you, and the more likely they are to staff you on better projects (which looks good on your resume).

If you're working in consulting, you are going to be creating large PPT decks to pitch business and create client deliverables (these are not Steve Jobs decks).

Here are three tips that will help you stand out from day one (I've included YouTube links to videos which include specific examples if you're interested):

#1: Never settle for the default formatting: that is what most people do...and exactly what consultants do not...always aspire beyond the default formatting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxQUNmmYhg

#2: Break up your bullet points and make them visually engaging: content heavy decks require large amounts of information synthesized into bullet driven information…that's just life. If you want your project to fly, don't settle for boring lists of bullets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qrhLaFv6_Y

#3: Highlight your point Visually: nothing is worse than a content heavy slide without a clear point. Make sure you make your specific point in the title AND highlight that point visually within your layout. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHf1AYqrk1Q

There is obviously a lot of other things to learn, but these three guidlines will get you started on the right foot.

Good luck!"

On Thursday, I'm using my computer as normal. No problems. My monitor is connected through HDMI from the graphics card, and that was the way I would play audio.

On Friday, I traveled by car for a few hours with the computer. I have an internship at a college that I'm working at over the summer and they housing me in a dorm.

When I set up my computer, I notice something odd. In the ""Playback devices"" under sound, my monitor doesn't show up as connected. The video is fine, just its not detecting audio. 

I did some basic troubleshooting. I used a different cable, same result. 

I hooked up my laptop to my monitor to see if it was a monitor problem. Nope, played audio just fine.

So I think it's pretty safe to say that its the graphics card. Any suggestions on where to go from here?

Looking for advice/experiences.,Vnuke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2705zi/im_a_canadian_wanting_to_do_an_internship_in_the/,"Hi there, I am a third year Canadian computer science student and I have decided I want to relocate to the states upon graduation. I've looked around a bit and it seems quite feasible for a Canadian to move to US and work in tech. I'm interested in how feasible it would be for me to get an internship (co-op as they're called here) in the US before I graduate. 

I go to university good for CS but it's not Waterloo or anything. I have a co-op this summer at a federal research institution which I figure will be a decent resume point. My grades are not speculator; I think they'd be around 3.0 on a 4 point scale. I have a some decent side projects and I hope to have some significant projects and open source contributions when I begin applying. Overall my resume/experience are pretty comparable to what is considered good on this sub. 

I would like to work for a larger company thats name will recognizable on my resume, and I think thats the environment I will most enjoy. I'm not set on any particular companies and I think it may be a good idea to target companies that less glamorous than the big 4 (still applying though). I'm willing to go any location, but I think it would be an exciting experience to move to the Bay area.

Thanks for reading my post. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry if this is a repost, I couldn't find any threads about Canadians doing US internships specifically."

Mix this in with every thing reminding me of home, my severe PTSD, and a case of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I'm at rock bottom.

270cl0,1,2014-06-01,Dark Cafe,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/270cl0/dark_cafe/,"In early March this year, I started interning at a social business near my school. My reason for picking this company was because of its interesting business model. 

The company runs a cafe, but it was not your average kind of gourmet eatery. The cafe allows its customers to feast on a wide variety of food, in complete darkness. By doing so, customers will get a feel of what it's like to be blind and gain an empathy for the disadvantaged in our society. To top it off, the servers in the cafe are all visually impaired people (we call them VIs for short), who are trained and well familiarized with the cafe's layout. 

In the beginning, the job was really fun. As many of the other interns were my classmates, we had a great time goofing off at work; when our boss wasn't around, that is. We were also tasked with memorizing the cafe's layout so that we could navigate our way through, with or without light. 

However, work soon got boring. I was mostly in charged of administrative work. Occasionally, I would escort a late customer into the cafe to his table or interact with the customers after the meal (they usually have a lot of questions about how we run the cafe and serve food in complete darkness). But that was really it. 

Thus, us interns always filled our time by entertaining ourselves with useless chit-chat. Sometimes the conversations can be quite abstract, from religion to alien abductions. However, this was when things got weird. One time, when we were talking about ghosts, one of my colleagues asked a supervisor if our cafe was haunted since that place was completely dark most of the time. My supervisor, Sue, gave us a weird look and changed the subject. This made me suspicious, as Sue was always ready to share information about everything with us. 

Then, even stranger thing started to happen. A few days later, Adam, another intern, came in the room, face as pale as can be. He claimed that he heard footsteps beside him, quick and frantic. He called out but no one replied. Then something brushed passed him and hissed. I repeat, HISSED. Needless to say, we got really freaked out and no one wanted to go in the cafe afterwards. Sue, who's a terribly bad liar, assured us that it was just Adam's imagination. 

Anyways, a few weeks past and nothing else happened. I gradually got back my courage and even offered to escort a few customers into the cafe when everyone else was busy. Then yesterday, I escorted a young lady, probably in her twenties into the cafe. She was extremely scared and took much coaxing before she agreed to step into the cafe. I assured her that I would be by her side the whole way through. She gave me a kind smile and said, ""Me, too.""

I gave her a bewildering look but ushered her inside anyways. As we walked, she held on to me for dear life. When we finally reached her table, I seated her and heard her grateful voice as she thanked me. I left her there and headed in the direction of my office.

I was almost near the exit when I heard frantic footsteps. And then soft hissing. I got scared and ran towards to what I thought was the exit. But it wasn't, which was really strange as I've never gotten lost in the cafe before. I know the place like it was my second home. I tried to retrace my steps but it just led to another dead end. At this point of time, I started to really panic. It didn't help that the hissing is getting louder.

Suddenly, someone grabbed hold of my right arm. I screamed and tried to pull away. It was no use. I thought that I was a goner. But then whoever who was holding on to me spoke, ""Follow me, quick! I'll get you out of here!"" Relief soaked me from the head to the toe as I muttered a word of thanks. But then a second person grabbed my left arm, ""No, follow ME, I'll get you out of here.""

By then, I was honestly in hysteria. I must have been hyperventilating until I heard the first voice say, ""Be by your side the whole way through, remember?"" Following whatever instinct I have left, I broke my left arm free and followed the first voice. As I speed walked away, I heard a soft cackle behind me. 

After making it to the exit, I stumbled back into the light. Adam ran up to me and asked what happened. As I explained what happened, the door behind me opened up again and out walked all our customers. Apparently, lunch had finished! I had been lost in the cafe for almost an hour!

In the sea of faces, I tried looking around for the lady I brought in just now but she was nowhere to be seen. "
270d78,6,2014-06-01,"Planning on interning next summer, would appreciate any help.",FlameDra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/270d78/planning_on_interning_next_summer_would/,"I went through the FAQ and caught up on all the threads related to internships. I could not find the weekly internship thread, so I'm sorry for making a new post about this. 

I'll start off with a little background about myself. I'm a college sophomore going to the University of South Florida in Tampa, FL, for my Bachelors in Computer Science. I'm a pretty decent student and have around a 3.6 GPA right now. I've been programming on and off since my teenage years and most of what I worked on was web based. I started off with HTML and CSS when I was pretty young, and through the years got to work with PHP, Javascript and SQL. Most of my major projects (which I worked on during high school), focused primarily on developing and administrating websites for gaming organizations,  and the projects themselves relied heavily on some form of a CMS (I'm most familiar with Joomla! and PHPBB). As such, there wasn't a lot of heavy programming involved, just some minor scripting here and there. Other than my web based projects, I learned C# with XNA to learn some basic game development techniques. I'm currently taking my Introduction to Programming class this summer which uses Java, and it is pretty easy for me considering that I did many online intro and OOP courses during middle school.

Next summer, I will be done with my sophomore year of college, and want to do an internship for experience. However, I'm not sure how to approach this especially since I’m not sure if companies are even looking for sphomores. I'm listing down some of my concerns for visibility's sake:

* 1) When is a good time to look and apply for internships for Summer 2015? When do the applications open up? From what I read, October/November of this year seems to be the answer but I’m not sure. Also should I first make a list of every company I want to apply to and then custom tailor my resume/cover letter for each or what? Not sure how to approach this.

* 2) Where should I look for internships? I'm already looking into my University's career services but would like to know some external sources too. LinkedIn, Monster, etc. What do you guys recommend? I would like something in my area as I don't think companies pay interns to relocate. Also, I would very much like to intern in something web related as that's where most of my interest (and experience) lies.
 
* 3) What do I need to have on my resume for them to call me for an interview? I feel like I don't have the most presentable resume. I've worked on a few projects but they were a good couple of years ago. And most of them did not include heavy programming (didn't have to apply complex Data Structs and what not). What should I be focusing on doing the next few semesters to make my resume look better? Personal projects like an Android app, looking for a research opportunity in the university, what?

Most of all, I really want to have some internship experience before I graduate. I feel like not having one will seriously end up with me being unemployed upon graduation. Sorry for the long post, but this is something I’m really concerned about and will appreciate any help I can get. Thanks for taking the time to read.

I have been admitted to McGill, McMaster, Western (the main site) universities and am in the process of deciding which one to enter.

Personally, I would like to atten McGill university as it is renown and in a favourable city. But I know that I won't be able to work their due to their French Language Exam.

However, I have come to realize some problems that I may encounter after I graduate from their program. 

1) after I graduate and pass their nursing exam, I know that I may be able to register as College of Ontario Nurses. However, would this still be valid as the CRNE exam is replace by NCLEX exam?

2) also, do hospitals prefer students that have graduated from universites of their own province (e.g. Ontario?)

3) would it be hard for me to get a job in Ontario without doing the internship in that province?

4) would it be hard to get licensure in other provinces other than Ontario and Quebec? I would really like work in B.C or Ontario.

5) why are the nursing wage so low in Quebec?

If I cannot get a job after I graduate from McGill University, I would rather go to other universities. Which university will enable me to get a job right away? (I've seen in some posts that some people cannot get a job right now)

Any help/comments on these questions will be greatly appreciated! "

Hope this helps you!",raphaMBN,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2719ki/i_was_22fusa_europe_here_is_exactly_how_i_did_the/,"It is incredible the amount of passion in this subreddit. There is in particular a brand of IWantOut dream that keeps popping up here and seems the most desired but most impossible. But it's that dream I followed and achieved. Thus far I haven't seen anyone else who has done it and posted how. On the back of a great recent post about ignoring naysayers, I think it's time to share my story. 

I was "" 22F//USA//IBUS/Marketing -&gt; EU "" ...  

...and I did the ""impossible"": got hired straight from university to my first job ever, in Marketing, in Paris, France. English is my mother tongue. The job was all in French. Bachelor's degree only. No intercompany transfer from the US, no special skills not found elsewhere in the EU and no visa hassles except for normal French bureaucracy. I spoke French well but had never lived in France/worked in it (big difference). A year later I moved to Denmark. Seven years later I'm still in Denmark, and only just a few months ago became an EU citizen...of Latvia, incidentally.

To be clear, I'm not a robot sent from the future to find work in Europe. Haha. It was hard, but you know that. 

I'm going to detail exactly how I did this, including the actual job board I found my way out on. I even looked through all the emails from that period, saw 22 year old me's CV I sent out etc. (Cringe worthy stuff!!) 

See what you can get out of my journey to help you on yours. I'm rooting for you!

Here is the director's cut, with commentary, of the keys things I did:

**I made my own international experience** 

By the time I was applying for jobs in Europe at 22, I had studied abroad in four countries, spoke Portuguese fluently, four more euro languages at B1 or above level (took the tests), had two short internships, one of those in Portugal, and two ""misc"" int'l work experiences (bartender and songwriter/vocalist). 

None of this happened by accident. 

Starting from age 15 I would barter trips abroad instead of Christmas presents, save up money waitressing to hang out in Brazil with family friends for the summer, found a Brazilian lady to private tutor me Portuguese after school. You're not even supposed to study abroad more than two semesters at my university. But I convinced my advisor to make it happen. Those two internships and ""misc"" experience? Self made opportunities. For example, in Portugal on a student visa still I convinced an owner of a consultancy to let me do some free work for him for  two months. The other US internship was the same story really, helping some rogue entrepreneur do things. 

I got as much on the ground experience as possible - and when I wasn't on the ground I was talking to people who were. Stayed current with current affairs, music, life, people I met abroad even when not physically present. 

Building my own brand of int'l experience helped me in many ways. I showed I would not be a ""fresh off the boat"" hire. That I knew to some extent how things were done there and could handle working cross-culturally. My CV, cover letters etc were in local format and language which also signaled this. You might not have this background or be as much as a language nerd as myself - and that's OK. But think about your ultimate goal and if creating your own opportunities would help get you there. I didn't rely on anyone to give me euro experience. You can cultivate some euro savy with just an internet connection.  


**I reached out to contacts that could hire me - or get me to someone who could** 

Behind every work visa is Your Future Boss in Europe, who really wants to hire you. I focused on securing that part, because I should be so lucky to be dealing with visa issues! I spent the majority of my time trying to get in front of, get information from, and impress people who could help get me hired. From both first and second hand experience: if Future Boss really wants you, he tells HR to deal with the visa issues, and they can succeed. Even in seemingly impossible places. I went to notoriously tough France for an entry-level marketing job, remember? But first you need someone willing to fight for you, or go through some extra motions, if necessary.


**I paid for access to a European job board** 

Europeans are also interested in moving around in Europe, and there are a few pan European job boards in English with more internationally focused postings. Which one led me to my life in Europe? www.iagora.com. Just checked, it still exists and for 0€ you can browse recruiter-sponsored jobs, and for 24€ (33 ish dollars) you get premium access for a whole year. Wow. Easily the best 24€ I have ever spent. 


**I applied for and got REJECTED from LOTS of jobs on said board - but learned and kept going**

I never did get a response like ""we are obligated to hire an EU citizen"". In my desperation, I was applying for jobs that I was not a good fit for, but freshly graduated you think you can do anything if given the chance. Looking back it is so crystal clear the weaknesses both in my CV and approach. Ugh! 

See what I mean from this rejection email I got from a manager in Germany:

""Your cv is absolutely impressive and so are your language skills. However, the position offered does not focus primarily on marketing issues, but rather on product and sales issues.  I understand your skills and interests are mainly in marketing, and judging from your application you certainly are a great fit to any international organisation for a marketing position. 

For that reason I regret that at this point in time we cannot consider your application. However, should you be in Europe again, I will be happy to get your call to see if we can meet somewhere. There may well be other opportunities within (company name) for you in the future and it would be nice to have met you...""

Don't forget...Future Boss in Europe is not going to summon you from across the ocean if you cannot help him achieve his sales targets. If you wouldn't get the job even as a native of that country don't be too shocked you get rejected. Don't get too caught up in the romance or mystique of working in Europe that you lose sight of this. 


**I learned what to look for - and applied to a major corp's ""Graduate Programme""**  

This is where things really start to get interesting. In their early twenties Americans are looking for an ""entry level job"". But in Europe there are a few other terminologies for this concept, which I believe makes these types of jobs harder to find. It varies, but you could be called for example a ""trainee"" like ""management/marketing/sales trainee"", or a ""graduate"". Major companies might even only take on employees with less than 2 years experience through what's called either a :  ""Graduate Scheme"", ""Graduate Program"" (or ""Programme"" the UK spelling), ""Graduate Development Progamme"", ""Training Programme"", ""Trainee Program"", ""Traineeship"" or some variation. Some of these are local, some of these require you work in 2+ different locations/countries in two years. I saw a major corporation's European programme and applied. 


**I prepared my ass off for the interviews to demonstrate to Future Boss in Europe I was the best hire**

I sent my CV into that black hole of doom online application, but to my surprise whilst late and having to walk clear across campus I got a phone call from the UK. It was the company! We had a chat while I was walking which I later realized was a proper phone interview. It apparently went well because they flew me over to a two day ""assessment center"" in the European HQ near London a few weeks later. I totally shut everything else off and studied how to ace difficult consulting interviews, reviewed business problem solving, practiced my interview stories etc etc. International experience and languages got me in the door, but it would now come down to showing how I would help the business more so than the others.


**I GOT THE JOB.**

A few weeks later I got the call. I got in the Graduate Programme as one of fourteen, from about 2000, at 22 the youngest of the bunch, and only American. Ever. I distinctly remember taking a victory lap on my rollerblades. Paris for my first year in a Product Manager job because I could speak French and then I lobbied to go to Copenhagen, Denmark for my second year. Six years later still here and actually 1.5 years ago returned to the original company, where I now have a European Marketing Manager role.

We had a call about why we were accepted into the program. Besides demonstrating value for the business through the various tests/interviews, I absolutely stood out because I was an American who had closed an ocean-wide gap to have those language skills and experience.  A German who speaks German, English and has studied a semester in France? Not as awe-inspiring.


**A note about the language skills requirements for these programs**
The program I got in required English plus two foreign languages. Quick googling shows some programs just English. But a note on the foreign languages. My Euro program mates all were non native English speakers so they did have their mother tongue plus English right off the bat. However, that third language? Some of them were really stretching it. My German friend studied in the Netherlands and put Dutch. He spoke like three sentences. Another German put French and.. just no. French girl's Spanish? Not good enough to work in. Most of the job placements anyway were in the UK. Lots of companies have European roles and English as the business language. So don't count yourself out but keep training your languages you have more to prove as a native English speaker. 


To round it off, the process is supposed to be difficult, at any age, embrace that. Not only in an administrative and legal sense, but emotional as well, as you probably have so few supporting you. 

But I am one of them, so keep going! If you want to chat more feel free to PM me."

For the past few months I have known about this subreddit, I have laughed at the thought of submitting something here. I have laughed, thinking that even though I would like to commit suicide I would not do it, and searching for help here would be just silly.  
I've had psychological and psychiatric 'help' since 4 months ago. I tried two anti-depressants (Sertralinum and something else), to both I had severe unwanted reactions (flyer attached to the medication said that I should seriously-look-for-medical-help-RIGHT-NOW! if something like this happened), now I'm not taking any pills. I had serious thoughts about suicide for about 7-8 months. I was at the brink of doing it, but far enough that I thought I would never do it. I had no strength to commit, and I still had *some* life that I valued, that I didn't want to lose. Today my girlfriend of 2 years suddenly dumped me, she didn't even want to talk about it...  
  
This is a long text, I totally get it if you don't want read it all, read the last 2 sections at least.  
  
*Please consider that I am not a native English speaker and it is hard for me to proofread at the moment, some parts can be hard to understand.*  
  
***  
  
(this is my 'back-story', feel free to skip it: )  
  
I've been struggling with social interactions my whole life. It started when I was 10-11, when I was ostracized by my colleagues in school and I had no friends outside of it. I live outside of town, there were no kids around me almost my whole life, my parents have also frequently moved, I had no way of building relationships even if I wanted. This trend continues even today and many times I have tried to 'fix it' by pretending that I am someone I am not.  
  
When I was 13 I tried to 'build' myself a new personality, a mask. I wore 'gangsta' clothes (even though I was a small skinny boy), listened to music that deep inside I hated, etc. I found myself a 'girlfriend' that liked the values that I faked but apparently she didn't know we were a couple (we acted like a teenage couple, I just haven't *asked* her to be my girlfriend). This problems caused my first 'breakdown' and I didn't want to leave house to go to school for almost half a year. I switched schools, dropped all my previous friendships. With good help from a school psychologist/pedagogue and daily meetings with her over the course of 5-6 months I have slowly built my self respect by a tiny bit, from a total lack of it. I had to switch schools again, because at this age people go to a 'secondary school' of sorts for three years. My parent chose a private school where there were only &lt;30 kids. I haven't improved or regressed there. I still had no friends, I still spent all my time either waiting for my parents to pick me up from school (there was no practical way for me to return by myself, and my parents worked relatively nearby) or playing video games at home. Three years passed like this, the only people my age I had contact with was my class of 4 people. I felt relatively good though.  
  
After 3 years I finished this 'secondary school' and had to switch to a 'college', I was 17 then. I had made a decision that I will try again to build myself a 'mask'. I tried to act self-confident, I tried to join the *popular group*, I tried to wear fashionable clothes. I failed again. I was not that person, I didn't fit there. I 'locked out' myself again, I skipped classes all the time, I talked to maybe 1 person at school. I failed one year and I had to repeat it. I was put in another class by the school head teacher. I found 3 friends there, they too were ostracized in the past, they were amazingly intelligent and had nerdish hobbies. Perfect. Slowly but surely, up until 2 years ago, I have built this small group of 'friends'. They liked me for who I was, this slightly awkward depressive guy who lacks self-confidence. I went to study computer graphics, my life *'started'*.  
  
There is Piotrek. My best friend. We met few times a week, we never ran out of conversation subjects. He moved to another town, 2-hour train ride away, we have contact, but we rarely talk anymore. He has his own life now that is totally separate from mine. He is my best friend and the best person I have ever known.  
There was Ewa. I had crush on her, it didn't work, we remained friends for few years, our friendship ended.  
There was Karolina. My first girlfriend. I was 2 years with her. Looking back, I can see that I was a total asshole to her. I treated her not as good as I should. She dumped me.  
There was Basia. She was my best friend too. I have met her right after Peter left town. I have fucked up and the contact ended, she probably doesn't want to talk to me again. I know that it hit her really hard when our friendship *ended*.  
There was Gosia. She also studied computer graphics, we were in parallel groups. There was something between us for a short time, I naively thought that it may become a relationship.  
After Gosia I had hard time, I had another 'breakdown'. The only friend I had was Basia then but we met rather rarely, and I had to drop out of the computer graphics studies. I tried to build a mask again, I wanted a relationship, I wanted to not worry about being alone again, I wanted to feel 'cool'. Each 1-2 weeks I went to a party and tried to pick up a girl there. I always got phone number of the girl I liked the most. It always ended after 1-2 dates. I tried it with ~6 girls. I still feel like an idiot.  
2-3 months after it I have found a dating profile of a girl that lives nearby, I've seen her in the bus a few times. We went for a date, It worked, we liked each-other, we wanted more, we started dating. It went on for 2 years.

I was with Weronika for 2 years. We had troubles, we somehow semi-fixed them all. I still had troubles with myself during that time, but I always had Weronika, she almost always made me feel good and forget about it all. A year ago I have found a job as a web developer. I was supposed to wrote HTML 'skins' based on graphic design done by co-worker which then were converted to Wordpress by another co-worker. It started fine, I liked it, I am good at it. Soon after I started my boss found me some various 'side' jobs (fix broken websites of former-clients, provide support for new clients who bought our 'skins', anything that no one else wanted to do). I hated these, it was a 'trash' job. No one else wanted to do it because it required no skill or expertise. I did it anyway, because I was still a 'newbie'. 2 months before I quit the business expanded and they had to hire 4 new people. 2 of them had no previous HTML knowledge but were meant to be trained and hired for the same position as mine, HTML development. I still had to do the no-skill-or-expertise tasks. I was good, I knew what I was doing, I could do something important. I was forced into these trash tasks. Meanwhile the interns were finishing their first HTML 'skins'. I made the same money as them (even though I was supposed to get a 1k raise after 6 months), and the business laptop that the company gave me had to be shared with an intern. I quit. I felt unneeded and unappreciated. It was 7 months ago, around then problems with my gf started. Around then I started to think about suicide.  
  
In the past 7 months our relationship was slowly destroying itself. You see, I have problems to get out of bed in the morning, I don't have energy to look for a job, to start freelancing, I don't have energy to live. Between hating myself for my previous friendships and acquaintances, hating myself for not being able to work, and dreading my health problems, the relationship I had with Weronika was everything that gave me some joy and will to live day-to-day. Any energy I had I put into this relationship, because I was able to regain that energy when we (rarely) met. I had just enough energy to sustain the relationship for 7 months but it wasn't enough, Weronika 'let me do all the work', she rarely gave something back, she counted on me to sustain it. We talked over the internet for few hours daily, met maybe 1 time a week, rarely had sex, we rarely shared our problems.  
My day looks like this: I wake up 12:00-15:00, I go to eat some junk-food for breakfast, sit in front of the computer, and watch movies, watch series, play games, read reddit; I'm doing anything to not think about my life, because every time I do I end up overwhelmed and crying. I fear going to bed, I have to exhaust myself to the point where I know I will fall asleep in a few minutes, otherwise I risk thinking (and being overwhelmed again), I fall asleep anywhere between 03:00-07:00.

(today)  
  
I was on brink of committing suicide in the past 7 months. I 'knew' I would not do it because I hoped that my relationship will work soon again, and with Weronika's help I will slowly build self-respect again (as I did a few times in the past).  
  
I had no money recently, but I've made some simple t-shirt graphics for my sister few days ago and she paid me a little, so today I had money. We went for a bike ride with Weronika, I ordered pizza, we watched a movie, hung out in my garden on a hammock, we talked that tomorrow we will meet again at my place and later this week we will go out on a date, for a coffee, maybe to the zoo (she really wanted to eat some candy-floss and this is the only place I know they sell it), we wanted to go visit my uncle's fabrics shop next week, he said that he will give her some fabrics, so she can start to sew clothes (she wants to have her own boutique someday). We were having good time. We then went to my room and laid on bed, we were snuggling and the mood was right so I tried to initiate, by kissing her neck and touching her. She said 'No.' pushed me away from under the blanket and out of bed. It was a good day, we were happy, she never did that, so I tried to talk. I had to pull her tongue an she finally said that she doesn't need the physical part, she doesn't need the relationship, she wants to be friends (she rarely wants to meet with me and we haven't really talked about anything important for some time... how is that friendship?), that she is tired. She also said that she is disappointed with how I live, and that she hates that I rarely have money. Her idea of fixing our relationship is this: we should find our own friends and spend time with them and not ourselves. While I agree that overly relying on another person is bad, I see no way of living else-way myself (all my friendships and acquaintances had ended long time ago). Also, committing this little time she had, that we spent together (1 day a week usually, often twice in a month, rarely it happens that we met 2-3 times in a week) to other people would mean we would not meet at all (am I wrong thinking that this would be counterproductive?). She said we should end this relationship. After she said that she said she needs to go because she has math private lessons later today so she needs to do some homework. She then open the door and left. I went after her to ask if we could talk some more, we **need** to talk, she reluctantly said that *maybe* she will come to my place tomorrow. She left without saying goodbye even.  
  
Maybe she will come back to me... Right?  
  
(/today)  
  
***  
  
**(my fears)**  
  
I felt unneeded and worthless for the past 7 months, today I feel worse than that. For the past 7 months I saw no bright future in front of me but a tiny spark of hope-that-maybe-everything-will-be-alright, today I see a black hole. For the past 7 months I was one step away of committing suicide, now I am certain that I will do it, I just don't have the energy at this moment, and have not planned yet on how to maximize the chances that I will die and not just maim myself.  
  
I'm jobless, welfare system earnestly wants to kick me out, I have no friends, girlfriend dumped me, family either despises me (I know I hate them) or just don't know how to help me, I don't have social skills, I have no money, I don't have energy, I have skills but I can't force myself to use them, I feel that I am getting dumber every day, I'm emaciated, my teeth are really bad, I have back problems, I have heart problems, I have an undiagnosed Marfan syndrome. I fear that I will not be able to live even as 'good' I did before, I fear that I will be locked in a mental ward. Psychiatric and psychological help here is a farce. My aunt had similar problems, they locked her in a mental ward when she was about my age, it only worsened her state. She is 70 now and still lives with my grandfather, she has no social skills either, she is scared of life and people. I don't want to end like her. Living where I live (2hrs bus ride from nearest town) and being who I am I won't be able to find help. I want to kill myself, and escape it all.  
  
It will **not** be OK."

271w38,3,2014-06-01,Class Project?,tryingtofindaproject,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/271w38/class_project/,"Edit: btw sorry if this seemed like the wrong place to post. I don't know if engineering students would have been the correct place to put it, or CPUDesign or Chipdesign, they seemed more industry oriented. 

this is an extremely long post, so I apologize in advance and thank anyone who reads it. 

My classmate and I will be taking an independent study on Computer Architecture in the fall, essentially the graduate class. It is hardly offered so we talked to a professor who usually teaches that course if we could do a course under them. 

Well we finished our first computer architecure class a semester ago, with our final project being a pipelines processor using MIPS. We hadn't decided what kind of a project to work on over the summer and possibly into the fall. 

Over the summer we would cover all the foundation concepts of computer architecture, such as cache memory from a systems perspective or instruction and data level parallelism and the fall course talks about some more foundation material, such as more detail into threading, on chip networking, advancements in memory design and so on. The class project is more of a term paper, following IEEE guidelines on a recent advancement in computer architecture. 

Aside from our homework assignments and labs, which we've started, we don't have any project decided upon. Since we do have two semesesters we think it might be a good decision to do a large scale project. We  aren't part of a large university or well known, but we've looked into all the comp arch courses at other top level schools and seen that some do a large scale project, such as a superscalar processor. We thought maybe since we had two semesters that may not be a bad idea. 

We talked about this to a graduate student whos studying in VlSI design and he suggested that instead of just remaking our own cpu using an isa like MIPS or ARM, we could work on an open source project and actually contribute to the community and that might make our profile stand out more for applications. Neither of us have yet had internships and we are sophmores so we would like to do as many extracurricular projects to make us seem more applealing to companies. He said we should work on something like opensparc or openrisc, established projects that we can work on to improve microarchitecturally and see the results by actually testing out C code or making variations to the current design, more so with openrosc and learning about being engineers and the method of tradeoffs for power consumption, cpi and area used. The added benefit of opensparc is that there is a course Ive seen from UTexas that uses the sparc project to teach VLSI design. That's a bit too much for us obviously, but I have some experience in using Cadences design suite and Ive laid out a simple 8bit processor following a book before to learn about it, and I wouldn't mind spending an extra semester working on those skills before senior year myself. 

What do you guys think? Should we just make our own implementation of a set ISA or work on an open source project? 

Background: both he and I have taken one course in digital logic and one course in computer architecture. I've also taken a course on VLSI layout but that was more on using algorithms and just foundation things. I did use Cadence there to layout some other simple class projects. Both he and I have just over a year of experience with verilog, we've done three major projects using it and most of our class assignments. We've done one major verification project using SystemVerilog. 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. I know it's a tall order, but I wanted to make a sound decision before jumping in."
271xss,65,2014-06-01,[OC] The Egixus War: Chapter Seventeen,Manufacture,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/271xss/oc_the_egixus_war_chapter_seventeen/,"Chapter 17: Captured

It hurt to think. Julia Edwards' head pounded, scattering her thoughts.

*Where am I?*

*What happened?*

She glanced around at the metallic chamber that surrounded her. It was spotless and there wasn't a single flaw or rivet in its curved surface. 

*Why does my head hurt?*

Sitting up, she glanced around the room's interior. Save for the President of the former United States, it was completely empty. Light seemed to come from every direction and no direction all at once.

Then it came back to her. Slowly at first, then in a flood of memories.

*Air Force One.*

She had been half asleep on the bed near the rear of the plane. Her husband had just promised to meet her. A space ship in South Dakota was the destination. *New Horizons*, built by a company called Ethereal Concepts. She had seen the advertisements. 

""Sign up today,"" the billboards had read, ""and take one giant leap for mankind!""

Hilary told her that the Secretary of Defense had left the White House to get to the complex and commandeer the craft by force. 

""Why wasn't I told?"" Julia demanded to know.

""Ma'am,"" her Chief of Staff replied, ""I proposed the idea to you myself several times today. You acted like you didn't even hear me.""

*I'm not sure I did.* Julia thought in agreement. *Today has been a long day.*

When she had been filled in on the rest of the plan, she agreed that while it wasn't much, it was something. The mission would go ahead to Mars as planned. From there, maybe they could continue to be in command of what few assets that remained at their posts. 

*Maybe.*

Who was she kidding? It was a horrible, desperate idea. It was also the only one anyone had left.

*Run and hide.*

That had all been before she had spoken to James and then laid down to sleep. As she felt herself sinking into unconsciousness, they attacked.

A flash so bright that she could see the blood vessels on the inside of her closed eyelids had been followed by a roar and turbulence that Julia was sure would shake Air Force One apart. She had bolted upright and made her way quickly to the window of her plane.

The alien vessel was so close that she couldn't see anything besides the curve of its metal hull, illuminated by the lights on the wings of Air Force One. A second later, one of the dozen escorting jets shot past the window in a blur of motion. A dozen alien craft in close pursuit. She heard explosions, muffled by the plane's reinforced hull.

The fighters, taken by surprise when the giant ship had jumped out of warp right on top of them, were no match for the enemy.

They fell rapidly in streaking fireballs toward the ground below. Air Force One was not engaged. 

The pilot tried to break off, but the alien craft matched the ship in speed and movement.

Julia ran to the door to her quarters. She heard shouting in the hall. 

When she opened the door, she saw Secret Service agents running this way and that, their guns drawn in anticipation. Hilary looked petrified, clutching a stack of papers as though they might offer her some salvation.

*Thud. Thud. Thud.*

The impacts rang out inside of the ship. 

""We're hit!"" cried one of the interns, a young blonde, in panic. 

Suddenly, blades sheared through the hull of the aircraft. Within seconds they had cut a hole out of the side of the plane. The decompression threw Julia forward into one of the seats in front of her. The suction pinned her against its frame. 

She saw Hilary lose her grip and begin sliding towards the gaping hole that had appeared in the side of Air Force One. Her screaming was audible, even over the roar of the wind outside. As the Chief of Staff neared the wailing abyss, a great arm reached down and grabbed her.

It was not human.

The armored figure lifted her up like a rag doll with one arm. Using its other arms it pulled itself in through the hole it had made. 

The thing held her at eye level for a few moments, seemingly regarding her behind the jet-black glass of its visor. She thrashed and kicked to no avail. Then, almost flippantly, it tossed her out the hole behind it. Her screams were lost in the roaring winds.

It was getting hard to breath. Julia tried to move, but her arms were not strong enough. Instead she watched in horror as two more of the aliens followed the first into the plane. 

Concussions rang out as the Secret Service agents, who having finally braced themselves against the suction, were emptying their pistol ammo at the enemy. 

The aliens shrugged off the bullets with ease. 

When they ran out of bullets, Julia watched as two of the agents gave each other a look. 

Even with all of the commotion, one look was all it took, she saw them steel themselves. Then, with a ferocious war cry, the pair of agents launched themselves at the alien closest to the hole. It turned to face them, sickeningly long blades extending out from its upper arms. 

They crashed into the alien, who struggled to hold its ground. The two men let out one last roar and with a final heave, all three toppled out of the hole and vanished into the night sky. Even Egixa armor was not made to withstand an impact at terminal velocity. 

If there was a Valhalla, Julia knew where she'd find her two agents.

One of the armored monstrosities charged the remaining agents,its blades flashing in the fluorescent light. Bright red blood splattered far and wide across the interior of the Presidential plane.

The remaining alien glanced around the craft. 

Then it  saw her. The thing stepped towards her. 

It paused just within arms reach of the redheaded woman, ""President Edwards?"" She heard a robotic voice ask over the howling winds.

She nodded, beginning to feel light-headed.

The last thing she remembered was it reaching towards her with its cruel talons.

Now she was here... wherever here was.

*What will they do with me?*

She wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

272j4b,0,2014-06-01,Is it feasible to work as both a geotechnical and structural engineer?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/272j4b/is_it_feasible_to_work_as_both_a_geotechnical_and/,"Hi /r/engineering, 


I’m a recent B.S. in Civil Engineering graduate, and will be finishing my thesis for a M.S. in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering in about another year. My M.S. degree will have a specialization in Geotechnical Engineering, although my coursework will be split about half geotechnical, and half structural by the time I graduate. To date, I have my EIT, and some experience which includes a single summer internship experience with a geotechnical consulting firm, and the rest being mostly research related internships and work. 


My dilemma as of late is that I’ve been uncertain of how to reconcile my desire to work in both the structural, and geotechnical profession. What drew me to pick geotechnical engineering for my technical specialization was initially the uncertainty and variability inherent with many problems and the rationalization required by the engineer to go about solving those problems. To the same extent, I find that I still have a lingering passion for doing structural analysis/design.  


Ideally, I would like my career to involve solving a combination of geotechnical and structural problems, but based on my limited experience, observations and preliminary investigation, I’m unaware of a plausible pathway for this to work. Whenever I speak with geotechnical and structural engineering professionals, it always seems like there is a very distinct delineation between the two disciplines, which leads me to believe there’s not some middle ground, and it’s either one or the other. 


I’m hoping to get some guidance and recommendations on what my potential options are for working in both areas, if such options exist, and perhaps what type of companies provide this opportunity. Has anyone experienced similar desires, and how did you go about attempting to address it, and how did it work out for you? Has anyone obtained licensure as both a G.E. and S.E., and what type of work do you mostly do?

272za2,1,2014-06-01,Problems with an internship,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/272za2/problems_with_an_internship/,"So to give a bit of background, I'm a 21 year old male in a computer science major that is about to enter senior year this fall. I have been working in IT for about two years, primarily as server/end-user support in the university I attend. During the past two semesters I have also been running an organization based on the development of college students in the CS/IT world in order to get them ready for life in the working world.

Originally I pursued a degree in history, but after looking at job prospects I basically turned myself around and decided to enter the wonderful world of computers. While it has been a very hard path, mainly because of my inability to focus on math well, I have done very well in my classes. Finishing my last semester with a 3.8-something GPA and bringing myself to a 3.4-ish overall!

However after this past semester, which really did kick my ass despite the good grades, I ended up taking an offer for an internship for 10-weeks at a major corporation (which will go un-named for sake of privacy). I was placed in an IT sector of the company that was basically kept in the dark until about two weeks before the orientation job. I'll get to that in a second.

The first day went as expected for an internship. Learn about the company, finalize some paperwork, meet your team, tour facility and get an idea of what I'll be doing. People are all nice enough, environment is awesome in this one building, however I won't be working there. No biggie, they must do just carbon copies of these buildings, right? 

Day two comes along and it lands me in truthfully my worst nightmare and thing I desperately tried to avoid when going through interviews, which was a cubical farm. I'm given an idea of what I'll be doing for the next 12 weeks now and quickly find out over the course of the week a few things.

1. I don't enjoy anything about what I'll be working on. I've always been one to work on Windows environments, this work is all Unix/AIX/Red Hat.

2. The stuff I am working on isn't relevant to anything I expressed interest in during the interview. Instead of being placed in a security field or web app development, I have been kind of thrown in a compliance software management team.

3. I am not a person who can do cubical work. Some people can, I cannot. I've always been one to be walking around, working with my hands, helping people in some way or trying to figure out solutions to problems.

4. Basically I've been told that I'll be put in a sandbox environment for everything I do. While I know this is for security reasons, I had been told earlier that I'd be at least working on low impact projects, not a walled off project. 

5. I feel burned out. Partially from how the past two semesters have gone and also from the constant work I've been doing on the side during these semesters. I wake up and literally just do not feel like going to my internship knowing that for the next 8-ish hours I'll just be sitting around watching other people type on things while I take notes on subjects I hardly understand.

If anyone has any advice on what to do, I'm open to hearing it. Thank you for reading this, I know its a bit ranty and maybe a few of you will find it to be just a young college kid bitching about work. For some reason though every time I come home from this job I just feel nothing but hate for it and it's been really hard to pin down the main reason why I dislike this job so much. "
2734oa,59,2014-06-02,Ride Along,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2734oa/ride_along/,"5 summers ago, I interned with the local prosecutor's office. All of the intern's were taken on a tour of the jail and forensic lab, and the lab offered to let us all do a ride along. Almost everyone jumped at the chance, so we signed up. 

Week after week interns rode along, and week after week they came back disappointed. Nothing interesting happened, and most never left the lab. My ride along was schedule for a Friday night, 3pm to 11pm. 

The day of my ride along, I was listening to jail calls at work when I got an email from one of the big wigs. The CLE (continuing legal education) she was supposed to teach that day was cancelled. She had to attend an infant homicide investigation. It was 2:30pm.

&gt;Oh God, I thought. 

I didn't want to sit in the lab all night, but I didn't want to go to an infant homicide scene either. One of my bosses came to my office, 

&gt;Did you see Big Wig's email?

&gt;Yeah.....

&gt;Good luck.

At 2:45pm, I walked over to the forensics lab. When I arrived, the secretary told me I'd have to wait. 

&gt;Everyone is in a meeting. There was an incident. You might be the first ride along to see any action in weeks.

Lucky me, I thought. 

I waited about 20 minutes before the head CSI guy came out. He took me down to the lab. I signed  a waiver. He introduced me to Sarah. I'd do my first ride along with her, because everyone else was headed to the infant homicide. Sarah was headed to the north-side where the police had just served a search warrant.

I was relieved. I was going to get to go on a real ride along, but I wouldn't be at the infant homicide.

&gt;Sarah: You ready?

&gt;Me: Yeah.

&gt;Sarah: It'll be pretty straightforward. We just have to go collect some bedding, take some pics, and sketch the scene.

&gt;Me: Collect bedding?

&gt;Sarah: Yeah, the cops just busted a child sex ring. At this home, a 13 year-old mentally handicap girl was forced to have sex with men and women for money. We have to go collect the bedding so we can test for DNA.

My relief quickly vanished.

I could describe the scene in detail, but there isn't much to say. It was filthy. The worst part was the children's toys mixed with very adult garbage. Three children lived in this house....well existed. I don't know if i'd call it living. 

Some of the cops were wearing ski-mask type covers on their face and gloves. Not an inch of skin exposed. Apparently, they were undercover and part of the reason the ring had been discovered. They had to protect their identity, but it just made the scene creepier. 

The grandmother was there waiting for the kids to come home from school. The mom had taken her handicap daughter to the hospital. Apparently, it was the girls father and his girlfriend that forced the  her to have sex with strangers when mom and grandma were at work/gone. When the kids arrived they were so excited to see real cops. The cops showed the kids their badges, their tool belt, they let them talk to another cop on the walkie. The cops kept everyone from going upstairs, but they also did their best to keep the kids from wondering what exactly Sarah and I were doing.

We left. Sarah explained to me just how deep some of the undercover cops could get. It was intense and terrifying. When we got back to the lab, Sarah put me in a side room with a TV.  She needed to check in all the evidence, order labs, and write up a report. I watched Friends for all of 10 minutes before, 

&gt;Hey kid. You want to do another ride along?

I was 22 at the time, so I wasn't a kid. But Greg was at least 40. 

&gt;Sure. Where are we going?

&gt;Some asshole beat a baby to death. 

My heart skipped a beat. The infant homicide. I thought they had already left for that!

&gt;Oh.....

&gt;Come on. The coroner and a detective are going to meet us at the scene.

Turns out they only had an arrest warrant earlier. Now they had a search warrant, and it was for the whole house. The house was small. It was also hell. 

When we got to the scene the detective was waiting for us. He debriefed us. The baby's mom had dropped the child off for a week with her father. Mom was going on vacation. Mom had wanted her mom to watch the girl, but Dad insisted on watching her. Dad lived with his current girlfriend and her 3 year old son. Dad did not work, so he watched his daughter and his girlfriend's son why the girlfriend went to work. After one day, the dad called his mom begging her to come take her granddaughter. He couldn't handle her. All she did was cry, he told his mom. The grandma told him to man up. The dad beat his daughter to death on day 3. He beat a baby to death b/c she cried. 

The coroner arrived. He said the baby had a weird bruise that he thinks was caused by a blunt object. The father hit her so hard her rectum prolapsed. Her insides literally exploded out of her. She also had bleeding in her brain, a ruptured eye, cracked ribs, and a collapsed lung. Then the coroner did something I was not prepared for, he pulled out an ipad and showed us pictures of this tiny innocent baby. 

He showed us the weird bruising. We needed to find something that could match it. 

We went inside. The floor was sticky. The house smelled like feces. We quickly discovered it was because the dad had just put his daughters (and girlfriend's sons) diapers in a corner on the floor in the kitchen. There were at least 20 diapers. We had to sort through them. Two were beyond bloody. 

We looked through the kitchen. We didn't find an item that matched the bruising. What we did find: A rat, dishes drowning in grease, dishes caked with dried food, cereal with rat droppings in it, formula with rat droppings, and a pile of dirty laundry. The washing machine was in the kitchen. We went through the dirty laundry. More blood, this time on a princess blanket. 

We went to the bathroom. There was hair and what appeared to be a piece of scalp in the garbage can next to the toilet. This was the only part of the house that did not smell like feces....that was b/c it reeked of bleach. Again, no item matching the bruising. 

The detective stepped out to make a phone call. Greg went to check a spare room. I went to the ""play room"". Although, I'm not sure how much playing the kids did in there. There were plenty of toys, but also a box cutter, rat poison, and what appeared to be weed. The box cutter was next to a doll house. The rat poison was just laying in the middle of the room. And the weed was sitting in the toy box. 

I decided to venture into the bedroom. No on had ventured in there yet. We knew this is where everyone slept, but we were putting it off. I looked at the pack-n-play. There was random bits of plastic inside. It looked like it may have been from a mobile, but now it was just random green plastic with jagged edges. I doubt this was safe for a baby to play with. 

I decided not to touch the bed. There were plates of food on it and on the night stand. A cockroach was enjoying the remains of the food. I opened the closet door, and I almost vomited. A mouse was caught in a trap, but it wasn't quite dead. It's legs tried to wiggle itself free. A cockroach was already sitting on top of it ready to eat it. I closed the closet door. 

I held my head in my hands and bent down into a squatted position. I was trying not to faint or breakdown. I looked at the floor. It was covered in wire hangers. Including one hanger that had been unwound. I called for Greg. He finally entered the bedroom. He looked pale. I pointed at the hangers, including the one that was unwound. Greg called for the detective and the coroner. We think he beat her with a wire hanger. 
 
I helped Greg bag up more things, and we did a backlight of the bed. It was filthy. Then Greg had to do a video of the entire house. On big crimes scenes, they don't just sketch it. They do a video walkthrough. The detective told me to come sit in his car. 

&gt;My boss is about to interrogate the dad. We can watch.

I listened as this dad explained in detail what he did. He admitted to beating the girl with a hanger when she wouldn't stop crying. Shockingly, the beating did not quiet her down. The captain brought out a prop, a baby doll. The dad picked up the baby doll and showed the captain how he shook the baby, how squeezed her so tight he was ""sure her eyes would pop out of her head"". He threw her into the pack-n-play and went to play xbox in the spare room. She didn't cry for hours. 

When he finally went to check on her, he couldn't get her to eat and her diaper was full of blood. She whimpered and ""made a wheezing sound."" He bathed her and her hair fell out. That is when he called 911. He didn't mean to kill her, but she just wouldn't stop crying. She died in the ambulance. 

She was alive after that beating for at least 4 hours. She laid in her pack-n-play barely able to breathe, rectal protruding, bleeding internally. She suffered alone, in pain, for 4 hours before he called 911. She might have lived had he called immediately, but instead she died slowly and in pain. All because she wouldn't stop crying, b/c she was hungry. The rats got into the formula and he hadn't ""had the chance to buy more"". He just gave her sugar water. But he didn't mean to kill her....

It has been nearly 5 years, and I can still walk through this house in my head. I can still see the pictures of that baby. I want to say it was the worst experience of my life, but that seems wrong. I only had to walk through this house for a few hours. That little baby had to live and die there. I still think about her from time to time, and I pray that there is an afterlife and that she is finally in a place where she feels safe and loved. I have to believe she is, because I can't stand to think of all the innocent babies, animals, children, etc. that live only to suffer at the hands of some of the world's worst monsters....the ones that are supposed to love them."

Hell, I just messing around with a simple coding project that I was working with on the side and it was incredibly more enjoyable than this job.

Anyways, based on that alone, I think it would be a good idea to quit but it does suck since I likely won't have a job over the summer then, but what's more concerning is that I won't have an internship on resume, which is something the vast majority of people in my field (coming out of my college) will have so it does put me at a strong disadvantage.

Pretty much, I built a poor foundation in my intro classes and have just had a lot of trouble since then. I've taken classes in Java, C, and currently in C++. My current class is the one I'm struggling the most in. I'm most likely about to fail this class unless I can somehow do amazing on the final. 

The main problem I have is that I can read through a code and understand it for the most part, but when I have to code something myself, I'm clueless. I don't know how to approach it. Something that can easily be done in one line of code becomes a struggle for me that I feel needs about 10 lines of code. I just feel lost when I try to code on my own. I have this same struggle even when I try to plan out what the program should be doing. This is the problem I've been having on the tests mainly this year. We're asked to program a simple function but I don't understand what to write. In C and Java, I had a simple understanding of it so I was able to get some points on the tests, but in C++, I have no idea what to do. I struggled trying to learn it. I've sat down and tried to learn it but it doesn't stick with me. I feel like, as the title says, programming doesn't click in my head. 

Am I approaching programming incorrectly? I've tried writing and reading through programs but to no luck. Is there a better way for me to learn the basics? Should I just go back and start from scratch again? I would devote my time over the summer, but I won't have as much time since I have a QA internship.

In fact, not a single professor in our BME department has a degree in BME. They are all EE, MechE, and ChemE. 

Also, one of the faculty advisers as well as my school's BME adviser told me that companies that work with biomechanics and other BME fields would much rather hire mechanical and chemical engineers than biomedical engineers. She even told me that more mechanical engineers from my school have gotten BME internships than BME majors.

I was curious, so I looked at my schools job fairs, and out of the 100+ companies that attend each quarter, not a single company was hiring BME majors. Not one.

Also, after doing some research online it looks like people with BME degrees can't find work after they graduate, and most end up having to go to grad school just to increase the likelihood that they can find work.

I was originally a BME major but I switched to Computer Engineering a year ago because I found that I enjoyed programming and computer hardware more than biology and mechanics. However, I am still very curious as to why the supposed fastest growing engineering field according to the BLS is horrible in terms of job prospects.

Anyone have any ideas?"
276e5o,6,2014-06-03,"I love consulting, but I'm losing hope that I won't be able to work in my dream field.",[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/276e5o/i_love_consulting_but_im_losing_hope_that_i_wont/,"I don't mean for this to sound like a cry for help, I've just lost a lot of hope that I used to have about breaking into consulting recently and I was hoping that some of you may have a similar story and could offer me some guidance. In the past year I was exposed to what consulting was, and I fell in love with it pretty quickly. The problem solving aspect is what attracted me to it so much, I never really had thought about what I wanted to do after I graduated but now that I've learned what consulting is I know that this is it. Ever since then I've been trying to absorb as much information about it as I can, I'm reading books, listening to podcasts, researching companies, practicing cases, everything I could possibly do to learn more.

But here's my problem.

I'm currently a rising senior in college, and I do have some things on my side in that I'm at a target school that companies like Accenture and Deloitte recruit heavily for. I'm also majoring in bioengineering and our department is consistently ranked in the top 3 in the country and most of our graduates have found great success in consulting. Despite all of this, my GPA is nowhere near where it needs to be to get an interview. I messed up my freshman year and had some family problems the next two that hurt my grades but it's looking more and more likely that I'll add two A's to my transcript this summer and I am also looking to get a 4.0 next semester taking some classes very relevant to consulting and also retaking one that's an F on my transcript which would boost my GPA. It's currently ~2.7 with a potential to be ~ 3.0 by the end of the fall term.

Unfortunately, I was not able to land any internships in consulting this summer despite attending on-campus recruiting case competitions, coffee chats, etc. This is mostly why I've been down in the dumps lately as I'm not doing what I would kill to do this summer: intern at a consulting firm. To be fair to myself this was when I had just learned about consulting so I was not very well versed on how to network or work cases but I am much better now. But I know my GPA is a big red flag and I have been trying to fix it and gather skills I can use to get my dream job but I don't know what to do now.

In addition to spending the past few months learning about consulting, I have become a part of this program at my school where teams of undergrads work together to solve a global medical program. In the group I worked on this past year, I helped to develop a now patented medical device that I also presented at competitions where it won multiple awards. Additionally I will be working on another team this upcoming year to develop a new device related to vital sign monitoring in rural countries. I only bring this up because firms that recruit at my school seem to really favor students involved in this program (several of my team members are currently working at firms for the summer). 

Additionally, I recently (in the past few weeks) was elected as the only undergraduate executive member to our school's Business and Consulting Club. This means that starting in the fall I will be running many case review sessions among myself and graduate students and I will also be allowed to have my own undergraduate team in what is historically an all-graduate student attended Business Case Competition that the school puts on with many recruiters from MBB and many other consulting firms.

Aside from this I feel like my resume reads as it should, I have been involved with Varsity sports, a member of 6 different clubs where I have held leadership roles in all 6 and this summer I will be working what is essentially an IT consulting job where I am going to be responsible for advising our school on how to implement our new electron microscope network so that it can be automated and of efficient service to everyone, I will also help implement this solution myself (I have a background in computer science).

What I most need help with is how to get an interview. I believe I interview well as I have been practicing it a lot and I think I could relay my intense passion for the field and show the personal strides I've recently made to make myself a good candidate. The problem is though, that most companies filter based on GPA and I don't know that I'll be able to meet that requirement by the time applications are due. I do have my school and fraternity network that I can make use of (which I plan to) but I'm kind of lost as to what exactly I should do. I plan on meeting with people I know who work for these firms and with my department adviser but I was hoping you guys would be able to offer some words of wisdom on what I can do to make myself a better applicant and possible ways I might be able to get my foot in the door for an interview.

**TL;DR** Consulting has become my dream and passion, but I don't have the grades to land an interview. I will be a senior this year and need advice on what I could do to get companies to look past my GPA and/or land an interview with some."

To me, this is exciting because my previous internship was working with dreadful internal applications that had huge ugly codebases. Mostly fixing crappy code that other people wrote.

For my first year or so of my degree, I was planning on becoming a software developer. I worked on a load of programming side projects, taught myself languages that weren't on my course, and just did a lot of programming for fun and work.

Then in my second year, I started to get really into the more theoretical parts of my course (which were unrelated to software). I signed up for a third year project in a theoretical subject, and started spending my time going to research seminars (I was almost always the only undergrad there), writing to academics about their research, and talking to current PhD students. I decided that I wanted to go into research in some area of theoretical CS, and my own-time work and projects veered away from programming.

Last summer I did a ten week internship at a largeish company writing software in Java. I really enjoyed it, and I was good at it -- at the end of the internship, they offered me a job for after my third year, if I chose to graduate after three years (with a bachelor's rather than a master's). Although I had had a great time, I was leaning much more towards research at that point, so I declined them (but expressed a lot of gratitude and what a great time I'd had, and I am still friendly with several people there, so hopefully that might come in handy if I need it at any point).

This year, I did my research project (which I also loved; it's probably the thing I've enjoyed the most and am most proud of from my whole degree so far). I continued going to the seminars. And I didn't take any programming courses. I had to do a bit of programming for a couple of courses, but that was just implementing algorithms related to the theoretical courses I was taking. I also arranged for a research internship this summer at a great university (which I am really looking forward to), and I have signed up to do a fourth year project which is also very theoretical and probably won't involve writing a single line of code.

I have a website on which I post programming projects and also write a blog, which is 90% on my research-related interests.

To be honest, I feel like at the moment I am a pretty good candidate for a PhD and a research career. I have put a lot of work in with that aim, and I have a lot to show for it (good research projects, good relationships with academics and researchers, good internship, active and detailed relevant blog).

The problem is that... I've been doubting that this is the right path for me. Despite all my motivated... my grades actually aren't that great. I go through periods of depression, and I worry that a few months of depression could fuck up a PhD or a research career much more than it could a software job. I worry that I won't be able to handle the responsibility. I get emails from my lecturers at 10PM on Friday nights... I don't know if I want to be that guy; I don't *always* feel like going home and turning my brain off on a Friday night, but having the *option* to do so is important to me! And do I really want to spend 3+ more years as a broke student? Really? I dunno.

So I've been reconsidering software. But I'm currently a terrible candidate for a programming job... I haven't done any significant personal programming projects for a year and a half, and my skills/knowledge are rusty from lack of practice.

The obvious thing to do is to spend more time programming. But with everything else going on in my life at the moment, I don't feel like I have time to make myself a competitive PhD candidate and a competitive programmer, and I don't want to screw myself over for either option!

Any advice gratefully received."

Something like this: http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs124/  [Which is obviously not open]

I'm hoping you can help me solve this problem at my internship. I work for a biotech company and we want to graphically represent the data from one of our machines (Agilent Bravo). It's pretty much a machine with 96 heads (or 384) that picks up pipet tips and aspirates/disperses fluid. 

So each head/well has it's own value for quality control testing. I.E. the well in column 20, row E gives a value of 9.1 (ideal value is 9.9). We want to track the values for every well in the head (96 or 384) and put the info in a line graph. Once we see the linear line have a dip or depreciation, we can predict with some certainty that the well is going bad. 

Obviously if we go in excel and  create a graph with one well (i.e. Column 20, Row E) we can visually see a linear line (assuming its a good head) and then once a well goes bad, we'll see a dip/depreciation that will show perfectly a well going bad. But the question is how to reproduce this if there are 96 wells (or 384) we are trying to watch. 


How do you suggest we represent such a large amount of data? "

Graduated in December with BS in CS. Summer of junior year and part of my last semester interned for ""web company"". ""Web company"" had management issues and I ended up being let go with all the other interns (3 of us total). Took a job in January at ""Java company"". 

Location: western ny


I have been working for ""Java company"" for 6 months and have been stressed out, working on a boring app that is outdated and isn't any more complex then school work I was doing. Large company, management sucks (manager doesn't even know my name). Really close to home. Stability. Making 55k/year.


""web company"" which now has new management that I've met and liked wants me to come back, they've made an offer of 60k/year with potential 10k/year bonus depending on if I hit goals or not. Small company, I know everyone on the dev team and enjoyed working there.  ~30 minute commute. 


My gut is telling me to take the offer and work for ""Web company"" since I will be happier and making maybe a little more money. Benefits are comparable. 

Questions:

How does only working for a company for 6 months look on a resume? 


Anyone have experience with goal based bonus? 

Any other things i should be thinking about?"

278m5u,13,2014-06-03,"What I Learned From 30-Year Old Self-Made Millionaire, Tyler Dikman (LoungeBuddy)",kNIVEK2,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/278m5u/what_i_learned_from_30year_old_selfmade/,"I'm in the process of interviewing young, successful entrepreneurs.  This interview is with Tyler Dikman, founder of CoolTronics &amp; LoungeBuddy.

After our interview, I wrote everything out and organized it together.  Here it is:

Tyler Dikman has been known as an entrepreneur his entire life.  He started off with lemonade stands at the age of 5.  These were not just your typical lemonade stands.  He went the extra mile to make them the best he could, including putting signage up and down the streets.  Tyler would even go to the grocery store to get free displays and essentially turn his lemonade stands into his personal enterprise.  Running these lemonade stands would yield him about $15-20 per hour, which was a lot for someone his age.

Several years later he found himself in other small ventures such as babysitting and lawn mowing.  At the age of 12-13, he took on the hat of a magician, performing magic tricks at birthday parties.
Tyler had always been extremely interested in the stock market.  At the age of 13, he landed an internship with Merrill Lynch.  This became possible through his babysitting job.  He was babysitting the kids of one of the Vice Presidents of Merrill Lynch.  The two would have conversations and he could tell Tyler was very passionate.  At the beginning of 9th grade, he was hired on part time, working after school.  Tyler learned a lot and this further drove his passion for entrepreneurship, business, and the stock market.

At the age of 15, he founded the company CoolTronics.  “CoolTronics helps individuals and small businesses with making the most of what computer technology offers.”  CoolTronics is a very intensive 1 on 1 service business.  This was very exciting for him as he was really starting to build a company for the first time.  He had no idea what he was doing and many mistakes were made, however these became his learning lessons.  Tyler built the company with a reputation of exceptional customer care.  CoolTronics was a great way for Tyler to make good money.  Throughout high school he continued to grow the business.  By the time he was graduating, CoolTronics had between 6-10 employees and was doing over a million in revenue a year.  Because of this CoolTronics gained some publicity.  Tyler continued to run CoolTronics in college, and today it is still well and thriving.

After high school, Tyler attended Santa Clara University located in Silicon Valley.  He wanted to surround himself with entrepreneurs who were far more successful.  Silicon Valley was the ideal place to do this in which Tyler was able to get great mentors.

Shortly after college, Tyler co-founded a company called Redux, which was based in Berkeley.  Redux makes discovering exceptional online video as enjoyable and effortless as watching cable television.  Redux delivers a lean-back TV experience programmed by curators and friends that share one’s taste.  Redux allows a person to see, share, and experience the best video moments from movies, shows, and videos they already know and love.  Tyler was in charge of working on big partnerships with major companies.  He was also in charge of growing a workforce quickly.  Redux was Tyler’s first time raising venture capital, as well as his first dot-com start up.  Tyler worked with Redux for three years before moving on.

After Redux, he became one of the first employees at Net Power &amp; Light.  Net Power &amp; Light “has numerous patented innovations that change the way people experience media, entertainment, and communications, heralding the onset of the Experience Age.”  They are “dedicated to delivering a new kind of powerful technology platform that gives people the freedom to have fun and connect more deeply.”  Tyler ran partnership management during his three years with the company.  He got to fly all over and worked with places like Harvard on their global education initiative and well-known groups such as TED Talks.

Slightly over a year ago, Tyler began his latest venture LoungeBuddy.  “LoungeBuddy is the only App that displays all airport lounges in over 400 of the busiest airports around the world.”  LoungeBuddy is focused on setting up structure to support millions of people around the world.  It was originally created to solve a problem Tyler was having.  His real passion is travel and he wanted to start a company doing what he loves.  This is the first company of its kind, which makes it very exciting for Tyler.

A day in the life of Tyler Dikman is quite sporadic.  Typically in the morning, he will start off making phone calls to check in with the people at CoolTronics, which is still thriving.  This will be followed with a phone call to a business partner, mentor, or advisor.  Tyler has many mentors and advisors, all of whom are incredibly helpful.  At about 10AM, he heads to the LoungeBuddy office and often works until 11PM.  He has no problem working long hours since he enjoys what he does, and time flies when you’re having fun!  

There are currently six people working within the company, each with many different jobs.  Working at LoungeBuddy oftentimes does not provide much of a routine.  There is some structure, but also opportunities to break away.  Since they are the first company of its kind, there are many trial and error testings, which also changes everyday.  

Besides his role as CEO, Tyler is also in charge of business development, oftentimes traveling all over the world to meet with current or potential partners.  He spends pitching to major airlines.  Other tasks include working on the marketing initiative or sitting down one of the interns and discussing how their week went and what was learned.  Tyler also takes on different media, publication, or live TV requests.  Because of all the differentiated things to do, it makes the day go by quick in a good way. 

One of the most difficult challenges Tyler faces is dealing with people internally and externally.  Aligning goals internally and externally can be very difficult.  Keeping employees happy as well as customers are two very different things.  Being able to find that delicate balance is incredibly tough and has been a challenge for Tyler.  A way he strives to keep employees happy is through surprise.  There will be surprise events or company outings.  These are always very exciting and employees really enjoy it.  On the other hand, there are times when Tyler encourages employees to stay in the office later in order to push out for customers or do a lot of beta testing.
   
To show that he is also part of the process he will participate in many roles, even though it is not his job.  As the leader, he must lead by example.  He must be working as hard, if not harder than anybody in the company.  He can’t expect them to do something and not live up to that himself, or else why should they?

Currently LoungeBuddy is pre-revenue.  They are generating revenue, however unprofitable yet.  They are still in negative cash flow.  Tyler has told all his employees that he will not pay himself anything more than his rent, until they either become profitable or raise a formal round of funding.  He currently pays himself the same as interns and will continue to do so until one of the two events happen.

Another challenge LoungeBuddy works through is not having many companies to compare with.  Because they are the first business of its kind, they are constantly creating the rules as they go.  There is a lot of beta testing and trial and error.  

Tyler gave sound advice for entrepreneurs.  He mentioned that many first time entrepreneurs think they need to come up with a completely original idea.  He went on to say that just because something has been done before doesn’t mean you couldn’t do it, or do it better.  Entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they could model different pieces of various companies and reform these concepts into a new bit of execution.  His advice was to essentially copy successful companies and do it with your own insight and special hook.  Doing something completely original will waste a lot of time.  Don’t reinvent the wheel.  Some of the best ideas are the most simple.  If you can’t explain to someone what you are doing in 30 seconds, you are either not explaining it right or probably won’t be very successful at it, especially first time entrepreneurs.

Tyler goes on to say how important it is to be a good public speaker.  If you are not, it is still fine, however you must get a business partner who is.  Best of all, you should learn the skill.  When it comes to public speaking it is very important to really speak your idea and give people that excitement about what you are doing, in a way that is understandable.  Again, simplicity is key.  There were many people that were smarter and more brilliant than Tyler.  Luckily for him at a young age, he sold lemonade and performed magic shows where he got the practice of constantly talking to people and adapting to the environment.  

He continued by saying that as an entrepreneur you are always pitching, whether talking to a friend, at a baseball game, or business mixer.  You must be as excited with each and every person.  You must assume they are the next employee, business partner, investor, or acquirer.  This rang true for Tyler as he hired employees and found investors this way.  If you can’t pitch your idea 100 times a day and still be excited about it, don’t do it.  If you don’t love it, you won’t give it your all.  You must love it so much that even if you repeat it in your sleep it is still enjoyable.  

Another piece of advice was to ask for help.  Don’t be afraid to say you don’t understand something.  Ask for clarification.  If you just nod and agree for everything, you won’t learn anything.  In Silicon Valley, Tyler was at the bottom 10% of intelligent people in the room.  The great thing about this was that he had everybody to learn from.  Situations beyond our comfort zone are where we learn the most.  Put yourself in situations that are well beyond what you are used to.

Love what you do.  As an entrepreneur, you are working your ass off.  If you are not having fun while doing it, you are wasting your time.  Some people believe that a successful entrepreneur is one who exited for whatever millions or billions.  However it is the journey that is most exciting.  Once you sell, then what?  If you can do what you love and support yourself along the way, and one day have a successful exit, great!  The key is to always love what you do and continue learning.  The money will eventually come.  You may fail 10 times, but keep at it!

Personally, Tyler has faced many small failures.  They key is to start as early as possible.  Take risks.  When you make a mistake when you are young, the outcome isn’t so bad.  Always learn.  Get a part time job.  Ask a neighbor to sit down and ask them about what they do in their job.  Learn to shadow people.  Shadow 10 people.  See if you can work with a different person a week for the whole summer.  Set aside some time to learn about business in general.  You’ll eventually find your way.  Do something you love and in that way you will keep picking yourself up every time you fail.  Just starting a business isn’t what an entrepreneur is all about.  It’s about being able to make those mistakes and doing it again and again.  It’s about doing it in a field you love, time and time again.  Being an entrepreneur is very stressful.  You will constantly hear people telling you, ‘No’ over and over.  

It is one thing to come up with a lot of great ideas, than to actually execute on it.  Far fewer people will execute on an idea.  It is about the way you execute and the energy you put into the concept.  Start with something you know.  If you don’t love it, you probably won’t be successful at it.

It is crucial to get a mentor or a group of advisors.  It is also crucial to get a group of people you can bounce ideas off of.  You want to learn from others mistakes, that way you don’t make as many of those mistakes.  Constantly ask for help and constantly make more mistakes.  This is the process of learning.  A lot of easy advice may be tempting to just throw off, however they are really the important things.  

Tyler found mentors in various ways.  Some mentors for LoungeBuddy have been CoolTronics customers.  Others were from professors.  Tyler would ask his parents if they knew anybody in a certain field.  He also attended networking events.  He mentioned other ways people could find mentors are through big name guest speakers.  These people can be found at colleges, business functions, or other events.  These guest speakers really enjoy helping people out.  The reason they are up there is because they want to provide advice.  After their speech is over, follow where they go and be the first person to ask a question during the Q&amp;A session.  If they have time a mentorship may sometimes work out.  Having a mentor doesn’t mean you have to talk to them everyday.  It could just be a 10-minute phone call.  The key is to get a lot of different insight and a variety of opinions.  

I will be interviewing more young, successful entrepreneurs.  If you would like me to specifically ask them a question, comment below!


Edit: I've been reading the comments and thanks for the feedback.  This is the very first draft I wrote, which was intended to get everything from the interview into words.  I will send Tyler an email for follow up questions to some of the comments I see.

On another note, I've created a website where I want to share a lot of value.  If you love reading great books and want to get through the main concepts more quickly, check out my website www.kevinhleung.com.
I read many books and underline what is important.  I then type these up as an entry on my website.  The books I have so far include Think And Grow Rich, Awaken The Giant Within, How To Win Friends &amp; Influence People, and Never Eat Alone.

I work as an intern for a startup that makes an embedded device. I've been working there for almost a year. During that whole year, we have only ever met a project goal once. We are still very heavy in development, but our boss is trying to get our product into the hands of investors. Recently, we missed another deadline for the new version of the product to be completed, and we were given very little time to complete and test it. In the last year we have lost over half of the team. My boss seems to be a smart guy, but his management skills are terrible and doesn't seem to know almost anything about managing a programming team, building an embedded device, or a web service to support it. We seem to have a severe planning deficit. Things are bleak and morale is low. Let me reiterate: he's not abusive or demeaning or petty, in fact he's a very nice guy that's trying to do something to help people, but he just seems to be very bad at his job. Have you ever been in this kind of a situation before? What did you do to remedy the situation? Is there some book or website or Jon Hamm instructional video or something I can give to my boss to improve his skills?"

Hi guys, as a little background I am a 19 year old looking to start going to college again to peruse a career in programming and development. In all honesty at the moment I am in a tight spot - I was a high school drop out with a GED and getting into a bigger named College most likely won't happen for me. 

Currently the University I am looking doesn't have a CS degree but does have a few other options in the technical field. I, in all honestly want to be a developer and want to figure out what degree path would be right for me. 

I have worked with a bit of web design (HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS) but don't really have the greatest creative eye for things (though I can improve that I am sure, I know a good website from a bad one). I have also taken an intro Java class and taught my self a bit on my own, and plan to the rest of this summer and really like the application side of programming.

All in all I just would like a suggestion for which of these degree choices I should peruse. I will link the ones I am considering below.


Also - there is a ""Video Game Design"" degree that I am skeptical about but seems interesting. If someone could provide a bit of insight on that, that would be great. That is a four-year too.

[**Web Information Systems**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/webinfosystems_curr.aspx): I am leading towards this the most, it has some business classes, a lot of programming classes, and has internship possibilities.

[**Information Systems Management**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/ism_curr.aspx)

[**Game Design and Development**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/gamedesign_curr.aspx)


Edit: My final choice is self teaching while getting certifications. Finding another school in my current situation is not possible. "

The situation I am in right now is this: I have been extended an offer for an internship but it is an unpaid internship (basically) and that doesn't really work for me at all, but so far that's the only firm offer I have received. Other places I have talked to are in limbo, [poorly organized; frequently missing scheduled phone interviews or forgetting to reply to emails until much later] but they are offering paying jobs/internships. The advice I am getting from my parents is that I should take this internship for the experience, continue to interview at other places and search for another job, and if I find something paying just immediately leave the non-paying one. 

Now I have frequently read that one of the worst things I can possibly do is  leave a position without giving adequate notice, and I  would be in a situation where I more or less have to do exactly that if I took this unpaid position. 

That is my situation, what should I do?

What do I do?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/279tdo/only_had_a_job_for_three_months_i_need_to_quit/,"I'm an engineering student. I wanted a little money on the side, so I got a part time job. I'm also heavily involved in a design team. Long story short, classes that should have been easy have become hell. My grades are tanking, and with finals in a week, I'm not sure what to do. I go to a school where you have to apply to upper division engineering majors, and all of a sudden, I've gone from a 3.6 student to a 2.5. It is terrible, and I have become so depressed as a result.


The job is fine. It's really boring, but it pays okay and the people are nice. However, when I got the job, there was no talk about required hours per week or length of employment expectations. I figured probably 10 hours a week, flexible. My classes are really hard, and this quarter I am working 14 hours/week. I asked to drop down to 10 midway through the quarter when my grades started getting a hit, and I was basically told no. Now I'm being asked to do 15 next quarter, when I am taking even harder classes than now. They said that if I don't work 15 hours they will have to hire another person. At this point, I want to just tell them to hire a new person entirely because I need to focus on school.


It's only been three months. I don't want to burn any bridges, but I literally have no time to study or enjoy my time in college. There are always people who say ""suck it up, you're getting paid"", but I have no time to enjoy the money anyways. I was lucky enough to get college paid for by a state program, so I don't *need* a job, I just wanted the money. Getting a job was one of the most ill advised decisions I have made during college, and I want to quit. However, I feel as though I can't. What do I do? I am leaving for the summer and doing an internship, but I am supposed to come back in the fall. I don't want to go back.


I'm not an assertive person. Do I talk to them now? Wait and see how I feel after the summer? I have no idea what to do."

I am interested in applying for an IT internship position (April 1st - October 1st 2015) at the Bosch Corporation in Japan.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at the University of Konstanz, Germany, where I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in 2016. During my studies, I have acquired knowledge in programming, theoretical foundations and mathematics. During the “Computer Systems and Networks” class I at my university, I learned about network layers, internet protocols and security in computer networks. In the “Database Systems” lecture, I learned about transaction models and storage methods for databases and used SQL to formulate database queries. In a team with fellow students, I am also currently co-developing a course submission system for university teachers to facilitate the evaluation of assignments handed in by students which uses a MySQL database.

I am skilled in Office Applications as Word, Office and Powerpoint and also have experience working with various operating systems, namely Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, setting up RAID systems as well as using virtual machines to virtualize client and server machines. Furthermore, I have a strong interest in real-time systems, especially avionics and automotives.

I speak English and German fluently. Furthermore, I am very interested in Japanese culture and language. After my visit to Japan in April 2014, I began taking Japanese lessons.

As I will be working in the field of databases, especially database administration and servers, your company would be a good opportunity for me to bring my skills to perfection. I am well-fitted for your program and this position would be ideal for me to apply my computer science skills. I will contact you later to discuss the position further. I look forward to speaking with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

27a1n3,2,2014-06-04,Internship advice needed: A low-ish pay internship in SF or defense company? I'm really at a loss,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27a1n3/internship_advice_needed_a_lowish_pay_internship/,"I was offered $23.50 an hour for a Summer internship at a large tech company in San Francisco (I currently live in Portland so I will have to temporarily relocate) and it seems a bit below what glassdoor and this sub list as average salaries for the area. Is this reasonable for SF? The project seems really interesting and the people I've spoken with seem nice but I'm not sure I can afford the bay area at that rate. Unfortunately, there is no relocation assistance or intern housing provided.  
    
Additionally, I'm sort of having this moral issue with the idea of asking for more pay. Frankly, I don’t think I’m /worth/ the $30-$35+ some might expect from SF internships. I have pretty decent soft skills but my programming ability is lacking quite a bit (all my fault due to lack of practicing but recently have been actively trying to get better). I want to be paid what I am worth but I would like to have enough to afford the exorbitant housing costs, as well as food and possibly stash a little away to put to student loans.  
  
I have another option, a local major defense company is offering a position that could potentially extend in to the school year (I’m an rising senior working towards my BS in CS). If they like my work and I choose to stay on board with them, it is likely they would pay for a clearance of some sort. How valuable is a clearance? I do not have a formal offer yet (although they have verbally said they want to bring me on) as I was initially interviewing for a software engineering position, however, they thought I was a better fit with the R&amp;D department due to my math background.

I am really enjoying this subreddit, but thats the first time I am posting something :)

So I am a Computer Science student and I am going to take part at an internship the next couple of month. Today they told me I am going to need PERL for my project. Unfortunately I never touched PERL, but I am experienced in other languages (C, Java, HTML, JS).

So do you guys know a good place to learn PERL? Thanks in advance! :)"

[Do you know of anyone looking for senior Swift developers? I've 5 years experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyynls?context=5)|I have honestly never heard of a Swift Developer haha. What is that? 
[It's a crummy joke :( Swift is a programming language that was announced by Apple 2 days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyyqcd?context=5)|You slick sonofabitch.
[What's the most unprofessional thing you've seen a professional person do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywag9?context=5)|Oh man, there are so many occasions. One that stands out was at my first recruiting job. In that particular company, it was against policy to date others in the office, like you could lose your job over this. They found out my manager was dating the girl in HR (who was about 20 years younger than him, that baller) and they fired him. She quit 2 days later, but before she left she sent out a mass email to everyone in the company that basically said ""You are all terrible people and when your time comes, god will be the one who judges you. You all have a special place in hell for the terrible things you've done to us"". I had no idea she was nuts, but man that was some weird shit.
 |I also once worked with a guy who I hung out with outside of the office one time with my girlfriend at the time. Apparently he was a huge douche bag and I didn't know it. I went to the bathroom at the club we were at, and apparently while I was gone the guy asked my gf what she was doing with a guy like me, said she should be with a guy like him and asked her if she'd like to come back to his place. She told him to fuck off. We broke up a few months later and he heard about it. He asked me if he could have her number because she's available and my manager told me to take a couple days off because he saw me headed over to his cube to punch him in the face (which I was going to, I was too young to care). One of my friends at work grabbed me and directed me out of the door. In hindsight, I'm glad my coworker stopped me from hurting him. I had been training in MMA at the time and i could have really hurt the guy. The dude was rich and would have sued the shit out of me. To this day, I'd still like to drop him.
[Twist:  OP gives example of himself as professional acting unprofessional in workplace.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzyfi?context=5)|You got me. 
[*In that particular company, it was against policy to date others in the office, like you could lose your job over this.*  That's a bit draconian isn't it? I know it can be awkward if people split up and have to work together but that's their problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz12lk?context=5)|Yeah I thought it was ridiculous. It's the only company I've worked for who had that policy. 
[Why was only the guy fired? I'm sure she was dating him just as much as he was dating her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz25v5?context=5)|He left so she could keep her job. He assumed all responsibility. She left on her own terms.
[Everyone has someone in their office they would like to punch in the face.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz18eq?context=5)|Not in my office. Which is the first time in my life I can say that.
[You must be 'that guy' then. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz26pn?context=5)|Shit, I didn't even think about that. Now I'm paranoid.
[What constitutes a good cover letter? Do I need to include everything mentioned in the job offer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|A cover letter actually is pretty uncommon later in your career. I usually see these for people just getting started. You don't need to include everything in the job description, just write your experience and what would make you a valuable asset to the company.
[If a job asks for experience I don't have, should I still apply or do I go directly on the reject file?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|Still apply. There are some things that you might have, and the things you don't they can easily train you on. 
[I assume it's really bad to lie on your CV. Do you have a story about someone who made an outrageous claim on his CV and got caught out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|Yeah, don't lie on your resume. No one likes dishonest people, especially in the work place. No crazy stories, but I have seen it happen.
[Is there a tactic to play hard to get on an interview, saying you're not sure if you'd actually take the job? Or is that just plain stupid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|In an interview you can say something along the lines of ""I'm really interested in this position, but there are a couple others I'm looking at as well"". 
[Is it good to try to do some small talk with the interviewer before/after (because I will most likely be working with them\) or should I keep it professional?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|Yes, absolutely make friends with the interviewer. This is beyond important, especially if you're new in your field. A lot of managers will hire you based on personality. If they think you would be a great person to work with, they can train you on everything else. I always tell everyone, go in there and make friends with the person. If they really like you but you don't fit the job, they'll remember you when something comes along that you are a fit for. I've seen this happen more times than I can count. 
[Do people still ask the crazy questions like ""How many golfballs would you need to fill a bus?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|No I've never heard any crazy questions like that. I had one lady in an interview ask me when i'm sitting at a red light, do I look at the other light to see when it turns red so I can go as soon as the other one turns green. But that was a good question. She was trying to judge my level of patience.
[Please explain ""technical"" recruiter. What is a ""technical"" career field? I only ask because I'm finishing up 11 years active Army service in logistics, and looking for a new career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyx456?context=5)|I basically hire people in the information technology field. Software Engineers, Network Engineers, Data Admins, etc.
 |11 years in the military with your profession, I think you shouldn't have a problem finding a job. Companies seem to hire ex military over civilians.
[Audio engineers? Need one? It says engineer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0pbg?context=5)|I don't need one, but there are a lot of positions out there for them.
[I'm relocating from the D.C area right now to head back to Michigan. Any tips, tricks or such. What should I be prepared for? If you don't mind me asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyx8wg?context=5)|Get your resume out there ASAP and create profiles on websites like Monster and Careerbuilder. Also, try indeed.com. It's a great job board that pulls every job posted from every job board when you do your search. Also, make sure you have a detailed linkedin account. Believe it or not, people do check those things. Good luck!
 |Also, find local staffing companies to the area and reach out to at least one recruiter at each one and stay in touch with them. You never know when they'll have a job pop up that fits your background. It's good to establish a relationship with them. Most recruiters, good ones at least, genuinely want to help you find something. It gives us great pleasure when we make someone happy finding them a job.
[Wish it worked out that way for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4rve?context=5)|:( I'm sorry, man. Don't give up though, seriously. If you want something, don't stop going after it until you get it. Unless it's a girl who's not interested. That'll just get you a restraining order.
[By technical I usually think draftsmen, assemblers, builders, engineers etc. The more mechanical side of things. Having a degree in product design I see less demand for physical development as opposed to electronic development. The times are a changing I guess.  Is there demand for designers or engineers these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzszd?context=5)|I'm really not sure. By technical I mean software engineers, data architects and things like that. When you hear IT (Information Technology) that's usually the type of positions they're referring to. I know physical development isn't in AS high of demand as electronic development, you're right about that.
[Any thing for Air Traffic Control Specialists? The FAA ain't biting BECAUSE I have experience. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz11m4?context=5)|No unfortunately not :( 
[I currently work for one of the largest government contractors in the US as well! Is the system ""it's all about who you know"" the only way to get noticed? What would increase my chances of getting an interview if I know no one in company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywyg3?context=5)|No, once you reach a certain point it's not ALL about who you know, but it certainly helps. What I would do is try to find the specific people hiring for the job you're interested in, try to find their email or linkedin account and email them directly. I would definitely make sure you have a very well written resume. If you're completely unsure how to write a resume, contact and pay someone to write it for you. It's definitely worth the investment. A resume is the strongest first impression you're going to make.
[What's the most common mistake you've seen job-seekers make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywyd5?context=5)|Well one of the biggest ones is having a sloppy resume. You have to have a good looking resume to grab someones eye. It shows your attention to detail and willingness to do something the right way and take pride in your work.
 |Also, acting desperate in an interview. Never say ""I just need a job"" or anything to that affect. Some managers will understand, but most will take it as ""this person will say anything just to get a job and could be lying"". Be confident in your skills and work ethic. Act interested in the job, but don't act desperate. You should be there to interview the hiring manager just as much as they're interviewing you. A good manager will appreciate that.
[Thanks for the response. Are there any other red flags that you often see that most job-seekers don't really understand are negative? And just for kicks, what are some of the worst flubs you've ever seen people make as they look for work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxfwy?context=5)|Some people are just weird to be honest haha. That or they have a negative attitude. Go in with a positive attitude. No one wants to work with an asshole.
 |I haven't come across any major flubs, but I have been conducting a technical phone screen with someone and after a question they would say ""ummm, uuuh, uuum"" while I could hear them typing because they were trying to look up the answer. I call them out every time and usually get off the phone with them pretty quick.
[Can I show you my resume and have you look over it? I am having lots of trouble finding a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0buz?context=5)|Because of the contract I work on, I honestly have to remain anonymous on here. However, I would definitely contact a recruiter and ask them for recommendations. There should be a ton of recruiters around. Also, you can pay someone to write your resume for you to make it look really good. Sorry I can't be of more help :(
[What's the job market really like for technical professionals, from your perspective?  Do you recruit engineers for remote work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywufy?context=5)|It really depends on where you live. In the DC metro area, it's booming pretty well. I don't know about the rest of the country and I also don't see a lot of remote work for engineers. At least not on the contract I work on.
[Quantico is a hotbed right now, I just got an offer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz00i8?context=5)|Quantico is always a hotbed. Congratulations! I've heard it's a good place to work.
[Hope so, for all I know it's with your company. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz094u?context=5)|It very well could be.
[How has the job market changed over the last nine years? Were there more jobs available nine years ago? Are you getting more qualified applicants than you used to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxhae?context=5)|It's actually kind of hard to tell. Because I'm in the DC metro area, there are always a lot of jobs on government contracts. I'm not sure what the difference is between the private sector then and now. However, 9 years ago, there were definitely a lot more government jobs coming out.
[I work for a smallish govt contractor in the DC area as well! I'm looking to explore positions outside of what I'm doing now (Air Force Sales/Contract Mgmt, etc.\) How hard is it to get in the door of larger Govt Contractors if you don't have a clearance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyz1vt?context=5)|Um, it kind of depends. If it's a lower level clearance, they'll usually sponsor you. If you already have a clearance, they'll usually sponsor you there as well to up the level of your clearance. However, if you don't have a clearance and are looking for a job with a secret or even top secret clearance, 9 times out of 10 the company will sponsor you and get you a clearance. It's ridiculous how easy it is to obtain a secret or TS clearance.
[How likely would someone be to get their secret bumped to ts if they have a DUI conviction in the past year?  (Otherwise good record and credit,etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0yzk?context=5)|Oh, I honestly don't know about that. I would do a google search on the requirements. I think you would be ok.
[What about recent a recent college grad (AS\) that lives on the other side of the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyyw8b?context=5)|That's hard to say. I know it's harder and harder for recent grads to find a new job. All I can say is post your resume everywhere. Monster and careerbuilder are good sites, and indeed.com is a good site to search on. The best advice I can give, put a couple hours into searching each day and network as much as you can. Realistically, it could take a year or longer for you to find a job, just do not give up. Keep looking until you find something. The hardest thing is getting a foot in the door, but once you do, if you do well, you're set. Work something part time just to make some money and keep looking for a full time job and eventually you'll get one. Like my dad always said, just keep doing the foot work.
[During the application process, I've always been conflicted on the ""What's your current salary"" question. Is lying and saying you make more than you do to try to get a better offer frowned upon or expected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyz8nu?context=5)|I've always lied and never had a problem. There is no way for them to find out. If a company asks to see a copy of your W2 to prove it, get up and walk out. That's not a company you want to work for.
[I recently left an agency recruiting job...this was always a tough question to have to ask people...and we did work with companies that asked for it.  On the upside...my current job didn't ask for a W2 and I got double my previous base :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0ka8?context=5)|That's awesome. I did that when I left my last staffing job and transitioned to corporate. About a 40k raise. It's definitely a life changer and a jump I'm glad I made. Congrats to you!
[So I just sent my info to a company that wants to interview me and let them know what my current salary is and then what I want. Its a significant difference. Did I hurt myself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4b0k?context=5)|No I doubt it. If they can't meet what you want, but they still want to hire  you, they'll make you an offer of what they can afford. I see that a lot. Someone making a certain amount and is like ""I want 30k more"". We kind of laugh like ""Jesus, the balls on this guy"", but if he's good we make him the best offer we can. It usually works out for everyone. 
[Ok, yeah they want to fly me out to Herndon for an interview, so I figure they at least want to meet me.  What are some good questions to ask at a post interview?  I know they can train me to the job, I already have the clearances and stuff needed so I am not to worried about it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4wdd?context=5)|Oh wow, congrats. Do you mind if I ask what company? I'm very familiar with Herndon. If they want to spend the money to fly you out, that's a great sign.  One question I ALWAYS ask, and I've never heard anyone ask it before, is ""how do you like working here?"". It seems to catch a manager off guard, but they always seem pleased to answer. It's kind of like an off the record/personal question. Almost every job I've interviewed for, I always try to shoot the shit with the manager. If I can't do that, then it'll be tough to work for them. When I got my job here, I started off with just small talk with the manager. 2 hours later, I realized it was an entire interview about small talk and she didn't ask me any questions about my recruiting background. She liked me so much she hired me an hour later. A lot of managers will hire people based a lot on if they get along with them or not, because you can always train the person.
[You've said you didn't go to college, so am I correct in assuming you don't have a background in the field you're recruiting in? Is that common? I mean, I don't get the impression that most recruiters calling me have a background in mechanical engineering. How does that play into evaluating people? Is there any sort of training about the field you're hiring in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz8ffl?context=5)|I've seen some IT people convert to recruiters but it's rare. I have just learned what technologies go with what skill sets over the years. You could show me java programming on a computer and I would have no idea what I'm looking at. Ask me to find a java developer with a certain set of skills, that I can do. 
[Do you get lot of contacts from outside of your country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxncd?context=5)|Not me personally, but there are a lot of contracts that need people willing to travel outside of the US.
[That's all I apply to, but man, not having a degree is really hurting me. I just want to go back to Afghanistan hah. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0fsx?context=5)|Yeah it's tough sometimes, man. I never went to college, I just got a lucky break and consider myself extremely lucky to have ended up where I did. Just keep working at it and you'll find something.
[Do they tend to be any easier to get? As a single guy, I would be more than happy to travel/live in other places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4vrr?context=5)|Ya know, I'm really not sure. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to travel and relocate.
[Why are so many recruiters so cagey about telling you who the job is for? It drives me nuts because it's always ""an exciting opportunity for someone with your skills that I'd love to discuss with you?"" And then it takes forever to drag out of them that it's a position I've already heard of and rejected, or with a company I wouldn't consider working for.  It seems like such a waste of everyone's time, but they're always so guarded about actually saying a name.  What gives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz5o7j?context=5)|Because they don't want you to go to the company and apply directly. If you do, and they hire you, they don't get any commission. That's one thing I love about corporate recruiting. I can tell you right away who it's with. MEEE!
[Can I guess the company? Boeing? Raytheon? Or those evildoers at Lockheed!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzta0?context=5)|Neither of those 3, but you're close. I still won't say which one it is even if you guess right :)
[Fluor? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1sjv?context=5)|Wut?
[I was guessing which gov contractor you work for.. I'm assuming your response means 'nope, don't work for Fluor' ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1xuu?context=5)|Even if you guess which one I work for, my response will be ""nope, don't work for them"".
[How'd you get a job as a recruiter/ degree in human resoruces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1c6n?context=5)|Nope, never went to college. Extreme luck. Met a guy at the gym who was the VP of a staffing company. Liked me and asked if I would like to give it a try. One of the coolest guys I've ever met.
[What languages do you see the most demand for from a developing standpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0fvs?context=5)|On the contract I work on, Java and Ruby on Rails are in pretty high demand. 
[What is the normal salary for a cleared mid level java developer in the area.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1p6a?context=5)|Generally between 70 to 90k. The higher level guys make around 120k+. 
[But polygraphs are very unreliable. What kind of shady company would demand such a silly thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0fhf?context=5)|Companies that hire people for the government.
[Have you every hired anyone for NSA? And which Universities do you hire from for government contracts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0qvm?context=5)|No, never worked on an NSA contract. We have done job fairs at universities in the area like George Mason and GWU.
[Do you know of anyone hiribg for biotech? Any tips on getting in to the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0887?context=5)|I honestly don't know anything about that one. Sorry :(
[Dyncorp?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0fli?context=5)|In the words of Mark Wahlberg in The Departed ""maybe, maybe not, maybe fuck yourself"". I kid.
[Did a 1 year contract with them in Afghanistan as a Prime Power Plant Operations guy. I know they have a lot of IT positions open right now, as I look at their jobs posted list every now and then. Dyncorp is one of the largest government contractors in the US. It's a pretty likely option. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0yfx?context=5)|Yeah they're huge, but I'll tell you I don't work for them. There are a few companies bigger than mine.
[Two questions: What is your outlook for the cleared DC job market with the ongoing budget cuts?  My clearance is due to re-investigation next year, but I'm finding out the the private sector is 5-6 years ahead of the Fed, making a private sector move more attractive but I'm in DC.  Do you see a lot of openings for people with DevOps backgrounds?  I'm acquiring skills in this area now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz167o?context=5)|I think the fed sector will be ok, at least for the next 10 years or so. It's always up and down, but I don't see it crashing any time soon. At least I hope not.
[I'm a third year CS student and I need advice on deciding what to do over the summer. I have 2 options: My first option is to work over the summer. I've been offered a full time IT Helpdesk/Web position at my school for 3 months. There's a possibility that the position would extend throughout the school year if the department can get the funding. I would be responsible for: maintaining web applications, migrating static websites to Drupal, providing help desk support, and migrating 4-5 databases into a centralized database. The other option is that I take Java courses and a Mobile Development for Android course at my local community college. So my question is: What should I do? Money isn't an issue for me; I'm more interested in getting experience. Would this position be helpful for a CS student? Would having a job look better for recruiters than taking an Android development class? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chzi8uz?context=5)|Personally, I would go for the java and mobile development class. Those will be much more sought after skills in the future. I think we've only seen the tip of what mobile devices can do. Get in there early. Good luck!
 |Also the job experience would be good too, but if it were me, I would take the classes. Developers are always needed. 
[I just got a masters in International Affairs and National Security in DC but I am studying for my CompTIA A+ certification and hoping to go and finish the Network+ and Security+ certs. After that I was looking at some SANS certifications as well. I am really hoping to get into cyber seeing how that's the booming industry both in the public and private sector and my lack of hard skills like a language.  My question is how much will these certifications help and what are some good ways to get into the cyber field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzw4u?context=5)|Those certs will actually help a lot. The best thing I can say is just get your resume out there as much as possible. Contact recruiters at technical staffing companies and let them know your situation. Build relationships. That way when you have your certs, you'll be ready to go and they'll already know who you are. I see a lot of people in IT positions that don't have a degree related to IT.
[I'm an Electronics Technician about to get out of the Navy (I worked on airfield communications systems &amp; did micro circuit repair\).  What kind of opportunities are there for me?  I'm completely flexible about where I live and totally willing to travel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzoa6?context=5)|There are quite a few positions out there for people with your skill set and if you're willing to relocate, that's a huge plus. On the contract I'm on, I don't have anything like that, but I don't see you having a problem finding a job.
[Thanks.  I'm a bit nervous about re-entering the civilian workforce and this is pretty reassuring.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyztjl?context=5)|Oh yeah, man, you'll be totally fine. I've found that companies are quicker to hire ex military then they are civilians. I wouldn't worry too much.
[Do you guys usually hire outside of the state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0e4e?context=5)|Not my company specifically no. Because we work with the federal government, most of our stuff is in the DC metro area. However, I have worked for staffing companies and we hired for jobs all over the country.
[Were you he one that hired the people for the healthcare.gov website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1lf4?context=5)|That's insane. I actually was hahaha. In all honesty, it wasn't the companies fault that it went wrong. The government totally fucked that one up. I don't blame the people we hired one bit. 
[Applying for internships, I've been asked what my passions are. I don't really have any. How do I spin that, or do I just be honest and move on?  I'm hoping that question doesn't haunt me for the rest of my job hunting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzk0s?context=5)|You really have no passions or interests? You have to have something you're good at that interests you. 
[Yeah. Learning. Which is why I went back to school as an adult. For some reason it doesn't come off as sincere. One interviewer said ""...anything other than that?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0w9o?context=5)|Be specific about what you enjoy learning about, even if it's something made up. For example, if you just have a huge interest in astrology, tell them things like that interest you and you study them for fun. I would call that a little white lie. Unless the interviewer is huge into astrology, then you're fucked.
[Still being in college, I continue to hear more and more about how technical professions are continuing to grow, very quickly, in demand. Like, 20% growth in a year yada yada yada. How realistic are these claims of growth and how expectant should I be of open positions in the field in, say, 2-3 years? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz7i6t?context=5)|As our technology increases and technology takes over more and more of our everyday lives and how we as individuals and companies operate, the demand will continue to increase. If you're serious about getting into the IT field, definitely start going that route in college. 
[I'll be a senior next year in high school and am looking for an internship in this field. I'll be taking Ap programming and engineering design courses and am looking for something starting around fall. I would love to do something with the government where do you think I should start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz07w0?context=5)|I'm honestly not sure if they hire high school students. I would honestly wait for a year or two into college before trying.
[The swift comment someone made alluded to this...  As a recruiter can you, or do you ever manage employers unrealistic hiring requirements? Things like making 10 years of experience mandatory with a technology that's only been around for 5?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4mlv?context=5)|It's not common, but I've seen it happen. I've had managers request, lets say like you said, 10 years of experience with a technology that's only been around 5 years. I'm usually like ""I've never heard of this"", I look it up only to find out it hasn't been around that long and think ""is this manager an idiot"". If you're familiar with upper management in a lot of places, you'll find the answer is yes more times than not.
[The FBI is currently reconsidering its zero-tolerance policy on marijuana for some of their computer recruits. What is your opinion on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1otg?context=5)|Good. Marijuana should be completely legalized. It's absolutely ridiculous that it's still illegal to fire up a joint and enjoy a movie that would suck if you watched it sober. 
[Any chance you can stop sending me emails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4vh5?context=5)|I don't send mass emails through a system. I make every single one of them personal. My manager, on the other hand, will blast the shit out of people. Blame her haha.
[How should someone who is currently employed but looking for a better opportunity go about doing it? As in, how do you keep your job while dealing with the risk of a prospective employer contacting your current employer as a reference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz101v?context=5)|Well first, you have to give them permission to contact your current employer. If they contact them without getting permission, they could face a lawsuit. In all my years, I've found that it's pretty hard for your current company to find out you're looking. Unless you go change into a suit and walk out of the building at lunch. Then they might be suspicious. 
[How does one not already in a job needing one, get a security clearance that is needed to apply for many jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz12ks?context=5)|You can't, unless you pay for it yourself and it's really expensive. Most companies will sponsor you for a lower level clearance if you don't have one.
[On a scale of one to ten, how hard is it to get a federal job or a job with any government contractors if you have issues with student loans you've let lapse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4udi?context=5)|Damn, I never thought of that and I honestly don't know. I wouldn't imagine too difficult. If you filed for bankruptcy, that's a different story.
[Has your inbox just been overloaded with people asking for your help in getting a job? I mentioned I once worked for an IT government contract firm in a single comment and had 20 messages asking for help getting a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz3om2?context=5)|Yeah it has haha. And I can't give out my contact info. I wish I could help. 
[My husband works for a contractor for the government and we had to move to Arizona.  How can I get that contractor to relocate to Colorado, so we can move back and be happy again? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chze51n?context=5)|That breaks my heart :( I'm so sorry. I wish I had an answer for you. 
[Dumb question: I'm a student, and I've done internships for three years. Would that count as three years of experience?  I'm also in the DC metro area BTW. Falls Church! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1pdb?context=5)|I definitely would, yeah. 
[Since you've done both staffing and corporate recruiting, what would you say are the main difference between the two? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0pat?context=5)|Someone asked this question already and here was my response.
 |In staffing it's a lot more cut throat and commission based jobs are always hard. We had set metrics we had to meet and it was definitely faster paced and a lot more work. I had to interview people before sending them off for an interview, etc. Now all I have to do is call them up, qualify them and find out their salary and then send them to the manager. I don't do any interviewing and I rarely have to negotiate salary. Also, if they get an offer and don't take it, I still make the same amount of money. Nothing pissed me off more than when someone accepted an offer then called the day before to say they took a better offer. It's like someone stealing $2000 out of your wallet. Basically, corporate recruiting is so much less stressful and generally corporate recruiters are more fun to work with.

[Hi Eva - Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA! I’m vaguely obsessed with your Instagram, but it always leaves me wondering: When do you eat the apple?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3gu1?context=5)|I usually eat the apple either at 11 AMish before I get REALLY RAVENOUS FOR LUNCH or around 3 PM as an afternoon snack!
[It's just after 11 AM here on the west coast - I'm going to grab an apple to stave off hunger in your honour :\) thanks for answering!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3r51?context=5)|How do you like them apples? :) Enjoy! 
[Hi Eva- I think you're a great editor with amazing style (and a fantastic Instagram account\). How do you respond to criticism that working in fashion, particularly fashion magazines, is only for the children of the wealthy? Do you do anything to promote the hiring of lower-income prospective editors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3lgy?context=5)|I don't really look for people from a specific income bracket  when I hire. I am looking for articulate people with a palpable sense of drive/hunger/fashion knowledge/LUCKY excitement and capability more than anything else. I am a first-generation American, as are many other staffers here. It's more about what you can bring personality-wise versus what your last name is at LUCKY. 
[I recently graduated college with a degree in Neuroscience, but like you, decided to forgo the science route to pursue my passion in beauty.  I will begin working in product innovation at a large beauty company in a few days and could not be more excited.  However, four years of college has permanently engrained phrases like ""make a difference,"" ""help others,"" and ""make the world a better place"" into my head, and I sometimes worry that my career pursuits are not going to fulfill these lofty pleas.  I am wondering if you ever dealt with this type of crisis, and was hoping you could lend some advice on how to deal with this tug-of-war between wanting to follow dreams of my own and feeling like I need to do something more beneficial for the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3m24?context=5)|Congratulations and applause on your bravery. It's tough to make a change/pivot in that way, I know first-hand. I think there's a way to combine your two passions. There are amazing companies that combine the two—think of brands like Warby Parker, Tom's, Yoobi (a new one), Yes to Carrot, etc. And there are different ways to help people. Sure, fashion isn't curing cancer. But there are so many charities that the industry supports—think of the impact it's had on AIDS awareness, for instance. And think of the way the beauty industry has embraced charities like Dress for Success and Breast Cancer Awareness. I suppose what I'm saying is where there's a will, there's a way. And I know you can do it. 
[Hi from the Birchbox Team, Ms. Chen! We are dying to know—how do you keep up with all of your social media accounts (including talking to all of your fans!\) AND run an insanely successful style magazine? Give us your stamina secrets! xo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mnx?context=5)|Oh, haiii! Nice to see you on reddit, ladies!  Well, honestly, I'm not sure how I do it all but I do? I suppose it helps that I genuinely love social media AND magazines so it doesn't ever really feel like work. And I find time to do both by just being structured about my hours... When I'm in a cab, for instance, that's prime tweeting/Instagram time. When I'm walking down the Lucky hallway, that's prime Instagram-stalking time. Did I say stalking? I meant... savoring :)
[Eva, THINK FAST! You have $100 to spend on a fashion-related object. What do you buy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3ku1?context=5)|On one object? Well, geez, that's a hard question. I'd rather go to ASOS or Topshop and buy many objects: a pouch (use as a wallet or clutch), statement earrings or a cat watch (Charming Charlie has a good one), and a crop-top from Topshop to wear with my high-waisted skirt. The latter is an item I have on this very moment and basically I bought them in every color when I was in London. It was $18!
[Hi Eva! Thanks for having this session! I just want to know, in the industry, is experience (i.e. internships\) or qualifications (Master's degree etc.\) more valued when looking for editorial or writing jobs? Also, thank you for being such a fashion inspiration to us all! &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3j7m?context=5)|Master's Degree: Not so much, although I have one. I got it when I was working at ELLE at the time and wanted to go ""as a hobby"" (that was ill-advised. Craziest 18 months of my life until I got this job at Lucky). It was a good experience though, in terms of learning to write quickly, identify the lede/kicker, etc. And I think if you are dying to go to graduate school, you should. There's something lovely about devoting yourself to learning. I wish I could go back to school still. Maybe for an MBA or Hogwarts.
 |In terms of the best preparation for working at a magazine, it's interning. It's a tough market for interning now as many companies are re-evaluating their programs. I'd advise starting local/small before coming to NYC for an internship.
 |And practice makes perfect. Write, write, write. Even if it's for yourself. You'll discover your voice and POV that way. 
[Hi Eva - who is your favourite up-and-coming designer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mr5?context=5)|Ack, that is an impossible question because there are so many! I have been obsessed with the shoe designer Gianvito Rossi lately—his shoes are SO COMFORTABLE, I can basically jog in them. MSGM makes cool street wear that's in-between luxury-luxury and downtown-cool. Dion Lee I haven't had the pleasure of wearing yet, but I love how modern it is. Trademark is a brand everyone-everyone-everyone at Lucky LOVES and everything is under $500. 
[Hi Eva! I remember seeing the interview you did with Huff Post and reading that it's taken you 10 years to solidify your voice. Did you ever feel like your writing wasn't good enough and wanted to give up? If so, what kept you motivated? Any advice that your mentors passed on to you that helped you along the way? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3vw7?context=5)|I never was, like, ""Oh, I should give up"" but there have definitely been moments where I've been like ""Oh my gosh, I am only three steps above a third grader in terms of coherency."" I think what kept me going is just knowing that it would work out and knowing that the more I write, the better I'd get. That's the light at the end of the tunnel—remember that always. 
[Hi Eva never expected to see you on reddit but while you're here I'll ask away. I credit you for landing a job in the fashion industry. I currently work for a local designer in upstate ny and I'm also a photographer. my longtime boyfriend is encouraging me to move in with him right outside the city which we both think could be a great career move. I'm really nervous because I feel like I have nowhere near the amount if credentials as the people I would be competing with. Do you think there's room for me in the biggest fashion capital and if so what should my next step be??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz49pi?context=5)|Take that leap of faith. It might be tough in the beginning but NYC will likely open more doors for you because there are more opportunities and you'll build a network. It sounds scary but I think you'll find it worth it. 
[I work full-time in social media, but I absolutely love to write and I've written for a few places, it's basically a second job. But, I also need to have time for myself and to enjoy other things so that I don't burn out.  I was wondering, how do you manage to do everything and still have hobbies outside of the office? And, how do you avoid burning out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3wn4?context=5)|Burnout is a hazard for everyone in this day and age when we're connected 24-7-365. I think I stay sane by doing, um, very little on weekends that involve work. I try to save that time for friends and family on the weekends. Also, I try not to do too much at night. And I get—this is where people are going to like, WHAT?!—nine hours of sleep of night on average. Sleep = the secret.
[I am a fan of your Instagram, esp the travel skincare/beauty posts. What are your top travel skin/beauty favs that you can't leave NY without. Also how do you pack ALL of that?! Your toiletry bag is a must to Instagram next HA! Thank you :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3jv6?context=5)|My toiletry bag is pretty impressive, I have to admit. Basically I have several (huge) Ziploc baggies at home of travel products and they're organized by category at home. And when I travel I put what I need in the toiletry bag and when I get home I resort them. Yes, it's a crazy system. So when I travel, I always bring the following: 
 |Makeup wipes.
 |SPF.
 |Ridiculous amounts of body lotion since I have the driest skin in the world.
 |Multi-use products like Nars The Multiple or Benetint.
 |And I often pack products where I'm like 1 inch away from being done with them so that I can toss then while I travel. I don't know why, that makes me super happy. 
[Hi Eva!  Thanks for doing this, and I think you are a great example and leading light in the fashion industry.  However, I wonder how what your feelings are regarding editor gifting?  Do you think it taints the media and information the consumer receives? An example being if you got a new face wash with new Jimmy Choos does that mean that face wash will get into the magazine regardless of its quality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3v1b?context=5)|I think that the editors who cover a product solely based on gifting probably are not exercising their best judgement. At the end of the day, we have to remember the magazine is for the readers/readers' service, not for our own personal closet. Our editors are a smart/sensible/great bunch. I feel Lucky (there's that pun again, sorry) to work with them!
[Hi Eva, how did you get your start in the magazine business? Can you tell us more about your career development from starting in the industry to where you are now as editor in chief of Lucky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3jl8?context=5)|Hi there! This link answers your question, I believe! Feel free to ask followup questions :) [Link to www.businessoffashion.com](http://www.businessoffashion.com/2013/08/the-creative-class-eva-chen-editor-in-chief.html)
[How did your roles at Teen Vogue, ELLE, and other various publications helped you revamp Lucky Magazine? What do you think is the secret to creating awesome content for the publication and coming up with fresh ideas each month? Thanks! xx.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3uez?context=5)|I think life in general is an aggregation of experiences and, of course, working at Teen Vogue and ELLE under great EICs like Amy Astley and Robbie Myers were great experiences. I even think my time as a pre-med student working for 9 embattled months at a law firm were good experiences. Everything teaches you something, if you know to look for the lesson.
 |I think the secret to creating content is listening to the ideas of staff. Lucky is a great collective of stylish minds and I trust them to have some great ideas! And they never disappoint! 
[Hi Eva, I hope you don't mind multiple questions. who are your favorite designers at the moment? And where do you typically get your style inspiration? What made you decide to get into fashion and running a magazine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3rdk?context=5)|Hi there! Part I of your question I tackled earlier but MSGM, Public School, Trademark, and Etre Cecile are a few more of my favorite new lines! I get my style inspiration from so many places: living in NYC and being lucky (excuse the pun) enough to travel, my coworkers at Lucky have next level style, and Instagram! I love seeing what people around the world—whether I know them or not—are inspired by.
 |In terms of what made me decide to run a magazine... That wasn't really something I actively sought out, actually. I always sort of just worked hard/my best at what I was doing, whether it was beauty director at Teen Vogue (where Amy Astley the EIC there was a huge mentor) or a freelance writer, and just sort of assumed that things would work out and I'd be happy. I suppose I'm an optimist that way. I never thought I'd be in this position and am so grateful every day to have it. 
[Any general advice for Asian-American women aspiring to be successful in industries such as fashion/entertainment/etc.? Thanks for doing this AMA! You're an inspiration. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3lod?context=5)|SPEAK UP, DON'T UPTALK, AND BE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL! 
[Hi eva! how does it feel to be not only one of the youngest, but also the first asian-american editor-in-chief of a well-known fashion magazine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p68?context=5)|It was very surreal in the beginning, to be honest. There were moments at fashion shows when I'd ask myself (in my mind, not out loud... not to sound crazy:)) ""What am *I* doing here?"" But I've gotten a bit used to it by now and, TBH, it's still pretty amazing/surreal. I would love for there to be more Asian-Americans in media/magazines. I'm involved with the AAJA. And I'm not the only one—there's also Janice Min and Joyce Chang. But hopefully more more more to come.  And I know these are not fashion but every woman needs a great concealer (sigh). 
[Also, what are some classic pieces of clothing that every woman should have in her wardrobe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p68?context=5)|And every woman should have these things in their closet:  *a ""gee-whiz-I-look-great"" dress that makes you feel like a million dollars. One that you can wear to the office and to a wedding, with the right accessories *a pair of high heels you can actually walk in that you can wear to the same events above. I'd suggest a classic pointy-toed pump or a minimalist sandal like Stuart Weitzman's Nudist.
[Eva, daaarling, (your name just lends itself to that phrasing\) whats your favorite thing about your new(ish\) role as EIC???  Happy editing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3nmz?context=5)|Hello, darrrling (that is fun to type, you're right). Hmm, there are many, many things I love about my job but honestly nothing has been more satisfying than working with the stellar team at Lucky to make the changes to the magazine. Lucky is a magazine that I so loved when it launched and bringing a new perspective of street style and personal style to the magazine has been really gratifying. Every letter I get from a new reader basically is a testament to the team we work with—the photographers, stylists, models, editors... Go, Team Lucky!
[Hi Eva. What do you think makes a fantastic fashion writing? And who are your favorite fashion writers/critics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3hmm?context=5)|I love it when people have original voices and opinions and they're not just, like, reporting on what happened in a straight-forward newsticker way. My favorite fashion writers include Robin Givhan, Cathy Horyn, Leandra Medine, and Imran from Business of Fashion. And, honestly, I love following people on Twitter as well to get a sense of their personality! I've discovered some great potential talent that way. 
[I'd love to hear in your words, what do you think distinguishes Lucky from other magazines in this vertical? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3nqf?context=5)|Well, the new Lucky has a focus on street style and personal style. When Lucky launched, the great Kim France created a magazine like nothing else in the US. It basically had a great, crazy-comprehensive sweeping view of products. Say there was a story about the best shoes of the season. There would be 100 pairs of shoes on a page and—wow—I remember looking at it and being like ""yes, please."" The difference these days is that e-commerce exists and when you want to see eye candy of 100 pairs of shoes, you go to Shopbop or Amazon.com/fashion and type in ""shoes"". So what we are trying to do differently is: A) curate and be specific about what we love.  B) have a voice. Be down to earth. Editors have had an ivory-tower sort of feeling to them for decades. Lucky editors are NOT this way. We're the ones that you can talk to at a cocktail party and ask ""Hey, where's that top from? C) we have a sense of humor (I guess that's sort of similar to B) D) place a premium on personal style. You'll see that in the people we choose for covers, you'll see that on our pages.
 |I could go on and on on this topic but 100+ questions to answer... :)
[Hi eva! Huge fan of your instagram and twitter feed :\) always look forward to your fashion week posts too! Just wanted to ask.. what was the first luxury item you bought yourself and do you still use it? Also whats your favorite spot for bubble tea in NYC? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3yxy?context=5)|Kung Fu Tea is my favorite! And the first luxury item I ever bought for myself was a Gucci (it was the 2000) bucket hat. I actually ended up losing that hat when I was studying abroad in England and one of the signs that my husband was a keeper is that he literally retraced my steps to find the hat for me (and found it). He will probably be embarrassed that I told that story, but there you go. 
[I want to know what you think it takes to be the EIC of a top fashion magazine? What are qualities you see in yourself or your peers that you believe to be paramount to your role as editor in chief? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3xfn?context=5)|I think it takes an ability to listen, manage efficiently, and a great team. The last part is the most important. You are only as strong as your team and if you have a team you trust, you are able to work 1000% better. And I think having an open mind and curiosity are important too! 
[What do you look for when hiring interns? What can I do to stand apart when I am going to apply for my first internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3tm3?context=5)|When hiring interns (although Conde Nast is on an intern hiatus at the moment as they re-evaluate the program), I look for someone who clearly knows/loves Lucky and seems on top of things, professional (it's okay to be a fangirl for the magazine but try to stay calm and collected) and can multi-task. A good attitude is key as well!
[Can you talk about what you’re looking for in an editorial candidate (experience skills, etc.\) and how to ace the hiring process at Lucky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3goo?context=5)|Well, it depends what department you're applying to. Of course, different departments require different skills (ie: art/graphic design, fashion/a knowledge and love of designers, beauty/a sense of experimentation, etc). But overall, I look for someone with a great passion for communication, efficiency, ability to multi-task, and a sense of humor.
[Hi Eva! Obsessed with Lucky and your fabulous Insta account.  What are some of your favorite jewelry brands under $100? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mnu?context=5)|Oooh, so many! I love CatbirdNYC.com, I just discovered a new line called One Six Five jewelry—I got a great super thin band from them—and I have a chain necklace from Charming Charlie that is major. It looks like a giant ID bracelet. I haven't figured out when I'm wear that yet but I'm biding my time...
[How has the fashion magazine industry changed since the rise of blogging? do you think the two will eventually work together, or will one make the other obsolete? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3w4s?context=5)|I think that the best magazines are ones that react to the times—and I hope to keep Lucky that way. We try to work with bloggers and shoot them often—so far we've shot bloggers like Leandra Medine, Emily Weiss, Tamu McPherson, Nicole Warne, Alexandra Spencer, Hanneli Mustaparta, Phil Oh, Susie Bubble... the list goes on. I see it as a symbiotic relationship, 100%
[Nice to see you on Reddit, Eva! Which fashion trend would you say is the most underrated of 2014 thus far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3no4?context=5)|CULOTTES. MULES. HOBO BAGS. The frumpy ones. And, of course, they're the ones that we love the most at Lucky.
[What are your absolute all-time favorite clothing pieces? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p86?context=5)|I have a Topshop moto jacket I bought almost a decade ago that I still wear all the time. It was black when I bought it and at this point it's basically a blackish-grey hue from being worn so much. I've worn it to black tie galas, I wear it on the weekends, I've worn it in pouring rain... Everywhere! I think I'll have it forever and I'm sure one day, if I ever have a daughter, she will steal if from me. I also love all the Marc Jacobs in my closet. He is one of my favorite designers of all time... I feel like he perfectly captures the energy and spirit of NYC.
[Do you think spending more necessarily means better quality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3n1o?context=5)|There are things in my closet from Zara and Topshop that I love as much as Proenza Schouler and Marc Jacobs. I think it's about looking for things that you think will last and you'll be able to wear for ages. 
[Hi Eva! Page Six reported that Lucky was rumored to be on the chopping block at Conde Nast. Link to pagesix.com What is the long term viability for fashion magazines and is paid content the solution to diminishing circulation numbers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3quj?context=5)|That rumor was a rather silly one, if you ask me, because it came out the same day that a truly storied magazine—Ladies Home Journal—basically did fold. The magazine industry is going through an evolution right now, there's no doubt about that. The reality is that the way people consume media and are entertained is really fragmented these days. Lucky's readers also are on Instagram, reddit, Twitter, Netflix, HBO Go, etc etc... What we as magazine editors have to do is create content you can't get anywhere else. The good thing, though, is that fashion magazines have always provided that—and I think the longterm viability of fashion magazines in particular is great because we are doing exactly that: you won't see a shoot with Candice Swaenpoel and Patrick Demarchelier and Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele just on Instagram. That exists in a magazine in 8 delicious pages and it's something to savor and return to over and over.
 |In terms of paid content, well, magazines have done that in the form of advertorials for decades. It's always been a thing magazines have done. For me, I always just want to make sure it's done in the right way. Luckily, our publishing department/business side does a great job of it. 
[Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz4ie6?context=5)|One horse-sized duck. I'd distract it with stale bread and then capture it then with a lasso made out of adamantium 
[Hey Eva -- beauty PR lady popping in here :\) What's the best way to pitch you and your staff at Lucky, and what are some general tips for how publicists should work with beauty editors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3ojs?context=5)|I would be specific about your pitch, don't blanket the staff with question or email everyone... Know what makes Lucky different from other magazines and what we're looking for. And don't call—email is the best way! The beauty editors are rarely at their desk because they're out at events or desksides or out and about... so email email email! 
[Hi Eva, I love that you make time for reading on the weekends! What are the top 3 books you've read in the last few years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3su3?context=5)|I love the Miss Peregrine series, Art of Fielding was really good (was not expecting to like a book about BASEBALL), and I keep trying to read the JJ Abrams book but, oh boy, it's complicated and bits keep falling out. I use the hashtag #Saturdaybookclub on Instagram so you can follow along there! 
[How would you describe your own personal sense of style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mmp?context=5)|Evolving and eclectic and constantly inspired by the great city of NYC and Lucky editors!!

[Hi Eva! I know you're a skincare fiend, so have you tried any new items recently that have blown you away? Also, I'm on the hunt for a new clay mask and I'd love a recommendation! Thanks so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3twf?context=5)|I started using a new line called Aurelia Skincare, it's English/organic/lovely and I am obsessed! I think it's only sold on Net-A-Porter. In terms of masks... so many. I just used Jurlique's Herbal Recovery last night. I don't know why I like it so much—maybe it's the little bubbles that burst on the skin that remind me of bubble tea? But it's very refreshing. Just like bubble tea. Darn, now I'm craving bubble tea.

Well, I think most people think of magazine editors and picture, well, The Devil Wears Prada, Ugly Better, 13 Going on 30. Sigh, if only life were that glamorous! There are really fun/cool moments in my life but a lot of my job is sitting in front of my desk with my Warby Parker glasses on editing text, running meetings, making things go smoothly! 
[Hi Eva, I love the work you've done with Lucky so far and I always enjoy seeing you on GMA! Since you have such a big presence in the media/fashion, do you think being Asian American influences or impacts the work you do, if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3xog?context=5)|Being a first-generation American is ingrained in my soul and is a key part of who I am and a big part of what drives me. My parents—immigrants from Taiwan/China—sacrificed so much to give me what I have and I think a lot of my work ethic comes from them. I hope that more Asian youth feel empowered to pursue their dreams—no matter what they are. I work with a group called APEX in NYC to help further that message. 
[My name is Richard Karcher and I am currently a recent graduate that is pursuing a career in the Fashion Industry. I was wondering what are the crucial steps that I should be taking to land my first full-time job in this highly competitive industry?  Thank you so much for your insight! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3w7b?context=5)|Research, research, research. Don't apply to jobs blindly, think about the places that you would truly be a good fit. Ask for informational interviews. Remember that for every 10 people you email, MAYBE one or two will write back. (Try to) Develop a thick skin. Be patient. And reach out to your school/alumni office to try to find people who might be able to give you an ""in"" into the industry. And if that doesn't work... make your own way. 
[Good afternoon, Eva! I'm curious, how tall are you? I'm guessing pretty tall since you never look short around models, not even when you're around Karlie Kloss.

[Hi Eva! Thank you for doing this AMA!  1- Before having a good interview, how does one GET the interview? I've found this is one of the hardest parts. I don't have the resources or time to intern for free but am dying for the chance to prove myself in an entry/mid level position.  2- What is the most important part of an outfit?  3- When you go to fashion events, who is one person you always look forward to seeing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz49xs?context=5)|1) One gets the interview by being persistent and really reaching out to every single person in your network. Your mom's sister's best friend's cousin's dogwalker's hairdressers exboyfriend's sister. That person could work in the industry and give you your big break. You never know. And fortune really favors the bold, so reach out to people out of the blue too. Make your own connections. 1.5) You will likely need to start form the entry level, it is very hard to get a midlevel job without having done the entry level one. 2) The most important part of an outfit is your attitude ;) 3) I always look forward to seeing my husband when I go home. But outside of that, I love seeing Leandra Medine, Karlie Kloss, Liu Wen, Tamu McPherson, and Wendy Nguyen.

I'm a student in D.C. and I was wondering do you ever think about moving to another city other than New York such as London, Tokyo or Los Angeles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz473w?context=5)|I lived in Los Angeles for a hot minute last year when my husband was working on a big project. We lived in Venice and it was glorious. As a student, I think NOW is the time for you to take a leap and to try something new. Once you settle into a career/city in your late 20s, it's harder to break out of your comfort zone. Go forth and explore now, it will never be something you regret.

Please help.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27bp44/question_from_a_senior_about_in_a_unique_position/,"I'm a current senior who switched from Computer Science the summer after my sophomore year from a BS Biochem. The one thing that concerns me is getting a job after graduation (which is in Spring 2015). In order for me to graduate on time, I've had to take summer classes every summer (including this one) which hasn't allowed me to get an internship during any of my summers since switching and I'm terrified that it's put me in a bad position. I'm trying to get started on making an android/ios app but I'm having a hard time balancing a 9 credits of summer classes with doing a personal project simultaneously. 

I'm wondering what the best course of action would be after I graduate.  Most of my experience is in healthcare and I also did bench research as a biochemistry major. On my resume I've included semester long projects i did for classes but I'm still worried. I was thinking of getting an internship after I graduate rather than a full time job so that I could get the experience I need but, I was afraid that I might be selling myself short if I did so.

My main language is Java but I know some C and MIPS assembly and after I have graduated I will have taken classes in Database systems, software engineering, internet programming, computational theory, algorithms and many other classes. If it helps my GPA is around a 3.3 right now and I attend Stony Brook U (but I still have 2 semesters left).

And I'm wondering whether I should pursue unpaid research as an undergrad, or do paid internships... I feel like doing paid internships instead of unpaid research... So, is there a particular reason where a masters in CS would be helpful to someone? My GPA is pretty good, I guess... I just don't feel like research is my thing...

The building I work inside is very old and small, the stairs are metal and the place doesn't look very clean. Half of the programmers are 40+, and the people I work with don't even have CS degrees. Instead they have ""degrees"" in game development from Digipen. I looked through the code base for the project I'm working on and it seems like half of the code is a mess with hardly any comments. 

I don't really receive any mentorship since it's a small company. No one has really trained me to do anything yet, they just expect me to write code on my own and that's it. I just feel like I chose the wrong place to intern at and it is bothering me.

I am currently merely a lesser Scottish notebook noble, no where near the glorious standing of your fancy shiny sli / cross fire rigs. A fairly good laptop in my eyes 660m, 2.6ghz dual i.5, 8gb RAM and a 320gb 7200rmp hard drive. (Custom build from pcspecialist.co.uk) But frankly i'm getting fed up of living at 30fps.

Although i will be getting the individual parts for my rig of the course of the next few months, just wanted some input if you would be so kind on what ideas i have so far. Planning on spending a fair bit as well. So far these are the components that i'm eyeing up - i'm also aware i'll be able to (and planning) on, find better prices for most of these elsewhere - this more a breakdown of the components than the pricing.

Also planning on adding a 250GB (vague ballpark) SSD for file launching.

Still undecided on the RAM - unsure as to 8gb or 16gb. For a general low down of what i'll be using it for beyond redditing and laughing at console peasants, it will be a cross of gaming - generally source and ESO, however i also play bits and pieces of BF4 (played the rest on PS3 *sorry*) DayZ standalone and CIV 5. Modding the shit of bethesda titles is also a life long dream. However will be getting more AAA graphics intensive games in the future. I also spend time doing light coding in VS - C# mainly as part of my apprenticeship (Kind of UK equivalent of an internship) web development and design work, so CSS, JS and JQuery alongside some fairly heavy photoshop use. Also enjoy using photoshop for image editing both purely graphic based and from my own photography. I also do bits and pieces of 3D modeling in 3DS Max and some video editing also. Planning on making this a dual monitor (1920x1080 most likely) build. Unsure on the MOBO as well, PSU will be dependent on the final build and the power usage. This rig will be developed on in the future as well, currently this is just the base point. Will be looking at possible RAM increases alongside CPU upgrades and GPU addition for SLI. And of course the extra cooling required to keep that set up running nicely. One thing i do want to do is to keep all cooling fan based and to not have to have liquid cooling - nothing particularly against it, just like the idea of managing a good airflow to keep it all regulated than having piping running through my rig. Dedicated CPU fan is going to be part of the base build as well so far.

Any input would be appreciated gents, i quite enjoy bouncing ideas of one another. Although i have a half decent grounding in Hardware fundamentals the majority of you will be far more knowledgeable than myself! 

Impressed if you managed to survive my cirngeworthy grammar and punctuation this far!

I landed an Internship a few months back (which is confusing because I'm full time now with benefits, but still labeled an intern) with a small CRO in their one man IT Dept and that one man being my direct supervisor who runs EVERYTHING. I would like to say I'm an Assistant/Junior Sys Admin (if that's even applicable). My title is IT Intern, but my duties consist of the following and I'm probably missing some things - 

* GPO creation
* Remote deployment to users machines
* Managing the AV (Trend Micro WFBS)
* Checking and performing backups on our Unitrends Unit
* Monitoring network activity
* Resolving Tickets for end users (pc support)
* Active Directory User Management
* Setup and provision all laptops/desktops to Users

With the Active Directory management I create and deactivate all users as well as add them to all of our services such as VPN, VoIP, external sites, etc. I'm from a Desktop/Laptop support and repair background and this is all new to be, but since I've secured a full time position I can only assume I'm doing a good job. Before the whole Desktop/Laptop support I was working in a Datacenter for my first job just dealing with server deployment and hands on support for the software guys, not anything too in depth.

I'm 26, I have no certs, barely any schooling (attended my 1st year last semester) and just wondering what path schooling and Cert wise I should go forward with. Eventually he wants to show me the VMWare side of things and how they work as of now I have a basic understanding. So far I like the position, what I do and the company is a night and day difference from retail pc repair...

Any feedback is appreciated! 

Thanks!"

I've been following this sub for awhile now with the hope of putting myself in the position of being able to move abroad at some point in my life.  I have moved a lot within my life, so I'm not afraid of that.  (Ohio/Georgia/Montana/Texas/Colorado/Texas)  

I'm 25, not married and a senior software developer at my company.  I started out with this particular company when I was 20 as an intern and now have a full software team who has revitalized our software.  Furthermore within my role I have been able to travel across the US and to our headquarters in England.

That opportunity may be coming much sooner than I ever anticipated.  Our company has other locations that I mentioned in the title, but no actual software development resources in Europe.  They are potentially looking to send someone overseas to be the starting point of building a software team in Europe.

My boss has approached me, knowing my affinity for travel, to see if I would be interested in the position.  I told him that I was absolutely 100% interested provided that the position would move me forward professionally and financially.  They are meeting within the week to decide if that is indeed an avenue that they want to pursue and if it is, then I will be the first pick.  He also asked what my location preference would be if I decided to do this.  I said Nuremberg-&gt;Dresden-&gt;Stockholm-&gt;Canterbury.

The reason I'm here is that I obviously have a lot of questions, and I need to speak to someone about it all.  I don't want to tell my family/friends until something actually becomes solid.  

So time for the questions.

1. Has anyone else done this?  What were their regrets/things they wished they knew before doing it?
2. What are some advantages/disadvantages about the various locations?
3. How hard was it meeting new people/friends in the new locations
4. I don't know Swedish or German, but I definitely plan on learning... how much of a hindrance will that be outside of work until I get semi fluent?
5. What are some concessions I should negotiate with my employer?  Extra vacation/flights back to US to see family/etc.
6. What are the tax implications?
7. How should this affect my salary?  I'm currently in the mid 50's with a raise to 65k coming within the month.  
8. I have a German Shepherd, will I have to find a new home for her?
9. What is the transportation situation like?  I am a country boy and have a truck, obviously I would sell it.  Would I need to buy something there?
10.  What are the questions I should be asking?

Any advice/anecdotes are more than welcome.  I understand that very few people might have the answers for all of the above however I am hoping to be able to piece the puzzle together with Reddits help.  :)"

My second internship was counseling inmates and facilitating groups at a house of correction. My third internship was back at the probation office but this time I worked alongside the Chief and supervised the officers.



I now work in a manager's position at a shelter and get paid only a few dollars above minimum wage because I lack experience. They said they would've paid more if I had more experience. I took it because I was desperate for a job at the time.



I do pretty well with money but that is only because I'm supporting myself. But due to student loan payments, I cannot afford to purchase an older car because I can't afford car payments on top of student loans. I'm on a strict budget and sometimes can't afford to go food shopping.



I'm afraid to start out anywhere else because now I feel as if it'll be the same reasoning and I won't get paid enough.

how do they look like? I know Fall 2015 is a little bit overloaded, which class would you move to Summer 2015 if you were I? 
Also, any suggestions for good professors (i.e: the classes that I'll learn much from) will be much appreciated

Thanks !



===============EDIT===========EDIT====================






After reading your comments I feel like I must spend more quarters at UCSD. I'll start out by drafting classes to add to Summer 2016 and FALL 2016 to my schedule (or could be an internship as Moogra2u and necbromancer have pointed out that could be used to fulfill CSE 197). I'll add and change classes as I see fits from your suggestions. Please help me working it out. For now, I'll leave it blank. Additionally: is it possible to attend the commencement or graduation ceremony in Spring 2016 if I still have some, say 4 to 5 upper div. major classes left to complete? I know my friend in Berkeley did that, but I'm not quite sure how many classes exactly did she had left incomplete prior to attending the graduation ceremony. I know I must further confirm with the advisor later, but just in case you have had any friends who did that please leave a comment below

27gq94,2,2014-06-06,Supposed to fly to Seattle for an internship Monday (3 days) and i haven't yet received an itinerary. Is this normal?,yooman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27gq94/supposed_to_fly_to_seattle_for_an_internship/,"I'm starting orientation for an Amazon internship on Tuesday, and I'm supposed to have a flight to Seattle on Monday that I was told would be arranged for me.  I submitted the last of my paperwork weeks ago and they told me I ""may not receive an itinerary right away, as we make travel arrangements through a 3rd party"".  But I've got nothing and the flight is in 3 days.  Not knowing my departure time has spoiled my weekend hiking trip plans, and now I'm just sitting on my hands until I get the email.

I've asked my recruiter and hiring manager, and the general response has been ""we don't have anything yet either, we'll let you know."" I want to email them again but I don't want to bug them too much.  Although I'm starting to get nervous.

Should I be worried?  Or is it normal for company flight arrangements to take up to the last few days to be finalized?

If there was some mistake and I don't get my flight info, I'm going to have to fly myself and ask for reimbursement, which is frankly a little ridiculous.

Edit: made some calls, got this resolved.  Apparently my email address was refusing to receive their emails.  Ugh!"

My name is Randy, I had been working for Goldman Sachs for a while before I got tired of the ~~misogynistic~~ corporate atmosphere and moved to HR.  I recruited for HBO (yes, the one and the only) for a very long time before I realized I could be more successful on my own! In January I split off and it's been like a dream come true!

My nephew in Electrical Engineering (working as an intern for me this summer) mentioned the reddit community enough times for me to become curious -- I've been lurking on his account for about a month.

I have two jobs that might interest some of you:

* one Site Reliability engineering consulting role at HBO
* one sysadmin job at a blooming IT company in Midtown Manhattan

HBO wants folks with previous experience working on high traffic websites and servers

the IT company is small and friendly, and is looking more for a new team-member than just for the skillset. They need someone with experience in MS Exchange, VMWare ESx and a whole bundle of setup, config, troubleshooting etc...

PM me if you are interested! Thanks, /r/sysadmin!"
27gyx0,14,2014-06-06,How to deal with an unrealistic project manager?,internThrowaway1337,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27gyx0/how_to_deal_with_an_unrealistic_project_manager/,"Hi everyone, 
Got some questions about working with an unrealistic project manager....

I'm a non-traditional student (~30 yrs old) who is currently about to graduate with my CS degree and have been working for the past year as an intern at a large hardware/microchip company. Prior to going back to school, I worked in the corporate world for a few years and earned enough money to live on while I was in school.

About 6 months ago I got transfered to a new team/project developing a platform as a service. The project manager/leader of scrumm team seemed like a nice guy when I started, but slowly alot of red flags have been coming up. 

The guy never shows up until 3pm most days, but constantly is scheduling online meetings on our bridge to interrogate us on what we are working on. He claims to follow Agile/Scrumm, however our Daily stand up meetings can run anywhere from 45 min to 1 hour while we listen to him wax philosophical over how great he thinks his user stories are. In addition to long DSU meetings, he also expects us to be able to have at least one feature to demo every afternoon, however this only gives us around 2-3 hours to actually work before we have to demo (unless we work through lunch). He is ALWAYS late for meetings (by at least 20 - 30 minutes) and expects us all to wait around for him to show up. If we don't have anything to demo in the afternoon or are still debugging/testing, he makes us share our screen online and has the rest of the team sit around and debug that one person's code until it works. After he has tied up the whole team for at least an hour or two every afternoon, he gets furious because no one has gotten any work done. His remedy for this is to assign more work and ask for demos to be presented the following morning in our daily stand up..... lol. Also going home everyday is awkward, he feels the need to ask us every night why feel like we can go home around 5:30 or 6 when the work hasn't been done... not cool dude. 

I am not new to development (have been working as a dev for around 3 years now) and have seen how Agile/Scrumm works when used properly. My biggest concern is not being able to deliver for stories, due to not having enough time to work. To be honest, I refuse to take work home since I am already in the office 8-9 hours a day and my pay is capped at 40 hours. However I feel like I can't get anything done because I am always going to meetings or being lectured for not getting my user stories finished on time. The company has made it clear that they will be extending an offer to me once I graduate, and I would love to stay.... just not with this team/project. 

Is there anything that can be done to better my work environment? How can I handle the appearance of underperforming, when a major roadbloack is the leadership in my team?"
27hejj,17,2014-06-06,Hey /r/sysadmin need help with lazy coworker...,elitegamerbros,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/27hejj/hey_rsysadmin_need_help_with_lazy_coworker/,"I am in Intern at a small-midsize company (70 employees) out IT department is only my coworker and myself, and we are managed by my boss who is also the director of marketing so he tends to always be busy. 

Long story short. I, the ""Intern"" (paid), love my job and do my best with every task and even gone above and beyond with tasks outside my job description saving the company lot of time and money by doing things in house (photography and photoshop for product catalog, web design and development, etc...). 

Meanwhile, 90% of the time I turn around to check what my coworker is doing he is watching videos on youtube. He doesn't respond to email requests on a timely manner - he over all just counts down the time till he can leave. 

He has a CIS degree with a minor in programming but I'm sure he can't even build a simple calculator. The first few weeks (we started at the same time) working with him, he asked me for help installing windows 7(he had never done it before), and he revealed to me that his home pc is 7 years old and he never built a pc in his life - he didn't even know what 7.2k (RPM) meant when it came to Hard Drives, I KID YOU NOT. This guy even asked me for help resetting someones password in AD &gt;_&lt;

I am probably looking at salaried full time position soon since my boss just gave me a major web development project which I finished this week, during which he hinted towards us talking about a permanent position. 

Anyways what do I do in this situation? My boss is too busy to realize his incompetency and I don't wanna be a rat but his laziness is beginning to affect my workload. 

Thanks!

TLDR: Lazy coworker in small IT department, is/was clueless about key components of his job. Watches youtube/doesn't do work all day and my boss is too busy to realize it.  

edit: 7200k brain fart

edit 2: Thanks for the great responses guys! This month should be interesting when I try some of your suggestions as I discuss permanent employment."
27hk33,3,2014-06-06,"First Internship Starts Monday, but I'm worried and have a few questions",comicstix,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27hk33/first_internship_starts_monday_but_im_worried_and/,"My first internship ever starts Monday. I'll be working in the IT department doing web development at a local college. I didn't get offers from any of the CS internships I applied to (I'll be a college sophomore next year). So I used my network and obtained this internship. I'm really excited about the job because I love coding and it's SO much better than retail. Just a few things I'm worried about how:

* I'll be the only intern on the development team. The manager hasn't had interns in a long time, but said there are 5 full-time developers and I'll be put with someone to help me. So it isn't a defined internship position. He said he'd give me easy projects at the beginning. I'm worried I'll get lost and drag the team down with questions.

*  They use PHP and mySQL and I've never used either of those languages. Should I try to learn them over the weekend or learn as I go? I've started doing a CodeAcademy course on PHP. I know Java, Python, and Obj-C so it's not too challenging to learn PHP but I've never used databases before.

Also, should I bring my laptop? I was a late addition and there aren't any more cubicles available so I'll most likely be put at a workstation. They use Windows computers and I'm more comfortable on Macs.

Thanks."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I've never been so prepared for an AMA before!  I wanted to tell you guys that you are hands down my favorite band, ever.  I move a lot due to being a part of a military family, but I've still managed to make it to about 6 of your shows over the past 5 years and each time is like getting a little glimpse of home (I'm a South Carolina native\).  So thank y'all for doing what you do and doing it well!  Now for my question: Y'all are often referred to as a Christian or even a Christian rock band.  Is that how you define yourselves?  Or do you try to stay away from labels in general?  Edit: One more question--You guys are absolutely amazing live.  I'm always blown away by your energy and passion.  Where does all of that come from?  And is it ever difficult to get it going after so many years of touring?  Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v3zf?context=5)|First of all, thanks for being a fan.  i'll answer you're second question first.  The energy we put out every night is because we try to experience the show in the way you do.  we know how hard it is to make it out to shows sometimes and what it costs for a ticket.  believe it or not, we talk about that all the time.  we feel like we owe it to you guys and it makes it more fun for us to experience the night with you.  as far as your first question goes, i hesitate to answer because i know how much unnecessary discussion goes into this question about our band, but i'll try.  we've always hated the term ""christian band"" as it pertains to us.  the reason being is that it is very polarizing.  if your a person of faith, you might love it because your proud to call our band one of your own.  if you're not, it's an easy way to write our music off as something you won't like.  to be honest, our beliefs have never allowed us to be comfortable with the latter of those two statements.  the one thing i can promise is that this band is going to be honest, sincere, and vulnerable in our music.  our faith is something that is a very real part of our lives and thus cannot be separated from our music.  bear.

[SETH BOLT - Do you ever get time to go on dates these days? Will you do me the honor and go on a date with me in Dallas before your show?? You met me on 11/01/13(I asked you how tall you were @ SoundCheck\) :\] ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vbfx?context=5)|Hahaha ... I have many-a-friends trying to play match maker, but I don't have much time to go on dates because I'm kinda out of town a lot.
 |I won't have time before the Dallas show because of soundcheck, meet &amp; greets &amp; promo, but maybe I can carve out time for a coffee since you are ""the best single girl in the Midwest""
[How was the transition with a new drummer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v4hq?context=5)|Gonna be honest, the search for a new drummer was pretty tough at first. Our original drummer, Joe Stillwell, is a beast and one of a kind. We held auditions and played with a lot of great drummers, but that didn't work out. - Much to our surprise, Randall Harris, the soft-spoken intern that had been getting us lunch every day while we made THE RECKONING is a monster of a drummer. WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE PLAYED! Crazy how he had been there with us for so long and not once did he show off all his drumming chops... but he knew all the songs VERY well. Which is a good thing because his first gig (ever) was in front of 15,000 ppl. -Seth.
[If you weren't musicians, what would each of you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v4ad?context=5)|In high school, I wanted to be an optometrist. But I would probably be a record producer for other bands. -Seth.

 |Bo.
 |I would be retiring from a career in the canadian football league about now probably.  other than that, i love building things when im at home.  
[What anecdote best describes what you've learned about the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v5x0?context=5)|There are about a million of these.  i will give you a couple.
 |The day the outsiders came out, we played a local tv station in kansas city.  we were top 5 on itunes and feeling good about ourselves.  the news anchor introduced the band as ""need to dream"".   he then proceeded to ask us what it was like growing up in north carolina.  we said it was great of course.  thats when we learned you're never as big as you think you are.
 |The president at one of our agencies has introduced himself to seth about 5 times that i recall.  each time he assures us that we're a ""really big deal"" there.
 |When we signed our record deal and went on the road for the first time, we put 6 people in a van.  every night we would send one person in to the hotel with 40 dollars.  they would tell the clerk, ""this is all we have""  we did this until we found a room.  yes, 6 of us in one room.  if we couldn't find someone to take the deal, we slept in the van.  rock n roll.  bear.
[Congrats on all the success you’ve had, and thank you for putting out an absolutely on-point album yet again. I saw you perform in Atlanta and San Francisco this year, I was blown away by the experience, my face and throat hurt from smiling and singing so hard.  Listening to your albums, your songs seem to progress from songs about love and relationships, to songs about what it means to be happy and your journeys to become the best men you can be. They are upbeat but calm at the same time. Did that change evolve organically or was that a conscious choice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v3an?context=5)|The music always happens to us.  i wish we could say that we always had a grand plan when we start a record, but we're normally sorting out our lives while we're writing.  we honestly don't normally know what kind of record we've made until it's done.  thanks for the question.
[What is the weirdest thing you have ever found in a Green-room? (It can be creepy/gross\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v4qo?context=5)|Unfortunately, lots and lots of amateur drawings of male anatomy. -Seth.

[A couple of technical questions (I'm a gear head\): - Do yall get to crank your amps on stage or do you have to keep the volume pretty low? - I've seen yall using in-ears before, but I see Bear &amp; Bo with them out all the time... do you have your wedges running pretty hot and most use those, are are yall running click and stuff through in-ears?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vaaa?context=5)|I like it loud. The natural breakup of the amp cannot be duplicated by any pedal. however, if the venue is not suited to compensate for our outrageous stage volume :) we adjust and do our best with pedals. We use Tyler amps and they are amazing at reaching the ideal tone and texture without being overbearing volume wise. The rest of the guys all use in ears but we take them out from time to time to get reacclimatized with the audience. I do not use ears anymore, and I am in heaven! you can't beat live music pushing thru the air.

[ I would like to say: huge fan! I first heard you on the P.S. I Love You soundtrack, and I've been hooked ever since! Your new album is amazing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vmqo?context=5)|The lyrics to this record, like most the records have always been about what we're going through. On ""More Time"", the song you first heard, we felt lots of pressure to fulfill the promises we had made to our families about making it in the music industry. (I kept telling them ""soon, I will stop borrowing money from you! :) .. but we were never an overnight success (now we realize that was a blessing in disguise).  These new songs are more about faith because for the first time in a long time, it's all we had because we didn't have each other. We felt alone or we missed home so we wrote about it. For all we knew, we were breaking up. Then, when the turn around happened, we wrote about that too. Faith was the biggest part of that turn around, so we just wrote about that as it happened. It wasn't really planned out.
[My first question is would you say your album Rivers in the Wasteland was more influenced by your faith than your previous albums? It seems to me more of the songs on this album are more openly faith-based than many of your previous albums. If so, what made you choose to go that direction this time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vmqo?context=5)|Yes.
[My second question is... any of you in the market for a wife?

My university, CUNY, runs something called CISDD which sets computer science students in CUNY up with programming/IT-related internships in NYC government departments. I wasn't expecting much, but last week I got an e-mail to come in for an interview. 

The job is a C# software development internship. I've had experience with .NET and so on, so they asked to meet with me today. I wasn't really prepared (I figured they were gonna ask me programming related questions), but I forgot interviewers often ask logic questions, so I spent what time I had going over C#, the concepts of OOP, algorithms, and other programming details instead of the logic questions that I heard about.

After the initial meeting, asking about my experience and programming knowledge, one of the three interviewers asked why manhole covers are round. I hate myself now because I see that it's one of the most common questions asked, but as I said, I had never really prepared myself for an interview as I was never expecting one, so I never bothered to look into these questions. I still feel stupid for not knowing the answer. Initially I said ""because if it was square it would fall through,"" but I now know it wasn't really a proper answer. He pushed on, trying to get me to say more, to break the problem down. My mind was racing, trying to put the pieces together. I was thinking a lot on it, but he wanted me to verbalize it, but I was so busy thinking and when my lines of thought kept leading to dead ends, my brain just kind of shut down. It was made worse by the fact that all three were waiting in silence, watching me, and that only made me stumble and freeze up. I was very embarrassed by it, but fortunately he said let's move on and gave me a sheet of paper with more logic questions on it. He said to answer three out of the six provided, so I did so. Took me about five minutes, but he didn't let me know if I got them right; I believe I did, they were designed to be trick questions, but I'm still dwelling on the manhole cover question. Figure I blew my chance there.

So I guess my question is what do the interviewers think of me now that I completely screwed up the manhole question? Are my chances out the door?

I recently got an internship at a large tech company. It was pretty much a dream job, and I'd spoken to my future boss beforehand about my project. There were a few organization snafus when I first showed up, but now I'm working with my boss. I'm also working with another intern that I interviewed with many months ago.

Our project is supposed to be understanding part of a product, and interacting with customers using qualitative and quantitative surveys to generate a specification for an improvement to the product. We would then spend time implementing that improvement and testing it. 

My fellow intern was here a week before I was and so has a bit of a head start.  Although our boss has implied that he sees us both working here long-term, it seems that my coworker (intern) and I are in some sort of competition. However, it's not that our boss/team is pitting us against one another. It's some sort of interpersonal conflict I can't figure out. 

When I came here, I expected to be putting in more than forty hours a week, but my coworker stays until 9 or 10 PM (or even later) working on portions of our project. He wants to work on weekends and every moment possible. He also seems to be vying to be the person doing all the work. I work on group projects by splitting the work and then meeting up, combining it and reviewing it. He wants to work on everything together/concurrently, which means that I'm staying at work with him, or driving back to work at odd hours because ""he just decided to tidy a few things up"" and reworked large parts of our survey, etc. 

In addition, he wants to spec out/implement more than one improvement to our product (Our project is to only spec out one improvement as far as I can tell). Our first spec is due next Friday, and he wants to iterate on that one, and get a first draft of the second one done this weekend. I'm not sure if we're going above and beyond, or just killing ourselves here. 

I'm worried that keeping up such a schedule/work pace is going to lead to some serious burn out on my end and somehow cost me my offer. I came here to work hard as well as to explore the area and get to know my fellow interns. I don't like this perceived 

Is this how the tech industry is? Maybe I'm not cut out for it. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: I feel like I'm competing with a coworker and I'm going to burn out soon."

What I **think** I need is a crash course in power flow analysis. However, I don't know how useful that is going to be as the product they're using to make these calculations hasn't openly shared their algorithms, much less give me any ability to adjust them.

Right now, I'm validating calculations based on additional readings special equipment downstream from the substation breaker. So the system estimates values for my downstream equip and I compare them to the values reported. Ultimately, they want to quantify the quality of calculations made down to the transformer based solely on readings from those substation breakers.

At this point I am now giving honest thought to continuing my education and going for my Masters degree in the future, as a way to move to France. I had the wonderful opportunity to live in southwest France for two 4 month stays and both times that I left, I felt myself wanting to find anyway possible to go back. I realize at this point in my life, with limited applicable job experience, I would be a tough sell in a country that has high unemployment, even with a pretty good degree.  

Having researched different options for finding employment in France, it seems the most promising route for me personally would be going for a Masters degree at a University in France. Since I only have an intermediate level of French, I would be looking for programs taught in English. I looked at http://www.campusfrance.org I saw that there are a number of Universities that offer a variety of Master programs for Computer Science taught in English. 

My plan would be to work for a couple years, saving up money. I'm fortunate enough to only have about $10k in student loans that need to be paid off. Once I have saved enough money to make such a endeavor feasible, I’ve made rough estimates of about $20k, I would then begin looking and applying for different opportunities. 

So, If I went to France for a masters program, what would be the odds of being able to get a job once I obtain the degree? During those 1-2 years I imagine that I would be building networks and connections through internships and such. Also, I imagine that I will also have a strong grasp of the language. I realize other countries such as Germany might be more promising in terms of costs and opportunities (should I be considering Germany more so?), I'm not against looking at education options there. I'm just leaning towards France since I truly enjoyed the time I spent there and I have some foundation in the language (and regardless my ultimate goal is moving there). "

One of my parents is American so I don't have any problems with visas or language. What should I focus on to maximize my chances of getting a job in the US with a decent salary? 

I've heard that most foreigners go to the US for a masters and then look for work, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice. I want to be as productive as possible, as I don't really have anything that makes me stand out from the crowd other than winning some small programming contests, but I highly doubt anyone cares about those. I'm also competing in some major contests but my chances of winning are close to zero since my team isn't as well prepared.

If I work on personal projects, would it be better to work on one really big one, or three smaller ones? I love algorithms so I was thinking of making some sort of algorithm visualization tool/game but it would definitely take me the whole year to get something nice done. What kind of projects would really impress a recruiter from a good company? I'm very confident in my CS abilities, both theoretical and practical, and I think the most difficult part for me would be getting the interview and not the interview itself.

I could also try to get some internships, but I'm not sure if I could actually get any, and since I don't have much free time, they would have to be very short and with unknown companies. I could also work for my university, but I think that won't look as good.

Another choice is to try to get into a decent university in the US for my masters. The problem is that since I don't have any research experience and my gpa is around a 3.3 (I'm actually at the top 5% in CS, anything above a 3.5 is nearly impossible), I might not be accepted anywhere decent. Also, it would cost me a LOT of money, and in the end I simply want to get into the private sector so if I could skip this and simply start working, I think it would save me a lot of money unless the degree boosts my long-term earnings by a lot. If I go this route, I would need to look into research opportunities asap, and I wouldn't have time for much else. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice, should I do something else? Or what is my best option?"

	My name is XXXXXXX and I am applying to a full PhD program with the fellowship XXXXXXXXXXX. Operations Research and Probabilistics /Combinatorics  is a field that gives me drive to learn. I believe there are important developments yet to be made in this area and I am looking forward to being a part of it. As the most prominent  scholars studying these topics are located in the USA, there is where I want to go for my PhD.

	 The study of the unknown has been of my interest for long now. In my high school, learning math and science came easy to me. One teacher, acknowledging this, invited me to have advanced classes that covered material not taught in regular classes in a small, selected group. At this moment, I started taking part on math Olympiads, being placed among the 20 best in one year. I remember well when he taught us probabilistics and combinatorics for the first time. When I left, I was thirsty for more. 

 	A couple years later, I started studying Industrial Engineering at XXXXXX. I was lucky enough to have two outstanding professors of Operations Research that revived the same feeling I had that day in high school. They taught me how to solve complex problems with simple, but powerful methods. Still during my undergraduate studies,  I was awarded a scholarship to study Engineering in Nantes, France for one year in 2010. While there, I went after a professor who taught Recherche Operationelle (Operations Research) and asked whether I could attend his classes even though it was not officially part of my accorded class schedule. He agreed and I was able to learn different methods and approaches to problems that were similar to the ones I had seem at XXXXXXXXXXX.
 
	Afterwards, given my high GPA (top 10% of class), I was awarded another scholarship to study during one year at XXXXXXXXXXXXx in 2012. I was so happy to be in such good school I decided to challenge myself taking classes that interested me, disregarding the pre-requisites or the level of them, including courses aimed for Masters in the field of Industrial Engineering, Finance and Math.  Additionally, I took one course that was aimed for second year MBA students, called Experiential Learning Initiative. It was a research based class in which a group of students had to solve a real-life industry problem. My group had to build a model to better predict production order and lot-sizing for a well-known company that manufactures glass bottles. Being the only one with experience in Operations Research, I was defined as the leader of the modeling part. This was of great value to me. The scope was too big to be done in one person, so I had to teach basic concepts to one of the fellow students and organize myself so the others could provide us with meaningful data on a timely manner. There was a lot of pressure since the deadlines were short. Eventually we were able to deliver what was promised and I ended up with an A on my report. That was a true feeling of accomplishment.

	I also think my working experiences, though few, help shape the person who I am today. While in college, I worked as a tutor and a teacher, teaching Analytic Geometry, French and English. I loved it and hope to become a professor someday. I am eager to learn more and develop myself, but  I am just as eager to share what I know. I have also worked as an intern engineer in manufacturing at XXXXXXx and as an intern consultant at XXXXXXXXX, a strategy consultancy. I had a glimpse on how vast the applications for Operations Research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics can be while working for I could apply my knowledge of using math to optimize production lines and to help on the decision-making process. I am currently working as a Trainee forXXXXXXXXXX, a company that manufactures gases for the industrial and healthcare segment. At this moment, I am doing a job rotation to learn how every single area within the company relate to the others and what are the peculiarities of each one of them. This is a very competitive position, having had more than 4500 candidates applying for 10 places.

	Having this background and this experience, I would like to conclude by saying that I am excited to conduct a research in this field. I am confident I am the ideal candidate for a PhD in Operations research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics. The fellowship will cover my expenses so I can fully devote myself to this program.

27ktgj,0,2014-06-07,SOP Operations Research Critic,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/27ktgj/sop_operations_research_critic/,"Please, can someone give thoughts on my SOP below???



My name is XXXXXXX and I am applying to a full PhD program with the fellowship XXXXXXXXXXX. Operations Research and Probabilistics /Combinatorics  is a field that gives me drive to learn. I believe there are important developments yet to be made in this area and I am looking forward to being a part of it. As the most prominent  scholars studying these topics are located in the USA, there is where I want to go for my PhD.

The study of the unknown has been of my interest for long now. In my high school, learning math and science came easy to me. One teacher, acknowledging this, invited me to have advanced classes that covered material not taught in regular classes in a small, selected group. At this moment, I started taking part on math Olympiads, being placed among the 20 best in one year. I remember well when he taught us probabilistics and combinatorics for the first time. When I left, I was thirsty for more. 

 A couple years later, I started studying Industrial Engineering at XXXXXX. I was lucky enough to have two outstanding professors of Operations Research that revived the same feeling I had that day in high school. They taught me how to solve complex problems with simple, but powerful methods. Still during my undergraduate studies,  I was awarded a scholarship to study Engineering in Nantes, France for one year in 2010. While there, I went after a professor who taught Recherche Operationelle (Operations Research) and asked whether I could attend his classes even though it was not officially part of my accorded class schedule. He agreed and I was able to learn different methods and approaches to problems that were similar to the ones I had seem at XXXXXXXXXXX.
 
Afterwards, given my high GPA (top 10% of class), I was awarded another scholarship to study during one year at XXXXXXXXXXXXx in 2012. I was so happy to be in such good school I decided to challenge myself taking classes that interested me, disregarding the pre-requisites or the level of them, including courses aimed for Masters in the field of Industrial Engineering, Finance and Math.  Additionally, I took one course that was aimed for second year MBA students, called Experiential Learning Initiative. It was a research based class in which a group of students had to solve a real-life industry problem. My group had to build a model to better predict production order and lot-sizing for a well-known company that manufactures glass bottles. Being the only one with experience in Operations Research, I was defined as the leader of the modeling part. This was of great value to me. The scope was too big to be done in one person, so I had to teach basic concepts to one of the fellow students and organize myself so the others could provide us with meaningful data on a timely manner. There was a lot of pressure since the deadlines were short. Eventually we were able to deliver what was promised and I ended up with an A on my report. That was a true feeling of accomplishment.

I also think my working experiences, though few, help shape the person who I am today. While in college, I worked as a tutor and a teacher, teaching Analytic Geometry, French and English. I loved it and hope to become a professor someday. I am eager to learn more and develop myself, but  I am just as eager to share what I know. I have also worked as an intern engineer in manufacturing at XXXXXXx and as an intern consultant at XXXXXXXXX, a strategy consultancy. I had a glimpse on how vast the applications for Operations Research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics can be while working for I could apply my knowledge of using math to optimize production lines and to help on the decision-making process. I am currently working as a Trainee forXXXXXXXXXX, a company that manufactures gases for the industrial and healthcare segment. At this moment, I am doing a job rotation to learn how every single area within the company relate to the others and what are the peculiarities of each one of them. This is a very competitive position, having had more than 4500 candidates applying for 10 places.

Having this background and this experience, I would like to conclude by saying that I am excited to conduct a research in this field. I am confident I am the ideal candidate for a PhD in Operations research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics. The fellowship will cover my expenses so I can fully devote myself to this program. Upon my return, I intend to become a recognized professor in my field and develop my country's education by doing world-class research and helping students learn how to face the complex problems they might encounter.

Because of advice I probably shouldn't have listened to regarding a prerequisite, I was only able to take one computer science class, which was just an intro to c++. Prior to college I rarely ever did anything with a computer besides web browsing, so I am feeling a little bit behind. I really enjoyed and did well in my intro to c++ class, but now since classes are over, I would really like to learn more on my own this summer. I have watched some c++ tutorial videos and networking videos, but I was just wondering if there are other topics that I should be looking to learn. Any books that you would recommend, or resources that I could look into. 

Another area that I am concerned about is getting an internship of some sort next year. I have looked at some of the qualifications, and just feel that I wont be able to meet them by next year. What other languages should I learn, and how should I go about learning them. Sorry if I wasn't so clear with everything, I guess its because I am not so sure what I need to be looking into! Thanks for any answers!

I've been researching and learning about SCOM 2012 as you will learn below. But I wanted to field sysadmin for some help since some information I have found is pretty sparse. 

I've been given free reign to setup a SCOM server for a datacenter as part of a project for a short internship. I will be starting with a dev environment to make sure things go well and such. After reviewing a few threads on here and elsewhere, I have come up with a basic idea of how to build and implement the server pool/databases. However, I am unsure of which packs to use or even suggest to the manager in an upcoming meeting I will be having with my suggestion concerning what we need. 

Currently I was planning to use: 

* Windows server 2012 r2 DC edition x2 for server pool

* SQL server for DW and Operational DB. Based on an excel sheet, we have a rough idea as to the necessary storage based on the active agents. 

What I sort of know that they want: 

* 100-150 servers to be monitored, some physical, some virtual.

* Virtual machine management of both hyper v and vmware.

* web console

* reporting server

* application monitoring

Not necessary: 

* No gateway mgmt server is necessary for the network. 

* No network management is desired.

* Currently they are unsure of auditing use, so likely not going to be used.

Does anyone have any tips, suggestions, or warnings I should know? Any suggestions on the best practices for grouping servers together for monitoring? Also, does anyone have any recommendations for packs to use?"

I have a slight dilemma and I'm not sure how to deal with it on my resume, my schooling went:

University A (1 semester, 3.46 GPA)

University B (1 semester, 3.52 GPA)

and finally once I had enough credits for them to let me transfer to the school I wanted to go to,

University C (2 semesters, 2.25 GPA)


and in the fall, I will be returning to University A because I was offered the full ride I had again, and I will be switching from engineering to CS+math.

By the end of the summer, I'll have 1 year of internship (although engineering) experience at a Fortune 500, which I'd like to highlight.  For the place I'm currently at, I was able to rationalize why I did this and get hired.  I just feel it's at the point that I jumped around so many times that it'll be harder, not to mention that my GPA was so low that I'm embarrassed to even have that year on my resume.

I'm rambling at this point, any advice would be appreciated on how I should list my education."

It's an old Dell Latitude E6400 with a slow processor, not much RAM, and worst of all Windows XP.

I asked one of the IT guys at my work about using XP and my huge concerns with security while using it. I'm just an intern, so I don't see large amounts of sensitive information, but I definitely do see some stuff that could hurt the company if it got out. 

I know IT departments get to deal with all kinds of crazy people all day long, so I don't want to be one of those people, but I'm still worried. Should I listen to their opinion since they know more about the system and the network? Or should I push even harder to get either an updated OS or a new computer? Thanks!"

Should I learn Python and go my own way and try to develop apps?

I know a little bit of everything due to Codecademy and I understand the basic principles of programming, but nobody wants to hire someone who only knows the basics of everything. I'm not quite sure if I am suppose to be even focusing on anything other than Systems Analysis and Design and OOL. So what should I be doing?

I have been looking for work in my area, which I'll say is in southwest Florida, searching the job boards. 

I am 28, married with a 1 year old and another on the way. My wife is an RN and is currently the bread winner while I'm looking for work in my field, namely software development.

But there doesn't seem to be any work in my area, at least nothing for Junior Developers. I've been keeping an eye open the last few months but the same companies are still looking for Senior Developers. The couple of companies that have had positions open for Junior Developers have had my resume for a couple months now and I've only heard from one in which I got the screening interview and was told I would get my technical interview but that was nearly a month ago and haven't heard from them since.

Should I be willing to relocate on my own to a larger city for the sake of finding work, flying or driving back home occasionally until my family can join me in the new city? Or am I being impatient and need to keep looking in my area? Our long term goal is to move to a larger city like Raleigh, NC anyway.

I worked a couple of part time jobs through college to help pay the bills, but was never able to land an internship and I fear that may also be affecting my ability to find work. 

Overall I feel like the pressure to find work quickly may be affecting my judgement and making my overly anxious. 

Any advice?

-Brief background-  
(Copied from old post)  
I work in a software company as the Head of Support for the APAC region. Mostly we deal with support tickets from our clients regarding our software but occasionally we get some internal tickets for general support.  
  
Normally Satisfied Customer (NSC): A bubbly lady in her 30s that is generally pretty happy with how the system works  
  
-The Story-  
Returning to the office after a quick trip to the coffee shop I notice a bright pink post it note on my screen.    
&gt;NSC called for you. Something about her iPad version not downloading. Seemed a little mad -Intern
Very informative... our iPad application has had some issues downloading in the past but NSC's version has been working flawlessly for months at this point, definitely odd. I decide to get as much information from the intern who took the message as I can before calling her back.  
&gt;Me: Hi Intern, did you have anymore information for me regarding NSC's call?  
&gt; Intern: Oh Hide, only that she's very angry for some reason and I can't reproduce the issue.  
She shows me her iPad, I check the version number on our application and it is NSCs companies' version. Very odd.    
&gt; Me: Did you do a clean install for this version?  
&gt;Intern: {Other Intern} passed me this iPad and it was already on there. He said it was from this morning when he was doing testing.  
I wish they'd just say no. I finish up with Intern and take the iPad back to my desk.   
Alright lets do a quick test. Delete the iPad application, navigate to NSC's installer page, click the download button and... Error, Unable to download this application at this time. Well da1mn, the client IS always right.  
Flummoxed as to how a page that has been working flawlessly for months suddenly breaks I begin my investigation. Modified date of the installer page? Months ago. Hmm. Link within the installer page? Pointing to the right place. Maybe the FTP server where the file is hosted is down? That's a troubling thought, if it was I'd spend the rest of the day putting out fires. I ping the server and get a response, phew.  
Next step is to Remote in, navigate to where the .ipa file is and... it's gone. I look at it in disbelief. somebody actually  deleted the file from the FTP in the last few hours. I asked around but no body was owning up to the mistake. Ah well easy enough fix. I restore the file and retest, download begins and installs successfully.  
Time to call my possibly furious client.  
&gt; Me: Hi NSC, it's Hide from {Company Name} how are you?  
&gt; NSC: Hi Hide! I am doing extremely well, did you here we passed our audit with flying colours!?  
She continues to chat to me in her normal bubbly tone, didn't Intern say she was furious?  
&gt; NSC: But I suppose we need to talk about the iPad version.  
&gt; Me: Actually I already found a small issue in the installer page. Not sure why it was changed but the URL was pointing to the wrong place. I fixed it and should be working now.  
Please please please.  
&gt;NSC: Excellent! I suppose that is it then. I'll test it an email if I have any further problems.  
Can't help myself.  
&gt;Me: Are there any other issues you need help with? Intern mentioned you were pretty frustrated earlier.  
&gt;NSC: Oh that! She just sounded so nervous on the phone, I couldn't help myself!

It was my first choice college, and I'm glad I came to UT. I came in as a math major because I wasn't accepted into CS with a 3.8. They told me to get my grades up and apply again, so I applied again but with a 3.97 GPA, but was still denied because the department has reached capacity. I can't reapply until Fall 2015. I just finished my freshman year, (19 year old) and I would be almost a junior by the time I applied again, if I got in at all. And it would be the last time I can apply.

I'm looking to apply at UMich, UWashington, UIUC, Cornell, and maybe UCLA for January 2015 too. If I wait to apply for Fall 2015, I can also apply to Berkeley and Caltech too. But those are kind of a longshot. Also, I could apply to UT CS again. And I would have more than 3 weeks to move; I'd have the whole summer. I only mention Michigan in the title, because that seems to be the school I think I could most likely get into.

So I'm left with two options. I can probably transfer to the University of Michigan and major in Computer Science and Mathematics in January 2015. Or I can stay at UT, and be an Electrical and Computer Engineering major and maybe reapply Fall 2015.

Obviously having to move would be a pain. Plus transfer credit would push graduation back a year if I did. But at least I could major in computer science. My career goal was to get degrees in CS and math, then get a CS PhD from a top 10 university in CS, then become a research scientist in industry. I could still get into CS PhD programs with an ECE degree, but I'd prefer to have a CS degree. Luckily UT ECE has a specialization in Software Engineering which is somewhat similar to CS. And the University of Michigan is a great school too! Maybe I could come back to UT for grad school.

As far as jobs go, I wanted to intern at Microsoft, Facebook, Google, NASA JPL, SpaceX, and cool places like that. I'm more interested in programming than the hardware side of things. One thing I do know is that I definitely want to be working in California when I'm done with college. What would better help me achieve those goals? 

Anyway, what should I do?

27pkxd,190,2014-06-09,Why 'consultant' starts with 'con'...,starla79,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/27pkxd/why_consultant_starts_with_con/,"Greetings all... while I'm not an official tech support person, I do a lot of tech support for things that qualify as security tools (MDM, proxy, firewall, etc) because sometimes, pay and quality are inversely proportional.

Years back, shortly after I graduated college, I got my starry-eyed self into a internship with a nicely-sized contracting company that did IT work for a large local company (LLC).  Fortunately, the large company knew how to do security, and had an isolated lab environment they used for testing new technologies and doing pre-deployments of software.  I, along with several other interns, was tasked with assisting the large company in re-wiring the lab with updated ethernet cabling, new switches, the whole nine yards.  Simultaneous to that, my company (via another contract) was also helping LLC beta test some new software my company had produced for them.  

I use the term produced loosely, because we had actually purchased it and then spent considerable time and money customizing it to meet the customer’s needs.  For this particular test deployment, they had a consultant in house that was a SME on the original software to help troubleshoot any problems.  

And of course there were.  There are two types of deployments -- failed ones, and ones you don't realize have failed.

Unfortunately he was pretty stumped by the error messages, and caught our attention by asking if he could email it to his colleagues.

No can do.  Isolated network.  But here’s a floppy (yes, back in those days…).

By this point he’s attracted a gaggle of gawkers, myself included.  Yeah, we were bored, but you would be too if you’d been making cables all day.

He takes a screenshot of the whole screen (not just the error window, mind you), copies it to paint and saves it to disk as a bitmap, and tries to copy to the floppy.

We watch in silence.  We all know there’s no way it’ll fit.

The copy fails.  Too big.  Stumped, he looks around at the LLC employees.  “CD Burner?”  Nope.  Too expensive still to be standard equipment in the lab.

With bated breath we lean in, watching him closely.  Surely this highly paid, senior, technical consultant should be able to solve this problem.  After all, any of us interns could, but speaking up could mean getting labeled a trouble-maker or smart-ass and we all wanted to be permanently hired after the summer.

One of the LLC employees finally got tired of the consultant staring ineffectually at the computer screen and suggested he convert it to a smaller format, say, a jpeg?

His eyes cloud over in confusion. 

Convert?

Convert?

His hand trembling, he mouses over to the file on the computer.  

Convert?

Rusting gears turned in his head.  His thought process seemed almost tangible at that point.  Convert?  Convert like change?  How to change?  Change… change name!

He right-clicks the file, selects “Rename”, deletes the extension and replaces it with .jpg.

Oxygen levels in the room dropped dangerously low as everyone inhaled.  Oh.  No.  He.  Didn’t!

But we couldn’t laugh either.  Too smart-assy.  Definitely not something to do in front of the customer.  LLC employee was already giving us the side-eye.  I think deep down he didn’t want us to ruin it and tell him how to do it, that he wanted to see the consultant fail.

After successfully changing the file extension, Mr. Highly Paid Consultant starts to drag and drop the file to the floppy drive again.  We can hardly contain ourselves.  Schadenfreude begins early in the tech sector.

LLC employee stepped in, breaking the spell.  “I’m sorry but I’m pretty sure that’s not going to work.”  Damn it.  He gives us a look.  “Don’t you guys have work you should be doing?”

Double damn it.  We went back to terminating cables.  White-green, green, white-orange, blue… We may have been stuck building and testing cat5 but for just a minute, just a minute, we were all smarter than the highly paid consultant."

Once I get past month 3 or 4  I want to start applying again. Will me having gotten  this job and having no dev work experience( yes no internships either)  hurt my chances on landing a dev job out of state? Does it look bad having been 6 months out of school?

Also once I start applying, which cities have the most opportunities?"
27pqw2,9,2014-06-09,"Tips for expanding my network in the Electronics, Semiconductor and IT Industries?",Jonas223XC,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/27pqw2/tips_for_expanding_my_network_in_the_electronics/,"Hi /r/engineering 

First, a bit of background about me: I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at a top 50 research University looking to finish up my M.S. at the end of the summer. Naturally, this means that I am actively in the job hunt. 

I've come to the conclusion for a variety of reasons that I would enjoy working in the technology, IT, Electronics, and/or semiconductor industries. I have succeeded in getting a few interviews in these industries (most notably for Hardware/Thermal Design positions at Cisco and HP), and everybody that I have talked with who works in those industries has told me that I am a smart, likable guy who is an all-around great candidate for their company. 

However, for a variety of reasons that seem to be unrelated to my qualifications, these leads have not actually resulted in my Employment (i.e. an available position has been closed to budget restrictions/layoffs or they were unable to find a position that is right for a college grad with my background, etc) . 

The main issue that I have seems to be not with making myself more appealing to employers: while I am not going to act like I am perfect (in fact I am eager to learn all that I can when I enter the working world) I think that I have basically all of the accomplishments that a new college grad should have. All of the ""goodies"" that employers like to see from a new college grad like a 3.7+ Graduate and Undergraduate GPA from a respected school, Months of research experience for my Thesis in a widely applicable field (in my case, that field is Computational Fluid Dynamics), three summers of engineering internship experience, etc I have.

My issue is that, whenever I apply to the companies that I want to work for on their website I rarely if ever get a response. When I do get a chance to actually talk to people about myself and what I do I seem to impress, but getting past the ""automated website"" barrier and on to the ""talking to people"" phase of the hiring process has proven to be difficult.

Most of the interviews that I have succeeded in getting have come from connections that I made from family and friends, and leveraging those connections to get in contact with the right people at those respective companies. Applying on company websites all day and  getting automated rejection emails weeks later is about as depressing as can be. So to avoid doing that further I would like to go about expanding my network, but I am unsure of how exactly to go about doing that. 

So I guess the tl;dr is: how can I go about reaching out to other Engineers and recruiters in these industries? Those of you who are in those industries (or others who have been in a similar position as I have described), how did you get your foot in the door? "

I don't know where to begin.",reprs22,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/27pul8/shut_in_for_over_a_decade_no_friends_or_anyone_to/,"So the title kinda says it all. It'd be too much to explain how I got into this situation but I suppose it all began with depression. School was rough for me because I had severe social anxiety that went undiagnosed and untreated. I was home-schooled and got my diploma early. After that I basically just crawled down into a hole and here I've been since. It's been just over 11 years now.

Over this period of time I've only left my house 5 times. I don't have any friends online or offline, no assets, the only family I have are my 2 parents who are ""functional"" alcoholics who seem try and forget that I'm even in the basement, my daily routine over all these years has been wake up, turn on my PC, and sit there until I go to bed, and to top it all off I live pretty much in the middle of nowhere.

I really don't know what to do. For lack of a better word, I get something called ""planning shock"" when I try to think about steps I need to take to get out of this or ways to improve my life I get a sort of mental block that locks me up, kind of like trying to remember something that isn't quite there. My eyes will roll to the back of my head and it's just nothing.. blank.

Since I don't have any friends or anyone to talk to, I'm really at a loss. I don't know what's out there, what tools are available to me. I'm an adult but I feel like I know just about as much as a 10 year old.

I'm turning to this place for advice. What would you do in my situation? 

I've already tried getting jobs. I've put in hundreds and hundreds of applications for internships and everything but never has anyone followed up. There is nothing around here but farm land and I don't have transportation. 

To be honest I feel completely trapped. "
27pzah,3,2014-06-09,Should I take an internship that wants to classify me as an independent contractor?,ngc_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27pzah/should_i_take_an_internship_that_wants_to/,"I was recently offered an internship in the Bay Area for the rest of the summer. All seemed fine until I started reading through the internship agreement they just emailed me today. Apparently they are wanting to classify me as an ""independent contractor"". I'm guessing this is probably a way of getting around not paying health insurance for short term interns (and saving on some tax fees for them). I'm fine with the no insurance part (I already have insurance), but the rest is starting to look a bit shady.

According to the IRS, an Independent Contractor is:

&gt; If you are an independent contractor, you are self-employed. 
&gt; You are not an independent contractor if you perform services that can be controlled by an employer (what will be done and how it will be done). This applies even if you are given freedom of action. What matters is that the employer has the legal right to control the details of how the services are performed.
&gt; If an employer-employee relationship exists (regardless of what the relationship is called), you are not an independent contractor and your earnings are generally not subject to Self-Employment Tax.

After some research, it seems that every place I've looked says that interns can NOT be classified as independent contractors. A general consensus is that an IC is someone who the company can assign a task and a due date, but has no control over how, where, or when they accomplish it. They are also supposed to supply all of their own resources (computer, etc).

As an IC, they won't withhold taxes, and I'll be subject to self employment taxes, adding up to 15.3%. They're offering $20 an hour, which seems alright, except this is the Bay Area. Having that extra tax requirement is going to make it fairly hard to afford living there even for just the summer, I think.

It just seems rather fishy, and not even legal from everything I've read. Anybody run into this before? Any thoughts? I guess my options are: just take it as is, call them out on it and ask to be classified as an employee (which they probably wouldn't), or ask for about 7.5% more pay to offset my extra tax requirement."

**Why I chose what I bought.**

**4770k** - Was going to go for 4670k, but I stumbled upon a 4770k on sale and I figured it would be useful for video editing and rendering that I do every now and then.

**CLC Over Air** - IMO, CLC's look a lot cleaner, nicer, and prettier than large air coolers. Plus, with the Swiftech fans, the H100i cools my 4770k very nicely.

**8GB of RAM** - At RAM's current prices, I really couldn't afford 16GB. Another 8GB is planned for the future though, to fill up those two extra slots.

**Two SSDs** - I bought the first one a couple years ago when it was on sale at the local Memory Express. Pretty cheap (can't remember exactly what I paid for it) and worth it. Then, a certain friend who will be mentioned later, happened to have an extra. So I picked that up.

**Two HDDs** - Nothing special here. Ran out of space on one, bought another.

**280x** - IMO, this model of 280x looks *insanely* good. It's great. Quiet, cool, and plays all the games I want to on high settings on 1440p.

**EVGA 750W PSU** - On sale at local Memory Express, needed a modular PSU. Gold rated was an extra bonus.

**Windows 8.1 Pro** - I did not pay 250 dollars for this, so don't call me insane. I have it thanks to a very good friend, and owe lots to.

**1440p IPS** - I was running on an old 21.5"" 1080p TN monitor for a year and some, and I really wanted a 1440p monitor. The same friend I mentioned in the SSD section had one for sale, so I picked that up off of him.

**H440** - IMO, this case is very clean, sleek, and stylish. A lot of small but useful things like the screws for the side panel don't completely come off, so you don't drop them and lose them.

**The white, blue, and black theme** - I've always loved the colours white and blue (no, not racist.) and I figured a touch of black would look very nice. As you can see from the album, it does. It turned out amazing, and I hope you agree with me.

***HONOURABLE MENTIONS:***

*/u/Jappetto* - A truly amazing person. I met him just over a year ago, yet he has been a great friend. He helped me with picking parts, finding deals, and other things. He was the friend mentioned in the SSD and monitor section. He also was the one who sleeved the cables for me and helped with the H440. Most of this build is because of him. I could go on forever about him, and I cannot thank him enough.

*/u/AnimalFarmPig* - Another good friend. We became friends when he offered me an internship of sorts with where he worked. Gave me experience in the web development area, and I owe him lots. He was the friend who helped with Windows.

*/u/alok99* - Another great friend. Helped me pick parts out, and helped with personal stuff too. Two words. Hom and butts. ^(Dumb inside jokes, sorry.)

*/u/n0Obpcbuilder* - Another good friend. Love picking on him, but he knows I'm not serious &lt;3

*/u/othtim* - An awesome friend. Helped me learn some basic networking stuff. Always fun to joke with.

*/u/IncendiaryPlatypus* - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

*/u/Firebolt1914* - Cuz he cried.

*/u/filleman123* - For the Swedish snapchats!

*The BaPC IRC* - This is where I met all of these good people. This is where my knowledge began to grow. This is what made this build happen. Some people are nice. Some are douchebags. But I have to thank them.

**And last, but definitely not least, shameless plug to www.homstardware.com!**

Thanks for taking the time to check my build out. Ideas, questions, and constructive criticism are all welcomed."

I've done SOME dabbling outside of school, but nothing substantial and it almost feels like it would be embarrassing to mention it in an interview. Stuff like a flash game (that's half broken and bad, made it after freshman year), going through other peoples' Javascript games to help bugfix (again nothing substantial and nothing documented), and using programs to solve trivial problem's I've had (like finding all valid permutations of letter=number arrangements for a math/crypto puzzle I was trying to solve, or doing crude simulations to find the probability of something because too lazy to math). 

I've also lightly participated in a competitive programming group called Codeburners, but I never went to the meetings and never won any of the competitions (participated in 3, solved 2 problems on average out of 6, though they were made to be difficult so that score was pretty average). 

But yeah, outside of those things, I have NOTHING other than my degree. I felt like it would get me pretty far, but without internships or a portfolio I feel like it'll be impossible. And to add insult to injury, I had to move and stay within the area to keep my sales job, and if I don't get a real job offer by August, I'm going to have to relocate again.

I'm starting to diversify my job search (so far I've primarily searched in one or two cities, though I'm willing to relocate almost anywhere). I just don't know what I can do or what I can say to get a job in the meantime. Are there are resources to help me out? Would you suggest I make something for a portfolio, and if so, what? Would it be too late or a bad idea to go ahead and take on an internship if one was offered somewhere? Should I just BS the hell out of my resume and speed-learn the topics relevant to position before the interview rolls around (something I definitely feel I'm capable of, school definitely prepared me to do that).

I know I'm not the only one who's ever been in this position, so any advice is welcome =)"

I am a senior, and graduating soon. I have a nice internship, but want to pursue some extra education in order to ensure job security. The companies I have been offered jobs/talked with about post bac positions all have some type of tuition match so it wouldn't be so bad to pay for.

In my area, we have two well known CS schools. One offers a masters in CS the other a masters in Software Engineering. 

I was wondering which one of these programs is generally the best for someone who wants to work as lead developer at a large software company?

Also, how important is the school's name for a CS/Software Engineering Masters? One of the schools here is a top 10, the other a top 50. But I've also looked into online programs that may be easier for me to complete.

* BA in Political Science, International Relations, Asian American Studies
* Graduated from a Big Ten School last year
* $55k in student loans, I was reckless with them.
* 2.87 GPA

Other things:

* I intended to go to graduate school for SE Asian Studies and hoped to work in the intelligence field or foreign policy/state department. I thought it was a good career choice because of the ""pivot towards Asia"".
* I spoke with the dean to the graduate program and she really turned me off about it. She seemed to not like me, questioned my academics (I would too if I came to her with a 2.87), and spoke about how the entire program has no funding for me. It simply turned me off, plus I don't want to go into academia.
* I'm joining the National Guard in a few months. I wanted a career as an active duty military officer but missed my chance at ROTC due to some complication. I don't believe my GPA is competitive enough for OCS, and I have a GF that does not like the idea of moving out of state. This is sort of a compromise and I can use the educational benefits to go back to school if I want.
* I have experience only in non-profit and internships at my state's house of rep. I don't want a career in non-profit, at least community based ones. There is no money in it and I do not like working for small, unorganized non-profits that lack good missions (I found out I am a great worker when the mission is something I resonate with). I want to break into maybe corporate, marketing, or government.

I guess what I'm asking is, where do I go? My passions seem to have died and I really just want a job after my NG training that pays decent. I'm focused less on my career and more on money, because, I feel incredibly pressured by my girlfriend, my family, to settle down soon.

27rgje,0,2014-06-10,Engineers more conservative?,Rifter519,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/27rgje/engineers_more_conservative/,"Hello, this is something I have been curious about for quite some time.  

A lot of people have said that engineers typically lean right.  I'm about halfway through engineering college studying computer engineering (physics double major) with plans to get a Master's degree, and this definitely doesn't describe me at all, I lean pretty left both socially and economically.  

I can understand why there'd be a classical conservative/libertarian bent as many engineers are high earners and tend to emphasize efficiency and simplicity (small government), and I've seen a fair few of these in my engineering class, is this what people mean when they say ""engineers are conservative""?  Or do they mean that the majority of engineers are socially conservative as well as fiscally ie against gay marriage, Earth is 6,000 years old and Darwin was a Nazi, Religious Right stuff?  Becuase if that's the case I may need to change majors :P

But I haven't observed the latter case at all among my class or in the engineers I know who are practicing, and only one person at my internship even gave a hint that he was religious.

Is this really the case, and if so, what are the reasons for it?  My own theory is that a conservative religious background could cause scientifically minded students to be more attracted to engineering than the sciences due to science's association with liberalism and atheism, but I haven't done any great research into that.

Simply put, I can't believe (or am not comfortable with believing) that a majority of the people building bridges and nuclear reactors might seriously consider creationism valid science.  

Does the field within engineering have anything to do with it?  I can see why someone working for a defense contractor would lean a bit more to the right since obviously their job depends on a pro-military political climate or why a petroleum engineering working for an energy multinational would be skeptical of climate change, but I can't fathom what might cause electronics or computer engineers to be more socially or religiously conservative than the rest of the population."

How do I sink-or-swim?,narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27rgvo/how_often_should_i_seek_help_with_my_work_how_do/,"I've been working as a junior developer in a small-to-mid sized company for about a month and a half.  Was unemployed for 3 months, lived off my savings, and took this offer.

In the beginning, I was given simple change requests.  Sometimes I'd have to generate SQL reports for higher-ups.  That was easy yet I was learning comfortably.

Now, with the guy who had been there 8 years quitting, unloading some of his responsibilities onto me after a one-day 'data dump', the difficulty increased and I'm lacking resources to learn how to do my job.  This is worsened by us tending to software written in a proprietary language where there's little documentation.  The business jargon and acronyms goes over my head and makes me question why this stuff is complicated.

I don't mind asking for help, but it gets awkward when someone is doing their own work, I'm the one responsible knowing how to do the specific work I'm assigned.  I suppose this is the sink-or-swim situation, and I feel like I'm drowning so shortly in.  I guess I can't figure out how to not be spoonfed.

The pay sucks, and I don't see myself - so far - staying there for 7+ years like the biggest complainers.  A problem is I've only had one real job I was in for 9 months, and a software engineering internship that lasted for 6 months.  I'm 24, and I feel where I work is a drag.

http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24vqz0/computer_science_programming_or_management/

I appreciate the comments they were really helpful. I'm going back to the school were I'm almost finished in graduating but I decided to change my major once I return. I've calculated the credits based on what I took as a Liberal Arts major and it will only take me a year in a half before I graduate(a year if I take Winter and Summer courses that is).

Once I graduate with an associates in CIS I'm thinking of going to a 4 year school to upgrade my education further. I want to know as I'm completing four years what internships should I look for during my end semester timeframe? I like in NY and I don't think my state has a lot in terms of tech based companies(correct me if I'm wrong).

I know California and Texas are more tech-oriented. Once I receive a bachelor's should I stay in NY or move out West or down South? It seems like for a tech based world we live in the U.S. only has two states that are tech-oriented and it's kind of sad.

I'm still deciding on what I should do to make myself more employable. I have limited job experience and once when I return to school, work at my school my resume will build up. In terms of the tech-field what can I do? Should I develop my programming skills, learn how to develop software, volunteer in projects that are computer based?

What is the job environment like for those with a CIS/MIS degree? "

- B.A History (with honors)
- 3.5 GPA
- Honors Thesis/ direct mentorship by Dean of Honors college at my fairly well known university. 

I have numerous ""valued"" skills which are fairly common such as strong research/writing skills, plenty of experience with office suite etc. 

I have previous managerial experience in a food service setting and 5 year work history but it's all been typical minimum wage jobs. 

My major anxiety over the last 2 years has been finding an internship or any office experience at all. Unfortunately my living situation (both area and money) wouldn't allow me a non paid internship and the only paid internship opportunities would be an hour plus commute each way. 

So, even when I approached a temp agency I was politely rejected because they didn't want to waste time on me when they felt I wouldn't be hired for any office positions. 


I'd love any advice on how I could get my foot in the door at an office. At this point it seems like my only chance is to offer to work for free for a few months.

I really need some help.

I have build a pc in may 2013.

Everything turned out pretty good and the pc running good generally. Except when it comes to gaming.
My pc will crash/freeze and the monitor will go black and turn into power save mode. The sound will also be very distorted. I am searching for a long time now but I cannot find out whats wrong.

Some games crash not all. For example, I have played Far Cry 3 and the latest Tomb Raider fine. The strange thing is also that I had run 3D Mark and this will also run fine. At first I thought it might be a driver issue, so I have re installed my whole pc, and updated to the latest drivers with no positive result. I have uninstalled programs/drivers like: Intel rapid storage technology, Intel Smart connect. Tried another PCI-e slot on my mobo. Checked the fans after crashing (still running). Tried to change AMD catalyst control center settings and test. But all without a good result.

I have checked the temps at the moment of crashing using second monitor and the temps looks good (not high).
The event log is giving some errors, but I think this is from holding the power button to turn of the pc. Im starting to think its the PSU but I cannot test this. Or maybe its an SSD issue (according to similar issues) but I do not know what to do anymore.

Here is a summary of all info:

I have placed all settings and errors in an imgur album (with description) :

When I graduated, my GPA was 3.7/5.0, which is around 3/4.

I have 2 years of work experience as a consultant at a well-known tech consultancy, and have done 4 internships at well branded companies during my university (which might account for my poor attention to university work). I also run my own start-up, though it isn't very successful (yet!). I got a decent GMAT score of 720 on my first try.

I hope that the admissions office will take into account the type of grading system used in Singapore, and will also look at my GMAT scores and work ex.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not (technically) in IT, being the only person in my family with any computer knowledge that kept growing after 2005, I'm pretty damn close. 

My dad and I have always had a rather tense relationship when it came to anything computer related (and in general but that's not relevant). Him being an ex-project manager for Ford and me being a compSci major has led to us always being on opposite sides of the problem solving spectrum. Whereas I always took Tech support advice with a grain of salt (and a healthy dose of Google), he would naively believe anything ""John from Massachusetts"" would tell him because they were being paid to know how to fix his problems. This difference has led to quite a few arguments between us with me being too proud to stop arguing my logically sound, cross-referenced side and him promptly ignoring anything that proves me right. 

The real story begins with me getting home from my job to find that my computer refused to connect to the internet. Ever since TWC's ruthless takeover of Insight, our internet has been less that stellar (Insight was not much better but ""better the devil"" you know and all that stuff) but it had never outright dropped off without the phone and cable going out as well. ""That means it's probably a local problem!"" I thought. So off I go downstairs to the tangled router+modem setup by my dad's desk. Being one of those ""age implies experience and knowledge"" types, my dad has very little faith in my technical skills since I had just graduated from high school the previous week. Never mind that I had spent the majority of my senior year working for probably the smartest CompSci teacher in the school district just for the fun of it and now intern at a very successful software development company. I was 18. He was 63. He was obviously smarter and I had no right to mess with his ""perfect"" network setup.

As I approach the router, my dad defensively asks what I'm doing. I tell him the truth of ""I'm just switching the port my ethernet cable is in."" So i unplug it from the router and think ""hmm, my connecting would be better if it was plugged directly into the modem."" So I do just that. About 5 minutes later, I'm back at my desk reading up on the latest AskReddit thread when I hear ""TELHELKI WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO???"" Turns out that wasn't my ethernet cable I had unplugged. It was the ethernet cable that connected the modem with the wireless router.

While fixing this rather simple mistake (under the furious eye of my dad) The power cord for the modem gets snagged on one of the multitude of other cables knotted together. out it comes and down goes our internet. I quickly plug it back in a pray that my *oh so understanding* dad didn't see. Turns out it would have probably been better if he had. With our modem, loss of power means loss of network settings. So dear old dad gets furious and demands that I go upstairs and let him call tech support to fix my mess. 

Another 5 minutes go by while I moniter whats going on with the modem from the safety of my own computer. When everything is done, i realize that the tech support guy had no idea that we had both a modem as well as a wireless router. He had just reconfigured the modem to function as a wireless router on its own while our original router remained untouched with nothing connected to it. Seeing my opening (and knowing what I was doing as this was not my first time messing with our router) I quickly change the settings of the router so it is entirely out of my dad's (very limited) control completely. After another 5 minutes my dad comes up and icily tells me how he had to create an entirely new network because of my fuck-up while I'm sitting there with as straight face as I could possibly maintain. He was clueless to the fact that I now had my own network and he had his. I was now my own man! no more fearing any wrath for forwarding ports or changing settings!

I found the corpse of the author of this journal, in the year 2009, in mid July, as a long dead skeleton in one of the rooms.  The other room was far out of the way, but both held stone tablets with words engraved upon them.  And after years of work to be able to read it properly, I give you this.

From the Journals of John Trask (alias)


January 27, Week 1


Today, I have stumbled upon a massive labyrinth.  It is a beautiful structure, with sections covered in barnacles, other sections obviously covered in some form of coral, as well as a giant section that obviously used to be underwater, with 3 springs within.  And I am stuck here.

Forgive me, whoever reads this, finds my journal.  I mean no insult.  But I do not know why my mentor sent me out here, alone, to deal with this situation.  But I am cold.  I am tired.  And my astral body feels hungry.  The fact that it CAN get hungry, disturbs me on more than one level.  That should be impossible, no, let me be frank.  According to all that I know, it is impossible.  The only reason why it would be so, is if somehow my physical body is HERE and I am not projecting here at all.

God help me if that is true.  God help us all.

I am filled with such utter horror at the thought that if that is true, because if it is, then the Astral Plane has somehow fused, or linked itself to the Physical plane, upon where our mortal bodies reside.  If that is true, then our bodies have all somehow linked to the Astral bodies, which means?  I'm not sure, I honestly cannot say for certain.  But the thoughts chill me to the bone, of what it could possibly mean.

I disgress, however.  I have found no way out but straight upwards, out of this labyrinth, and the way up looks trecherous.  Every inch seems to be covered in horrific, large barnacles.  Ones the size of a large person.  And when I threw a rock at one, the piece that fell down cut through the stone at my feet like a hot knife through butter.

I have, however, saved another.  It looks like it might well be a perfect peace for writing in, if I run out of ink in my pen, or, worse yet, be forced to write this upon stone tablets that I found earlier.

God be willing, I will triumph over this place.  Help me, God, for this place scares me like none other.

Why, oh why, did I listen to my mentor and come here?  Why did he insist that this place needed to be explored, and something within turned off, if the Astral plane was to continue to exist?  And why did he only send me 15 pages of paper and a pen to write in this hellhole?


Week 2


I have explored with more diligence, and found a horrific discovery.  Only one of the water sources is safe to drink.  Another is an acid, which burns even the barnacles like a hot knife through butter, and the final one reeks of sulpher and several other chemicals I cannot identify.  Thankfully, the third water source appears to not only be safe to drink, but somewhat nourishing.  I don't feel or look as horrible as before, as shown from the peculiar moss that lights up the lower sections.

The nature of the water disturbs me, horribly.  And in my disturbance, I have done several tests.  The stones from the main structure appear to be completely unaffected by the acidic and sulpheric water, which explains part of the clean state of things.  However, that suggests a tide of water in this place.  One that moves upwards and downwards.  If that is the case, then the tide must burn anything between it and the barnacles far above, in the roof.

God help me.  God help me, for I have no solace anywhere else.  Oh God, my God, please, in my time of need help me.
I threw a fingernail into the acid.  I threw a FINGERNAIL into the acid.  And I saw it melt as it laid on top.  And then the acid rose up 3 inches.

God help me.  It's slowly increasing up further in the tunnel.  As I run, I write this, shuddering from the light of the moss...?  No, the moss is moving?!
God, help me.  God, help me.


Week 3


I have, since the last writings, transcripted the writings to stone.  And in this central chamber, is the only place of safety.  Since I discovered the tunnels, I have found a more horrible discovery.  The “moss” is much like the fish at the bottom of the ocean, the... what's it's name?  Anglerfish, maybe?  The one with a glowing “worm” dangling in front of it?
I managed to cut off a bit of one, using the last barnacle, and found that the stuff is acidic.  Horribly acidic.  It melts through everything like a hot knife through butter.  Luckily, by the grace of God, I managed to avoid it on me, but it cuts through the stone like a hot knife through butter.  And so, I write upon the stone slabs here of my experiences.

This place is a giant death trap, with some sort of device at the bottom.  What I took to be walls were some sort of giant snake-like leviathan, with thousands of glowing pieces that resemble those Anglerfish.  Most people would carve a little piece off the wall, to keep the inside of the area light up, only to die a horrible death, instead.  And with how the acid sprayed out of the sacks around that one, it appears that the “moss” is a form of a lure for prey to be eaten by it.

Another thing I noticed?  One that is worse?  The acid from the acidic pool is still rising slowly, at the rate of a foot a day.  In 32 days, I will be unable to drink water, and will eventually starve, if I don't perish from dehydration, first.

Even still, I search the tunnels.  Even still, I try to figure out how to get through this place.

God help me.  No one else will, so please, God, help me.


Week 4.


In desperation, I have done much work.  There is less time to write, now.  The light that shines through the overhead tunnel seems to get dark earlier and earlier.

Trace amounts of that “moss” from those leviathans have returned, and I have journeyed towards the bottom of this hellish place.  And at the bottom, I found a massive device, of unknown origins, and several people in what appeared to be Nazi uniforms, all dead.  I stole from them their weapons, and a journal nearby, then returned towards the surface.

It appears that they themselves also found this place.  I'm not sure if it's before, or after, however.  Time seems to flow WEIRD, here.  Not weird as we know, but weird in a more, shall I say, Lovecraftian way?

I do not know much of German, but a teacher I had taught me much of the words for german engineering, while I did an internship under him.  Through my memory of his words, and the notes, they appeared to have done several chemical analysis attempts upon the stone, and the coral like rock.

It appears they were on a breakthrough, but could not bring down any more manpower, from the leviathans that I encountered in the tunnels.  However, they did note this.  The coral counters the sulpheric water completely, and the stone counters the acid water completely, due to something in both's composition.  They noted, however that the water from the third spring rises rapidly when the other two springs are not.

I can see windows from this place, too, showing massive numbers of rather large serpents? with glowing eyes, that look around in watery depths under this place.  With the glowing on their backs, I suppose that they are the Leviathans I worry about.  They much resemble giant eels, or perhaps even Chinese dragons of legend.  Chinese dragons don't have moss like that, though.  None of the legends I read said anything close to that.

In the center was my biggest discovery, though.  Some sort of large cylinder, that had the words “Prototype Reactor” was in the middle of this room, which I now suppose to be at the lowest depths of this massive building I must be in, overlooking the Leviathans in their watery home.

It writes  of being an “Elerium prototype reactor”, whatever Elerium might well be, and has several notices that it powers several substations within this place.  It also notes the liquids inside, and insists that the liquids are gone before I can access it, and gain access to the equipment within.

Perhaps this is what my teacher wrote of?  I must

What was that sound?  It's black out again, but it sounded like something falling!


Week 6


I am in some sort of giant chamber, located in what must be the nesting grounds for the Leviathans.

Pardon my time, it has taken a while for writing in here again.  I had to recover from a broken leg, when that titanic head came down into this place, and tried to crush everything in here, in a vain attempt to find me.  While I hid in the tunnel below, what appeared to be unique carvings on the wall were wiped away, and giant eyes looked in upon the room, with a great many pieces of glowing “moss” slammed against the newly shown windows to illuminate all inside.  After a great deal of time hiding, even with a broken leg, the eyes and “moss” disappeared, and I heard it again below, against the windows.

As time passed since then, I have built a crude shelter in the rubble.  With this, I have come to realize that somehow, the entire building has an equal pressure to the water outside, thus the “moss” on the backs of the serpents in the tunnels, as well as the giant serpents down below.

I suspect these leviathan serpents all use this building as a chamber to hold food captive in.

The more worrying event that happened, after the serpent crashed within, one day a great many of the moss like acid sacks fell through the top of the building, and poured down upon the center of the chamber I usually write in.  Thankfully, I had finished my shelter, and had constructed a well made room.  Unfortunately, almost all of the lower half of the shelter has now melted, leaving only the “roof” as the floor.

The serpents, I believe either know that I am here, or suspect, with my carving away a sack several weeks ago.  It appears they also have some form of intelligence, and prey upon the occupants of this place often.

Even still, one thing has been noticed, that I am blessed by.  A perfect sphere of the stone has been formed by the damage done from the serpents, one that I can use to plug up the stream of acid.  Now, if I can make another for the water that is sulpheric, out of the coral, then I will be able to stop both.  But at what price?

The serpents still hunt for me.  Those leviathans of the deep, scare me beyond words, and occasionally thrust their heads down into the chamber to check for me to see if I live.
Even in this small room I have made, where I carve these words, I fear.  And I fear they watch over the opening above, far above this place, waiting to devour any that might climb out.  That leaves me with only one option.

I must solve the mystery of this place.  I must jam the two holes with a sphere of stone, and a sphere of coral, so water floods this place, faster than the acid the Leviathans emit might hurt me.

I hopefully will find that device my mentor told me about, when I have time, at least, if I can keep out of sight long enough to survive.

God, help me.  You are the only one that listens to me here, in this forsaken place.


Week 7


I have plugged up the acidic spring with a massive boulder of stone, and the Sulpheric one with a massive one of coral.  With that, I now hide while the spring of water fills the rest of this place with water, and the reactor room seals shut.

Soon, I will make my way into 3 tunnels, normally sealed shut from this.  Soon, I will...

I can hear pounding in the upper levels.  Horribly loud pounding.  Like massive drums, only I know for a fact it is not.

I must hide.  But I have noplace to go.  Noplace to run to.

The reactor!  The reactor is opening holes in the walls, to tunnels... and water is pouring in from 3 of them?!

I must rush to the fourth.  I must race to the fourth, and live.  I write this even as I run.

No.  No, no no.  The fourth has the gaping maw of a serpent in front of it.

I have checked the others, and the water rises to my waist, now.  The others are full of broken equipment, and shattered oxygen tanks.  There are no other devices in here.

That means the generator, the reactor is the one thing that I have to shut off.  I will either feed it to the monster, or drown.

It appears, I was wrong.  There is another room, with a broken stairwell above the great serpent's head.

After I throw the small reactor into the serpent's head, I will try to climb into that room.  It looks like there is functional equipment in there, at least for oxygen.

If I do not make it, then I will say this.  My most famous internet alias that I have used is John Trask.  I entered this hellhole on January 27, 2017.  Please, let there be someone out there that will find this.  Publish this.

God, don't let me fail this.



Author's Note:  When I found this corpse, there was no ""moss"" that exhibited lighting.  The only thing that was there was an unlight cavern.  I presume he killed the entire species off with the reactor he threw into the mouth, and noted that the pedastal in the room he claimed the reactor was in, was about the size of a large duffel bag.  Perhaps it was some sort of as of yet unknown reactor, not known to man?

I also could not find any of the other rooms that he had described, while exploring the place, or the massive barnacles, or stone chamber.  Most of the labyrinth was long ruins, broken and destroyed beyond repair.

I've seen more things like this, and there's other tablets from that place.  Would you like me to post that next, nosleep?"

The station does the norm for community broadcasts, they have safety updates, local business stories, and ""fun City facts"".  

I'm trying to brainstorm what I can bring to the station to get it more attention or something. I have a couple ideas for potential shows, but not sure how straight or loose I can play it. 

So the question I pose to Reddit, what would get you to watch local community television station?"

I got hired on full time last month, which was nice as I finally get vacation and other benefits. I'm only getting paid 30k a year, which is rather low but I didn't really have any other options open so I had to take it. The pay itself is just getting me by with me spending most of my money each month on repaying my school loans, but I'd like to be make some more probably doing something else that isn't heavily programming based. The more I work here, the less I enjoy programming but it feels like that's my only skill set now...Every passing week I just feel less and less motivated to get any work done here.

I don't think I could find a decent job for my main interest, video games, as most are programming jobs and I'm not too fond of C++. Another interest of mine is history but I don't even know how a CIS degree would get me a job dealing with that.

I guess my question is, what else is there that a 23 year old can do in the DFW area of Texas with only one year of work experience  and a CIS bachelor's degree?"
27w5a4,2,2014-06-11,Where to go?,beefgaming23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27w5a4/where_to_go/,"First off, hello everyone!

I just have a quick question, but first a little back story.

I graduated with a BS in Applied Computer Science and always coasted through the classes because I did the bare minimum effort. Due to this, my programming skills are lacking severely, however I understand the concepts not implementation.

I did however learn SQL and how databases work pretty well from a teacher who actually knew who what he was talking about (go figure). I really want to pursue this, but I'm not too sure.

Due to this, I always stuck to IT internships, helpdesk, grunt work. Nothing spectactular, but I am good at it. I learn quick and do well under pressure.

Though I am good at help-desk things, I do not see a potential career in this, at least with enough money to pay off loans and make some sort of fund for myself.

So, my questions are this:
What are some of your stories with career choices, what did you do while in college, strengths, weaknesses?
What can I do with IT related work down the road, is the higher level stuff worth it?

I don't want to sound demeaning, I just see the loans coming my way and I want to choose something viable."

27wq9e,2,2014-06-11,CS major vs. CS/stats double major considering possible interest in data science,cs_stats_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27wq9e/cs_major_vs_csstats_double_major_considering/,"I'm an undergraduate student in a North American university, planning to major in CS. I'll be taking mostly second year CS courses next fall. I already have an European bachelor's degree in physics with a CS minor and quite a bit of math/stats courses. Data science, machine learning and the like seem very intriguing to me, since while I love coding, I'm afraid that I'll get bored in a dev job that doesn't involve any math or science. It will be time to declare my major soon and I found out that my school offers double majors, one of them being in CS and stats which would probably serve me well if I did decide to continue on to a master's and/or PhD in something involving data analysis.

The problem is that doing the double major would limit the number of CS courses I get to take, since I don't really have the money to take more courses than are required for a BS. The CS/stats double major would require me to do a total of 13 CS courses and 11 stats courses, leaving room for only a couple of extra CS electives. The other possibility is a honours degree in CS, consisting of 21 CS courses and just one stats course, with a little more wiggle room for the electives (which might as well be stats courses).

Will I be at a disadvantage in the software development job market, if I do the double major and decide not to do a graduate degree (which I realize is required for most real data science jobs) later? I would of course try to get some good internships and personal projects under my belt before I graduate, no matter which major(s) I choose.

Thank you for any responses!"

27x1hr,9,2014-06-11,Is summer internship worth it when it's not exactly in your area of interest?,rui278,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/27x1hr/is_summer_internship_worth_it_when_its_not/,"So, i've got a chance to do an internship, and i'm torn about it.

I'm a computer engineering grad student, about to enter my final year, and i have the chance to do an internship this summer. The thing is, it's not exactly in my area. It's about design validation, while i'd be more interested in the actual design part. What i'm really asking is, it's not really exactly my area, but i feel like it is in the vicinity of it/close to it.

So my question is, do you think internships that are only close to what you want to do, but not exactly, are worth it (and i'd be losing around half my last summer and it's an unpaid internship)

(p.s. i've already done an internship before, but while an undergrad, and was not in my exact area of interest, but was in a big company(though, again not my exact area))

EDIT: I'm from Portugal. In here unpaid internships are kind of the norm around here, so i wouldn't worry too much about that part of the deal. It's a bummer, but a normal bummer. If i'd gone through more trouble i could probably have gotten a paid internship, but i didn't so i just when through my schools internship pool, which is mostly for unpaid stuff... The actual company i'd be working for is actually a multinational and cool, though not exactly in my area..."

[Are you concerned that George R.R. Martin will kill you off?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54tnr?context=5)|Hopefully not until I am able to finish off the very last episode of the show!
[Also, on the back cover of season 2 soundtrack, it says it was recorded in Prague by The Czech Film Orchestra and Choir. Were the other soundtracks also recorded in Prague?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dpn?context=5)|Yes, all those soundtracks are recorded in Prague.
[Do you come to consult or supervise to Prague?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci559wy?context=5)|Oh yes! I connect with them through the internet and am present during the entire session and give comments over the internet. 
[Has George R R Martin spoken to you or commented on your work at all? What does he think of the music? What did he say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54gnn?context=5)|I think he likes the music. We saw each other at the premiere for Season 4 in New York, and I actually thanked him for creating this amazing world of Game of Thrones that I can now paint with music. 
[Hi Mr. Djawadi, I'm a huge fan of the Pacific Rim soundtrack I could listen to whole CD everyday. I was wondering did you and Guillermo del Toro talk during development to discuss how he wanted the score of the movie to sound like or were you given free range? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54lr7?context=5)|Guillermo was a huge influence during the whole process. He's super-creative and he had a very clear vision of how he wanted the score to sound. So everything was discussed, from guitars to big brass to the choirs, and he was very sophisticated with ideas. It was an amazing collaboration. 
[Hi Ramin, I can't thank you enough for giving us the opportunity to interact with you in this AMA, and my question is ... what instrument in your orchestra do you feel best encapsulates the Game of Thrones aura?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54eo0?context=5)|That would be the cello, because that's the instrument you hear in the beginning of the main title and it's very prominent throughout the score.
[Adore your work, and I cannot recommend enough listening to your sountrack while reading the books on long flights ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54eo0?context=5)|And that's great!
[What sound library do you use for that cello sound most often?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55gqu?context=5)|I don't, because it's a real cello. It's all live performances. 
[Did you know anything about Game of Thrones before you were asked to create the theme? What sort of guidance/information were you given by the showrunners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54df9?context=5)|I was approached while the show was still in production. They actually showed me the first two episodes, which were ready, and explained to me the overall approach of the show. And for the main title, they said ""make it like a journey."" That was really the overall comment that they wanted for the main title, just because you see all the locations. So they said it needed to be like a journey. I saw the first 2 episodes, and they just spoke for themselves, I just saw how great this show was and was very excited to be asked to be part of the show. 
[What's the music-making process like in general for GoT?  How collaborative is it?  I mean, do you just watch the raw material and score based off that, or have D+D sat down and outlines specific things they want to hear or do with the music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dac?context=5)|We get together before very episode. We watch it through, then discuss where the music should start and where it should end. Then we discuss what the music should do in every scene. And then I go off and write all the music, and then we meet back again, I play them everything that I've got, and then they give me notes and we make tweaks and then that's it!
[What is your usual inspiration for your music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nqw?context=5)|Silence. I wake up in the morning, and when it's completely quiet, that's when I usually have my ideas. Because there is no other external influence. 
[Hello Mr. Djawadi! Is there a chance we’ll ever hear your unreleased music from GoT? Is it possible you’d release it on your webpage or some other place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dbo?context=5)|I don't know if there is any? There is not, really. Obviously as I write them things get changed, and I talk with the producers and have to make changes, but it's generally pretty much intact based on what's been written. I'm trying to think if I have anything laying around unused and I don't really.
 |It's a collaboration with Dan and David, they are just so good at giving guidance and that's a huge part of it. 
[Ramin! How did you go about composing for such a heavy emotional scene as the Red Wedding? I really felt like you brought us up and down throughout the scene right along with the characters and the dialogue. Is it difficult to compose music for the deaths of such major characters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54hwu?context=5)|Definitely. Especially throughout the show I've gotten attached to a lot of these characters, and then to see them go, and having to underscore the drama of that is definitely hard. Especially because I have to watch the scene over and over again. 
[Is it harder for you to compose music for disturbing scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54l6b?context=5)|Definitely. I mean, because I have to play the scenes over and over again, there's definitely been scenes where it makes it harder if you have to look at the same scenes over and over. 
[Huge fan of the parts of the season 4 soundtrack I've heard so far! We've seen you combine themes and mix and match them such as with the track 'Two Swords'. What two themes would you like to see come together in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54l3a?context=5)|That's a good one. That's tough. The main theme has been combined with so many of these other themes... How about Arya's theme with the Lannister's theme, that could be very interesting. We haven't seen that yet and it would be an interesting ""payback time,"" right? 
[Do you have any favorite arrangements/covers of the Game of Thrones theme? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54d5a?context=5)|There's a couple actually.
 |One of the original rock versions still sticks in my head, the person who played the drums and the bass and the guitar. That was one of the very very first ones that I heard. That I liked a lot. Then there were a couple of very creative ones, there was one where somebody had the theme playing with computer hard-drives, I have no idea how they did that, but that was incredible when I saw that. 
[What was your favorite piece of music that you composed for Game of Thrones? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54fsu?context=5)|It might have to be the main title, I will say. The visuals were just so inspiring, when I saw an early version of the visuals of the main title, that's when I sat down and wrote the theme. I wish I could take credit for the metal-shine sound on the sun in the introduction, but the mixers did it, it's not part of the music, unfortunately I can't take credit for that. But the rest of the music is all me. 
[I know you most likely don't pick what songs go on the soundtracks but there's some cues that are left off of them (most notably Oberyn's theme this year\), will we ever see them get released in Suites? (ie Stark suite, Lannister suite, etc\) or perhaps a complete soundtrack when the series concludes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54gq2?context=5)|Definitely. Obviously we can only put so much on the soundtrack, and I am definitely listening with open ears to people's comments of what music was left out and I will do my best to include in the next round.
[How did you come up with the Pacific Rim soundtrack, I'm listening to it right now? Also what inspires you to compose the music and how did you start composing? Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54i4b?context=5)|On Pac Rim my big inspiration came from Guillermo. Talking with him about his idea and his vision and just what he wanted to do with the film. I met him on-set when he was still shooting the film, and just seeing those big sets, I remember one set was just the HEAD of one of those robots, and seeing just the scale of it was inspiring to me to come up with an equally sizable score. 
[What was your experience of moving to LA to pursue writing music for film and TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nfp?context=5)|I was fortunate to find a mentor in composers Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Basically I ended up working for them and that's where I got my experience in writing for film &amp; TV. It's a lot of hard work and long hours but it was a great experience.
[Also, favourite movie/soundtrack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nfp?context=5)|And my favorite soundtrack? The Magnificent 7 by  Elmer Bernstein. That movie score, actually, triggered me to want to write music as a kid. That was a big, big point for me. 
[What are the main differences between composing music for TV series, movies and videogames? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54tjq?context=5)|I approach them all the same way in terms of how I start writing my themes and picking my instrumentation. The big difference in video games is that most of the time the music has to play in the loop, so you have to pick pieces that after a while will repeat themselves. I guess that affects things like my TV scores. 
[What software did you use for composing the wonderful System Shock 2 score? Are you a fan of videogames? If so do you have any favourites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci556ah?context=5)|I love video games. The whole thing was done on a Korg keyboard.
[What are some of your favorite film and television scores?  I am a big fan of your work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54mja?context=5)|Magnificent 7, Star Wars is very important, Back to the Future, all those classics. I liked Magnum (the show from the 80s), the A-Team.
[How much are you integrating the themes during the show? Or will they integrate in the future?  For example, when I hear the 'You Know Nothing' theme for Jon Snow, I can hear the possibility for the 'Winterfell' theme being played over it, we know that Jon has Stark blood, is stuff like that a conscious choice? Are you working to integrate themes together (I'm pretty sure I read somewhere you have read the books so you kinda know where the story is going?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55w2d?context=5)|The exciting thing about the show is that the themes have to be created in a way that they can be combined with others. We never know where the story is taking us.
[Also, will we ever hear the complete actual main theme in during the show? We hear variations of it, like the recent episode 'Watchers on the Wall' where we hear a minored rhythmic version of it. Are you saving the main theme for pivotal moments when GoT draws to the final few series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55w2d?context=5)|We use the main themes ( parts of it) only in special moments. That's why it usually plays towards the later episodes at the end of each season. Let's see if we will play it in full at some point.
[Have you heard, and did you have a reaction/opinion to the South Park parody of the GOT theme song? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci551mi?context=5)|Yes I've heard of it and it made me laugh, a lot. It's very cool. 
[What are your thoughts about Sigur Ros's performance of Rains of Castamere? Is there a chance that you will collaborate again with established artists like this in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55uvm?context=5)|I'm a huge fan of Sigur Ros and I think their version of Rains of Castamere is amazing. I hope that there are more opportunities to collaborate with other artists.
[Who is your favorite GOT character and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55kzl?context=5)|Well, it sort of switches from season to season. It's really hard actually because I try not to favor any of them, even though I sometimes tend to like Daenarys because her story is so very compelling and I think the dragons are cool. 
[How much do you love the Ukulele? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54edr?context=5)|I love the ukulele! I own one and I play it all the time!
[One of my favorite songs you composed was 'For the Realm' in the Season 3 soundtrack. Was that used in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci564lq?context=5)|No, it was not in the show. I thought it would be a nice rendition of theme for the soundtrack.
[Hello Mr. Djawadi! Just curious here, in which language the choir sings ""Mhysa"" and ""The Children""? Is valyrian? And where is possible to find the lyrics (and translation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci551k8?context=5)|They are Valyrian-influenced.
[Composing music for films is often about capturing a certain emotion. Is there any emotion that you feel music can't convey? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54wgw?context=5)|In general music should be able to capture any sort of emotion. But in certain instances, it really depends on the context of what's before or after a certain scene. Sometimes silence is the better choice. 
[I know that learning music theory is quite painful. Is there a way how to learn it painlessly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54p7t?context=5)|Unfortunately not. It's like learning anything else, it just takes time and a lot of hard work. 
[I love the OST for Game of Thrones. It really adds a dimension to the wonderful world GRRM has created. If you could elaborate on your influences and and inspirations for the various House themes, that'd be be great. Examples such as: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Targaryen and also the theme for the Old Gods and the Lord of Light.  Also, how much leeway do you have in your compositions? Do D&amp;D give you specific instructions on what should sound like when or do they leave you to your own devices more or less? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54f42?context=5)|The difficult task in creating a theme for each character is to enhance their behavior, or their essence. The themes always enhance their actions and behaviors. So in that sense, the theme is an extension of their character. It's just looking at what I see on the screen, what they go through emotionally and that's what I have to express with music.  Besides the season 4 Soundtrack, and also the main title, I would say it is Mhysa.
[So I used to sit in my room and listen to classical music and movie scores while pretending to conduct them (I didn't get out much when I was a teen\). Anyway, do you ever do this or am I just a dork?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54mhp?context=5)|I definitely used to do that a lot as a kid, for sure. And it's a lot of fun. 
[Would you consider doing the soundtrack to Schwarzenegger's ""King Conan"" which will be shot later this year? Are you a Conan fan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54qdc?context=5)|Never say never!
[Dear Mr Djawadi, Can you give some advice for people trying to make it as composers in hollywood? Do you have interns and assistants? If not, are you looking for one ;\) I can make a mean pot of coffee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54wr4?context=5)|Keep creating your work and look for opportunities on online job boards.
[Which form of media do you enjoy composing for the most, film, TV, or video games?  Also, as a Berklee grad myself, congrats on your success! You are a huge inspiration for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54u86?context=5)|I actually like all media. The fun thing about being a film composer is actually switching between those different forms of media. 
[Thanks for the AMA, Ramin! How was collaborating with Tom Morello on the Pacific Rim score?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55ko6?context=5)|Tom is such a gifted and talented musician. He added so much to the tone of the score. He is a super nice guy and good friend.
[Thanks for doing this AMA, Mr. Djawadi!  I recall you doing the OST for the Medal of Honor game. My question is, how does composing for a video game differ from major film/TV projects such as Game of Thrones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54lmf?context=5)|Sort of what we just answered? The big difference is that a lot of pieces have to be created that don't 100% match the picture but overall capture a mood, like tension, or action, or emotional states overall, rather than being precise because you can't anticipate where the player is going to be at what point in time. 
[How did you come to work on Prison Break? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54gjl?context=5)|My agent called me and said that the producers were interested in working with me. And we had a creative meeting and then we went from there!
[What do you think of George RR Martin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55p5z?context=5)|Brilliant.
[Would you return to score Pacific Rim 2, if the movie got into production?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci5578a?context=5)|Absolutely. Loved working with Guillermo.

Will employers care if I say my GPA is : including credits from x college?

I just got a fall intern offer from Amazon.  However, I was planning to take several important classes this fall (distributed systems, databases, fundamental algorithms).  I asked my recruiter if it was possible to trade the fall offer for a summer one.  The recruiter said they will not have the necessary summer information until fall, but it should not be a problem since there are plenty of summer spots.

Here are my two options and what I think are their benefits:

Fall Internship

* I can pursue another internship next summer.
* Better resume, sooner.  This summer I am doing programming for my university and last summer I interned at a non-CS centric company.  So thus far, I have not had any California/Seattle-caliber resume strength.
* I am paranoid that I will end up not getting the summer offer.  If I wait until fall to hear the news, then it will probably be too late to accept the fall offer.

Summer Internship

* More experience from classes.  Will enable me to perform better during the internship and receive a full-time offer.
* Normal schedule and graduate on time.  I calculated it and I could graduate on time, but there is little room for retakes if I fail and I will be behind my same year friends/classmates.

Please tell me which is the better option and why.  Thanks!"

27xz6p,1,2014-06-12,Confused in what field I enjoy and want to do (EDA or design),[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/27xz6p/confused_in_what_field_i_enjoy_and_want_to_do_eda/,"I'm going into my junior year at UIUC as a computer engineering student. I didn't get an internship so as I'm spending time over the summer enriching my skills, I'm seeing some confusion in what field I want to do. My first semester there as a freshman, I got hooked into digital logic and did extraordinarily well in that class in contrast to my other programming/math/physics courses. For the last two semesters, I've done 2 digital design classes that really stress upon the HDLs, optimizations, and designs of modern digital components. Up till this summer, I've been focusing on basic internships that cover ASIC design, validation, or testing of digital devices.


My fall semester courses cover layout and validation techniques with an emphasis on EDA software, and to get ready I decided to learn over the summer. Over the past few weeks I've been working on modifying a microprocessor we wrote in Verilog to a full layout that would be sign-off ready. As I've been doing this, I've started to gain interest into the EDA process and the tools that facilitate them (Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsis Design Suite, etc). I've looked into routing, placement, self-tests, LVS and DRC checking, etc and thought about how these big companies wrote the algorithms for doing so. And as such, I'm considering internships focused in testing for EDA companies using their tools.


What I'm really having trouble with is where to specialize. Other than some required system-programming classes, I have six slots of tech electives which I can fill. I was planning on doing digital courses that take me to advanced SoC design, but now am considering to do courses in verification and manufacturing. I have no idea what way to go based on the market; it seems there's the same number of jobs in both areas and they all have the same requirements, pay, etc. As a future BS graduate who's gonna do an MSEE after a few years in the workforce, what in your opinion is the better field to get into?

27y0u3,2,2014-06-12,What are useful minors/degrees for a career in software/web development? Also general advice for a Colombian aspiring dev.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27y0u3/what_are_useful_minorsdegrees_for_a_career_in/,"So hey, first time posting here. I'm starting college (for the second time) this next semester after ditching my old major (Physics) and my old university for a better one since I got a full scholarship. I have a few questions though, and I was hoping to get advice from older, more experienced people in the CS field.

First of all, no school in my country (Colombia) offers CS degrees. The most similar degree (in terms of jobs and career) I can get is called Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación which you could translate to ""Systems and Computer Engineering"". It's a 4 year degree, with a big focus on IT and software development/architecture. I've asked a couple of professors and they all agree the name is misleading, since ""Sistemas"", at least over here, is used to talk about computers and computer networks almost exclusively, unlike the actual or more commonly used meaning of ""systems"". I'm really interested in pursuing a career abroad, and I was wondering how well received/regarded such a degree would be. It's one of the top universities in my country (if not the best) and obviously I'm not providing tons of details about the degree, I'm mostly just asking for opinions. The degree focuses mainly in four things: programming skills, mathematics (calculus, algorithm design, discreet maths, etc), computer architecture and software development. But I also have to take quite a few classes from other engineering fields, like electrical or industrial.

Now, since I get to study for free for a few years, I wanna make the most out of my time and get another degree, mostly because Im really interested in other fields but also because I think a wider view can also benefit my career once I graduate. My university offers courses all year long, even during vacation, and shares tons of elective courses between majors, which means if I work reasonably hard I can get two full degrees with 2 or 3 more semesters in school, I just don't know which to choose.

My first contenders are electrical engineering, design, mathematics and physics. I like electrical engineering and design because (at least afaik, you can help me out if I'm wrong) career prospects seem better. I've read quite a few job applications/requirements/I don't-know-what-to-call it and lots of frontend and back end web development jobs require both design and software engineering skills, for example. I'd love to be a web or software designer/developer/engineer, and I've always been an artsy kind of guy (if that makes any sense) so I think I'd like it. With mathematics and physics I'm not so sure. I ditched physics because over here job prospects outside of academia are basically non existent and I don't wanna be a professor or do research for the rest of my life, even though I still love physics. I just don't see how a degree in science would help a web/software dev career, is it worth it? 

Another option would be focusing on my main degree and building a portfolio, but since I'm getting paid to study and job finding can wait for a bit, I just wanna do what I love: study things I enjoy. Even if I do, though, a few classes are precisely focused on portfolio building and I'd be able to cram out some time outside of school to work on my own projects. I'm also planning on getting an internship in the US for a few months, almost a third of students do, according to my Uni department. I met a guy yesterday who got a paid 4-month internship at Microsoft (and have heard of a few other guys at google) in Seattle, and according to him, all the big tech companies target my university when looking for interns in Colombia, which is pretty nice.

I mostly just want some opinions. I don't know anyone whom I can ask  about these sorts of things, I'm just a 17yo dude who's starting out from scratch. Any advice or thoughts would be hugely HUGELY appreciated. Also sorry for the long post and excuse any mistakes, English is obviously not my first language. Thanks if you made it all the way down here!

27y3lc,7,2014-06-12,I need advice on how to not screw up my life.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/27y3lc/i_need_advice_on_how_to_not_screw_up_my_life/,"So I just read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/27we3l/student_loans_have_ruined_my_life/) post, and I can't help but think this will soon be me. If I continue living the way I am now, it definitely will.

Here's my situation:

Problems:

1) I've been at a moderately expensive US university for 2 years. I have a 2.0 GPA because I pretty much failed my entire sophomore year. I've been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, and adult ADD all in the past 6 months by two different doctors. I am near $25,000 in debt with less than 40 credits to my name, and I need 120 to graduate.

2) I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I would like to someday own my own business, or maybe freelance or trade stocks. I really want to work for myself. But specifics, and how to get there... I have no idea. I went to college because that's just what you're supposed to do, I guess I'm not the first to fall into that trap.

3) I hate where I live. Maybe it's the depression, but even after the meds kicked in I still can't stand it.

Good things:

1) My family is very supportive, I never would have seen a doctor in the first place if not for them. I have a place to live and food to eat, but I don't want to be a burden.

2) Medication kicks ass, really. I feel amazing compared to six months ago, but I still haven't accomplished anything.

Goals:

1) I don't want to be in a ton of debt. If I stay at my current college it'll take three or four more years to graduate, and I don't even know what degree to pursue. I'll be over $100,000 in debt.

2) I want to find out what I want to do with my life. What do I need to know to start my own business?

3) I NEED A JOB. Well, another job. I work part time at a call center now, and... well... yeah... What are some good paying jobs that I can get with only a high school degree and 3 summers' internship experience? Something that will give me enough money to save up and invest in myself.

4) As much as I love my family, I would love to move. I constantly daydream about waking up one morning, trading in my old civic for an old truck, and running away to kansas to work in a factory or something.

Options:

Here's what I think I can do about my situation. This is the part I need the most help with.

1) I'm already signed up for next semester at my university, I don't know what kind of fee I will have to pay if I don't go through. So I planned to switch my major to financial economics(they don't have business or accounting) and try one semester to see how I feel. If I get nowhere I would take more hours at my current job and go to a community college to save money. And get a more focused degree.

2) Leave my university and try for a community college now. I like coding, and I figure a compsci degree from a community college would land me an ok job to get me on my feet. Still like the business degree Idea more though, but I'm not sure what kind of jobs there are in that field.

3) Take a semester off of college to relax, and figure out what I want to do. Unfortunately I can't relax no matter what I'm doing because of the anxiety, but it would be nice to take the pressure of school off

4) Leave college completely, find a no-degree entry level job and roll with it. I really wouldn't mind this, because I could pay off my debt, and even start to be financially independent. Not to mention I could move.

I'm sorry if this was confusing, but I'm a pretty confused person right now. Any suggestions?"
27y6dv,2,2014-06-12,"Got really sick for a few months, have no internship arranged for the summer. Is freelancing my best bet? How do I get started?",AladdinP,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27y6dv/got_really_sick_for_a_few_months_have_no/,"The title basically says it all. I would like some kind of CS job experience this summer. Because I was ill, the plans I had before fell through, so now it's early summer and I am still without an internship. Is freelancing/working remotely a realistic option for someone without any work experience? For the record, I do have some impressive-sounding school projects to put on my resume, I'm strong in a number of practical programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, MIPS assembly, Javascript w/ other web technologies) and have learned the basics of a number of others. I have dedicated a lot of my own time to learning development best practices along with several technologies. After working with others, I would rank myself as in the top 10% of programmers in my class, although there is no way to communicate that on a resume.

I have a friend who dropped out of college to start a company that is willing to have me work with him for a few months, but

- The company has been around for 2 years and has been held afloat by funding from a startup accelerator in Cleveland. I know the initial funding was $20,000. They are probably provided free housing as well, since they live in a fairly swanky yet nearly completely empty apartment.

- There are only 3 employees, including my friend

- I suspect there will be low/no pay. When I asked him if there would be pay, he said ""Kind of? I think we could pay you, yeah."" His tone of voice didn't give me much confidence.

- The company is at a critical time in its lifecycle, as they only just demo'd their product after 2 years of work. This is a make-or-break moment, and I don't want to deal with the possibility of my internship being interrupted prematurely

As such, I would rather make money and save that connection as a last resort. I like the idea of working in a startup environment, but the simple fact is that I need cash right now.

edit: Further complicating things, my GPA is crap. If it makes a difference, Newsweek has recognized my school as one of the hardest schools in the nation. Additionally, frequent trouble with my health has made it difficult to perform (I had another severe illness the year before this one.) I am confident that my programming abilities are excellent even though my academics are not. Excuses aside, it's not worthwhile applying to any companies that value a high GPA."
27yd6h,1,2014-06-12,Finding my first job as a developer,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/27yd6h/finding_my_first_job_as_a_developer/,"Hello everyone, I need some advice.

I graduated college with a degree in philosophy (I know, I know) back in December 2013. Since then, I took an interest I had in programming and web development and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Responsive Design, and various other web technologies. I created a website to use as a portfolio, and have since done a few projects, one of which is ongoing, another of which is on pause.

 For the past two months or so I have been regularly applying for positions looking for anything entry level doing websites, web apps, mobile apps using web tools/frameworks (I have worked with cordova/phonegap). I have had plenty of talks with recruiters, had phone interviews/screens, and had one position that sounded like they were ready to take me on board. Unfortunately, its seemingly like they don't have the means to bring on someone who will need to be mentored at the moment, so I'm simply applying for more jobs and waiting for more phone calls. 

The thing is, I feel a bit stuck. Nearly every job ad I see requires 3+ years of experience, occasionally as little as 1, or it happens to not be suited for me (a lot of C# and ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, etc.). I have found a few (paid) intern to hire jobs that I thought I would hear from for sure, but nothing. I really don't know what to do at this point. I am getting to the point of being really in need of a full-time job, so taking a lot of time and expanding into other areas of web development isn't really an option. 

So what I ask of you all is if you can point me in the right direction as to what I should do to strengthen my chances or where to look that I may have not considered. I check Indeed, Monster, Dice, Craigslist, and Internships.com regularly. What did you do to get your first ""entry-level"" job in web development? Or is it unrealistic for someone in my position to expect to get my foot in the door? 

For the record, I am open to other types of positions so long as they are technical and I can grow and learn new technologies/languages, so if you have a suggestion falls into that category and would be maybe easier to get or just bolster the overall number of applications I can put out, please let me know (one position that I may be interviewing for is software testing, for example).

Thanks guys and have a good day.

**TL;DR**: How did you find your first job as a developer and where is the best place to look for entry-level positions?"

I have a nice SAN, full backups, offsite cloud storage even, so it'll be fine to toss the paper once it's digital.

I would like to keep this as economical as possible, so I'd rather not ask for $20,000 for a super-scanner. We do have a number of Konica Minolta bizhub's (C454e, C452, C224, etc.), and some large Canon office copier/scanner/printers as well. I was hoping to use the scanning capability of one of those. Have it scan compacted PDFs, and put them into folders based on the box they were in. Easy. The only problem though is naming the PDFs. Sure, it auto-generates a name, but it's cryptic, so you'd need to rely on search, but you can't search the PDFs then when scanned. I could look into an OCR add-on to one of the Konica's, but am unsure how the indexing of that would work out.

I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible with as little extra software as possible, hopefully keeping it to just files in folders on a server.

Anyone else take on such a project and have some thoughts for me?"

I am working an internship with a biomedical device design company right now, but i'm looking for some advice.

What would you reccomend I do next? My long-term dream is to make my own medical device and/or own a business. I really enjoy the over-all design process and being able to bring all aspects of the field together for innovation, but I am definitely most skilled in Electrical/Mechanical engineering. I have considered both BME Graduate school and MBA programs for the future. I am now on the path to try to get a job after next year and see where that leads me.

What do you reccomend I do to
1) Be happiest
2) realize my dream of designing my own device and/or owning a company
3) make money

I was the first in my family to go to college. Dad never even graduated high school. It's only relevant, because ""go to college"" was the only advice my parents were able to give me - in fact, I didn't know what a bachelor's degree was until after the first semester I was there. I also lived in a small town in Kansas with an archaic, technologically trogladyte-like set of parents, so my true exposure to the internet happened in college, where I got my first laptop (quote from my Dad: ""Me and my Dad never had the internet, why do you need it?"". God I love 'em, he's a bad ass old fart).

Anyway. Freshmen year, I start in computer science. I loved all of my classes, except the one EECS course I was in, ""Digital Logic and Design"". Despite understanding the material, the material was so foreign to me, I talked myself out of continuing, which I regret. Fast forward a few years, I'd switched into mathematics - which I loved, and was about to graduate without a plan (I wish I'd known I needed one), when I found out that the class that I'd taken Freshmen year was hardware programming, not software.

~Now~

This past year, since I graduated, I was teaching High School Math. I enjoyed it, but I started to notice some finer details. The first: most of my friends that I maintained after college weren't education - or even math - majors, but rather engineering, computer science, and IT. While teaching, I started to notice that I felt restless - wondering what else I could be doing. I continued to read up on computers and popular science. In my free time, I mod games like Skyrim just to see if I could get them to work - making it *not* crash was oftentimes more fun than playing (A good friend says that sounds like I'd love compiling code, as I'm a glutton for punishment). When teaching, I often found myself down in the tech and programming lab, talking with the tech teachers about the needs of the tech industry. I also built my computer, spend a lot of time messing around on it, manage servers for my friends and I to play on... and... you get the picture.

Why I'm here:

Reddit, I just finished a BA in Mathematics. I got introduced to coding while I was teaching - didn't know what software coding was until then, and before long, I was wasting most of my free teacher planning periods on codeacademy and watching videos about software development. I've also been learning Python. It's incredibly intuitive, especially with my background in mathematics.

I'm wondering what I should do here. What do you think? I left school in very good standing (close to a 3.4gpa), but I'm rather interested in computer science. Would a BCompSc be a good idea? I think this might be beneficial to me, as it will allow me to relabel myself as a more marketable employee (BS in CompSci instead of BA in Mathematics), get relevant internships (none ever happened, as I was teaching), learn to program, network more, and continue going to school (I love being a student, learning! WOO!).

**TL;DR** Got a BA in math - not so useful outside of teaching (maybe you could tell me otherwise?), heavily considering a BS in CompSci. All three of my summers and my afternoons were heavily taken by teaching ""internships"", so I've no relevant work experience. Advice on what to do?"

First, thank you for taking the time to check out my question.

Here is a little background on myself: I just graduated from a top university with a business degree but found out during my junior year summer internship that I hated working in finance (which was my previous dream job). However, I found out during my senior year that I really enjoyed programming/CS after taking CS1 and CS2. I couldn't take anymore CS classes due to my graduation requirements but want to continue trying to become a SWE or atleast be able to build an app/program. I used C++ in my CS1&amp;2 classes and have done the Python tutorial on CodeAcademy but didn't feel CodeAcademy really taught me anything.

My question is: Is it realistic to teach myself the material taught in CS undergrad classes? If so, where should I start? 

Once again, thank you for your time =]"

It has nothing to do with the jobs I'm applying for and it wasn't official or anything. My dad would pay me here and there at a discounted rate. Is it better just to mention this in my cover letter because they can't really do any checks because there is no company.

I was upfront and told them I have no real knowledge on IT as it wasn't what my degree was about, they were fine with this and are willing to teach me.

It would be mon-fri 8:30-5:30 (1 hr unpaid lunch) and I'd be expected to do overtime several times a week as a lot of work needs to be done outside office hours. Do you think I should take this opportunity?

Am I wrong to turn my nose up at this internship? Part of me does think I'm going to be exploited.

Last quick question....I reckon the agency that found this job for me is probably getting a few £ an hour for landing me the job. Would it be wrong to ask the employer to cut out the agency? This could come across as very unprofessional tho. Any advice is much appreciated.Thanks"

I believe my interviews were a great experience and the directors I interviewed with were amazing.

I was offered 56k and standard benefits.  This would almost triple my current income.  I will have to spend a lot of time learning new technologies, but this medium sized company appears to be the experience that I'm looking forward to.

Payscale.com shows this offer to be above 80% of offers for new grads in my metro area.

Would it be wise for me to see if I can negotiate higher or just run with it and ask for an increase during performance reviews.   I hear most new grads don't negotiate offers and I don't want to ruin the chance to work with this company.

Long story short  - I was pretty brilliant at landing internships since I'm very motivated and had a nose for finding groups in undergrad that had connections to some alumni. However, I didnt realize what I wanted to do until now. Unfortunately, their is a lack of finance jobs in Arizona, coupled with the lack of mentors that can help me along the way (I'm an AAM who wishes to go to t10 MBA program in the next 3-4 yrs or T-14 law program within the next 2yrs, I havent found many other AAM who have done so)


As it is, I'm moving to LA in 2 days and I plan to do a lot of networking. I was part of INROADS in college, so I know that their alumni network is good. Can anybody else give me some extra pointers? I'm basically looking for a Analyst job with a F500 Company or even better a job in Advisory with the Big 4.

Although, I do not plan on staying with the company, as I wish to pursue a career more related to my major, I worry whether or not this job will be better or worse towards my Computer Science career goals.

With my current job, I have a lot of free time at hand. I use this ample amount of time to learn and practice a diversity of programming languages. This new job would cause me to have to sacrifice this ability. I am also unsure if my experience as a Web Analystics intern will have any benefit towards becoming a better programmer.

28162x,21,2014-06-13,Snowflakes and Tartare,Philosohraptor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28162x/snowflakes_and_tartare/,"I remember watching an episode of the television series “Hannibal” in which FBI investigator Will Graham is having a conversation with his therapist about what it is to kill someone. His therapis, is Dr. Hannibal Lecter. At one point in the conversation, Hannibal leans forward and says to Will; “We both know the un-reality of taking a life…in those moments they are not flesh, but light, and color, and air.” Will looks back to Hannibal and answers tentatively “Isn’t that what it is to be alive?” I remember being so profoundly struck by the complexity of that exchange; I was captivated by the layers of meaning  and subtle nuances.Today though, I should hope Dr. Lecter is wrong; as flesh is the best part.

I’m graduating early this June as a pre-med student and I’ll be leaving for medical school in the fall. I have always had a fascination for biology. I memorized all 206 bones in the human body by the time I was four, parading around family reunions demanding my family refer only to me as Doc. I sincerely hope that is not how I’m remembered.

On the weekends, I drive-well, drove, 50 miles off campus to my home town, where I work at a gas station. January 6th though was a particularly cold Friday night. The roads hadn’t iced over per-se, but nonetheless that was no reason to be reckless, but Jeremy was reckless anyway.

Jeremy Ditter led a troubled life. When Jermey was eight, his father shot himself at the kitchen table during family prayer. The subsequent police report mentioned he was “severely disturbed, a heavy drinker, and frequently violent.” When Jeremy was twelve, his older brother, Thomas, was involved in a fatal car accident with a drunk driver. He was leaving for college in two weeks. Jeremy began to suffer the effects of manic depression when he was 14 as his mother did. She would frequently emotionally and physically abuse him until he left home at 18. However, despite having an incredibly traumatic childhood, Jeremy was an academic success. He was supposed to graduate from my university next spring, one year early. 
	
I was driving home late that night, a drawn out argument with my roommate over how we handled food in our fridge had prevented me from leaving earlier. Around 3:10 a quite determined motorcyclist whizzed around me going at least 90mph. Mind you, it was a cold night and there had been warnings of black ice, so I kept to a smooth cruising speed of 60mph.
	
 I made it about 4 miles before I happened on him. the bike was sitting crumpled in the middle of the road, headlights searching the sky for god knows what. I came to a stop and put my hazard lights on. I sprang out of the car and began to search for the missing biker…which did not take long on account of the groaning. 
	
Jeremy Ditter lay in a heap of flesh and clothing. I was surprised he was still conscious. He was flat on his back in the dirt, next to his leg. I was shocked he was till conscious…let alone alive. Trembling, he managed to remove his helmet.

“Please…” he groaned, “help” 

Being a medical student, I was in a position to do just that. I was certainly no E.R. doctor, but I had acquired enough experience between school, internships, and volunteer work to know what to do. Ditter needed a tourniquet, and quite badly otherwise blood loss (never mind the shock) would kill him. I knew exactly how to give Jeramy Ditter a chance at survival, but I didn’t give it to him.
	
I sighed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.”

When I was a child, a boy who was my year slit his wrists in the school bathroom. He did it one night after everyone had gone home, he hid in the library and waited for all the lights to be turned off. Consequently, the morning janitors were the one who found him, no child saw the mess. Nonetheless, everyone in my grade was forced to see a school psychiatrist. The woman who saw me handed me a stuffed animal and asked if I knew the boy, if I was sad. Our discussion was brief and I was told to go back right back to class. As I was dismissed, I glanced at the counselors notes; “A disturbing lack of empathy.” At the time I didn’t know what that sentence meant.  In hindsight, that peculiar observation probably had something to do with my asking of the fate of the boys Gameboy, and if I might have it. He wouldn’t need it anymore, right?
	
“Wh-why?” he croaked weakly. I cocked my head and kneeled beside him. 
	
“A wise man once told me; ‘the real tragedy is not to die, but to be wasted,’ you have a slim chance of survival even if I call emergency services right now. Wouldn’t you hate to die for nothing?” 

Jeremy’s eyes met mine, the light behind his was dim, but absolutely terrified nonetheless. He began to slowly wag his head from side to side.
	
“No, I w-w-want to l-live!” he managed.

 I sighed again and rose, brushing the dirt from my knees. It was then that I noticed it had begun to snow heavily. Hard enough that one could distinctly hear the snow impacting the foliage. The surrounding black forest hummed with ice. I remember noticing in that in that moment how snow is analogous to human life. Snow falls into this world purely by circumstance,  and comes to its resting place by chance. Each flake is unique and precious, however, collectively they are hopelessly the same. Each flake exists beautifully and briefly. The snowfall inevitably melts, each flake only leaving just a cold impression, a momentary reminder of its existence before every trace of the ice vanishes forever…Examined in scope, what is a life but a single, meaningless snowflake? 
	
Jeremy’s gasps for breath had devolved into weak wheezes, and they were growing weaker still. In those last minutes, he clutched on to life so fervently. He coughed up a great spat of blood, the crimson heat pooled on the white snow, quickly melting all the ice it touched. Had the snowflakes fought for existence, in the end? I kneeled beside Jeremy again, I looked into his eyes, brushing the matted hair from his face. A jagged piece of the motorcycles body work lay next to Jeremy’s near lifeless body. I moved for the piece,  he made panicked  noise and tried to shake his head, I plunged the shrapnel into his neck. 
	
When I was seven, my parents got me a dog. Baxter, a black lab. One day after school, my mother came home to find Baxter and I playing doctor. She shrieked and quarantined me in the guest bathroom until my father  had rushed home from work. My parents released me after some hurried discussion, explaining that in playing doctor with Baxter, I had killed him. They explained the concept of death, and mortality to me, with faces pale as ghosts. When they were finished, I told them that I hadn’t meant to kill Baxter.
 
“I know honey, I know,” my mother cried. 

“Mommy, it’s just that the first time I tried to play doctor with Baxter, he bit me, so I cut open his tummy.”

 After that, my mother bared me from having play-dates away from home with children who had any animals… Luckily, my neighbor had quite a few cats. 
	
I kept eye contact with Jeremy till the last pitiful wheeze. It took only a brief moment for him to finally relinquish his grasp on life, and as his body finally relaxed. No longer incumbent with the weight of life, I relaxed too. I sat back on the ground, and listened the forest hum. The life inside it was dormant, but the ice was plentiful thus giving Jeremy’s death a macabre and hollow ambiance. I exhaled, and drank in the moment. However, my appreciation was short-lived, I knew I had limited time. I rose once more, noticing Jeremy’s severed leg. I couldn’t very well leave that there could I? I took the leg, which carried more of a heft than I anticipated, and deposited in my trunk after wrapping it in a blanket. I then retrieved  my phone from the car, and gave the paramedics the call Jeremy had requested. 
	
Sunday, I returned to my apartment, finding my roommate to be smoking in the living room, again. As I crossed the threshold, he rose to greet me, putting out his cigarette on the arm of the lounger he was in. 

“Listen man, sorry about Friday,” he said. He was slurring his words. It was 2pm.

 “I didn’t mean to go off like that, it’s just you can be kind of a control freak when it comes to the apartment being clean ya know? Like it doesn’t have to be fucking sterile, right?” He playfully punched my arm, then caught himself on the door frame for balance. 

I sighed, “It’s fine-“ 

“Oh and by the way, you might want to wash your sheets, I got a little too fucked up and took a girl in there…Sorry” He laughed and punched me too hard once more.

I cocked my head, making eye contact with him. “Actually, on the subject of food, I have something I want you to try.” 

I went into the kitchen and took off my backpack, placing it on the counter. I unzipped it, and carefully produced a tupperware dish. Taking off the lid, I took a smell, it was intoxicating. 

“Beef tartare I prepared last night, made with lemon juice, capers, onion, garlic-“ Before I could finish, he grabbed one of the balls bare-handed, and deposited it into his grotesque mouth. I smiled, 

“how is it?”

“That’s great…That’s actually really fucking good! Holy shit!… Doesn’t taste like beef though…what else is in here?” 

“It was a different breed of cattle…all the butcher had I’m afraid.” I couldn’t help but to think back to how easy it was to filet Jeremy’s leg. “As to what else is in the dish, garlic, as I said, and pepper, egg, dijon mustard, parsley… oh and shrimp.” 

My roomates' eyes shot up with horror.“Oh no…” 

He was deathly allergic to shellfish… shame. But due to his erratic, and unorganized behavior, no one was surprised he made such a mistake. Besides, who will miss one or two snowflakes?

I finally figured I didn't have anything to lose and a little peace of mind to gain.

 I don't like parties much. I'm that quiet girl. There are times I can get excited of course, but I don't like socialising all that much. After what happened, I suspect I'll like them even less.

 It was one of those parties at varsity - I didn't even know the host, or who the host even was for that matter. Neither did the friends who had invited me and maybe half the guest list. Invitations spread by word of mouth and there must have been at least a hundred people crammed into two apartments. The place was pretty standard - the sort of apartments our varsity authorities lent out to students who wanted to room together rather than alone: two medium sized bedrooms with two beds each and a small bathroom attached, a large sitting/dining/drawing room with a sliver of a balcony and a small kitchenette. I knew it so well because it was exactly like my own. It was even in the same residence block, though in a different building and floor.

 I hadn't wanted to go simply because I don't really enjoy hanging around strangers - I can talk to them, but I take time to become comfortable around someone. My friends - who were also my roomies - dragged me there because in their words I needed to go out more (I was recovering from a particularly nasty break-up and pretty much fed up of the whole dating scene after my last horrible experience with it). 

 I felt miserable. Normally I just stick close to my group of friends and enjoy myself somewhat, but this party was pretty wild. There were couples making out in plain view, and the booze was a little too liberal. I'd been already hit on by a couple of guys, one of whom wouldn't leave me alone and kept infringing on my personal space and I slipped away into one of the bedrooms to get away from him. Not only did I want time for myself before starting anything either physical or emotional, I also didn't really want to sleep with someone who was reeking of booze. 

 Thankfully, there weren't any couples making out in this room. There wasn't anyone else in here, and I didn't care to question it in my relief. I locked the door so the guy couldn't follow me in there and went to the bathroom to wash my face and center myself. I was already a bit depressed from my last relationship and the incident with the drunk guy who wouldn't take no for an answer dredged up bad memories.

 I'd locked the bathroom door out of habit, and stayed in there for some time. After a while, I became aware of sounds from inside the bedroom. There was a soft rustling that I associated with clothes shifting and clicking footsteps like you'd expect to hear if someone wearing dress shoes was walking around on a tiled floor. I was freaking scared because I really didn't want to open the door and see that the guy had followed me into a bedroom. I mean, he had alreadfy disregarded my several requests to leave me alone, and he was drunk off his ass.  I'd had a few situations like this with my ex, none of which ended prettily. 

 I huddled against the door (which was to the right of the sink where I'd been standing), hoping he wouldn't notice I was in here. I knew that if he had seen me go in the room then it would be only logical to conclude that I was in the bathroom, but I was hoping he lacked that reasoning in his drunk state. 

 No such luck. The noises continued for a while before the banging started. They kept banging on the door and started this high-pitched groaning that made me worried about their health. By this point I was convinced it wasn't the guy I was hiding from because the moans sounded too high pitched to be male. In fact, the pitch was way higher than I'd ever heard a female use. And yet there was a sort of roughness to it that made goosebumps rise on my skin. It was really unnatural, and if a party hadn't been going on just beyond the door I would probably have been more scared. As it was, I felt concerned that whoever it was was feeling ill and needed to get into the bathroom to throw up or something.

 I started undoing the bolt on the door before I suddenly remembered something which sent waves of ice over my body. *I had locked the bedroom door!*

 I lived in a similar apartment. They were all cookie-cutter apartments, spitting images of each other right down to the bathroom tiles. And I knew that we had to get special permission to change the locks - understandable, since we needed to give the apartments up after we finished Varsity unless we stayed on as Staff or Faculty. So I also knew that, having been locked, there was no way someone could have opened the door from the outside. 

 I took in a deep breath, fighting to stave off an oncoming panic attack - I've never had them before, but I'm a med student so I knew the symptoms. And I knew it was the worst thing that could happen right then considering there was no one to help me should I go into one - and tried to think logically. 

 Alright, so nobody could have come in from the living room. I was pretty sure there hadn't been anyone when I entered - the room was simple, I knew. It reflected mine, because we weren't allowed to have any extra furniture or replace them with our own in any way. There were two box beds, which meant no one could have hidden under the beds, the windows were large but without any sills, and the curtains had been pulled back because I remembered fumbling for the switch in the moonlight that filtered in through the glass windows. True, there had been a closet, but in my experience the closets in student apartments never stayed  closed unless you locked them from the outside. It had been the source of many an annoyance among us - punching in combination for your clothes meant losing more time when you were in a hurry to get to class, but leaving the closet doors gaping open for all sorts of bugs and dust just wasn't an option. As far as I could remember, the two desks both had had the accompanying chair pushed into them, and that didn't leave enough space for a person who might be hiding in order to play a prank on the next person who came in next.

 The windows had definitely been closed. It was a windy night and there hadn't been any wind inside the room. It had been even warmer than the living room with all the people in it, but the air con had been on out there so it made sense.

 I hadn't heard the sound of glass breaking, either. That ruled out both the possibility that someone had been hiding in the room for a prank or had broken in from outside the apartment.

 Now that my attempt to rationalise the situation was finished, I began feeling afraid for real. If I had thought that I was afraid of the guy getting a hold of me alone, then this was sheer terror. I've always been a calm, logical woman and now I was facing something which I couldn't explain. I kept trying to tell myself that there was a logic behind all this, and tried to hold the scared panic at bay. But I also knew that I couldn't come up with an explanation and telling myself there was one I just couldn't come up with stopped working as soon as they - it - started banging even louder on the door and the strange groaning rose to a frenzied pitch. It was, weird as it sounds, somewhat like a baby's babble. I had the feeling that it was saying something but I couldn't understand what.

 And God knows I wanted to. I wanted anytyhing that would tell me a little more about what the hell it was and what was going on and what did it want and what could I do to make it just *go away*. Or maybe I didn't want to understand what it was saying. I was too afraid of knowing.

 I didn't know when I started crying, but I did, and I remember that I kept thinking *Please* over and over again. There wasn't even any other thought attached to it, just that one word. The only time I'd come even close to feeling this type of fright was just after my ex had come home drunk and tried to force me into things, which had led to me breaking his nose and breaking up for good. But looking back, I'm sure even that black day of my life came nowhere close to what was happening to me then.

 I felt suffocated, as if I were drowning. Everything ceased existing except for that bathroom door, whatever-it-was on one side and me on the other.

 I cried myself to sleep on that tiny bathroom floor. I'd considered opening the door, shoving the large toilet brush in the bathroom at it and running like hell but I knew I wouldn't get the lock open in time. And in the end I just couldn't muster up enough courage to face whatever the hell it was because I didn't think it was even human any more.

 I woke up intermittently throughout the night to the sound of the same banging and that voice groaning and moaning out things which only seemed to get louder every time I woke up. I had my phone on me but didn't even have the energy to make a call or text. I didn't want it to hear me, however redundant it may sound, and found myself grateful that I'd forgotten to change it back from the silent mode after class. It was a bad habit of mine, but I was so freaking relieved for it at that time.

 When I woke up to silence, I thought it had finally gone away. I hadn't opened my eyes, and I didn't want to open the door just yet in case it was just taking a break or preparing a trap that the moment I walked out it would jump me. I lay there groggily for a while, listening to the sound of breathing before realising there were two sets.

 My eyes snapped open and oh God, I don't think I can describe what I saw. I don't think I want to. It was humanoid, it had a mouth and a nose and eyes like a human should. But for some reason it was all so fucking wrong! I don't even know why, I don't remember its individual features clearly. But it left this distinct sense of wrongness. And its eyes were - I don't even recall what their colour was, but I remember the strange images that filled my mind when I looked into them. I had fallen asleep propped against the door, with the lower half of my body twisted and splayed on the floor while my upper half leaned against the door.

 It was sitting right in between my legs, its face maybe a couple of inches from my face. I could only stare at it, numb and horrified. We were making eye contact and grotesque images and scenarioes filled my mind. Even now when I think of what I 'saw' I want to retch, and this is coming from someone who has dissected people and animals, and done it without the slightest bit of repulsion.

 It leaned forward slowly until our foreheads were touching. Then it tilted its head and *pressed its damned lips to mine*. 

 I wanted to cry and throw up and scream. As if on autopilot my mouth opened. I didn't know why. I was absolutely repulsed by this thing, whatever it was. It tasted a little like soil and like the taste stale air leaves in your mouth, and something else that I couldn't pinpoint - it tasted horrible.

 That seemed to break the trance and I punched It. Its head snapped to the side but it didn't react. I was already up and I kicked it away from the door, unlocking it and slamming it shut and locking it on the outside as soon as I was out. Looking back, it was a stupid gesture because  It had already gotten into the bathroom with the door locked, after all. But I wasn't really thinking very logically.

 I opened the bedroom door, still screaming and expecting to see people but there was no one there. I didn't even wait to look around but hightailed it out of there - tried to, because the apartment door was locked on the outside.

 It was the second floor, and I scrambled to the balcony and jumped out on the fire escape, locking the emergency door behind me again. As I said, I wasn't thinking rationally. I jumped two or three stairs at a time, not even caring that the thin iron steps rattled fiercely. I ran all the way to my own apartment, where I found my roomie who had been at the party looking grouchy. She started cussing me out, and said that I could have at least called them before I went off from the party. Turns out they'd noticed me missing and since I hadn't answered my cell had thought that I'd gone home with a guy. When she took a proper look at me she asked me why I looked so pale and like I'd just run a marathon. I lied through my teeth, confirming that yes, I *had* gone home with a guy and that I just wasn't ready for it, which was why I looked so stressed out. Thankfully she didn't ask many questions, because I'm honestly not sure how long I could have gone without breaking down completely.

 I never told any of my friends about this. I mean, at the best of times the whole thing just sounds like a particularly bad nightmare to even me. I don't even want to know what it would do to my reputation as a level-headed med student, about to enter into an internship. It would be disastrous for my career. Besides, its been over two weeks and I haven't seen It again except in nightmares. I don't want to ruin my dream of being a doctor because of something like this, and who would even believe I was sound enough to let into an ER if they knew I said something like this?

 I went back to the apartment where this happened after a couple of days. There was this strong, almost morbid curiosity that attracted me to it. I wanted to know what the hell had happened. I wanted to know if I was insane and hallucinating, or if the people living there had witnessed something too. The whole way I phrased the questions I had to ask to get them to talk about it without revealing what I had seen first. I had to be careful, they probably wouldn't want to tell a complete stranger about something as delicate as this. And I couldn't speak first, in the case that I *really* had been hallucinating.

 As it turns out, no one lives in that apartment. The guys who gave the party - all really nice - live in one of the other apartments on the same floor (every floor has three apartments in our building block). Apparently its one of the two apartments in our whole block that were empty, and they couldn't really tell me why. They had persuaded the RA to let them open up the apartment for the party because their apartment couldn't fit in all the people who they had invited (and they hadn't even counted the ones who had been invited through the invitees). I went to the RA, but all she would tell me was that that apartment hadn't been up for rent for a few years and that she wasn't at liberty to discuss the reasons with me, though she assured me that it was closed up for purely legal reasons. 

 Well, I figure that chapter is closed. I doubt I'll see It again since I haven't seen it since. But I feel a lot lighter having shared this with someone else.

I've fallen off since then and recently decided to re-learn from the basics via Python. 

I have plans to go back to education at some point (Or attempt to get an apprenticeship / internship if possible) so I can really learn how to program properly.

Now here is my question. Any sort of job hunting I went with in England went quite poorly, I've even heard of companies moving country due to the lack of people wanting that sort of job.

So here is my question. If I get to a point where I can start working as a programmer, Should I try and stick to England or is moving to another country (America) an -Easier- time to find proper work? 

If I had a degree from an English university, would that influence any decision if I did move country?"

I thought about working on open source projects, but since I consider myself an amateur, I don't believe my contributions would be good enough to be integrated into the project.


Also, I'm somewhat used to doing projects by myself, but it always happens that, when I'm nearing the polishing/bug fixing phase, I start to lose motivation and to doubt if the project is any good, and eventually abandon it. I believe having a team to work with would help me stay motivated."

I am a full time grad student that interns 9-5 for tuition and works nights/weekends for gas money, bills, etc. In the limited free time I have, I try to run a few times a week to shed off all of my remaining college beer weight. I would consider myself a pretty level headed guy but what's been happening lately has been a bit bothersome.

Tuesday, June 3 2014: After getting out of class around 8:30 I tried to make the best of the longer days by taking a run at the track. I had left a pair of gym sneakers in my trunk with my shorts and headphones, I was ready to go. Although its long winded, it's important to note that I wear glasses through out my day but like most people that have ever run, hate running in glasses. I generally leave my keys, glasses, and belongings in my car when I go running and had done the same this night as any other. My town is fairly small, not one in which people are concerned about theft or any criminal activity in general, really. 

At 8:30 at night I wasn't surprised to be the only person on the track (at least I would think, I am near blind without my glasses but hadn't run in to anyone) so I was free to run to my hearts content. Run to my heart's content I did, just under three miles and back into my car before 9. I took off, headed home and went upstairs to start my daily unwind. 

After setting down my briefcase on the table, I saw the corner of a note barely peeking out of the front pocket. I grabbed the note and saw ""5:48AM"" scrawled on the sheet. Now this wasn't exceptionally odd, I write notes all the time for work and although I didn't recall writing this one, I hang onto old notes at times and this may have been the case. 

In bed by 10:30 life is good.

Wednesday June 4 2014: Alarm wakes me up at precisely 5:31AM (I am one of those weird people that can't wake up on the five or zero, it started as a kid and old habits tend to die hard, plus I deserve the extra minute). I roll out of bed to turn on the coffee pot and get my outfit ready to be ironed. Midway through my morning routine I peer outside my window next door to the church parking lot neighboring my house and I see a pair of headlights facing towards my house. This isn't incredibly uncommon as they constantly have funerals and other services, but the headlights seem to be flickering. After starring for another minute or so I realize that there is a woman screaming something circling her vehicle. 

""I told you this was stupid! I fucking told you! Fuck this shit!"" I hear as she walks circles around what appears to be a grey/brown Ford Explorer (far too early to remember, really). I now pulled up the blinds and cracked the window a bit more in an attempt to hear her a little better, maybe make some sense of this. 

""It was a fucking stupid idea, this has already gone too- fuck he's up, let's go!"" she screamed, jumped in the driver's seat and sped through the parking lot like a bat out of hell. I peer at the clock, 5:51AM. Now I am not sure if I was able to get her conversation down verbatim, it was certainly weird but not strange enough to really make note of as an isolated incident.

Day continues as normal.

Monday June 9, 2014: Monday's are my easiest day, I don't have class or work and my internship gets out a bit early to give my time to run some errands. I go to the bank, get a haircut, and do some grocery shopping. When I begin placing my groceries in the fridge I notice another piece of paper in one of the bags, same paper same hand writing. This one says ""9:38PM"". Weird. I mean at this point its pretty strange, but the last one seemingly had no result (although I am sure you see what I do too, after all I am writing this long winded account of the story). So 9:30 rolls around I lock my doors, lock my windows, and turn off the lights. Playing it safe. Rounding the corner to my bedroom I peer out the window and see the headlights peering towards my house again from the same parking lot. Weird. Same flashing pattern with the headlights two, one after the other. The lady must be circling her vehicle again.

I do my best to crouch down below the window and open it up a crack to hear if she's screaming again. Mind you, I am 25 and I am feeling simultaneously spooked... and stupid. Sneaking around in my house? Hiding like a kid? Anyway, I crack the window enough to make out her screaming again as she circles the car. 

""Just drop it! Fucking drop it! Just put it down and let's get out of here! Something's not right!"" She jumps in the driver's seat and speeds away. It seems no one is around her, no one is getting in the car with her, it's weird. This is weird. Too weird. It's 9:40, (okay, super weird) I read a bit of my book and go to sleep. 

Friday, June 13 2014: Get out of work, class is canceled for the night so I head home early. As I am pulling up my street I can't help but notice a vehicle that seems to resemble the one I have seen in the parking lot speeding down my road. I pull in the driveway and enter my home. Go into my room to grab a change of clothes for a run when I notice the same sheet of paper (it's a pretty distinguishable blue index card) on my bed. 

""We know you know mother fucker. We know you know. We know more than you think. Where you work and when. Who you know and how. Where you'll be and why. We know."" And the back, ""10:15PM."" 

Now I haven't really spent any time looking around the house for any other notes or abnormalities. I am not sure what legal action would do, as these people haven't done anything. They know some things about me but they haven't made any threats. They set up post near my house but nothing seems to come of it. I simply don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated, if you aren't as lost as I am. 

At this point I realize they have entered my home, but I am usually pretty relaxed about leaving a window open when I leave the home. As I had said my town is pretty safe, and my house is no Fort Knox. I intend on changing that start 20 minutes ago. If there's anything you think I should do, let me know. Updates to follow if anything warrants such.

My university requires me to have a capstone project to graduate and I have three options to fulfill that requirement - an approved internship, a thesis, or a year long IT project. I am going to be a senior this semester and plan to graduate in May. Like many, I chose to take a summer internship that I found through my University's career fair.  

I snagged an internship as a Systems Admin/Analyst with a Fortune 500 company. Upon arriving I was told by my university that I had to submit a application stating basic contact information, roles, hourly pay, etc. by a certain date. In addition I had to submit a document detailing what my project would be. (On the website for this my university said projects are often not necessary and not included). So I detailed my project (which in non-technical) and gave a brief overview of what I do as a SysAdmin ending with"" If need more information from me or my managers on my job duties please let me know. You may also contact them here:""  

I submitted everything and heard back from a Career Services Director at my school saying ""Professor John Doe denied your application stating the technical component was not strong enough"". At this point I was fuming because I take regular workflow like a sys admin, in addition to hardware support like running cables, retiring servers, and remediate hardware failures.  

I sent three emails back to him and have heard nothing back after 2 weeks. I detailed EXACTLY what I do in those emails and remained as polite as possible. I believe he thought I ONLY do project work that isnt technical - though I said otherwise - and that this would handled accordingly but not. I can't even get an email back from him. I escalated to the Director of Undergrad Ed. and he said he ""trusts Doe's decision"" and I decided to move on to Student Advocacy Office. The problem is that the guy who is making the judgement call on ""technical-ness"" has ever worked in industry but accepts much less technical jobs than mine.  

This is a huge concern to me because without this acceptance I cannot graduate on time because I would have to take a capstone course for the whole year that I can't begin taking till spring, I cannot accept a full-time offer from my company, and It will cost me an additional 20k to finish. 


I feel hopeless and hate that ONE GUY can change my entire life. I love the company I work for and have a great chance of getting an offer but that wont happen if I can't graduate. 

HE WONT EVEN REPLY... jesus.

284394,2,2014-06-14,How do I meet people in a new city far from home?,thr0waway2048,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/284394/how_do_i_meet_people_in_a_new_city_far_from_home/,"Backstory for my situation:

For my internship this summer, I moved to a new city 1000 miles from the area that I've lived my whole life in. A big part of the reason I took this internship was to get a change of scenery and do a ""dry run"" so to speak of living far from home before I graduate next spring. Another big reason for me choosing this particular internship was that I was told firsthand by a friend who did a similar one with the same company last year that it was a blast and the company does a great job of giving their interns a full experience - professional and social. The problem is, the plant I was assigned to is located in the middle of nowhere (this is coming from a small town kid) in a remote town of less than 5000 people.

So another intern (who I had never met other than through email) and I decided to live together in the closest city, which is a little over an hour away. From talking to different people, pretty much everyone who works at the plant lives in the little town, including all of the other interns and people my age. None of them really do anything on the weekends; they all seem to visit their families back home or just go fishing and hang out in the little town. My roommate and I would just hang out together, but we're pretty different. I'm a single guy, she's a girl in a long distance relationship with her long term boyfriend. The plant that we work at is 90% male so she's pretty popular and I'm just another dude.

Tonight, a guy from her department said he would be visiting our city and invited her to go out with him and his friends. I don't know any of them, they don't know me. My roommate invited me to come earlier in the week. I agreed to go, wanting to meet new people. Long story short, she ended up ditching me and my night was over before it began. I'm not really upset about that, we barely know each other and she doesn't have an obligation to introduce me to new people. I just feel weird knowing that she's doing so well socially without trying (she complains about the people she works with, including those who invited her out, and said she invited me to go with her to keep her sane around them) and I'm struggling so badly. The people in my department are nice but they all live in the small town and like to just hang out there.

The city I live in is a college town, but unfortunately it's summer time so not many young people are around. Also, I live on the opposite side of town from all of the bars, so going out requires a bit of planning and is very difficult to do alone (the city is infamous for its lack of taxis and public transit so I really can't drink without someone to DD). I've been here two weeks and I haven't been able to meet anyone outside of work. I know that this is a short term move and I'll be headed back home in 2 months, but it got me thinking: if I get into a similar situation after I graduate, how am I going to start a new social circle?

TL;DR: Got a job far from home, don't really know anyone. I live far away from everyone I work with. It's logistically almost impossible to go out to bars alone where I live. How can I meet new people my age?"

1. Overall, how do you like the CompSci program? Are there any fields that they are ""experts"" in? How is the teaching? Do you wish you went somewhere else?

2. What does the industry think of the program? Does it get attention from large software companies (Google, Facebook, etc.), as in internships and jobs?

3. I have no problem with a career in software development, but I also have interest in video game development, virtual reality, bitcoin, and entrepreneurship. Does Penn State have resources for any of these?

3. Is Schreyers all that it's cracked up to be? I've heard everything from ""It's not worth going if you don't get in"" to ""Don't waste your time.""

4. I'm in-state and am near the top of my class. How would that factor in to financial aid? I don't want to go into too much debt.

I have the pleasure of being a student intern at a psychiatric ward. 

One day, I was sent in (under video supervision) to field a patient-to-doctor conversation. The woman I met was Ms. Judy Garner. Unbeknownst to me, our conversation would be more than I would ever bargain for.

And because of it, I may never find peaceful sleep again.

Me: Hello, Ms. Garner! What would you like to talk about today?

Garner: Doctor Pence?

Me: No, ma'am! I am a student intern. My name's Karim, and I am very glad to meet you! 

Garner: Karim... You remind me so much of my son.... 

Me: Oh, that's very nice! What was his name?

Garner: Parker... My sweet boy.

Me: That's a nice name! What is your son like?

Garner: I will tell you...

This was her story....
___________________________________________________________

My son is a smart, smart boy. Even as a child he mastered the art of walking and speaking in no-time at all. All the academies for gifted children I sent him to remarked at me that he was far beyond a skill level they had ever seen before.

My son was so smart. And I so proud.

As a single mother, I couldn't imagine how lucky I was that Parker was alright in the head. I kept hearing the horror stories about kids being involved in trouble as they grow older due to the lack of having both parents.

But not my Parker. 

He was inquisitive. Calculating. When he was surrounded by an assortment of Legos, he turned them into magnificent pieces of architecture. While other kids drew rainbows in school, my Parker had sketched diagrams of the light spectrum. He was only eight years old when he was able to solve the Rubik's cube within a minute. Parker frequently wrote blueprints of odd-ball inventions that would likely revolutionize the world if he could somehow figure out the logistics to bring them to reality. 

I tried giving him every outlet to express his creativity. I took him to art classes, early-learning algebra courses, and even a children's ""Future Doctors/Surgeons"" club. He was quite fond of the latter one. 

When he turned ten-years old, he came up to me with a very serious look on his face.

""Mother, I have something to speak with you about.""

""Yes Parker dear, what is it?""

""As you understand, I am a growing young boy, and as a result, I am going through internal changes. I expect you realize what I am referring to.""

I nodded. It had to be regarding sex.

""Anyway mother, the only thing I wish to bring up in this conversation is that you knock on my room's door from now on before entering.""

""Yes, Parker, you've got it..."" I knew something like this would eventually be brought to my attention one day, I just didn't expect it to happen so... bluntly. But Parker was quite a special child, so I decided he knew what was best for him.

For the first time in a long time, though, I longed for his father to be here.

Parker then went to his room to read his books. Or do other things. 

I respected his wishes, but decided that whenever his door was closed it was best not to disturb him at all.

All was well for a long time, until one day, an electrical outlet of ours caught fire and I found it impossible to put it out due to its swift spreading. 

Terrified, I quickly called the fire department and, coughing from the smoke, ran to retrieve Parker. 

His door was closed. I knocked vehemently, with every voice in my mind shouting at me to just burst in there, but another side of me wanting to respect his wishes.

*Knock, knock.* No sound. Only smoke in the air. 

""Parker, honey! We need to get out of the house now!"" No answer.

Parker could hate me if he wanted, I decided. At least he would be alive.

I swung open the door. Parker was sitting on his bed, hands riddled with blood and intestines, with the remains of animals scattered in front of him. And in the middle, something which unquestionably looked like a human skull.

____________________________________________________________________________

Ms. Garner concluded her story with that, smiling at me.

Garner: My Parker is so smart. He was finding a way to combine humans and animals in order to make us all smarter! My sweet, intelligent boy!

She started humming to herself and tracing invisible shapes on her palms.

Later that day I looked in Ms. Garner's files. She had been admitted following the death of her son, Parker Garner, who was killed in a house fire.

I always planned on going on to graduate school to get a CS PhD in AI (ML and Computer Vision stuff). But I also wanted to go to a really good graduate school like Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, Princeton, MIT, Carnegie, Michigan, Texas, etc. 

Would I be overlooked because I don't have a CS degree at these grad programs? Also as a side note, how difficult would it be to get internships at places like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, NASA JPL, SpaceX as a software developer in the majors I'm in? Those are kind of my dream jobs, so I'm hoping I can land an internship next summer."

Friday, June 13 2014: As the night neared 10:15 I began to get ready for sleep while keeping an eye out for anything unusual. Nothing out of place, no windows or doors that had appeared to have been tampered with, nothing to be suspicious of. I shut down all of the lights in the house, double locked my doors, and closed the windows. Again, I felt a little silly huddled close to a window in the dark hiding from, well who knows, but at this point the threat was a little more personal. I checked the clock, 10:14, and waited... and waited... and waited. What felt like an eternity. I peered back at the clock on my microwave to read, nothing.

The clock was blank. The little light on the coffee maker was off. My power was out. I look across the street to a neighbor and see a small lamp on in the living room. The church had an outside flood lamp on. It appeared as though my house was the only one in the dark. Of course I had to check the nearest light switch, no result. What felt like sitting and waiting for ten minutes likely was just that. Knowing that this could potentially be a disastrous situation, I grabbed my cellphone and locked myself in the bathroom. I then phoned the local police. After explaining a brief recap of the story they kindly sent over a cruiser and the lovely lady on the other end was reassuring and polite. 

About ten minutes later I could hear the police officers pounding on the back door, to which I clumsily navigated through the kitchen and down my back stairs to unlock. I went to my car and locked the doors while they inspected the house. The source was something to do with the circuit breaker, I am nothing close to a handy man and the explanation was all Greek to me. Anyway, they had said that I should probably find a friend to bunk up with until tomorrow so that they could fix the problem and check the house a little better.

Without many options I drove across town to a friends. I was ultra paranoid driving to his house, constantly checking my rear view for any sort of vehicle following me, and I had seen nothing. I even went as far as to park my car a street over from the house... just to be safe. He was nice enough to lend me an old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comforter, a Thomas the Tank Engine pillow, and a lovely two-seater. After trying to sort the situation out in my head a bit more clearly I finally fell asleep.

Saturday June 14, 2014: I had woken up to an alarm on my phone reminding me that I had work this morning. I gave myself a decent sink shower and ran out of the house to my car where I found a blue index card under my windshield. It simply had a smiley face drawn on it, no time, nothing. I threw it in the back seat and went to start my car. Nothing. Engine wasn't turning over. Turning the key, no click, no sound. I popped the hood, my battery was gone. 

This meant that the person was able to get into my locked house and my locked vehicle (unless they can pop the hood without the button under my seat, its a 98 Toyota Camry if that helps?). They had eyes on me last night after I left my home. My friend was kind enough to bring me to work and said he would pick up a new battery for me at Sears Auto. 

Work was fine, I don't need to bore you with the details of my weekend job as you would surely exit this window if you haven't already. My friend picked me up around 2 with a brand new battery and brought me to his house. We decided that this was a situation he would like to avoid if possible, so I walked to the car by myself and put the new battery in. Started the car and began to drive it home. I had gotten maybe a quarter of a mile down the road and it started acting really strange. Reeeealllly strange, stop and go, no power, sounded terrible. I parked it on the side of the road, called my friend, and went down to the police station. 

I mentioned that my car was obviously tampered with in some way and that it was likely linked to whoever did whatever to my house the night before. I decided against paying for their absurd towing fees and used my AAA to get a tow to my mechanic in order to investigate the issue with the car. 

They had no news regarding my power outage, but my friend and I were curious enough to swing by the house. There was no one on the scene except for a line of police tape blocking my basement door. I used my key to go inside and grab some clothes, my computer, my textbooks and my briefcase. We made the grab and hightailed out of there. 

The rest of the night I had spent working on some school work at my friends, the police has assured me that they were ""on the case"" and that ""I would be in my home shortly."" 

Sunday June 15, 2014: My mechanic had called and said that the issue with my car involved some dishsoap in the gas tank and that the repair costs would likely double/triple the value of the car. I called the police and they said they would look into it, and that there was nothing new in regards to my home yet. 

Wanting to take a break from the nonsense and feeling pretty down about the whole situation my friend took me on a little day trip out of town. We went to breakfast with his father and then went on a hike. It was everything that I needed. When we returned to his car, however, there was a note under the windshield just like mine. Blue index card, reading ""You should stay away. This is your warning."" 

I tried my best to consider any sort of options I had for a temporary living situation, but nothing came to mind. My family was all out of state and I didn't have any close enough friends to my job/school/internship that would be willing to cart me around until I got a new vehicle. I could tell that my friend was supportive but didn't really want me around there anymore. I couldn't blame him really. We went to the police station, filed a report, and then picked up my stuff at his house. He then brought me to a hotel in town, where I am now, writing about this. It's been an exhausting weekend.

When I unpacked my computer from my briefcase I went to pull out the note I had found in there. Inside the pocket was a second note. I cannot tell if this was from a few weeks ago or more recent. I also can't read it, but I will post it here if anyone can. It appears to be a code or something, I don't know. Help if you could please.

I can take a picture if it helps, but I triple checked the spelling. Your help is appreciated here. Tomorrow my schedule should be light, I will be checking back to see if anyone can help (unless the police give me a call). Thanks.




**UPDATE:**
Monday, June 16 2014: I had received a call around 9:30 from the local police that they had wanted me to come down to the station to give a full report on the record. My boss has been incredibly understanding through all of this and was kind enough to give me the rest of the day to speak with the police. I was able to arrange a ride from a co-worker to the station and had been there for the better part of 3 hours getting everything ""on the record."" I had shown them all of the notes I had on me and mentioned the code that /u/SadCity was kind enough to crack for me last night. 

After getting all of this information down, they had informed me that whatever occurred in the basement of my home was far worse than I had thought. I haven't been down there since the incident on Friday evening, but they had told me that my power going out was the result of what had been a failed attempt to starting an electrical fire from the basement. The point of entry was the basement door where they had unscrewed the actual doorknob itself (I was shocked this was even possible).

The police also had some photographs of some pretty disturbing graffiti in the basement that I was unaware of: an upside down star with a zigzag in it (almost like the traditional pentagrams I have seen without the circle), an upside down cross, and a long word beginning with ""SHEM...."" upside down. These were painted on the floor and walls in the back of the basement, a section that I haven't been in since late last fall. In the winter it is cold and I simply haven't had a reason to be down there. The police seem to believe that these incidents are all related, but have opened up a separate case regarding the vandalism to my vehicle. They have offered to provide a police escort to work, school, and my internship until ""the dust settles."" Until then they have requested that I do not disclose too many of the working details with anybody (they are aware of this subreddit and have suggested that I keep the posts light to not attract any attention, as I had said I mentioned you all helping me crack the code) but I will still do my best to keep everyone updated as this story unfolds. 

I am now at a safe location that will likely change every day or so until I can determine that my home is safe and that I am not being followed. Unfortunately all of the index cards that I had were turned over so I can no longer post them as proof, however I will do my best to disclose any information in the future that will not interrupt the investigation as it stands. 

I appreciate all of the concern you have expressed and am still contemplating getting a weapon as a measure of protection. I have never shot a gun before, I have never even been in a fight. As embarrassing as it sounds I have led such a non-confrontational life that I am not even sure I would effectively punch somebody. I am still weighing the pro's and con's to having a weapon with me and will let you know how I decide to move forward with that. Never had I thought I would even consider resorting to purchasing a gun, but it seems more and more sensible as things unfold.

I'm a computer science major going into my senior year of college. I've been wanting to work on a summer project towards the applications side of things since my internship is more related to hardware (so far I'm not a huge fan). I know the basics about programming and I'm technically savvy, I'm looking for advice from you about how I should approach my project.

I want to make a script/program which will search for recent articles containing certain keywords on a specific set of news sites and then return a list of all of the articles with their titles, number of times each keyword appeared and a link to each article. I'm not trying to make this into a consumer service or anything so there's no need for a slick GUI or anything, it's for a friend who does this weekly by hand at the non-profit he works at.

If there's a tool out there that does this already, let me know! I'd like to make it available to my friend now and then pick up a different project.

I'm wondering what technologies/languages should I start familiarizing myself with, are there any tutorials you'd recommend, how is this sort of thing done and what's my first step? 
Any advice you guys could give me would be really appreciated!

289x3u,2,2014-06-16,It was a close one.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/289x3u/it_was_a_close_one/,"Somebody ran away and I tried to follow the shadow of that person. My mom grabbed hold of my arm and told me, ""I love you Yna. Everything's going to be fine."" She said some more words that is usually reserved for someone who is dying in the hospital. It made me stop and yell at her. ""Stop making it sound like I'm going to die!"" Tears sprung to my eyes and I turned away. I ran into the darkness.

The first thing I noticed is that there is blood everywhere. The bark of the trees looked red as the sun sets. The crows cawed as I walk down the forest with the tall trees bathed in blood towering over me. It was night inside the forest but looking at the edge of the trees, the sun continues to set.

Sounds everywhere. All at once the crows cawed and a lot of people are whispering my name all at once.
Rina. Rina. Rina. Rina.

I ran through the forest but the darkness stretched. Suddenly a girl wearing white and has no eyes appeared in front of me.
I stopped and stared at her. She pointed to her left with a hand with no flesh and muscle. It was such a contrast with her plump face and body.

She suddenly opened her mouth and spiders swarmed out of her. The more spiders that comes out of her, the thinner she became.  Until the very last spider came out and she was nothing more but a husk. 

I ran to where she pointed and saw faces on the bark of the trees as I passed.  As if the bloody tree had swallowed them all except for their head. Faces of children, woman and man all alike. They opened their eyes as I passed and opened their mouths like they're screaming but nothing came out of them. A silent scream.

I passed a guy who is hung upside down, tied at his ankles. The crows pecked his open ribs while he screamed continuously. His eyes were sewed shut. His arms are tied on his back. He screamed and screamed until I noticed that he was not just screaming. He was screaming my name. His head followed my progress as I ran quickly to pass him.

I continued running and saw a break in the darkness. Mud clung to my boots but I tried to keep running until I noticed that it was not mud that hinders my progress. It was hands.

I kicked off the hands that tried to grasp me and ran. I broke through the darkness and saw a grassy hill in front of me. The sky has that color like it is going to storm. There is a single bare tree on the top of the hill and as I walked towards it, I noticed a guy wearing a dark leather jacket staring at something right below the tree.

As I approached, I glanced at what he was looking at and saw a gravestone. I cannot remember what it said but I remember that the name written is familiar and there is a crow cawing on top of it. I turned towards the guy but he is gone and so is the hill. It was instead replaced with a large four cornered windowless room. It is painted grey and on the middle of the room is a table and two steel chairs. One of the chairs is already occupied by a guy wearing a straight jacket. His head hung forward like he is asleep or drugged.

I approached the table and sat down in front of him. I noticed that there is a bowl of red chili soup on the middle of the table. I immediately stopped thinking of food when I saw an eyeball rise up to the surface. Its dark brown iris stared up dully.

I looked up and saw the guy examining me intensely. His dark brown hair stuck wildly like he just woke up from bed while his dark eyes stared at me almost hungrily. I noticed the that his eyes are crimson but it's so dark that it could be mistaken for black or dark brown. His skin is so pale that it looked porcelain and his lips frowned at me.

""Oh I feel honored. It's been a while since they let someone visit me."" He said. He smiled slowly to reveal his sharp predator-like teeth.
He said something more and I replied with a short sentence but I forgot what was said. He said something more and I remember him saying this, ""A kiss to seal the deal. Nothing less. Tell me, are you willing to do it for the sake of justice?""

I bit my lip and closed my eyes. When I opened it again, the windowless room is gone and is replaced by a dark dining room. Like the ones you see in hotels or high-class restaurant. The light is dim as I stared into his eyes. He is leaning towards me with both is hands on either side of my high-back chair.

All traces of the straight jacket is gone and is replaced by a really dark blue suit.
He touched my cheek with a gloved hand before sliding it and resting it over my heart.

""Nothing less."" He said something more but a scream pierced through the calm surrounding and I opened my eyes, I am standing in front of a mirror. A guy is hugging me from behind and his head is buried on my neck, sobbing. I stared at the mirror but it showed something else. The guy wearing the dark blue suit pressing his hand on the glass.

He is surrounded by darkness as he glared furiously at someone behind me. He traced a heart on the glass and gave me a long look before reaching down for a candelabra and raising it up. He walked away from the mirror and was quickly swallowed by darkness. I screamed and the mirror shattered.

My mom grabbed my arm and smiled at me, her face calm but she doesn't look like my mom. ""I love you, Yna.""

That's when I woke up crying. I sobbed into my pillow for a long time before I gathered the courage to stand up and start my day.

This dream struck me deeply and I don't understand why. I took your advice people of nosleep and this dream came out of nowhere. I'm going to be staying with my grandma for a few weeks since it's nearer to my internship. I'm just going to leave this dream here and hope that someone can help me shed a light on this story."
28a00r,1,2014-06-16,Need some advice for a really sticky situation,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/28a00r/need_some_advice_for_a_really_sticky_situation/,"I need your help and advice in a particular matter because I’m reaching the end of my rope here.  I’ll offer as much detail as possible but I will keep a certain level of anonymity, I hope you will understand me in this matter. 

I’m 29, I live in Western Europe and for the moment I’m severely unemployed (1 year 6 months since my last job). I do have a higher degree and experience in my field, but I have some gaps, due to some bad decisions from my side, career changes and from life just happening. I’ll explain the timeline here shortly. If you don’t have the patience to read all of it, below is a tl;dr version and you can skip the bullet points.

- **age 19-23**: college attended (4 years study = 2 yrs common trunk Economics + 2 yrs specialization in Management). Finished with 8.10/10 final grade.
- **age 19-22**: the first 3 years of college I volunteered in 2 NGOs just to get some experience.
- **age 22-23 ½**: in the last year of college I started my own company with a colleague. 5 employees total, including me and my partner. We closed the business because it wasn't working the way we hoped. (Mistake #1)
- **age 23 ½ - 25**: landed a job through a friend developing projects for companies that wanted to obtain financing from grant programs. Financial crisis appeared, clients left and my paycheck took a big hit, I left the company to find a better job (without securing the next one- mistake #2).
- **age 25 - 25 ½**: I started to freelance doing the same thing that I did in my previous position, just to make some money until I could find a new job. I failed at my job search, I got severely depressed and it started a vicious cycle. I couldn't secure a job because I looked like a desperate, sad puppy to employers and that led to my depression getting more severe . 
- **age 25 ½ - 27**: moved from Eastern Europe to Western Europe for better opportunities. (Mistake #3.) Badly paid, long hours, exhausting, no legal contract, I even had to buy my own tools in order to do my job (not joking).
- **age 27-28**: I decided that I needed more experience in my field and took an internship (despite the age) in HR working for a large company in Asia, where I was assigned some awesome tasks (think being responsible for 250 employees). Things finally changed for me and I thought that my bad luck was over.
- **age 28 - 29 ½**: After my internship was over and with my direct manager’s recommendation, I started to look for open jobs within the same company. I had some interviews, but nothing came out of it and all my leads / contacts went cold. I came back to my family and restarted the job applications again, but with no luck whatsoever. 


**tl;dr: 4 years College + 3 yrs. volunteer work + 1.5 yrs own company -&gt; 2 years Project Management -&gt; 2 years unemployment / jobs not relevant to my field -&gt; 1 year internship (paid) in HR at multinational -&gt; came back to same country, last job was 1.5 years ago, unemployed and beyond worried.**


97 targeted applications sent so far with custom CV/Cover Letter for each application. I applied in the whole Europe and even contacted friends from Latin America for jobs, no results. I’m registered on LinkedIn and every major job search engine in Europe, send my CV to countless work agencies + regular applications. zero, nothing.

If there are redditors who work in HR in a country in Europe, please tell me your opinion on these aspects that I’m worried about:

1. What I really have, is it considered relevant and competitive for at least entry-level jobs in HR/general business administration/project management or a support function?
How much should I be worried about the unemployment gaps in my experience? Will recruiters understand these gaps?
2. I’m average in the local language, but fluent in English. What are my chances to find a job, even if it means taking a lower pay in order to mitigate the risk?
3. Given the fact that I’m in a country that is a little fed up with immigrants (especially with my nationality), will this aspect hinder my efforts to find something? How can I make connections in this case?
4. Regarding my personality. I’m modest by nature, I don’t like to talk about myself, I just do my work. I’m not shy, but I don’t like to be in the center of attention. Do you think that it could be a factor in my inability to find something so far?

I hope there is someone that can offer me some kind of advice, because I’m in a really tight situation here. My job is my identity, I can’t view a job just as a means to get money (although it is necessary to survive) and without one, I feel worthless as a human being. I loved everything that I did so far, I love my field, it’s intellectually stimulating for me. I never got fired, I was always in a good relation with my previous bosses and I even have letters of recommendation from them. I helped my colleagues every single time I could and I tried to keep everyone within my area as happy as possible with me. I have given the results expected, no issues on this side.

What could go wrong?

I am a civil engineer struggling to get a job or intern as a frontend dev. To apply I had to do some basic JavaScript functions, the they sent me a PSD file that I had to code into html/css/javascript. It went ok and they invited me for the interview.

This is really important to me because I really want to change the industry that I work in. I predict that the questions will be about JavaScript, common cross browser problems and w3c standards. 

Anyone can give me a hint where should I learn about the last two? 

Also what are the most common JavaScript questions?

I'm really concerned about this because I am totally self taught and have no real job experience. I dont want to fall on some common questions that a newbie have to know.

I would be really thankful for any advices!!

Oh, if this is important I live in Poland."
28a86z,1,2014-06-16,Advice for the future? I am a bit worried about it...,olenruotsalainen,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/28a86z/advice_for_the_future_i_am_a_bit_worried_about_it/,"I recently posted this in /r/self, but I was hoping to maybe get a few more opinions, and this sub is more tailored to this.

I'm about to turn 19. I delayed university for a year to go on an exchange to Finland, but it is almost over. While I expected to relax, have fun, and make friends in Finland this past year, my mind has been churning and just in general causing me to, internally, be a mental wreck. I can't stop thinking about my future.

When I first came to Finland last year, I thought I wanted to become a computer programmer. Well, I lost interest in that after thinking about how boring it would be to sit around all day, typing. Then came the thought, maybe I could be a comedian? Well, not anymore, I'm not spontaneous enough, and I'm a horrible writer. After that, the cop-out: become a YouTube gamer/comedian. Yeah right. Me and the other half billion people. For a short time I wanted to be a musician, but I'm not very inspired, and once again, I'm a horrible writer.

But then I went and saw dolphins. That stirred up something back from my childhood. It was almost like a click in my brain. I wanted to be a marine mammal trainer. But, unfortunately, a click is sometimes followed with a bang. My mind exploded with mounds of self-doubt, pictures of failure, and a fear of time. I have not been raised with relevant skills to becoming a marine mammal trainer. I am a pretty crap swimmer, I have virtually no animal training experience, and I'm relatively timid.

Sounds great, no?

Well, I've started to plan after some research. I need to get a psychology degree. 4 years of my life. Probably ~$100K of debt (I'm Canadian). I need to get some experience with animals. I know I could probably intern at the local vet, but between university and a job, where would I find the time? I need to get SCUBA certified (which I wanted anyway), but that's $5K of equipment, and probably a couple hundred more for the course. And once again, the issue of time. Then, the biggest issue: my physical condition and swimming. I've tried, god knows I have, to get into shape multiple times. Every time I've quit due to my lack of self-confidence. The same goes for swimming. I want to get a personal trainer/swim coach that actually wants to teach me and push me. Despite how wimpy it sounds, I can't do it myself. However, swim coaches and personal trainers are expensive (for good reason), and despite the fact it would be a worthy investment, my mind has trouble dropping big money on things.

I have decided so far that I will be going to university in Vancouver, due to it being close to the ocean, an aquarium, and in Canada. This would be the first time in my life living alone. I'm not the best friend-maker (something I need to work on), so I'm worried about being alone and allowing myself to destroy myself. I will be trying to go to a marine mammal trainer training camp next summer, and perhaps the one after that as well.

In the end, I look ahead of me, and see so many years of work. For a chance. That scares me. I want to be finished them as fast as possible, not waste time just for a chance that I could fail. I know, I'm only 19, and I shouldn't be worried about time. I know that, but I can't seem to get that thought out of my head. ""You're really going to spend the next 4-8 years chasing this? You're just going to be beat out by someone who is naturally better than you. You don't have the money to afford it anyway. You might as well just give up and drift aimlessly in society."" From there on it tends toward suicidal. This is why I fear time. My impatience, I think, will lead me to death instead of my dream.

If anyone has any advice, relevant information, or even just a question, please post it. Anything can be helpful, even if it just stimulates thought.

I come from a poor family and I was fortunate to earn scholarships for my initial bachelor's degree, giving me an opportunity I would not have had.  I can't afford to go right back to school as an engineer.  Many of the opportunities I have been thinking about are:

1. Getting hired by an engineering company with the assets I currently have.  I would work in the field they want me, such as human resources or finance.  While working in this field I would take night classes in the engineering field they specialized in.  It would be difficult but I am committed to working hard to achieve my dream (one I wish I had when I started college...). When I obtain enough credits for a Bachelor's/Master's, I would attempt to move over into the engineering division of their company.  They will have gotten to know me and see how hard of a worker I am in my current field that I'd hope the would give me the opportunity to switch.


2. I could obtain an internship in the engineering industry, even if it were unpaid.  I could have an internship M-F and work the weekends to pay for travel expenses.  I would explain to them my situation in my cover letter and hope they take a chance on me.  I would learn from the engineers in the company and hopefully they would help point me in the right direction with what to learn, how to better myself to employers, and ultimately how to enter the environmental engineering field.


3. Get an unrelated job and take classes at night to obtain a Master's in Environmental Engineering.  This path scares me only because if it is 4-5 years of unrelated experience I am falling way behind.  At least in scenario 1, the company will be getting to know me.  I would also be paying for my classes which could be expensive for a young graduate like myself who probably will not be making much as it is.  I am also afraid the opportunity cost of leaving an industry in which I will have climbed the ladder for 5 years might be too much of a risk to give up, making me drop my dream of environmental engineering.


4. I could go back to the school I recently graduated from (which specializes in engineering) and attempt to work with them, seeing if they would give me the opportunity to become an environmental engineer, since I have already completed all of the liberal arts requirements. This will also be difficult because it would be at least 3 years of study and would put me deep in debt that I have miraculously avoided so far.


5. Teach the advanced math to myself through online resources, and find as many free engineering courses/textbooks that I can online to learn all of the required material. Earn certificates from coursera that won't benefit my resume but may at least show proof of how I'm working toward engineering.  I could then pass all of the tests required of me, but I still won't have the degree.  Therefore, employers would still be taking a big risk on me.


Currently, I am working a job three days a week that is not particularly beneficial to my resume..  I have been applying to many jobs and have been looking for internships in engineering, hoping the .001% chance they take a chance on me works out.

For the program this summer I possibly need other students/people who have some knowledge of computer building and are available to work sometime throughout the week.

* I'll be attending the [Friends of VMware Student Open House](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/friends-of-vmware-student-open-house-tickets-11203749717) - appears to be sold out now. 

* I've talked to some ""developer evangelists"" at Twitter, Twilio, and Mozilla and have arranged for tours/information sessions on each. I figured this was a good way to get info on the company as well as potentially find some contacts to network with. 

* Facebook Group: ""2014 Bay Area Summer Interns"" (the group is closed now, but you might be able to request access? https://facebook.com/groups/1378139645766413) I know there is a sister Facebook Group for Seattle interns, too. There are likely ones for NYC or other large metro areas.

* Last, but certainly not least, hanging out with intern friends and making weekend trips to Tahoe, Disneyland, kicking it at the beach, etc."

However, the company wants to extend my internship contract, from anywhere between 2 to 6 months, before they offer me a job.

Hello (Name),

I am very interested in pursuing an internship / Co - Op opportunity with (company name) for the Fall of 2014. Currently, I am working a full - time internship as a summer software engineering intern at Raytheon and with a start-up called Fee Catcher during nights and weekends. As a software development intern, I have built many complex projects in Java, Scala, Python and C/C++. Along with my professional work, I have a couple cool side projects I am building in Python and Java!
 

Outside of programming, I have founded my college’s Black Male Leadership Initiative in order to empower black males to be mentors and examples for the youths in our community. I also took the initiative to create and lead a volunteering team to the Children’s Shelter. While I love my hands on experience, technology is my key to have a more significant impact on people’s lives. 

I look forward to hearing back from you in order to explore opportunities with (company name) and to further discuss my qualifications and diverse background. Please provide me with an email address if you would like to see my resume and more information.

Thanks for your time,"
28byzw,10,2014-06-16,Should I quit this internship?,QuittingAdvice12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28byzw/should_i_quit_this_internship/,"Quick Background:
-Computer Science major
-Starting my senior year of undergraduate in August

So I started my first internship about two weeks ago and since I started I wanted to quit because:
-Incredibly boring
-Not teaching me anything useful/technical (unless you consider Microsoft Office technical...)
-Very time consuming since it's full time plus there is 2 hour commute both ways

When I applied for the internship, I was hoping it would be more technical, but literally the most technical skill that I have used are Excel spreadsheet formulas (and they were simple at that).

After working two weeks, these feelings have only become instilled more. Additionally, my boss/supervisor is not in the almost half of the week (based on the calendar, this will be the case for the coming months as well) so communication is strained and makes it more difficult for me to find things to do.

For instance, today, for my entire 8 hour shift, the only thing that I did was print/staple a few packets for a meeting tomorrow. (It isn't like I am avoiding work either, I even him if there is anything else that I can do).

I posted this on another subreddit a while back (after the first day that I started) and most people scolded me and said I am naive for wanting to quit, but I see very few benefits to this internship.

Here are the *only* good things about the internship:
-Pay is actually pretty good
-It's my only internship I ever had, so if I quit, I won't have an internship on my resume (which would probably look bad)

However, as I said, it is incredibly time consuming and it's until I start back school in August so it's wasting most of my summer. I should mention that I have been developing/learning more about Android Development (I already have a decent foundation) but it's difficult to find the time to develop/learn more when I have to wake up before 4:30 AM and get home at after 6:00 PM every weekday (I work 8-4, but bus commute sucks). If I quit this job, I will most likely devote most of my time to Android Development since I love it and I believe that it is something that I want to learn as much as I can. I have even started trying to reading more about it during the bus rides to save some wasted time, but it is still not working out. (I have just started an app or two on the side, but it's difficult to find the time to work on much).

Sorry for the long rant, but here is what I would like do know:

Based on my experience, does quitting seem like a good idea? (bear in mind, if I quit, I will dedicate my free time to learning/working on applications, which is a multitude more relevant than anything this internship will provide)

How detrimental is it to not have an internship as a Computer Science undergraduate, which respect to jobs after graduation?

On another note, obviously this internship is in IT, but it is not at all related to anything that I would like to do (probably application/software development), so could it be argued that this internship would look bad if I apply for unrelated jobs (like it would imply that I don't know what I want to do?)?

If I do quit, how should I go about quitting, does it defer from a job since an internship is short-term?

What non-obvious things should I plan on doing in order to have a decent shot at a CS Masters program? Many of the tips seemed to have dealt exclusively with PhD programs, and emphasized research. Would this be as important for a Masters program at an institution like Stanford?

As for undergraduate research, when should I begin looking for on-campus research projects? Would it be more advantageous to do research at another institution during the summer? Does the research I work on have to be particularly notable (as in, outside press attention) for me to be a decent shot at especially selective graduate programs?

Additionally, would doing internships and co-ops still be advisable, or would the time/effort be best concentrated in research? I still want to keep the option of working in industry open, in case I change my mind at the last minute. 

Lastly, how could I minimize the ""damage"" of going to a not-terribly-well-ranked institution? I doubt it makes a considerable impact on my application, but its always possible.  

I'm already planning on taking steps to maintain a decent GPA, and obtain a decent GRE score.

Ideally I would like to major in CompE, but if my tuition was 100% paid for, i'm sure EE or SE would suffice. 

I have about four classes left of community college/basics (diff eq, linear algebra, literature, chemistry if my uni requires it) before I decide which university to transfer to. 

There's been tons of positive things said about starbucks doing this, but my initial reaction was ""i don't want to have to finish my upper level courses online, that sounds awful"". I've taken two online courses before and my personal experience was that it kinda sucked. I like hearing someone talk about the material, and I enjoy having the option of going by office hours in person to talk to the professor to sort out issues, not to mention the friends and study groups that you get to benefit from taking classes IRL. 

I also feel like some of the upper level engineering courses will require labs/projects and other things that I'm not confident an online BS degree would cover successfully. I also feel like I would miss out on job fairs and internship opportunities by doing all of my college online.

What do you guys think?

28cs4t,10,2014-06-17,Soon to finish a Masters in Systems Engineering at Penn seeking job/opt,runner2012,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/28cs4t/soon_to_finish_a_masters_in_systems_engineering/,"Hi there,

I'm about to start my last semester of my masters program in Systems Engineering at UPenn, and I am getting scared about not finding a job when I graduate. Even though I'm taking several classes at Wharton and I have a BA in Computer Science, with minors in math, physics, and economics I am pretty nervous.

The main reason is that I am an international student , so I need to find a company willing to sponsor me with an OPT( Optional Practical Training). I have been sending applications for summer internships and I got rejected from several large and medium sized companies, so I definitely need to change my approach for my next applications.  I think my main issue is that I did my undergrad in a small liberal at school in Arkansas (Lyon College), which makes interviews a bit awkward when I try to explain how I ended up there, and what a big change it was to move to Philadelphia. 

I was thinking of applying to positions like systems analysts, quantitative analysts, programmer. 
Any advice kind of advice would be greatly welcomed!!!"

I passed the first two stages (first stage was a why-I-want-this-position sort of thing, second was a problem set and an IQ test).

Crappy thing is, my phone crapped on me a while ago, and I've been sharing my girlfriend's phone. The phone happened to be with her when I got a call and she answered,not knowing who it was, and she told them I'll call back.

I certainly intend to call them back (this happened less than 1h ago) and not let this opportunity slip, because it's really important for me. But I just don't know how to go about it. Was it even ok for her to tell them I'll call back / for me to call back?

How should I professionally manage this? This is the first time I'm in a real life job situation (first year of college), and I kind of really want there.

Thanks!"

I never finished my degree, and have no certifications. In about a year, I will be needing to move and find a new job. My fiance will be starting a residency next July and I will be moving to where she is going. She is living long distance this year for an internship, and I am helping support her financially so that puts a pretty hard limit on the amount of money I can spend. What can I do in the next year to improve my chances of finding a well paying job wherever she ends up?"

[What was your favourite moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t9ro?context=5)|This is hands down my favorite moment and will stay with me the rest of my life. My first day was an old man's last day. I was told that I needed to help him pack up his boxes. No idea who this guy was. I was told he did the music. As I'm packing up his boxes (Literally took from 10 am to about 4 oclock non stop with no lunch), I learned everything about this man's life. He gave me lessons on ""How to not give a ***"" and ""Enjoy life"". This man was an intense Brooklyn 80 year old man. He really did feel like Carl from Up. As I was going through the boxes. I found a script for ""Follow That Bird"" with some notes on it. The handwriting was very scratchy. I asked whose notes were they. He says ""Oh, those are Steven's."" Then it dawned on me. I'm holding in my hands the notes of my favorite director of all time, Steven Spielberg. Soon, I learned this man was the creator of my favorite animated movies growing up. His name was Tony Geiss and he was the creator of ""An American Tail"", ""The Land Before Time"", and ""Fievel Goes West"". He also wrote all of the Sesame Street movies in the 80s and 90s. He gave me this script and told me to follow my dreams. This old man truly inspired me and changed my life that day. He told me a couple conversations that him and Steven had and apparently they were close but then age happened. He also told me that he never had any children with his wife. They weren't able to have children but they had no regrets. Both of them entertained and wrote the music for Sesame Street for most of the show and viewed every child viewer as one of there own. His wife died earlier that year. He also wrote ""Don't eat the pictures"" which was a favorite child hood tune of mine. Sadly the day ran out and he had to leave. Nobody really made a big fuss of him leaving and retiring. This saddened me. Tony died a few months later and I don't think a lot of people went to his funeral. He made such a huge impact on my life. I hope to one day ask Steven about Tony. 
[I wonder what happened to all his stuff.  Surely some of it would be of interest to a Smithsonian style museum or performing arts school collection. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wvys?context=5)|Completely agree. I've tried finding more information on this guy over the years. But I can't find anything but books he's written.
 |[Link to www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/arts/television/31geiss.html?_r=) ^^ Here is his obit. Such a long great career.
 |I just remembered another favorite moment of mine. It doesn't top the story with Tony but I would always sneak onto the roof just before the day was over. The view from Kaufmann Studios was a breathtaking view of the city. Almost always before the end of my day, I would watch the sunset. I had this feeling of ""I made it"" and it was one of the best feelings in the world. 
[WE NEED PICTURES.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciakiiq?context=5)|I will gladly take some pictures of the script if you would like to see them. The script is in a box in my garage of personal stuff. I'll try and open the box this weekend some time for you all. It's not the full script, just the first 10 or 15 pages. He didn't have the rest of the script for some reason. 
[How is Elmo off set? Is he really as humorous as he is on TV? What is Cookie Monster's favorite cookie brand? Is Oscar really a grouch or is it just for the cameras? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciam9yx?context=5)|I know there are a lot of rumors about Kevin Clash. From what I saw at work, he was nothing like the way the media played him out to be. I never saw anything that was remotely like that. During my time there, he was as professional and wonderful as the others. I was really sad when I heard he quit Sesame Street because of these allegations. I really hope all of that isn't true but I'll never know. He was very funny on set and would charm everybody with his humor.
 |Cookie Monster's favorite brand is Cookies. That's what was on the prop department in Hooper's store!
 |Oscar is a grouch. The actor, Caroll Spinney, is not. 
[HI!I seriously hope you had a great experience- I work for a PBS Station and joke ""Big Bird is my boss!"" Public Broadcasting and Sesame Street are basically the antithesis of the Cable Companies.  Congrats on a great opportunity, how did you dovetail with your studies and what you're doing now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vi7y?context=5)|I really did have a wonderful experience! If I could work for PBS or Sesame Street again, I would be extremely grateful. That semester of college was probably my hardest semester. I was taking 18 credits along with my internship so I never had any free time. The experience taught me how to perform well under pressure and it also taught me how to be a better writer. The writers that I worked with were simply wonderful. Currently, I work for the department of defense making army training videos for soldiers. It's definitely fulfilling and I do feel like I make a difference with the videos that complement there training. That's so cool you work for a PBS Station. How do you like your experience?
[Also, which is your favorite character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spaa?context=5)|I worked on the 41st season. Every day I worked usually had somebody famous. We were told we can never interact with them sadly. I did see Jude Law (who is incredibly shorter than I've ever imagined). I did have a bad run-in with Ryan Reynolds. He wasn't very nice and didn't seem happy to be there. My favorite characters are Big Bird, Gordon, and Super Grover!
[Grover4life.  Sucks that you can't talk to the celebrities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9szbo?context=5)|Not really. I understood that you needed to be professional around them so it didn't bother me much. My Ryan Reynolds experience completely killed my mood for meeting celebrities tho. There is one long hallway from the dressing rooms to the set. I was running some errand for somebody. Ryan Reynolds is at one end and I am at the other. It's a long hallway with no other doors so neither of us can escape running into each other. So as we walked passed, I nodded and said ""Enjoy the day and Good Luck!"". He gave a ""PFT"" and completely ignored me. Ever since then, he has not had a good movie. Kharma is a great thing. 
[He does seem like the person to do that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t891?context=5)|I wasn't even trying to talk to him! He seriously hasn't made a good movie since! And Green Lantern was one of my favorite superheroes at the time! And he ruined that for me too!
[Don't feel bad. Apparently, Ryan Reynolds has a history of being rude to people. A quick google search can confirm that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cibhljl?context=5)|Yeah, I just wish he was nicer. I don't feel bad at all. Like I said, no good movies since I saw him!
[How weird is it to get a behind-the-scenes look at something that is so iconic? Anything really surprise you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sstg?context=5)|It was really bizarre. I would spend any chance I had on the set. Whenever I had downtime, I would immediately go down to the set and just watch them do takes. I learned so much from everybody involved! It really surprised me how the puppeteers stayed in character most of the time (even when talking to the directors). A whole episode would take a whole day to shoot so that surprised me how fast they would be. Also, I never realized how often they put out military specials for military families. So so cool.
[What was your last day working there like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9u7ma?context=5)|I was really upset my last day. I had my college formal that night so I had to leave early. There was a wrap party that I couldn't go to and I really regret not going to it. They gave me a gift basket (baby books, stuffed animals, an alarm clark) and a couple on screen props which was really nice. I loved working for the writing department and that was the nicest surprise when I was leaving. 
[What do you want to do after your internship is over? What career are you looking at? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9tdzu?context=5)|Currently, I make army training videos for the government. I have a wonderful girlfriend who means the world to me (no, that's not career related but felt like sharing that). I like my job a lot but I really really want to get back into television in some capacity. It's just too hard and none of my contacts have panned out. I'm still trying tho and not giving up!
[Whats Grover like in person? I heard he is a real fun guy to hang around with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciab3p5?context=5)|Grover has had a lot of performers over the years. I think when I worked there, Grover was a ""she"". She's was a wonderful older woman who was really sweet and caring. There was a 40th Anniversary celebration and I briefly saw her interacting with children on the streets of NYC. She was very nice and I hope she still performs as Grover.
[Did you get tickled by Elmo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t0k1?context=5)|I had a very awkward encounter with Elmo on my first day. I was walking into the bathroom and out comes Kevin Clash (who I bump into) and he goes ""EXCUSE ME"" in the Elmo voice. Completely shattered my childhood. Had no idea Elmo was a big black man (not being racist, it just really surprised me)
[When I saw him on the Netflix doc it totally threw me for a loop too.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vami?context=5)|Right!
[Was the season you worked before or after the randoms from dating websites created that whole controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wss2?context=5)|Before.
[Was he creepy on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9umfn?context=5)|Not at all. He was really friendly and outgoing! 
[Who was your favorite actor on the set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciaiv45?context=5)|Caroll Spinney, Roscoe Orman, Bob McGrath, and Alan Muraoka. All of them were super friendly and out going. Watching any of them work was unbelievable. Caroll hones into his craft of puppetry well. Roscoe and Bob are just such professionals now. All of them just laugh and have a great time on set.
[What was your most difficult moment on the job? Was there ever a tough situation or did it go pretty smoothly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9toan?context=5)|Most difficult was keeping track of everyone's names. About 40 different people came and needed scripts. Each script had that person's name on it. I confused some people with others so it would be embarassing if I gave the wrong scripts (which happened often). No real tough situations except that happening.
[Do you agree that Elmo ruined the show? Oscar 4lyfe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0adx?context=5)|No. I think Elmo came in at the right time to help the show out. I think with a show that's been on as long as Sesame Street, you need to add in things to keep the show fresh. Adding a character like Elmo did just that. I don't think he ruined it at all. I'm hoping the new Elmo works out great.
[Do you think there is too much Elmo though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia83rv?context=5)|Maybe. I think there's been too much Baby Bear personally.
[What did you actually do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia2gb9?context=5)|My main job was delivering scripts to the actors and producers. The other parts of my job were delivering packages from the office to the set. Also I transcribed currently airing episodes from the previous season, and my transcriptions would eventually be the DVD subtitles. 
[Any fun facts about the show you learned while working there that you would care to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9ulcj?context=5)|There is a wall where all the celeb guests sign in crayon. Not sure if people know about this wall, but it was really cool to see! I haven't seen pictures of it. All of the props in Hoopers store are fictional brands that the design team came up with. Behind the door on the famous stoop, is a wall. 
[Any favorite bloopers you can share during filming when either a celebrity, cast member, or puppet goofed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vo8i?context=5)|Yes! If a puppet messed up there line they wouldn't curse but they would say something like ""Oh rasberries!"" Instead of shit or another curse word. Michael McKean kept messing up his lines when he was a guest star but would just laugh it off. Most never goofed tho and were always spot on with lines. 
[What was your favorite part of the job (ie set design/set up or interacting with kids\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t3xc?context=5)|I didn't get to interact with the kids that much but when I did, it was wonderful. The kids were so excited to be there and couldn't believe it. It was really nice seeing how happy they were. My favorite part of the job was probably getting to watch the performers work. They were amazing. 
[Do the kids get to see the set like you do? Or do they play it up while they're there and try not to break the illusion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9zqy2?context=5)|They see the set like I do. They see everything they can. Instead of looking down at the puppeteers, the parents and director would just keep saying ""Look up!"". And they would just get captured in the moment and stare at the Muppet or Puppet. Illusion for some reason never broke around kids.
[Were you and your co-workers familiar with the Broadway show Avenue Q?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9swns?context=5)|I've always wanted to see Avenue Q! Just haven't had the chance yet to see it.
 |The big thing that my coworkers and I discussed a lot was Spike Jonze's new movie (Where the Wild Things Are). We all LOVED it. I wish that movie got nominated for some Oscars. 
[Do you know Chris and Will? Actually, Chris isn't there anymore, I think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia207k?context=5)|I met Chris and he was a really nice guy. I believe you're referring to Chris Knowings. He would do anything needed for the scene and was always committed to whatever the skit was. Not sure if he'd remember me tho. Which Will are you referring to?
[Haha, no. I was just thinking about the guys I know that make the scenes and the puppets and stuff. Don't want to say their last names on the interwebs!  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia48t1?context=5)|OHHH!! Yes, I believe I know who you are talking about. Are they heavily involved in the prop department? If so, then I know who you are talking about.
[On the nerdist podcast,  Moby claimed people have sex inside a snuffalupagus outfit as a rite of passage. I believe he heard this while partying with Brian Henson in the early 90s. What sort of culture is there now? What are the rites and rituals?  Do you know any other apocryphal tales of the past? Is the snuffy thing true? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wj1h?context=5)|Nerdist podcast is my favorite podcast out there. I love Chris Hardwick and I can't wait to see what happens next to him. @midnight is great. I can definitely see him being a Jimmy Fallon/Conan one day. I remember the podcast your speaking of. There weren't really any rites or rituals that I know of. I don't think the snuffy thing is true lol.
[Did you get to keep any souvenirs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia8sqk?context=5)|I did. There was an episode where it was Baby Bear's birthday. I got to keep the banner they sewed together and I still have the banner! It's in my garage. Might hang it over my future child's bedroom one day. 
[Does everyone enjoy it as much as they seem to, or is it just a job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9smry?context=5)|Mixed feelings. Most people really enjoyed working there a lot! I could tell that a few people didn't enjoy it but most of them looked like they were having the time of their lives. You could easily tell who weren't into it.
[Were you there when Michelle Obama was there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spwl?context=5)|I was very briefly. That day was my second day at the studio. They were in the middle of changing offices so most of the time that day I was moving boxes for people. I did not see her but I did see the President make a video call to every one on staff. He was saying how important it is that the show is still on and how it still appeals to young children and wished us luck that season! Hell of a way to start off. 
[What is you biggest tip for someone who wants to write their own skits and things for youtube? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0hnz?context=5)|My tips would be to be creative and have fun. I used to write skits on youtube a long time ago and would love to bounce back into it. Keep writing and don't stop creating. I know that sounds really cheesy but that's what you have to do.
[Any chance you could link to some youtube work? I would love to watch/ Study it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0nyn?context=5)|I wish I could. They aren't on youtube anymore. They wore from high school days. Perhaps I'll start writing again tonight.
[Would you consider reading something of mine, and criticizing it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0zki?context=5)|Absolutely! I love giving notes on things. Feel free to send me anything. Follow me on twitter @dalybear and send me a DM.
[Which character do you like the most on sesame Street? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9snd5?context=5)|Big Bird. Watching Carol Spinney perform in costume really was a work of art. I'm also a huge fan of Roscoe Orman's (Gordon) work. He really gave the most energy to everyone on set and was so nice. 
[Hey there. Please join us at /r/museumpros.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cibarub?context=5)|I'll check it out! Also, heads up people: Cornell is going to look into finding his papers! Unbelievable what reddit can do, thank you all so much for making this a successful AMA!
[Is Big Bird a diva? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spea?context=5)|Not at all. He was the sweetest old man. He has so much wisdom. Can't wait to see his documentary coming out this year (I AM BIG BIRD)
[Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sq2q?context=5)|Astoria in Queens! Take the 1 train downtown and get off in Astoria. Walk 2 blocks North (past the TGI Fridays) and the studio is right there!
[Is the joint full of pedophiles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sfvu?context=5)|Nope. Everyone was really nice and professional! Shame what happened with Kevin Clash. Did not see that one coming at all. 
[Is this AMA brought to us by the letter V? For Verification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sf2w?context=5)|Do you know how to use verification? I'm not sure how to submit proof.
[Read the comment above from the moderator.  You need to submit some sort of proof (usually in picture form\).  Maybe like a picture of your work ID for Sesame Street (with your name blacked out\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sh0y?context=5)|Thank you!

Um... This is where... These are the guys who, um. Make sure everything is running, and that our emails work, and that the internet stays on in the building, and... Azonicstix, can you tell our new interns a little more about what you and ITDir do here?

The tour guide, FrontDeskLady ([Click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/267jjx/from_the_front_desk_lady_ep2_could_not_shut_down/)) understood IT in her own way, she knew that there were computers here and that if it weren't for IT, they would all be pasting sticky notes to each others desk with dried spit. What she didn't know was ANYTHING ELSE about IT. 

&gt;Sure. 

I said with a smile. 

&gt;Hello interns, I'm azonicstix, the resident IT Specialist. This is ITDir, my boss. 

ITDir said hello from his office without bothering to get up. He's seen so many of these tours come through it's become a kind of challenge to him to see how quickly he can get them to leave the IT Dept.

&gt;Together we administer and support IT operations and equipment for 5 of our international offices, all the way from end user complaints to disaster recovery. Nice to meet you...?

I stared expectantly, waiting for someone to initiate the other side of a standard formal introduction.

&gt;Oh, sorry, hi, I'm Tweedle-Dumb, and this is my friend Whippy-Woo. We're big fans of LARGENONPROFIT. Your office is really neat. Is that a computer?

He was motioning towards a growing pile of ornamental/destroyed dead hard drives I had been collecting for years.

&gt;No...

I said

&gt;That's where data lives inside of a computer. Everything you do and create is stored on a hard drive, and these are dead hard drives.

I tried not to be demeaning, it was a fair question.

&gt;Wow

gasp-sighed Tweedle-Dumb, completely in awe.

&gt;I wonder if there's anything good on those drives.

This was not a fair question.

&gt;Actually... Never-Mind, nice to meet you. 

I said, still smiling, but for a different reason now. This would be fun.

&gt;Thanks man! 

Tweedle was very happy to have... learned something?, and Whippy never spoke a word. They left and continued on their way, and I sighed knowingly. 

These two were going to be trouble.

I spend my freshman and sophomore year as a bioinformatics major and switched for my junior year. During my bioinformatics time I took a bunch of sciences, but also compsci 1,2 and calc+discrete mathematics. I do well in my computer science classes 3-3.3 GPA, but with my sciences my overall is around a 2.6. I'm pretty proficient in Java with some experience in assembly and SQL. But i'm currently learning python and html/java script in hopes to be well rounded in each by the end of the summer.



After applying to way too many places for an internship this summer, I have come up empty. I applied to internships in the field of cyber security and information assurance (Northrup Grumman, AIS type places). What can I do this summer so that when I graduate next year, I won't look unfocused in my path. 

I'm getting the feeling that my first two years were now a waste and that even when I graduate I will not have any marketable qualities for a job in the field I want (cyber/network security or information assurance). 


I apologize for the wall of text, I just don't really know where to go from here. Any advice form people in the field or anything at all would be super helpful.

**TL;DR: Need advice for summer activities to advance myself in the cyber/network security field.**

I was offered this chance from a friend who works in the local employment center, who knows the boss of the company. I had a interview with the boss and all looked fine, he asked me to start 2 months before the scheduled start time to adapt, and i was fine with it, since he said he would pay normally for my time as if i was a employee.

Thing is, i really enjoy working computers... and the job is to be trainned to be a communications/electronic tech (not that there is any problem... i was actually excited about it). I just finished my first week and i feel horrible, i never thought of hating a job like this... i don't know how to explain. The people working there aren't the problem, and i didnt had any relevant dificulty... i just don't like working on phones/phone-stations, or assembling communication lines, i just feel depressed I don't want to quit right away, even before it actually ""starts"" because i feel i would betray my friends trust, and lose a chance of a guaranteed paying job.

I have been watching some videos as suggested and am much more comfortable learning self defensive tactics with keys and pens than equipping a weapon. It's just an element that I don't feel comfortable bringing into my life if I can avoid it. Thank you for all of the tips, the support I have been getting throughout all of this experience has been far greater than anything I could have imagined!

Tuesday June 17, 2014: After work the police had called me and offered to let me go through my home to collect some more of my belongings. Fortunately I have a shortened schedule this week with my internship, which gave me a window between work and school long enough to collect my things. They were accommodating enough to arrange a ride for me to get into my house and the officer even offered to also go inside with me, however I took this as an opportunity to gather any evidence before the police confiscated it.

Admittedly I was a bit weary of entering my house even with a police officer in the driveway and the daylight but I was assured that the house was inspected for any foul activity once the power was restored. I was even given the option to return home though I am certainly no where near ready for that.

Don't need to bore you with the wardrobe items that made the cut or the nonperishable food items that were worthy of taking, but everything seemed in place as I had left it. I am a fairly neat person by nature that would readily pick up on anything blatantly out of place. That is, until I entered the bathroom.

The smell was unusual. I would love to describe it in greater detail but my vocabulary isn't equipped with the proper adjectives. The best way to describe the odor was that of metal, mud, and stuffiness. It was incredibly stuffy. I knew something was awry upon entering. I placed what toiletries I felt too cheap to repurchase and stored them in my backpack, grabbed my razor and tiptoed to the shower. I drew the curtain, half expecting to use the razor on some assailant stupid enough to pick the most predictable hiding spot known to anyone that was seen a horror movie, but was instead greeted by a very different scene. The tub has served as some sort of slaughtering area, with thick coagulated blood lining the basin. Inside the remain of what appeared to be a lamb. Totally revolting, I am sorry for the absence of the picture but understandably so this was not an image I wanted to stick around to analyze or revisit. I slammed the curtain shut, grabbed my bag and made a swift jog out to the cruiser. Written on the wall above was a time, 6 something, maybe 6:12 or 6:14 I can't recall now.

I told the officer and he phoned it in to the station. I haven't heard anything more concerning this, I feel it's pretty face value gore tactics to eek me out. It worked, I was disgusted. Clearly someone has access to my house at their will, so the police will be changing all of the locks this evening. 

Tangent: I would like to say that the police have been very helpful in all of this. I know the general opinion towards cops, even I had some pretty hard feelings seeing some of the articles, but they're not all evil.

Afterwards we went to empty the remaining belongings from my vehicle. The mechanic kindly offered some cash/trade in value for the useless car that was, from my understanding, utterly destroyed. 

As I had gotten the last of the important things out of my car I checked all the nooks and crannies for last minute items and found my King James bible under the driver's seat. This was certainly not there before. I threw it in my bag to scan at the hotel before I bring it to the police. I found another coded message inside. This time I was smart enough to snap a picture before turning it over (I check in with the police regularly as they still offer an escort to work and school and will give it to them tomorrow). It should be noted that this note was taped right under the passage Matthew 4:10, which seemed almost too ironic to be random. It reads: Jesus said to him ""Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'""

This was a bible I had received when I was confirmed into a church over 10 years ago. I had carried it with me as I moved, even read it as literature, but never left it in my car. It was removed from my home at some point and placed in my car. I hadn't scanned my bookshelves in the time I spent in my home but I am 100% certain this is mine. My name is engraved on the cover.

It was difficult to remain focused in class with even more questions circulating in my head than before. I feel like a useless player in a game. Someone is calling all of the shots from afar, predicting our moves and staying a step ahead of me and the police. Furthermore, who ever is doing this is taking pleasure in all of it. I cannot understand why anyone would choose to communicate in code. I think they want all of this to consume me.

I know a lot of you suggest that this person(s) is trying to harm or kill me but it seems just the opposite. I feel they have had ample opportunity to do so and take more pleasure in the torture of the unknown than inflicting physical pain. I am still puzzled as to why I am the target of all of this, among other complexities, but am sure that many of these questions will remain mysteries without really thinking outside of the box. I need all of your help.

What can I do to stop this? What have I unwillingly gotten myself into? 

I will try my best to update but as the semester ends my time will be even more divided. Hopefully there will be nothing to report in the coming days although that is just wishful thinking. 

[index card](http://imgur.com/vqKAvIG)

UPDATE: As of late last night the code was deciphered to reveal the address of the hotel in which I was staying. I contacted the police and changed locations to a much safer address where I will have a higher level of protection until some sort of end is brought to this investigation. I have agreed with law enforcement to continually post information to the subreddit with their permission, all updates will be reviewed before being submitted. All clues seem to be proactive threats, not reactive to any information that has been discussed on the thread and even if these assailant(s) are using aware of this posting there has been no reason to believe that is will have any interference with the investigation at this time. Most updates have been recaps of the day, not insight into what the police are doing or how the investigation is coming along, and the nature of these posts will obviously remain as such. 

I will try and update again tonight or tomorrow if anything unfolds. "
28ey2d,2,2014-06-17,Getting a Product Management internship or going for software development?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28ey2d/getting_a_product_management_internship_or_going/,"Hey guys, so I'm really interested in doing product management and I feel like I have very little of an idea of how to get there.  

I guess I'll give a little backstory, I was a business major for 3 years, and had various internships during the summer along the way, as I assumed I was getting into either marketing or finance when I graduated.  As time went on, I realized that I really hated all my business classes and had pretty much a 2.5 going into my Junior year.  I took a codecademy course over the summer after my Junior year while at an internship I had, and realized that I was absolutely doing the wrong thing with my life.  I went ahead and quit that internship immediately and decided to double major with Computer Science/Business.  

Now I'm basically going into my 5th year of college (finished with business degree, done with almost all my CS classes and basically doing a year of EE, Calculus, and Physics so I can get the CS degree)

Right now I'm trying to get everything prepared for the upcoming recruiting season but I'm not really sure how PM internships work, or if I should even go for them, because I hear many PMs come from being software developers.  I am not really predisposed to doing either, as I really think I would like PM, but I also like coding and would not be opposed to doing software development for a few years (not sure if I could do it permanently though).

Anyways, here are my questions:

1. Is it a better idea to go straight for product management via internships or try to get an internship as a developer, work for a few years, and then make the switch?

2. Should I have separate resumes for PM/Developer positions?  And if so what should be the difference?  

Here's my current resume, I'm not sure if this is against the rules to post outside of the resume thread, I will remove it if asked to: http://i.imgur.com/aZVaSSb.png

I also still have my older resume from when I was pure business that has the same positions with more detailed bullet points, and another sales job I used to have. Should I use that when applying for PM or should I use the newer one?  In regards to the newer resume, should I try to add more projects?  I have a lot of data structures written in C++ (lists, sets RBTree insertion, etc) from classes, along with other projects but no personal projects yet.  I plan to change that over the next year but I don't think any of this will be in time for fall recruiting.

3. How important is GPA for product management?  I've managed to get a 3.4 as a senior with mostly CS classes, but that still puts my overall GPA at about a 2.94, and I'm sure the EE and math classes are not going to do me any favors.  I foresee graduating below a 3.0 as a distinct possibility, and I would like to go for whatever I have the best chance in, so which choice has less of an emphasis on GPA?

Thanks guys, sorry this is kind of long.  I really appreciate anything you guys know about this.

28eysi,2,2014-06-17,Withdrew from college for the third time while pursuing a CS degree. Looking for a way to put 100 credits of college education to work.,thebeardhat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28eysi/withdrew_from_college_for_the_third_time_while/,"I started out in civil engineering and later switched to computer science. Now I have 100 credits and I'm three semesters from completing a B.S. in Computer Science, though most of the important CS classes are contained in those last three semesters.  

I had an internship last summer with a software developer where I think I learned a lot and did a reasonable job at contributing, given my skills. Now I'm working a miserable manual labor job and I'm feeling quite bitter about having paid for four years of education and spent over four years of my life working towards a degree only to end up in this situation.

I am concerned that four-year colleges will not admit me given my track record, so I'm looking for alternatives. I've considered doing some disciplined self-teaching to round out my knowledge, but I'm not sure about the job prospects for someone without a degree. I'd also be open to getting an associates degree if that will help me.  

I'm looking for some suggestions, some reassurance, and perhaps someone who has seen or been in a similar situation. I've heard lots of conflicting opinions, I can't quite get my thoughts straight, and I'm trying to come up with a concrete game plan to get back on track. If you'd like more details about my situation, just ask. I'd be glad to elaborate."
28f1nv,5,2014-06-17,Rafaa,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28f1nv/rafaa/,"I created an account after years of lurking because I'm just so frustrated and honestly a little scared. 

So about a month ago my roommate up and left without giving a reason why. It's ok though, we weren't very close anyway. However, because we had no warning about his plans to leave and because he left at the end of the month we were left with an empty room and another $600 in rent to make up for. I work part-time in retail and my roommate is doing an internship this summer. We are both full time students and are taking summer courses. So, in other words, we are completely broke. 
We created an ad advertising for the spare bedroom. Honestly, its a steal. The room is very large and everything is new. The previous tenants had wrecked the place so my landlord had remodeled the entire house before we moved in. The carpet is a spotless off-white, the walls are freshly painted, the windows are large and we get so much airflow that A/C isn't even necessary. We live in a suburb in the middle of the downtown near campus so our rent is comparatively much cheaper than other houses. All in all, our house is perfect. Naturally, we got a flood of interested prospective roommates and found one person that we really liked. He moved in a few days later and we were able to give in the rent without having to pay the extra $600.
Now the website we used to advertise the room with is a little funny. You can't remove your ad after you have listed it. It just gets circulated off the site after 30 days and then you're given an option of whether or not you want to renew your ad. We had found our new roommate only after three days of posting the ad and so we still got quite the number of interested renters. I read all of them. Most were older people looking for a cheap place to crash at while they worked in the city during the summers. Others were students like us taking summer courses in the later semester. A couple of older people replied and we even had a few soldiers reply. Most of them were respectful, others were more demanding and some were rude but there was only one reply that got me feeling uneasy.
A man or woman, I'm not quite sure, by the the name of Rafaa had emailed. His/her reply was different from all the rest because unlike those that were polite, funny, written in broken English and horrific grammar -Rafaa was erratic and desperate. 

My name if Rafaa I am looking for a place now now now. PLEASE PleaSE please please email or call me back! Please i need a place NOW I am ready to move in Tomorrow! Please please please email me back~!

I had chuckled and instantly deleted the message. There was no way I was going to respond to some crazy lunatic. A few days had gone by and I received a second e-mail from him/her. I won't repeat it since it is practically the same as the first. Still I didnt reply thinking he/she would get the hint after two unreplied e-mails. He/she didnt. More and more of the same e-mails kept popping up. I listed the sender as junk but I still received e-mail notifications on my phone so it was harder to ignore when Rafaa's name would pop up. It happened so frequently that I just kinda became accustomed to it. I didnt tell my roommates because I didnt think there was anything really to tell...its not like anything happened. But today I told them.
We were reviewing for our exam in my International business class when I noticed my phone flash. I unlocked my screen and saw that Rafaa had e-mailed me again. I opened it up out of boredom and found the receiving message:

hi i came there several times i recognize your house and i guess i know your street and anyway I came again today and looked around the house. You left your blinds open and i could see nobody was home so i LEFFT YOU A MESSAGE UNDER YOUR MAT. Please cal me back when you see this. i need to move in NOW. 
I called my roommate after my class and told her everything. She was freaked out and refused to go outside. She did, however, close the blinds and made sure all the doors and windows were locked. She was waiting for me inside by the front door when I walked up the driveway. Even before I got to the front door I could see a slip of paper under our welcome mat. 
I wish I could say the note itself was scary but it simply had his name written on it and his phone number was crudely scribbled down in red crayon. I called the landlord and he told us to call the police so I called the non-emergency hotline and after a few minutes of explaining everything to the police officer he just told me that since nothing had actually happened and no threats were made that we would just have to live with the harassment. I was resigned and thanked him curtly.

But see, here's the thing...we didn't post a photo of the outside of our house, we didn't list our address and we didn't even give out any landmarks so how did Rafaa know which house was ours? "

I'm an EE student right now with my sophomore year just ended and lately my GPA has plummeted. After my freshman year I was around a 3.6 but now am down to a 3.4. I'm pretty concerned about job prospects, since I didn't get any internships when I applied this year, and while I do have a research project, I want to get in to a decent Masters program or be able to get a reasonable job after graduation, and with my current GPA trend, I'm scared that that may be impossible.

I'm going to be a freshman studying computer engineering and I'm just not that excited about the college. I'm getting nervous. 

Everyone talks about how much they love their college and I'm not that enthralled. I got a 29 on the ACT and I've taken 7 AP classes. Student council, a couple other activities, no sports. Could I have done better than UC? Should I have done better? 

I only went here because the campus was nice and it wasn't too far away, but should I have picked differently? I know the coop program is great, but does that even mean much? Couldn't I have gotten an internship on my own anyway?

I guess I'm nervous because I honestly didn't put that much thought into picking a college and I'm regretting that. I'm not proud to be a bearcat. I'm not sure if I made the right choice and I'm scared of what my future will be like with the choice I've made."

28furq,2,2014-06-18,Hello! I am a student seeking your advice and feedback.,consultingeric,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/28furq/hello_i_am_a_student_seeking_your_advice_and/,"Hi!

I am currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in business administration. (I was recently accepted to the Haas School of Business for the class of 2016!) 

My career aspirations are to become a management consultant and I thought through this subreddit, I can be genuine about my concerns and ask for advice for my future.
My biggest dilemma and my main purpose for writing this post is because I was unsuccessful in securing any summer internship. Being the clueless sophomore I was, I spent the entire three months (March - May) blindly applying to online job posting on sites such as indeed.com hoping that at least one would reply (it did not happen). I also became an INROADS candidate but I was also unsuccessful in securing an internship through that process. So my questions are-

From this day on, how should I spend my summer to prepare myself to become successful when on-campus recruiting begins in the fall? (other than case practices, which I have been doing religiously)

Should I continue to apply to internships that are posted daily on indeed.com or am I just wasting my time?

If internships are out of the question at this point (totally my fault for not preparing myself), should I look for volunteering opportunities?

What and where is my best chance in securing an internship? (paid or unpaid, I just really want use this summer to be able to grow myself professionally, build my communication skills, and also build relationships with management consultants - a mentor I can talk to about my career aspiration)

Are there any management consulting book recommendations you have for a student such as myself? 


Also, I am a volunteer coordinator for a nonprofit organization on campus that pairs university students with 1st - 8th grade mentees and through this experience, I was able to realize how big of an impact mentors can make for their mentees. So I was wondering if there are any management consultants in the Los Angeles area with some free time, I can treat you out to some great German hotdogs in Little Tokyo or some Tom-n-Tom coffee in Koreatown! Such a coffee chat would be a tremendous help for my career aspirations and it would be fully appreciated.

Thank you in advance!


any constructive criticism to how I approached this subreddit would also be fully appreciated!

28gbp2,5,2014-06-18,"Got very sick, have no internship arranged for the summer. Too late? Should I freelance? Where to start? (repost from last week, didn't get any answers)",AladdinP,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28gbp2/got_very_sick_have_no_internship_arranged_for_the/,"The title basically says it all. I would like some kind of CS job experience this summer. Because I was ill for about 2 months, the plans I had before fell through, so now it's early summer and I am still without an internship. Is freelancing/working remotely a realistic option for someone without any work experience? For the record, I do have some impressive-sounding school projects to put on my resume, I'm strong in a number of practical programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, MIPS assembly, Javascript w/ other web technologies) and have learned the basics of a number of others. I have dedicated a lot of my own time to learning development best practices along with several technologies. After working with others, I would rank myself as in the top 10% of programmers in my class, although there is no way to communicate that on a resume.

I have a friend who dropped out of college to start a company that is willing to have me work with him for a few months, but

- The company has been around for 2 years and has been held afloat by funding from a startup accelerator in Cleveland. I know the initial funding was $20,000. They are probably provided free housing as well, since they live in a fairly swanky yet nearly completely empty apartment.

- There are only 3 employees, including my friend

- I suspect there will be low/no pay. When I asked him if there would be pay, he said ""Kind of? I think we could pay you, yeah."" His tone of voice didn't give me much confidence.

- The company is at a critical time in its lifecycle, as they only just demo'd their product after 2 years of work. This is a make-or-break moment, and I don't want to deal with the possibility of my internship being interrupted prematurely

As such, I would rather make money and save that connection as a last resort. I like the idea of working in a startup environment, but the simple truth is that I need cash right now."
28gl6d,1,2014-06-18,"Getting an internship oversea (in the valley) from Montreal, Canada?",HattyEngineer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28gl6d/getting_an_internship_oversea_in_the_valley_from/,"So, everyone has heard of Waterloo and how it's a feeder for the silicon valley companies. Recruiters go there every semester and hire students to work at the big 4 plus some startups.

The thing is, what can you do to get an internship when tou don't regularly have access to these recruiters? I don't think I go to a bad school, in fact it is a pretty good school for its software engineering program (also has clubs that win yearly engineering competitions in california), but I feel like the main barrier is the language (french), even though mostly everyone speaks english on a regular basis.

I know the school has partnerships with over 100 organizations/companies around the globe, especially in the US, for internships and studying abroad, but nothing in the valley. I also know Google (from their Montreal offices) and Microsoft (more rarely) come to the school for networking events, but it's not that common.

So, how can I get in contact with the appropriate people to make myself known? I have good marks in the program and I am part of multiple extracurricular projects, but I just need to know where to begin because it seems so unattainable. I really want to know what it's like to live up down there and an internship would be a good opportunity."

Y'all seem to enjoy my tales of woe (and/or WHOAH!) from my little Midwest cable company internship.

Little background: I'm working here for the summer to make a little money between semesters at college, and to build my resume. Typical internship stuff. We're located in a town about 15 miles away from my hometown, and this place is known for having *VERY* high-achieving citizens who have many discussions about books and such. And by that, I mean it's a buncha rednecks who wouldn't understand a late notice on their bill if it smacked them in the face.

We're not tech support per se, but we handle billing and work with tech support closely. We fob tickets off on each other, complain about management, and hang out in the breakroom avoiding work together.

We recently hired a new supervisor. Now, I can understand having a bit of a hard time getting used to things at a new office. However, she's been here about a month longer than I have, I've learned how to do everything she does and more, and I'm the intern. This is a story not about a dumb customer, but our dumb supervisor. We'll call her DS.

When a customer moves, we have to update a couple databases. And really, what that entails is you opening their account, clicking ""update"" on the service and billing addresses, and typing in the new address. It's a little more complicated than that, but for the most part, that's all we have to do.

DS went on vacation this week. However, last month, she took a phone call from a customer who wanted to move their service/billing address. Simple enough, right?

Ha! Don't make me laugh.

She told them that we'd take care of it, opened a ticket, then closed it, saying she'd fixed everything. Not even close.

Yesterday, the techs were supposed to go out and do an activation for this customer, and, tools in hand, bravery in their hearts, and, quite possibly, whiskey in their water bottles (we deal with VERY dumb customers), they went to the service address on the customer's account. That's where I and my brave ~~sidekick~~ coworker who trained me come in. Well, mostly her, I just sat to one side and died of laughter. We'll call her B.

The scene: INT CABLE_COMPANY FRONT OFFICE, DAY.

A TUMBLEWEED DRIFTS THROUGH, WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE A) WE'RE INSIDE, AND B) THIS IS IOWA.

TWO INTREPID CUSTOMER SUPPORT EMPLOYEES SIT AT THEIR DESKS, SIFTING THROUGH TICKETS DILIGENTLY.

AN EAGLE SCREECHES IN THE DISTANCE. THE PHONE RINGS.

&gt;""Thank you for calling Cable_Company, this is B!""

&gt;""Yeah, this is T (one of our techs).""

&gt;""What's up?""

&gt;""The activation we're doing? Yeah, that house burned down. As in, it is a pile of rubble. And it's not terribly recent.""

[confused_nathan_fillion.gif](https://imgur.com/2VzmC)

all_of_my_wat.jpg

We're slightly confused by this. Why would the techs get sent to a burned down house...? Then, B realizes what's going on, and I see a vein start throbbing in her forehead. She opens up the customer's ticket list, and finds the closed ticket from DS, which states that the customer's address has been updated, and that their old address had BURNED DOWN. She then opens the account. No changes have been made to their address since they became a customer. So, we've known for forever that their house burned down, but she didn't feel that that would be, you know, relevant information for the techs to know. And because of the mix-up, we can't do the install for a long time. WONDERFUL.

We got it sorted out, but that's another thing to put in our file of ""Stuff That DS Can't Do Without Screwing Up"". Also in that file: Running our credit card machine, locking doors, and counting money.

TL;DR: You'd make a terrible Dale Carnegie.

28gniz,1,2014-06-18,Need Career Advice ASAP!!,Greece_Lightningg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28gniz/need_career_advice_asap/,"I am going to graduate in about a month and a half, after this summer semester.

I've also been an intern at a company, since January 2014. This current employer of mine has average to above average ratings on salary&amp;benefits. Plus, I've always gotten good reviews from my supervisor on my work, so I was expecting an above average offer for a full-time position. 

However, I was only offered 50K, while others whom I've helped with (what I consider) simple CS concepts got slightly better offers at different companies. 

Thus, this offer feels like a slap to the face for me, cause I know I'm worth more since I already have 1.5 years of experience and a good GPA. Plus, I've only started my CS major/career not even 3 years ago, and am already in a position to graduate. 


My current plan is to accept this offer because I have one week to respond. But I also have interviews coming up with Amazon, and a couple of other CS firms. Plus, after such an offer, I will put more effort into actively looking for better jobs. Thus, my questions are below. 

Questions:

1. If I get a better offer, would it be okay to ""burn the bridge"" and leave my current situation?

2. How soon is too soon to leave a company?
I still have a few months on my lease, so staying put for a few months is the plan, but after that I want to go go go!


Thank you in advance, and I look forward to reading your replies as I really need the advice of others with a lot more experience than me. 
Best of luck in your endeavors as well!"

I am a current University Student seeking a STEM major, and I got off the phone with a potential employer. Initially the company called me to set up an interview about another position I applied to last week. After some discussion about my abilities and school the caller informed me that they have a student internship position for the summer that would be paying about $8.50/hr.

I've been seeking an internship since before the Spring semester ended, and I'm happy someone is finally interested in me. Now the thing is; the pay isn't too great, and the commute to this place would be about 30-40 mins one way for me. That being said I'm not sure if I should accept for $8.50/hr if the interview (which is tomorrow) goes well. 

Do you guys think I would be able to negotiate salary on this kind of thing? And even if I accept I'm not sure if the experience is worth the pay. I used to make anywhere from $9.50-$15 per hour at previous jobs."

[Hey Sean, I'm starting from zero in the graphic novel world, meaning I've read nothing. Where would you steer me out of the titles you've worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciaf86d?context=5)|It really depends on what type of stories you go for. Walking Dead is our most popular, and it's fucking great, but by now you probably now whether it's for you or not. We got a couple flavors of crime: Thief of Thieves (heists), Dead Body Road (revenge), &amp; Ghosted (supernatural). Manifest Destiny is our newest hit; pure action/adventure and monster hunting across America. Invincible is by Robert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead, and it's really the only superhero book you ever need to read. Poke around www.skybound.com to check them out, and maybe you'll find something else that peaks your interest.
[Hey Sean! Love the work you do. I'm a big fan of having multiple points of view in the letter section. AND the fact that you still make a point of even having a letter section. So thanks for that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia8bst?context=5)|As long as we get letters, we'll have letters pages. That interaction is hugely important for us b/c a) we're blowhards and b) we all get to know each other better. I'm actually supposed to be doing Letter Hacks now, shit.
[Question #2: With a new comic book movie coming out every week or so how come there are no Image books on the big screen? Or even direct to video? I think Invincible would work wonderfully in an animated fashion like DC's animated movies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia8bst?context=5)|2) I honestly don't know, but I think most Image books would be better suited to television anyways; that's certainly a place you'll see more of Skybound. A defunct Invincible screenplay exists somewhere... and an animated movie would be dope.
[What do you typically do as a comic book editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2q07?context=5)|Develop new titles. Work with the creative teams to assemble the book, which covers everything from story notes to setting schedules. Work with the fine folks at Image for production/marketing/friendship purposes. Tell Jonathan Chan at Image that I will buy him beers for his help and never do it. There's more, but this is what's coming to mind first.
[Umm, I put together a company newsletter, can I intern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3ey6?context=5)|Current intern Stephen aka ""The Little Rooster"" would be upset if you displaced him.
[How did you become a comic book editor and do you have any advice for people interested in being one as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3ttj?context=5)|I used to edit romance novels and applied for a job in collected editions at DC. Bob Harras hired me, and when he was promoted, he suggested I apply for mainline editorial, which was during the development of the New 52.
 |Advice... living in either LA or NYC helps. Check that Warner Bros career website. They'll be hiring plenty of folks in the next 10 months. 
[I'm from New York actually so this advice helps me a great deal. Thank you so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia6fkq?context=5)|Good luck! Marvel didn't hire me before I even worked for DC, so be persistent. People say it helps to know someone, but I had no connections to anyone in comics, so anything's possible.
[What was the most difficult arc of The Walking Dead to edit? And has there ever been anything in the story you have felt particularly strong about editing out or changing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia39cj?context=5)|All Out War, but only b/c of the accelerated schedule. Charlie and Stefano and Cliff are champs and really none of the issues came down to the wire. Hardest part was doing Letter Hacks b/c you'd be responding to an issue that just came out, and seriously guys, so many letters.

[Hey Sean -Thanks for the AMA!- more for your romance and urban fantasy editing- Best thing about working with authors and worst? Have you ever hated a book you've edited and if so, how do you deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2pw8?context=5)|Exchanging ideas to help fulfill a writer's vision, that's the best. The collaboration. The worst... when you're not synched up. You gotta be on the same page.
 |Hated... sure. You try to figure out what about the project appeals to its intended audience and make that work. But you have to treat it as professionally as any other project.
[If you could change one thing that has happened in the walking dead comics, what would it be? also favorite character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciaalvj?context=5)|I like what they did with Shane on the TV show, so that dynamic could've been played out further in the book. But his death gave that first arc a helluva finish, so I'm not inclined to mess with anything.
 |Favorite character... Jesus. He's got a certain je nais se quoi.
[How are you? Quick question, What's your favorite comic series that you have read/reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia30yu?context=5)|My favorite series ever is Preacher, with a lot of Vertigo from that period coming up close behind (Transmet, 100 Bullets, Deadenders). Planetary's pretty perfect as well. Love &amp; Rockets for sure. 
[I hear Preacher is being made into a TV series as well...will you watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3cl7?context=5)|With Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg &amp; Sam Catlin involved, for sure. You hire the right talent, then set them loose.
[Hey Sean, just wanna say that the books being published by Skybound and Image Comics are some of the highest caliber comics ever to be published!  I was wondering, how has the increasing digital market affected how you edit? Are you more conciouss now of the restrictions of digital comics, and as such edit works to fit that medium?  Thanks so much for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2jn8?context=5)|Digital hasn't really affected my editing process. We did try out releasing our TECH JACKET DIGITAL miniseries digitally--which is why we called it DIGITAL, I guess--and that worked so well, we're launching a new regular series by the same creators next month... but right now print still makes up the majority of our sales.
[What comic do you enjoy getting to edit before it comes out from Skybound? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia66lw?context=5)|My current favorite book to edit is the one we'll be announcing next month.

Really opens up this incredible world of science adventure... which Joe Keatinge and Khary Randolph and Dave and Emilio are realizing perfectly.

Clone traffics in some pretty disturbing characters/imagery. In Clone #13 an electronic bull ejaculator is used on a human. Also, pretty much all of the DC Flashpoint miniseries. Lo siento.
[Wait, so the Tech Jacket who fought in the Viltriumite War isn't the same Tech Jacket going now?  Where can I find more information on this?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia4kuh?context=5)|It's TOTALLY the same Tech Jacket. NOT a reboot. TECH JACKET DIGITAL picks up during the Viltrumite War (where Zack's fighting those Invincibles). The new ongoing tells a brand new story, with new villains and lots of other new stuff. Out July 2nd.
[As an editor you must get really immersed in the series' that you are involved with, that being said; who was the hardest character that you had to see die in the walking dead comics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia5f8o?context=5)|TWD &amp; MY LIFE SPOILERS.
 |It was from before I was editor, but Glenn. The length and intensity of that sequence... so much dread. And within a month I got the job offer from Skybound, so it all feels like part of the same thing.
[Good afternoon! My question is in regards to Clone. I am LOVING this book but want to know if there is going to be a chance for any spin-off titles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3g12?context=5)|We don't really approach any of our titles looking for spin-offs.

I work on the comics. But I'm guessing they've probably filmed the first couple episodes by now.
[In the most recent letters to the editor (is this what they're still called?\), it seemed there was some reprimanding for revealing how long exactly had passed between #126 and #127. Is this because Kirkman wants it to be vague on purpose or doesn't want to reveal it just yet? Can you tell us how long has actually passed :\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciauins?context=5)|Letter Hacks! Not reprimanding, more a reminder that anything said in Hacks is not continuity. And that Robert should read the letters page more carefully. :)
 |How much time has passed? A while. It's for sure been a while.
[What was is like coming on at the beginning of Outcast, versus editing something already established like Invincible and The Walking Dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3h6f?context=5)|Main difference was starting up that working relationship with Paul Azaceta.

[Hey Sean,  Avid reader of Image books and otherwise - I'm glad you're doing this AMA, because I've always been curious about Skybound's branding - or lackthereof.  Many of my friends, avid comic readers, don't even know the name Skybound - and some of them read TWD. I've had several friends just assume ""Skybound"" was a merchandising company. Even with the success of AMC's TWD and the TWD book, the Skybound logo is rarely seen or the name heard. For one of the most successful comic publishers out there (and definitely the most successful of the Image companies\), this seems really strange.  When people talk about TWD, or even Manifest Destiny, people don't say ""Skybound"" - they say ""Image.""  With such a slew of successful books, why does Skybound care so little about name-branding - and, on the heels of that, with the success of Manifest Destiny and Invincible and the Invincible Universe, why does it seem like you just rally around TWD?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2nwr?context=5)|We care about our branding a lot. We've put in a lot of work to individualize the trade dress across all our titles; before it was a more standard look. Over the next couple of years, you'll see the logo in new places, for instance, our movie AIR, or the video games our Interactive division is working on. But we also depend on fans like you to set these folks straight :) 
[Rereading, I think I may have come off a little antagonistic - I just love the Invincible Universe and get irked when people don't understand that it's not ""just another Image book.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3186?context=5)|There is no such thing as ""just another Image book""! That's what makes Image so great. That's Marvel/DC's corner.

I'm an undergraduate student studying math and CS, and I'm trying to find a better internship opportunity for the summer of 2015. I'm especially interested in working with cyber security or national defense someday-- companies like Boeing or the the government are ideal.

Currently, I'm only interning as a web developer for a startup, so I'd really like to enhance my resume by interning during the winter this year. My uncle happens to own a company in China that works with cloud computing, so I thought that this would be a great opportunity for me to learn a few things over winter break. However, my dad (who works for Boeing), mentioned that some US companies don't even recognize experiences in China as valid. Is this true, and if so, which kinds of companies do this? I'm trying to get some more information on this so I can decide if I should take on the opportunity in China for the winter break. 

Thank you!"
28hdrf,3,2014-06-18,I failed out of college- twice. What colleges would consider a transfer student like me?,Hopeful_Transfer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/28hdrf/i_failed_out_of_college_twice_what_colleges_would/,"
My story is quite long, so please bear with me. When I was 17, I went to a large state university and performed very poorly. To be clear, I didn't get kicked out, but I was put on academic warning during my second semester and I left shortly thereafter. I moved back home and signed up at the local community college where I did ok the first fall semester because my family was on my back, but pretty much failed spring semester. Unfortunately, at the time, I did not have the maturity or the motivation to complete my degree. 

After this, I got a full time job where I worked for two years. During that two year period, I completed an internship that changed my life and gave me a firm idea of what I want to do career wise. I also received treatment for the depression that was, in part, crippling me. At 21, I went back to community college. Since then, I've been on the Dean's List every semester while continuing to work full time.

In December, I will be graduating from my local college with an Associates degree. I am supposed to start looking at colleges to transfer to and I'm terrified that no school will accept me due to my less than stellar academic record. I am a member of several organizations at my local college and I've managed to raise my cumulative GPA to 3.1, but I am haunted by the mistakes I made when I was younger. I was very immature, and I suffered from severe depression, and I did not take my education seriously-- I take full responsibility for that. After working a menial job full time, I fully understand just how important higher education is, and I would even like to pursue a masters degree in the future.

Are there any colleges out there who would consider a student like me? I'm now 22 and in Fl, if that helps. If you managed to read the whole thing, thank you.

*Nine months later*

The months stuck in Los Alamos had been cruel. The aging AC, designed to cool experiments, not people, lead to a rack of winter coats by the entrance. Anne was increasingly deliberated by her swollen belly: her child, Yusuf’s child, the bastard. *I can’t believe he got me pregnant*, she thought when the disposable tester, taken for safe measure, beeped and lit up with a green light. 

Langton had met them at the elevator with with handcuffs in one hand and a bandaged, blinded Howard Moon in the other. They were whisked away to New Mexico in a blacked-out jet, threatened with death should they leak the details of the Higgs drive’s acquirement. Yusuf was smeared as an experiment gone mad and a terrorist. The official story was that the drive was recovered from a derelict Nurhuil ship conveniently drifting in Terran space. 

As soon as Langton learned that Anne was pregnant, he changed death to abortion. Anne was planning to abort anyway, but some geneticists were brought in by Langley to make sure she didn’t. They made her an experiment. They were stumped at how this happened. The genetic meddling of Yusuf’s kind somehow made them genetically compatible. Anne was given the worst torture possible: carrying the hybrid to term. If there was an abomination, a Minotaur, it would be riding in Anne’s womb.

That’s all they called it. The hybrid, the bastard. She often took off days to just lie in bed, looking up at the ceiling, hoping Yusuf could hear her silent screams of her hate for him. She also walked around the mountains surrounding the lab when she could, looking to get in touch with his spirit to give him a piece of her mind or a cliff to jump off of. At the end of each crisis, however, she could only be angry at herself, skulking back to her quarters.

One day, she found the strength to work again. The administrators were kind enough to coop her up in a desk. Wrinkles had appeared on her eyelids some weeks before. She gained a few pounds. Looking over the latest results from the super-heavy-element-vs-Higgs-field tests, she suddenly felt her stomach jump. She double-checked the results: nothing out of the ordinary. The jumping happened again, but it wasn’t a jump, it was a shove. She reached over to the phone and instinctively called Patel.

“The child, Sam. It’s *here*.”

---

The next few hours were the most painful in her life. Just pain being ratcheted higher and higher, blood curdling screaming. She hated this *thing*, stuck in her body. She wanted it out. It came out with surprising ease after she screamed at how much she hated it. The doctors at the foot of her bed were the ones to get the first look.

“Well, it looks human enough.”

“Is it a boy or girl?” The doctor decided to pop quiz the intern.

“It’d be pretty hard, female hyenas have –""

The doctor almost swung the bundle at the intern. “That’s *spotted* hyenas, doofus. It’s probably a girl, anyway.”

The doctor snipped the umbilical cord and brought the crying, pink, blood-soaked infant over to Anne’s arms. She was very much human, but the nose was slightly more pronounced along with the mouth, had a slightly sloping forehead and the ears were more pointed like an elf. The doctor also noted that her feet were larger than usual, and the calves shorter. There was also a fine layer of short dirty-blond hairs appearing sparsely in some spots. It was normal for babies to have that, he said.

Anne became rocking her child slowly. Patel walked over to the bedside and sat on a stool. The baby girl stopped its crying, looking deep into its mother’s eyes with its big, brown ones. Anne smiled and the baby smiled back. There was more satisfaction in this little moment than receiving a PHD, or helping humanity advance as a whole. This was her little piece of humanity, her greatest work, even if she half-assed it.

The doctor shed his gloves, washed his hands and picked up a clipboard. “Eight pounds flat, sixteen inches. Very healthy one.” He scribbled some notes on the hybrid features on a second sheet. Patel put his signature as the witness. “All I need now is a name, Mrs. Hathaway. You and I don’t want to refer to it as the 'hybrid', or 'it'.”

Anne thought for a second, then remembered Yusuf’s last question and her answer. It was so out-of-the-blue back then. How could he have known? “Edith.”

“An Ed. That’s a nice name.”

“It is.”

 I have couple months self taught programming experience, still very new at this. If I was put in an internship now, I wouldn't be able to contribute much, if anything. 

So what level of experience and knowledge do most companies want from a student? Am I thinking too far ahead? Should I just chill the fuck out and continue learning to program until I feel competent?

    Country of purchase: USA

    Budget range: $200-$700 (the lower the better)

    Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): taking notes in class, some DJ’ing, use for data transfers (I work in IT support at my school) connecting remotely to my desktop to video edit, maybe some minecraft if possible.

    Screen size preference: 12.5-15.6

    OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows

    Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): being able to run minecraft above 30fps would be nice

    Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): maybe a video card for CUDA or Open CL so I would not have to connect remotely to my desktop all the time to edit

    Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): supplier &amp; self support

    Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): Any

    Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Looks are not a big deal

    Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

    Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Low weight

    Build quality -vs- Low price: Build Quality

    Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance

Would you pay a premium for something that has: Nothing

    High resolution screen: It would be a plus

    A great keyboard: As long as it works and has a decent feel, that’s all that matters

    A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Same as above

    Great audio: no, I’ll be using headphones and external speakers 99% percent of the time

List any features that are critical: (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) 

-USB 3.0 is a must 
-Touch Screen is a must
-I would love a backlit keyboard
-any dual band/5GHz/AC wireless would be a huge plus
-and an SSD or SDD Cache would also be great
-the longer the battery life the better


In short I would like a lightweight laptop that has a touchscreen, backlit keyboard, and at least one USB 3.0 port all for as cheap as possible while still being a decent laptop that will last me the next 2 years through college, internships, and traveling for work

Few formal programs seem willing to take freshman (I'm Canadian, so fewer options) and the ones that do are highly competitive, so I am looking to create some of my own opportunities. I am very unsure about which field I am interested in (leaning towards Engineering Physics currently which is basically an honours physics degree along with a degree in either mech, elec, materials, or computer engineering. It is a full engineering program and because of the Canadian licensing system transfer agreement is fully accepted by ABET/other licensing organizations. It is not like the unaccredited engineering science programs in the USA.)

I was thinking of trying with some of the smaller engineering companies in my city as I have heard that the programs of the larger companies are just cheap labour/coffee grabbing/good for government grants with regard to freshmen. These are also very competitive and while I am very dedicated to getting good grades, those are by no means guaranteed. I also think that I might learn more at a smaller firm because it will be less structured. Unfortunately those companies do not seem to have any formal internship programs. Is there any way around this? Should I just walk in one day and ask for one? 

I do have some skills already, mostly in terms of programming (C++, C, Java). I also worked as a political strategist and volunteer for a candidate (I helped him prep for debates, determined where he should place his signage based on traffic flow and wait times, and spoke to some 750 people door to door about him. This was just a city council campaign, so no major media.) I have a decent SAT score (2130), will likely be an AP National Scholar (Canada), and have won several essay competitions, one at the national level. This summer I will have an internship at a small financial services company, to learn about stock markets and investing. 

How do you advise that I proceed? Thanks for the help. "
28jknx,1,2014-06-19,Is an industrial placement abroad worth it? I need some advice,initioterum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28jknx/is_an_industrial_placement_abroad_worth_it_i_need/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions! I promise I did my best to read through the FAQ and previous postings, but didn't find answers quite as specific as I'd like. 

I am a first year CS student in the UK, and in the third year of our course we undertake an industrial placement for twelve months. I am considering looking for placements overseas and am wondering what the long term career benefit of this would be. I am flexible on the field, but would ideally like varied, client-facing work. 

To give you a background on my situation, I am on track for a first in this first year at a top-ten ranked university and will be starting a three month IT Consulting internship in a few weeks. I can speak some French, but otherwise I am limited to English-speaking offices. As the company I am doing an internship with has offices in the USA, Scandinavia and Switzerland I thought I might try and see if I can use my network to organise a placement in one of their other offices (if all goes well and I like it of course!). I'd also be interested in working in Canada.


So specifically, my questions are:

1. Assuming a similar job, will a placement taken overseas boost my employability significantly more than one taken domestically? And in general would it be more beneficial in the US than Scandinavia for example?

2. Are year-long placements in American, Canadian and Scandinavian offices common? 

3. Does anyone have any experiences they could share which may be relevant?


I apologise for the broadness and, most likely, uneducated nature of my questions; I would really appreciate any relevant information and experiences from the community. Thanks!"

I'm going to be graduating this fall, after 5 1/2 years, with a 2.5 GPA in CS. I was undecided until my 3rd year in college. I do pretty well in my programming assignments but fall short on the theory and mathematics.

I have no internship experience, no personal projects, and don't know much past making console applications. I've done a bit of programming using GUIs with Qt for simple games like the 15 puzzle.

I've gone to the engineering career fairs and I've visited a fair amount of companies. I've been rejected by all (assuming no response == reject) and I've posted my resume on my college's career center. The next fair will be in fall and I'm already feeling down about it.

I'm scared that I would not be able to obtain a job in my field because of how much I'm lacking and how poorly I'm doing in college.

I have two months before school starts again and after browsing, I know I'm way too late but I want to get back on track. What steps should I take to bring me back on track? What should I do so that after I graduate, I can at least get a job in my field?"

______________________
Day three came and went without incident or mention of the duo. CCB seemed to get the hint that I wasn't happy about being left in the dark about new staff and probably advised them against approaching me about anything. 

Shortly after Tweedle left my office on day two, I heard level1 answer his phone next door and confirm that he would build two machines. He seemed so happy to be needed, with a sense of urgency that exists only within the confines of naivety and inexperience. He had yet to be broken.

The machines were built. Generations old machines that had gone onto our spare shelf for requests like these. I offered to help deliver and set up the machines. For fun, or so I thought. 

Tweedle and Whippy were positioned in a re-purposed office space that had been used for volunteer mail sorting. 

&gt;Me: Good morning interns!

&gt;Tweedle+Whippy: Good morning Mr. Stix

*They were sitting there. Just sitting and waiting. Had they done anything else yet? Did they go home at night?*

&gt;level1: Hi, I'm level1, I take care of all of the computers and printers and stuff in the building.

&gt;Whippy: Hello level1, it's a pleasure to meet you. Are you who I call if I have computer questions?

Whippy had a higher voice than I had expected, and was well spoken. I was surprised on both points. His question was loaded and I knew it, but level1 was young, driven by the need to be needed... and stupid.

&gt;level1: That's me!

He almost sounded surprised.

There were two old cubicle style desks that came with the building, one facing the other with a partition on each side, blocking the user's view of the neighboring workstation, which was a bit depressing considering that the partitions also blocked the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the parking lot and lake. 

We set up the machines and phones quickly while they stood in the doorway and watched. They didn't speak to each other, just stood there and watched. Something I was starting to get uncomfortably used to.

Now it's training time. The machines are fired up and working and they are both super excited to have phones with their own extensions and even their names on the display. Yay!

I let level1 take care of Whippy while I gave Tweedle his credentials and informed him of our policies. This is where it became apparent just how interesting this internship would be. 

&gt;Me: Blahblahblah policy, email etiquette, blahblah, username password, blahblah.

&gt;Tweedle: Um, so, okay. Great. How do I make an email?

&gt;Me: Outlook blahblah, new email, blahblah formatting, blah, don't reply to all it annoys people, blah.

&gt;Tweedle: Er, okay. So Outlook is email?

*Dun dun dunnnnnnn*

&gt;Me: Oh, sorry, have you never used a PC with outlook before?

&gt;Tweedle: Well...

*He looked at his shoes through the desk*

&gt;Tweedle: I've never used a computer before. We weren't allowed.

*Now I'm taken back. Way back.*

&gt;Me: Who wasn't allowed? 

&gt;Tweedle: Me and Whippy. Our parents didn't let us have computers. They said we didn't need to use computers.

*Um...*

&gt;Me: Oh, okay, well I'm sorry to hear that, had I known I would have started with some basics.

*Crappppp. I'm starting to feel bad for them.* - This feeling would eventually fade. Tweedle looked up from his shoes with hope behind his glasses.

&gt;Tweedle: So... You'll teach me?

level1 looked over the neighboring partition and met eyes with me.

&gt;Level1'sEyes: No. Please. Don't do it. Don't Do It!

&gt;MyEyes: You have to learn. And besides, you told them you're the one to call with computer questions. You practically signed yourself up for this.

&gt;Level1'sEyes: Crap. You're totally right. Why did I run my stupid mouth. Stupid Stupid Stupid.

I turned my attention back to Tweedle with a brand new smile on my face.

&gt;Me: I'll talk to level1 about developing some training and materials for the two of you. We'll have you up to speed in no time.

TL;DR - You should read it. 

EDIT: Wow, never thought I see some of these responses in TFTS. You people are amazing (in a good way).

* Graduating from college in a year (May 2015) with mechanical engineering major/engineering management minor. (In honors program, lots of student leadership, etc.) 
* Took Spanish in high school. Studying to take a B2 or C1 CEFL language test since it couldn't hurt to have that.
* Previous intern and research experience with engineering. 
* Mostly looking for design/prototyping engineering work. 
* Also have a lot IT/technology experience with current computer service job as school. (Open to jobs in that market as well.)
* Countries/areas of interest: Spain (Barcelona best, Madrid area good too), France (Paris), Germany (Bielefeld area in particular), Italy (Venice), or UK (really anywhere but London since very pricey). 
* Other countries that I'm open to: Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada (yes, not Europe), Norway, Poland. 
* S.O. is also trying to get his masters abroad. 

My questions: 

* I'm trying to trim down the countries I'm interested in. Are any of the other countries I'm open to really bad for expats? Are there any cons to these countries right of the bat? 
* Any recommendations for engineering companies in these countries, especially for the ones I'm most interested in? Any contacts/help in that area is much appreciated.
* Honestly, what are my chances here? I know engineering is a plus, but is it a big enough one?
* Any suggestions for how to best contact companies in other countries? I don't want to be offensive off the bat or anything. I've found companies with LinkedIn pages and was wondering of the appropriateness of reaching out to them there. 
* Is it worth the effort of getting a CEFL certification? 
* Any helpful advice or suggestions are very much appreciated. I've been reading the posts here a lot but figured I'd reach out and see what specific advice I could get for myself. 

Thank you! :)

There are only about 5 people on the infrastructure team, 5 on the client support(with a level 1 and 2 below them), and 4 SharePoint App Developers for a company of over 65,000 people, with most of the intranet running on SharePoint sites, although people all throughout the company worry about their own sites.

I interned in the company last year doing Java testing automation and was thinking about staying with the company, but I feel like this summer I am learning a lot about SharePoint and wouldn't mind doing that, and I could pick where I want to live.

Is is safe to say that SharePoint will be around for a while longer? If I applied for a full time job at another company looking for a SharePoint person will I be at a large advantage over new hires, or is 11 weeks not enough time for you to care if someone has worked with SharePoint before?

So let me preface this post by saying that embarrassing typos or random words are probably a result of my iPhone and the fact I wrote all of this one one. Next, by saying I have probably something near 0.5% of the knowledge and experience of half of you, but am actively seeking more; I will explain a bit below as this by itself is pretty worthless. Anyway:

So I'm a young teenager (probably even by standards of local tech shop internship standards) looking for some guidance in the realm of IT and systems administration, essentially; in the form of suggestions on where and how to begin. So here's what I've got so far:

* Background: I've been interested in the internals of computers and software for quite some time now, more so I'm the past 2 years. I've been spending a lot of my time recently working on java applications, building web sites with the usual markup and scripting languages, and dabbling with Python web apps along with getting vps servers to communicate with one-another in my testing/bot dev irc network (I got, and still am, quite obsessed with irc and irc bots recently). I also like to just throw random programs on them that I think are neat, and try as hard as I can to get them to compile properly and configured decently. The usual lampp stuff, bits and pieces of bash here and there, server programs n'stuff. Anyway, next bullet point.
* I'm hoping to work my way up some corporate ladder or career path to become a system administrator someday. Which is why I'm here. I'm a kid with no idea of the job market, this career in general, and would love some advice or really just thoughts on any of this.
* Ideally,I'd land an internship with the local tech shop just for that teeny entrance into the IT field, and cash, that's always good too, hopefully enough to learn further/specialise which'll be my next bullet point.
* Certs/schooling/learning. So far, I've been actively perusing random /r/sysadmin, tfts, and other techy subreddits and administration websites. That's pretty much it, besides the research I do for fixing my broken programs. (Which, albeit, is probably a lot. I'm proud to say that my only tech support calls were manufacturers' hardware defects!) I've heard from multiple sources, read:comment threads, of people saying certs aren't really all that useful in the long run. I'm inclined to agree that experience is probably Betty than papers, but I think getting at least the first level cert in most fields would be a great way for me to get introduced to everything and then work further in specific fields. I've really got no idea what I want to specialise in, if I do end up not going the way of a jack of all trades. Just not something in a data centre, that'd be great. Thoughts?
* Next, degrees? Something IT/networky, but again, would it be worth sacrificing what could be a few years on the job for a paper? I'm on the fence.
* If you could pick five to ten applications that are vital to an admins career that I should start getting familiar with, I'd love to see the list.

Glad to get that off my chest. Hopefully it's not too disorganised and stream-of-consciousness-y.

I'm completely open to suggestions or guidance on any of this, if here's any wizened sysadmins lurking about willing to share their mind. Or, even better, people in the Seattle area looking to hire an eager-to-learn PFY in a year or three ^_^

If any of this is unclear or you're really interested, by all means, pm or ask me some questions in the comments :)

28mc8o,3,2014-06-20,Internship Advice Needed - Backend vs. Mobile+Some backend,mathieconf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28mc8o/internship_advice_needed_backend_vs_mobilesome/,"I have received an offer at two companies, Citigroup in ON, Canada and a startup in Michigan. ( I live in Ontario )

I have heard that working at a startup is much better because I will be exposed to various roles and I will get to do more. A bank on the other hand might be more structured and might have to be a ""code monkey"" since I will only be an intern. Also, employees at banking companies might be busy so they might be too busy to give me work or help me out (according to friends who have worked at banks). However, Citigroup is internationally recognized, whereas a startup in Michigan might not have the name to it when others see it.

At the startup, I would basically be doing mobile development. I will work on their mobile application and implement features. I have minimal experience with a fullscale mobile project, so it might be a good experience for me.

At Citigroup, I will be programming in Java for the backend. I will work on ""Distributed Data Framework"". Not exactly sure what that means but from my understanding it deals with the big data financial transactions. I feel that I would definitely learn some important/cool things from this job. It doesn't seem so simple.

The startup in Michigan pays a bit more than Citi (Canadian software jobs don't pay high!). And also, the startup would get me some American experience so in the future, it might be easier for me to get Silicon Valley jobs (not exactly if it would).

I would like to hear your opinions on the two positions. What would be better in terms of future job prospects. I know mobile is really booming right now but who knows what might happen to it.

Thank you!"

I want to one day have my own business repairing computers and other hardware (or software if it so happens). I posted something similar like this in the engineering students sub and they basically told me to get my A+ Cert (which looks great), but I don't want to rely on a certificate to begin my business (I honestly do not mean to offend anyone who went this way).
The problem is that I want to go to college and earn a double degree in computer and electrical engineering, but when I say that, people say it is too much and that I could earn my Cert and have at it from there. The reason I want the degree is because I will be the first person from my family to graduate from college and high school, and I really enjoy math (even when I suck sometimes) and science. But I was thinking with the experience I would earn from all of those classes and the internships I would earn, I would know a lot more than just receiving a Cert. "

I'll post mine.  As an intern at the company I currently work for, there was a customer that had a critical service running on an older server, no HA, no redundancy.  We had just finished rebuilding it from a double drive failure, so the logical thing to do now that we have it rebuilt is take a snapshot right? 

Oh I was (still am) green as hell from my college days, where everything was running on bitching hardware, and mid-day snapshots weren't a big deal. 

I took the snapshot, and promptly fucked up the RAID card.  Now while hardware failure isn't something I could have predicted, I should have known better than to do a snapshot on a touchy server during the day. 
Lessons learned.

The main problem I am having is that the guy who had recently done this years ago got fired, and he does not remember his password to the CMS or anything for that matter. To add to this problem, he locked the CMS so that only his account could edit it.

We called the people who designed our website, and they said they could reset the website back to where THEY originally designed it so I could be granted the ability to edit things. They gave me the FTP so I could have access to the .html files and images located on our site.

What I told my boss was that we reset everything and just start fresh. I found a nice theme that we could plug in and go from there. Unfortunately we did not see eye to eye and he wants to keep the website as is, but with the ability to change things around. I told him this was not feasible as the code is a MESS and it would take a lot of time to accomplish opposed to starting fresh with a better, more recently designed website. The old website looks like shit btw.

How do I approach this? I told him I could make duplicates of all the .html files so when it gets reset we could just put them all back in to where they started, but I explained to him it would be such a hassle to update deciphering lines and lines of messy code. I wish he just let me start fresh but that simply is not an option."

Client email: Need account set up Ms New Employee and her exchange account created


We have policy on that and remote access to their exchange server so this should be a ten minute job but lets call the client to double check the last name since they use first initial last name as all of their logins and at least once a month we have to redo it because it turns out Doublepopulas was in fact Doundle and they sent us an email with the wrong name.

Cpt:Hello this is CptAdder calling from COMPANY I'm just double checking TICKET has the correct spelling of the new 
employees name here is NAME is that correct?

Intern:Yes it is that's how you spell my name

Cpt:Oh it's your account? (Red Flag) I'll set that up and call you right back


So I create the account, call them right back and I get a little red flag when the intern or whoever they have answering the phones says they will tell BOSSNAME that the accounts created.  But I shrug my shoulders and go on with my day.  fast forward a week we get an angry email from BOSSNAME asking why DIFFERENTNAME does not have an account set up for them.  So I get the email I contact her and forward over the original email.  And this is where the second part of the miscommunication occurs.  See if you can guess the first mistake I did not double check with her.  Because the SECOND mistake is that NAME is the name of the person she asked to call us to put in a ticket.

So I put in DIFFERENTNAME create the account, call back get BOSSNAME and tell her we are sorry and what she asked for is done.  Since she takes 3 hour lunches I have to leave a message.  But she does call back thanks me and we re-close the ticket.

The next day another angry email ""Why did Cpt lie and say he did what I asked that you all do for DIFFERENTNAME?""  My boss comes in and asks me what's going on.  I remote into their server, show him the account setup, I show him the two emails and the thank you call.  As we are both confused we try (And fail) to get BOSSNAME.


Fast forward three days, we send three unanswered emails and about eight calls.  BOSSNAME is back in the office and even madder than we did not call her when she left on her trip because she told us to call her on her cell phone.  I'll note it took us playing the messages back over speaker phone to get her to believe she sad nothing of the sort.  Nor do we have her self phone... nor does her office staff have her self phone because it's private.  


At this point it's been five days for a ten minute job and now at last we find out the first error.  We did not need to set up an account for NAME (Who was the intern who emailed us with his own name for some reason) or DIFFERETNAME (Who worked from home) what BOSSNAME wanted us to do was set up remote access for DIFFERENTNAME.  We both stopped, grabbed every email exchange and looked through them all.  No mention of anything but exchange account, set up an exchange account ect...  Come to find out when she asked Intern what it was called when you access the server from home he told her it was ""Setting up an exchange account""

The confusion all cleared up we all were backslaps and high fives because her Boss did not want remote access to the server from home for anyone but himself and when we asked him he told us No.

So we closed the ticket. "

28nzgb,1,2014-06-20,Question about unpaid internships. What should I do if I think the company is violating the requirements for volunteer internships?,musicalpets,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/28nzgb/question_about_unpaid_internships_what_should_i/,"Hey guys, I'm a high schooler and this summer I've begun volunteering at a local hospital that's quite large and has about ~500-700 interns. We are required to do four hour shifts once a week for three months (minimum commitment). Now searching through here, I saw a post about the legality of unpaid internships:

&gt;
1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school;
2. The training is for the benefit of the trainee;
3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observation;
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded;
5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period; and
6. The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training. 

In the program I'm in, high schoolers must at all times be with either a college intern who is also unpaid and is usually studying to become a doctor or nurse, or another high schooler. If the college intern is going to nursing school, he or she is required to do at least a three month rotation of volunteering at the hospital. (I'm providing this information because I'm not sure if that changes the legality of the situation I'm presenting.)

Rule 4 of the above requirements says that the employer can't have any immediate advantage. I believe the program I'm in is violating that rule: the interns at all times during their shift have company phones (not our own because HIPAA) that the patients or the nurses call when something is needed, for example: 

1. changing bed sheets
2. helping patients use the restroom, giving them baths/showers
3. bringing food and water, sometimes helping feed them, taking away trays
4. Changing adult diapers or providing bedpans when the patient needs them, and then measuring amount of urine and recording it
5. Changing their clothes as necessary
6. Discharging patients (bringing them down to their cars, helping them in, carrying their belongings)
7. Helping the cleaning ladies/janitors/custodians empty out trash bags, taking linen out to bins where they are to be cleaned, and restocking paper towels and gloves

Referring to Rule 3- we don't work under ""close supervision."" Nurses are there but we usually do everything on our own (nurses don't help us bathe, discharge, or feed patients, etc).

My mother also works in the hospital and she has questioned the appropriateness of the type of work we do, but we've never heard of any laws regarding ""volunteer internships."" While she was in ER, she has seen female high school interns be ordered by nurses to help men pee into portable urinals (really just bottles with measurement numbers). They have felt uncomfortable doing it because some have received inappropriate comments from patients before; however, nursing is a field dominated by women. The interns have asked the few male nurses to take care of these types of situations, but they are usually busy tending to other work. 

The hospital is understaffed, as proven by this scenario, which leads me to believe that interns may be ""[displacing] regular employees,"" as stated by Rule 3. And the fact that we have hundreds of unpaid interns also supports this theory.

I'm not sure what to do or who to contact. I myself have never faced any extremely uncomfortable situations, and I don't personally know anyone who has either. During our training, we were told that we were going to do tasks like this and may face unusual scenarios that may push us out of our comfort zone, so it's not like we didn't expect any of this. Also, because it's a hospital setting, I'm not sure if there are different standards that we adhere to.

Thanks for the input, any advice is welcome, and sorry for the long read!

28oeob,8,2014-06-20,Failed two technical interviews and it wasn't because I couldn't get the correct answer.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28oeob/failed_two_technical_interviews_and_it_wasnt/,"At least I don't think. My interviewers wouldn't give me feedback so I don't know for sure. These are internships by the way. 

Earlier this year, I had an interview with Microsoft and I failed first round. It wasn't because I couldn't arrive at the correct solution because I solved the problems pretty easily. My solution to the problem worked and the recruiter told me so. I'm assuming it was because my solution wasn't optimal. 

The question that I - believe - got me was a classic ""determine if two strings are anagrams"" problem. My response was to count the frequency of each character in the array and compare the two, if they're unequal return false if they're equal return true. The interviewer said this works. The classic solution is to sort the strings and then do a linear comparison. My solution was quicker but took up more space. I didn't know the classic answer at the time but live and learn.

This was before my data structures course and I was happy to get the interview at least so I kinda brushed it off and moved on. But I just failed my Amazon interview. Both engineers asked me technical questions and *every* answer I gave the engineers told me I was correct. Looking back, I could of made my solutions better but solutions can always be made better. Even then, my added code wouldn't of changed the Big O of my overall solution so it's more optimizations instead of major changes.

They're a million different ways to tackle a problem, there's no way interviewers are looking for just one particular solution, can they?

The reason I ask this is because I'm a bit discouraged. I thought the major goal with interviews were to answer the questions correctly and as efficiently as possible, but me answering questions and being told I'm correct, just to not get the job later has me confused. Obviously I'm missing something.

I talked through my thought process, maybe I should just shut up and only answer when I have a fully optimized solution? Any advice would help. Thanks. "

28oiap,2,2014-06-20,US-&gt;Poland,CassandraFoghorn,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/28oiap/uspoland/,"Hi,

I'm looking into teaching ESL abroad and from what I'm reading on this board, CELTA is the way to go. I did some research and the British Council has the most highly ranked programs (plus it would be awesome to get a foot in the door with a UK organization). They have courses in Krakow and Warsaw pretty much year round, and since I have an EU passport I could stay and work afterwards. I'm not too familiar with either city but they both look incredible. (Leaning towards Warsaw just because it seems like it might be an easier transition from abroad)

Coming from the US, the exchange rate would be easier on me than the Euro or the Pound, which is pretty critical since I have roughly $2,000 to my name. I graduated last year with an English degree from one of the top schools in the States without loans, but I pretty much drained what little savings I had to live in NYC for a publishing internship and am now back at home in CA. Internship was well worth it, but I'm a woman in my twenties and I want to explore the world while I'm still young/single.

tl;dr 

Want to go to Poland for CELTA, only have $2,000 

How much should I save to live in Warsaw unpaid for four weeks?
(Course= $ 2,000/Flight= $1,000) 

How is the job market in Poland for English teachers/tutors?

Out of curiosity, would being an American English speaker put me at a disadvantage (or vice versa)? Every non-native speaker I know from Europe learned British English, but I'd always assumed that was because Americans couldn't get long-term work as ESL teachers.

28pgr6,1,2014-06-21,I feel completely alone,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/28pgr6/i_feel_completely_alone/,"I feel backed into an inescapable corner where I have no friends because I have no social skills because I have no friends because I have no friends...

I was raised in an extremely religious house and sent to an all boys boarding school. I never questioned any of it and felt ""sorry for the sinners in the secular world"". Make a long story short, I went to college and opened my eyes. Now I consider myself an atheist after going through a breakup and a period where I felt like life had no purpose since there was no god, got over that in a few months after realizing that there may not be a god, but I could live MY life now, not some imaginary sky man's idea of my life. I had only one friend the whole time but he was a bit of a sociopath with no concept of what was socially acceptable or just flat out did stuff to make people feel uncomfortable to see them squirm. My parents don't exactly approve of this so we have a rather rocky relationship so for a while he was the only person I had any human interaction with.

Unfortunately I failed the two semester's during which this was happening. Afterwards I started going to school clubs and meeting people, most of them were understandably unwilling to do anything with my socio-pal but due to a kind of loyalty I hung out with him instead of getting closer to the people I met. Started going on ""dates"" with one girl who I'd see everywhere and we had a lot of fun. Had to keep socio-pal from being around her since she REALLY didn't like him. I put dates in quotes since I was pretty straight forward that they were dates and she said ""you're cute, i'll give you a chance"", but any time I would try to do anything, like put my arm around her, she'd ""playfully"" scratch me hard enough to give me scabs, keep in mind this was several months into us ""dating"". Anyway after about a year (yeah I was really into this girl) her friend died (shot by police after attacking an officer) and she found out about it while hanging out with me. Well we haven't spoken since and after a few months of just getting ignored in person and a few txts she txts me ""oh sorry i just needed time"". Continued to receive the cold shoulder act and eventually went off on her at a party accusing her of leading me on and wasting my time when I'd been straightforward and upfront from the beginning and that if she was ""a blunt person"" as she claimed she would have just said she wasn't interested (with swearing since I was upset and drunk). I stopped getting invited to stuff since they'd rather invite her and gradually lost most of my friends again, leaving me with only socio-pal. 

I recently did what I'd wanted to in the back of my mind for a long time and just told him to gtfo my life. I can count on one hand the number of people I can even ask to hang out, most of my former friends will give me ""busy"" excuses or just ignore me. Several months later I've only left my apartment maybe 2-3 times for cheap bulk food, I've lost weight despite being quite skinny and all I do dawn to dusk is play DotA, Warframe, and EVE. I've half heatedly filled out some job applications but I won't have the money to pay rent even if one hired me today at anything other than $30-40/hr full time. I feel like I've lost all my friends, past, present and will probably quickly lose any I make in the future, and the only people I even have conversations with now are disembodied voices on teamspeak and in-game chat. I deeply resent my parents for the ridiculously sheltered upbringing I received. My GPA is beyond repair in a field where you need an internship to get a job and you need a 3+ GPA to even be considered for one. 

After telling socio-pal to f-off I've taken precautions to protect myself just in case. I've never had any suicidal thoughts before yesterday, but lying in bed after doing nothing but play games for almost 48 hrs, I thought ""I could end my failure of an existence right now"". I was, and am, frightened (upset/confused/disappointed/repulsed I don't know how to describe this feeling) that after never thinking suicide was ever a valid answer this would suddenly pop into, and remain, in my head. This morning I woke up and cleaned my entire apartment which took literally all day. Now here I am, at 2am on a Friday night, not a friend in the world, alone on my computer. At least posting this gives me some sort of outlet as I have no one else I can talk to about this. I don't think I'm to the point where I could actually off myself, but I have zero desire of reaching that point, so thanks for reading something a stranger had to put on the internet because he can't tell anyone in person.

tl;dr no friends, failing college, no job, playing video games all day long. total failure, considered ending it, and that scares me."

* What did you accomplish?
* How soon did you achieve this goal?
* When did you finally feel that you ""fit in"" with the crowd (Coming from a new employee perspective)? 
* How was your first week?

I ask these questions because I've been an intern for about two weeks now, and really haven't accomplished much. My company's code base is quite vast. So I was delegated to mostly fixing bugs and working on application level work. I currently don't understand much of the tools that my company uses. I am worried me not fixing a bug will look as if I'm useless (I understand that most employees view interns as useless!), but I'd like to present myself as if I'm not useless!

Next week I'll be helping a friend build a budget gaming computer. His price limit is around $600, a little over is fine but we are trying to stick right around there.

Like I said above, this will be primarily a gaming PC, but he does have interest in doing some recording for Youtube and eventually wants to pick up a capture card for some console recording. But the capture card would be for later, so just making sure there is a PCI port open is all that is needed.

Here is the build I have thrown together so far. And as a note as well, I will be providing him hard drives to use, I have a ton extra leftover from my Western Digital internship. =P

The price is a bit over what we want and I'm curious to see what you guys think. Maybe going with an AMD processor will probably help.

**My impression from reading around is that for internships / employers, don't really want to look at trivial programs.**

I have never used github before, nor do I understand anything about version control (but my programs are so small that it really isn't necessary). If I should post my code up, do I upload all the separate class files as is or package them into a jar? **OR** do I wait until my programs are somewhat substantial?

He said I should be ready to discuss any of my academic/independent coding projects (Platform, Architecture, Design Patterns, etc). So he was fairly specific. I plan on discussing in-class projects from my two semesters of Computer Science classes as well as assignments from my Data Structures class. As for the independent projects, I haven't done many. I've created a few games (Game of Fifteen, Breakout using the Stanford SPL) but I feel a little underqualified. 

I'm very passionate about computer science. I love learning anything related to it. I have no doubt that this will come across in the interview. But it's gonna be about 35 minutes and I don't see how I can speak for more than 10 minutes at the most about my past coding projects. Am I too worried?

So I'm a third year CS student in India. I've been meaning to apply for an internship for a while, now, but there have been a few hitches with the whole thing.

My university gives me around 2 - 3 weeks of leave, twice a year, nowhere near enough to commit to the average internship. Unfortunately, because of mandatory attendance rules, I can't work on one during the year either.

What other options do I have? I've got a couple of small personal projects; designed a few websites and apps (though that isn't remotely in line with what I want to do). Should I work on open-source? Hunt for people who want stuff made? More personal projects?

Worst case scenario - take a year off? If I'm doing that, I'd like to find internships abroad, too - how plausible is that? I'm assuming it'd be harder for people from developing countries.

I'd appreciate any advice. Cheers. :)"

a short introduction: I'm in my 6th semester of university studying Computer Science for a bachelor's degree. At the beginning of this semester, I started an internship in my department which prepared me for my bachelor thesis which I was to write in the same department with the same supervisor. We got along really well in the beginning, everything was fine so far. But the internship took much longer than I planned or expected, and to be honest that didn't do well on my general motivation. Anyway, additional to that there are some differences of opinion between her and me and also between the coordinator of the department and me. I feel that I don't get along with them anymore and that writing my bachelor thesis there would become a pain in the ass.

Now I'm not sure what to do, because if I step away now I probably won't be able to finish my bachelor's degree this semester and therefore would have to add another semester before starting my master's degree. On the other hand, it would be stupid to just go on like this. I do like my topic, but it is a very theoretical topic and I kind of think that a practical topic like a software implementation would suit me better.

What do you think? I know that this is my decision in the end, but I'd like to see some other opinions on that.

28tnc7,12,2014-06-22,Concerns on targeting the game industry as a junior developer,Delicious_Cookies,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/28tnc7/concerns_on_targeting_the_game_industry_as_a/,"I'm looking for career advice and want to prod some out of the programmers here who are currently or previously have worked in the game industry. I have concerns about whether or not I want to follow my passion and pursue a career there or focus on the broader areas of software development. I'm hoping the questions at the end of this can be answered in a way to provide assistance to any of the junior developers considering a full-time career within the game industry, and if you don't want to read a shitty personal background please skip to the end of the post.

I'm currently a junior going into my senior year of college seeking a CS degree and I've been trying to find that niche/industry of programming that I really have a passion for by looking into open source projects I could contribute to. I'm spending the summer mainly adding to my programming portfolio so I'm not going to be turned away for internships and jobs because of lack of demonstrable experience. I've spent a lot of time using Java (school + freelancing) and writing applets using the core lang, but now I'm at a cross-roads for figuring out where I want my career to actually go and what industry of programming I want to specialize in. 
On one hand, I'm intimidated by all of the crazy requirements I see on job postings for junior developers and internships (1-3 years of work experience with the language, knowledge of a language specific framework, Agile/SCRUM/other software dev practices, experience with VCS in a big project, etc.) so if I were to continue on the Java track I'd be looking for sub-sets to dive into there, most likely by contributing to some open source project but I've yet to find one which interests me heavily. The fields using Java are so diverse that I'm not sure what they are or where I'd want to go, but most job postings I've scoured are enterprise focused so going through the Java EE tutorials would be my short term goal.

On the other hand, I want to jump into C++ for the first time in 4 years (it was my first programming language which I started learning in HS) and begin to learn UE4, and try contributing to the latest UT game using my newly acquired knowledge. This is a huge undertaking but one I feel I'd be willing to put in the time to make worthwhile, and it's an industry which I know I'd enjoy working in and using a language/technology I so far enjoy working in more than Java (currently powering through Accelerated C++ with ease). This has the additional advantage of making me ahead of the curve with UE4, and given UE's track record for industry adoption I think it's a safe technology to bet on. I also have a heavy passion for games and Unreal holds an even greater place in my heart. I grew up with UT2k4 as my first PC game and I spent a lot of time with UnrealED making levels for the servers I played on in middle school. It also led me to looking for a job in game development, and I settled on becoming a programmer but have until now have been focused on software development in general rather than a specific industry like gaming. Having even a small portion of my code contributed to the codebase would be a dream come true.

My main worry with this plan of action is that my area isn't a popular place for any kind of game development, and I'm not sure how the experience I gain over the summer and throughout the school year will appeal these enterprise-focused companies looking for software development interns/junior devs which are close by. I can't exactly move to a better area for the game industry until I've made enough money to trek out there and survive for awhile.

Even if there's no game development industry in the area though, there's a possibility that some of the companies will ask for C++ or be more inclined to hire someone with experience in two primarily OOP technologies (I also have Perl under my belt for scripting), so the knowledge shouldn't be all for naught. Either decision will arm me with experience being a part of a team and working on a large project, which I think is the most needed thing to add to my portfolio at this point.

I'm also cautious of the game industry itself, as I've heard a number of stories about the difficulties of breaking into it as a junior developer.

Questions:
How did you come to choose the game development industry as a programmer?, was it your industry of choice or did you leave another to pursue it? 
How well has your experience in the game industry allowed you to find employment in other areas/industries of software development?
If you had the patience to read through the whole post, am I making some sort of mistake by allowing passion to guide me to game development?

Any comments would be appreciated."

Thanks for all of your advice again, after I saw B  in the hospital, as I said in my first post she disappeared for what felt like hours and hours. By the time I had pestered a nurse enough to actually listen to me she assured me that someone would be in soon to hear me out. She explained that I had been found unconscious by the side of a road in the early hours and been taken straight to hospital for rehydration and some treatment of minor flesh wounds.  


‘Is my w…wii…wife here?’ I stuttered, holding the nurse’s arm to stop her exiting. 

‘Yes’ she smiled brightly. My face immediately fell. It wasn’t just some sick drug-induced fantasy, she had tracked me down to this hospital. I felt itchy all over, wondering if she had implanted any more chips.


‘Please help me’ I begged quietly, tears filling my eyes. 


‘Just try and calm down’ she explained in a reassuring tone, patting my arm.


‘Everything is going to be fine, you just need to stay calm’ She explained. 


I noticed her picking up my chart and scrawl ‘Wife confirms untreated psychosis. Pt still in episode and delusional’. She replaced the chart and left before I had a chance to construct a word.


 I needed to get out of this hospital bed. I went to sit up but this only caused a massive head rush. I immediately laid down flat again and swallowed vomit. I tried to move my legs but felt nothing but searing pain in the right one, which had previously held the microchip. I clutched the bedsheets, scrunching my hands into tight fists. I didn’t have the strength to stand up.


Before I had any chance to dwell on this another nurse had entered my room. An attractive young blonde, donned with rubber gloves and a plastic apron, with a kind smile. This was the first thing that had put a slight smile on my face in the last 48 hours. I know, you’d have thought I would have learnt my lesson but, clearly not. 


‘Sir, your wife has explained the situation to us and we’ve finally got round to identifying you’ 


‘Nurse’ I said, quickly.


 ‘My wife, my wife she’s abusing me’ I said, quietly. 


 She looked at me empathetically and nodded understandingly. I breathed out a deep sigh of relief, finally, everything was going to be okay.


 ‘We all understand here, don’t worry’ she reassured 


‘Now, I need to give you some medicine so I’m going to insert a little needle into your hand’ 


She unwrapped the IV and inserted it, almost painlessly, into my hand. She then turned to the trolley and drew liquid from a small vial using an injection. 


‘What medicine’ I enquired, confused. 


Her face showed slight annoyance at my query. ‘Just relax and hold still and let me administer it sir’  


Maybe the events of the last couple of days had stripped me of trust for any person or maybe I was just finally coming to my senses but I drew my hand back and started to struggle out of my bed. This wasn’t right.


‘Stop that, right now’ she hissed at a low volume, pinning my head down with surprising force and aggression. I started to yell for help to no avail, it was too late I felt the warm spurt of foreign liquid course into my veins.  


And then black.


 I woke up and it felt like my eyelids had been sewn shut, there were so heavy. And my mouth and throat felt like they were made out of cotton. With great difficulty I managed to prise them open with all the muscular force that my weary face had remaining. The room was dimly lit, I could make out nothing in my environment more than a foot or so away. I looked down to my arms and legs. I was naked. I was tied to a chair. There was also a thick wad of fabric stuffed into my mouth. I silently screamed. Suddenly, the room was flooded with light. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Many familiar faces were in the room, arranged in a circle, set in the same position as I. Clotheless and tied up. 


 My 8 fuck buddies of the past and present. 


And me. 


Fuck, and B.


I could hear the dull, terrified moaning of the girls ring through the air as B approached me, a cruel smirk on her face and her arms behind her back. 


‘Hello’ she laughed. 


I could feel the pounding of my heart in my ears.


 ‘Did my good friend get you off for a nice sleep then?’ she enquired, mockingly meeting my gaze at eye level. Uncontrollably, tears were streaming down my cheeks.  She walked over to the first girl on my right. It was Anne, I remembered her well as she was my first affair, about four years ago now. Sweet brown ringlets framed her elvish face. She was an intern, she’d first sucked my dick for the opportunity to shadow me and the guarantee of a good reference.  


‘Anne’ B said, tracing the outline of Anne’s quivering lips with a look of fake empathy on her face. ‘The 21st of July 2010, it went on for two months’ she explained.


B ran her finger down her naked chest, between her small pert breasts and down the firm contour of her abdomen. Out of nowhere a flash of silver over her neck and Anne slumped over, limp. Blood was gushing out of her neck and formed a bloody apron over her torso. I grunted deeply in shock, cutting my lip open with my teeth.


 ‘The game has begun’ B grinned, dabbing at Anne’s throat with her index finger and tasting the blood.  


And the game continued, the same practice of identification and murder was the fate of the next girl, and the next girl, and the next. You get the idea. Some I barely remembered the faces of but at least had some brief recollection of their body. I tried my best to keep my eyes closed after the third, Beth-the girl who served me coffee and I had fucked in my car in 2011, had been killed.  B kept demanding I keep my eyes open, even going to the lengths of physically opening them and threatening me with the blade. 


Finally the last girl, who I was still currently, seeing was to be met with her fate. Yvonne was sweating, her face was as pale as a sheet, and tears were streaming out of her eyes and although inaudible I could tell she was begging for mercy through her moans past the cloth in her mouth.  


‘Yvonne, ongoing since January 2014…’ B stated, looking Yvonne in the eye, familiarly. 


‘Notable, mostly due to…’ She stopped, I sensed a slight choke in her voice.


 ‘The affair commenced on the night of my latest miscarriage. She was my best friend.’ she continued, robotically. 


 I clenched my teeth, waiting for her throat to be torn open and blood to piss out  but was instead met with the sight of her being gutted. Viciously plunging the knife into her abdomen over and over, B screamed in satisfaction as she did it. Afterwards, she had something in her hand. It wasn’t…Vomit filled my mouth.  It was a foetus.


‘Fitting’ squealed B. 


She threw it on the floor, despite its appearance of a congealed mass of blood I had seen too many miscarriages to mistake it for anything else. B knew before, of course. That’s why she had chosen that method of killing. 


‘Now for you’   


I looked into her eyes as she approached me, I heard the clinking of the blade on the floor as she got closer which gave me some sense of relief amongst the dizzying atmosphere of death, the metallic aroma of blood stinging my nostrils and the taste of bile acid in my mouth. ‘It’ll be over if you make a single sound, or disobey in any way’ she explained, removing the gag. I daren’t make a sound as I surveyed the room, mounds of dead flesh amongst a sea of red. 


She cocked her head a little and stared at me in absolute silence for a good few minutes. 


‘Lick my pussy’ she demanded. 


I had no choice but to comply so as she thrust her sweaty vagina forcefully into my damp, with sweat and tears, and bloody face. I obediently performed fellatio, moans were escaping from her lips as I did so but I drowned them out. There was no way out. My mind was no longer racing. This was it. She was capable of so much, this had become clear. 



She was going to surely kill me after this. 


Until…. I felt her body noticeably relax as she reached orgasm. 


I bit and tore at her clit as hard as I possibly could and simultaneously pushed my head with all my force into her. She fell to the floor screaming in agony, grasping at her genitalia, writhing, screaming. 


 Adrenaline consumed me and, still attached to the chair, I ran for the door. I realised now we were in my basement, I managed to wriggle one arm free by nearly cutting off its circulation and grabbed the blade so I could free my other arm and legs, which I did. I pushed open the window and darted out into the night.


 I’m naked. I don’t know how far I have run but I didn’t stop until I had fallen to the ground and my face had kissed tarmac. I swear I heard the chorus of angels as a gloved hand tapped on my back. 


‘Sir’


  I turned over and was met with two police officers. 


‘My wife did this to me’ I whispered. 


He looked visibly shocked 


‘Let’s get you in the car’ he said, helping me up with the other officer and them both easing me into the car. When we got to the police station they gave me clothes and I had a very long discussion about everything that happened. The police doctor identified another chip just superficial to my gluteal muscles and one near my spine but he had a detector (usually used for fucking animals) that reassured me that there were no other chips present. 


I gave my address obviously but have heard nothing about that side of things and if she was caught and about the bodies of the other girls in the basement. I’m not sure if I want to know. They have promised me that I will be safe though and I’m going into some sort of protection programme. 


Thanks for all your advice guys. 


I’m sorry I cheated on you, B.

Currently I am in DC doing an internship dealing with Public Policy. When this is over, I am headed (through a national volunteer organization) to the state of Washington as a legal assistant. 

I am torn between pursuing an MPP (Masters in Public Policy) or going to law school. Either way, the timing is the issue for me. After my year of national service (to be completed in July 2015), I need to figure out what to do with the year after (while studying for either the LSAT or GRE). Should I get a job after my year of service or take the time off, and live at home, to study and apply to schools?

I just think it will be difficult to attempt to do the process of test studying/taking/applying to schools during my year of service. Or should I attempt this instead? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Also, my dream would be to do the Peace Corps after this first year of national service-but I am not yet eligible to take my citizenship test (you have to be a one in order to apply) until 02/16 : ("

I'll be a college senior in the fall. Right now I'm taking a summer class on operating systems, and it has made me realize that I want to get into systems programming. So far I've focused on Android development and desktop applications-I've developed a few small applications for both. The only languages I know are Java, C++, some Python and a tiny bit of AVR assembly. I don't have any internships (sucks, I know). So what can I do in the next year or so to make myself hireable in this area? Specifically I'm really fascinated with compilers and language design. Unfortunately my college doesn't offer any courses on it, since we're extremely small (1400 students). We have to do a senior these though, which I would like to use as a tool for what I'm trying to accomplish here.

Thanks for any help!"
28umxo,5,2014-06-23,Need advice on staying as intern at small company.,error35,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28umxo/need_advice_on_staying_as_intern_at_small_company/,"Hi, this summer I'm doing an internship at a small web development company (6-8 people). I'm a sophomore going into my junior year for CS at a four-year school in southern CA.

It seems that the job requirements are very different from the actual work I'm doing. It also seems like my managers want me to perform at a level I'm not currently at. For example, I will be assigned a task and reprimanded for either not finishing it in time or not going by some inferred requirements. However, I feel justified in the time I take to ensure quality and correctness. I understand that maybe some of the comments I receive can be passed as creative criticism but it really doesn't feel that way. As someone used to having good grades and generally being a good employee at previous companies, I feel like a failure every time I get home from work.

I also feel like since the company is small, there is a level of micromanagement that I'm having trouble adjusting to. I feel like I'm scrutinized for the smallest things, even if it's my first time.

I took the position with pay being at minimum wage because I thought I could gain experience and learn the industry (web development). However, I'm learning very little, and I feel like my daily work is very monotone.

With commute and normal hours, I seldom have time to read, code, or work on hobby projects as I could previously. Overall I don't enjoy any hour I'm at work and I'm extremely mentally fatigued afterwards. I know I'm being biased by nature, so I'd like to hear what others think about my situation and if I'm just being a ""wuss"". I know experience at such a company this early in school is very hard to come by, so if I leave, I feel like I'll be losing out on a big opportunity.

Never thought I would say that. A little background first, I've been working at the company for 4 years, 2 years in the IT department as an intern/ part-time as I finished college. The current IT staff is made up of 2 people one that has been here for over 15 years and the other over 7 years. When I started I noticed quite a few things that didn't seem right like a password list for all employees, no documentation, and a lack of organization. Sadly I fell into some of these same patterns for the first year and a half, but now that I have been hired on full time I have resolved to push to get some of these things changed. This is where HIPAA is coming into play because it is giving me quite a bit more support for some of these changes besides just that it is best practice or a risk to the company. After going through HIPAA documents that were referenced here on /r/sysadmin there is a lot more that needs to change and not just in the IT department. 

While I am fairly certain that I will be able to present the information to upper management in a way that they will understand, I am more nervous about upper management deciding that they will take the risk of getting audited or waiting until we get a HIPAA complaint to make certain changes. I am also worried about push back from my co-workers because some of the changes HIPAA requires changes the way they have been working for the last 5+ years. Quick example is that HIPAA requires documentation of policy and procedure in the IT department and I am pushing for even more documentation since we have pretty much nothing right now, but my coworkers are saying that we will need to get approval from upper management to do that because it will take too much time.

I'm looking for advice on dealing with this push back from my coworkers and dealing with upper management not wanting to make the changes that need/should be made.

I can post more detail of what changes I am proposing based on HIPAA and best practices from The Practice of System and Network Administration and what I have read on this subreddit.

There are other issues that I could discuss too but I think that those will be dealt with by upper management. 

I'll try to respond a quick as possible but my desk is in a position where people can easily see my screen so I have to be a bit careful with how much I am on reddit."

Experiences and opinions wanted.,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/28v9v1/admin_specialization_for_overall_higher_salary/,"I currently make a decent living in DC area as a generalist sysadmin working for a large non profit.  Having just celebrated our first wedding anniversary, my wife and I are starting to look more at the big picture and the next 5 years of our lives.  That being said we have started looking at other parts of the country as we both have no desire to remain in DC area for the long term.  Great place to build a resume, but time for someplace new, preferably more laid back and less expensive. Salaries in DC area for IT are overall decently high due to cost of living.  I know that is not true for everywhere in the country where we are looking.  Columbus, Portland, Austin, etc.  

My experience is as follows: BS in Comp Sci, 10 years post college experience and 2 years college internship, no current certifications.  My work experience has been a mish mash of Windows, Linux, Security, and some Cisco pretty much in that order.

If I was going to specialize, maybe even get a couple non entry level certs over the next year while we look, what would be the better choices in terms of maintaining a good salary most places in the country?  Thought about taking Windows all the way to MCSE Private Cloud or Excahnge.  Thought about running with the Linux for LPIC 2-3 and maybe RHCE.  Thought about going full InfoSec, which I really enjoy but I have the least relevant experience at it.

I've never really made any choice Purely for money and I won't make this one Purely for money, but I would like to know my options from other admins about what are some of the most profitable specializations that can carry over to most job markets.

Thanks in advance and sorry for typos, trying to squeeze this post in before a meeting."

__________________________
Tweedle entered, letting the outer door of IT close behind him and approached my office door standing next to level1. 

&gt;Me: So, the question?

&gt;Tweedle: Yes. Um. It's a personal request.

Oh god. 

&gt;Me: And that is...?

&gt;Tweedle: Can I borrow your car? 

&gt;Me: What? No. Tweedle, I'm sorry, I think you should go back to the call center now and continue with your work. I'll see you on Monday. 

Tweedle looked at his shoes, then at level1, this time without tears, then turned, saying ""Yes sir"" and walked out of IT.

&gt;level1: See what I mean? 

&gt;Me: That wasn't so bad, but it was a strange request. It'll be fine. 

Back to user migrations which was slow going due to some strange problem with our MAPI that ITDIR and our contracted sysadmin guru couldn't fix. Because of that I had the pleasure of moving objects one at a time so as not to accidentally pull the problem over in an automated migration. Yay! 

The rest of the week was quiet. The weekend came. Then Monday came. 

I sent level1 down to the callcenter with a cart to get Tweedle, Whippy, and their machines. He returned moments later empty handed. 

&gt;level1: They aren't there, and their machines are gone.

&gt;Me: What? I don't understand. Where could they have gone. 

&gt;level1: How should I know!? 

&gt;Me: Okay... Let's look at the security footage then. I don't understand how two complete workstations could have disappeared without someone noticing. 

*To the NVR!*

We pulled up Friday's footage of the lobby cameras and watched around closing time. Frontdesklady was sitting, talking on the phone as always, people were starting to shuffle out. 

&gt;Me: There they are! They're holding equipment! 

Frontdesklady doesn't seem to notice. They walk in, then out again a couple of times with more equipment, cables and all. On their last trip our they say something to frontdesklady and she cheerfully waves goodbye!

&gt;Me: She just watched them leave with our computers! What is her problem!?

level1 had stood there, silently watching as two good computers left the building. I could read his mind. He was less upset about the computer theft, and more upset that now he would need to build two new machines. Stupid.

&gt;Tweedle: Gooood morning Mr. Stix!

Ahh! 

level1 and I jerked around, surprised to find tweedle and whippy standing just inside the outer door of IT, holding PCs and cables, the door clicked shut behind them. Somehow they managed their silent entry while holding the equipment. 

&gt;Me: Tweedle, Whippy, what the hell!?...

I didn't know what else to say.

&gt;Whippy: I'm sorry Mr. Stix. Did we startle you? That wasn't our intention. I sincerely apologize. 

level1 stood there in silent amazement. 

&gt;Me: Fine. Okay, explain. 

I turned my screen towards them and pointed at the paused video feed of them walking from the building.

&gt;Me: Why did you take largenonprofit machines from the building!?

&gt;Tweedle: CCB gave us work to do at home, and we don't have a computer.

That made too much sense. It wasn't their fault that no one cleared anything with me around here. 

&gt;Me: Fine. Okay. level1, please set them up at the table.

&gt;Whippy: That's okay Mr. Stix, we know how to set everything up. Do you happen to have a power strip and 2 ethernet cables.

level1 continued to stand.

&gt;Me: Uh. Yes... Sure we do. level1, please show them our IT storage space and help them get set up. 

level1 woke up and walked towards our storage room, motioning for the others to follow. I was blown away both at the ineptitude of CCB as well as the apparent gain in skill points for Whippy and Tweedle since our last encounter. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. 

A new email popped up. I closed the RDP session with our NVR machine and opened it.

I originally thought about spending extra time over the summer to learn Android development. However, my friends got the following internships: Google JS stuff, small startup Ruby/Rails and me on some testing side on web dev. I write small python scripts with selenium to test and try to automate whole testing procedure. I feel fine doing that and decided that maybe it is more wise to embark on web dev route because it is not boring and my friends are working with web dev. We could then continue in our 2nd year and try to build something and maybe start a business if we all have web dev background. I like Android programming more than web dev though. 

What are your thoughts? I ask because I don't have time to spend on both things. It already seems daunting task to learn web dev: html5 -&gt; css3 -&gt; js -&gt; jquery -&gt; ruby -&gt; rails and I want to have a life outside too. :)"

As you can probably expect, I really don't have much work to do, and it's almost all menial. Most of what I do is just catering to the occasional help desk ticket and sometimes re-imaging computers from Windows XP (state govt is a little behind the times) to Windows 7, and I spend a lot of my free time learning Android.

I work 40 hours a week and, while I really do not like it here, I don't plan on quitting until it's time to go back to school. I figure it's better to get paid a bit to teach myself relevant skills than to spend the time gaming. But I was wondering if this internship would help me land software development internships in the future. I'm a little worried (based on other threads on this subreddit) that the tech support experience on my resume would force me into future tech support positions, though I suppose that, since this was only my freshman summer, it won't be a big deal.

**TLDR:** Will companies care about my tech support experience when applying for software development internships, and if so, would it be positive or negative for me?"

We met in my hometown, my senior year of high school.  I live in a big city, and we went to different high schools, so it wasn’t strange that we had never met before.  I had a fake ID at the time, and I liked to hang around a dingy old dive in the college neighborhood with my older friends.  I first saw her when she approached the bar, and I fell hard on the spot.  I was immediately reluctant to approach her, as I was a high school kid at a 21+.  No hot girl is going to be interested once they find that out.  I brushed it off and decided to chalk it up as a loss.  I went back to my game of pool, which I was winning by a long shot.  As I was lining up my shot at the 8 ball, I saw the soft flesh of the small sliver of stomach peeking between her top and her shorts in my peripheral. I felt the small hairs on my neck stand on edge with her being so close to me.  She dropped a stack of quarters on the ledge of the table and sauntered over to the juke box.  I sunk the 8.  I was going to play against her.  

Okay, I’m getting caught up, but long story short, we hit it off incredibly, and I even found out that she was only a year older than me.  We had a good laugh about the fact that we were originally both afraid to reveal our true age, and we have been happily together ever since.  Our relationship has been long distance as of recently.  We went to college in the same city, but she recently moved across the country for grad school.  She didn’t get a lot of funding and isn’t able to work more than part time with her hectic school schedule and internship, so she had no choice but to live in the dorms, at least for now.  Almost every night, we Skype for a while because it’s still strange to spend our nights in separate beds.  As I said, she has a very hectic schedule so these calls usually happen pretty late in the evening.  
The first time we were able to Skype wasn’t until about three days after she moved, and although we were able to call and text, my God was it amazing to see her face.  She beamed at me, and I all but melted into my shoes.  She had her ear buds in, so her long hair was tucked behind both of her ears, and they were sticking out just a tiny little bit.  So fucking cute.  She and I chatted for hours, her talking at almost a whisper.  I noticed her roommate was sitting in the chair at the other end of the room hunched over the desk.  My girlfriend was absolutely brilliant, and if her roommate was in the same major as she was, I pitied them.  I was so grateful that she was making this time for me when her roommate was obviously swamped with work, even at 2am.  My girlfriend weirded me out a bit when she made a comment about missing having sex with me with her roommate in the room, but it was subtle and I figured that maybe they’d become fast friends and she wasn’t too uncomfortable about it.  Besides, my girlfriend had headphones in, so I could say whatever I wanted regardless, which kind of turned me on.  We eventually both decided to head off to sleep.  
She’s been at school for about six months now, and we have these Skype conversations at least 4 nights a week.  It’s been hard that she’s away, and I’ve been so proud of her, but after about the second month I was worried that her loaded schedule was taking it out of her a little too much.  She gradually has started losing weight, and her face has become sharp angles.  She’s always tired and has been having trouble with various ailments over the course of her being there.  I eventually decided that I needed to go stay with her a while and make sure everything was ok.  I’ve dealt with stress overload, and it can take a serious toll on your health.  I was hoping that having me around for the weekend would help her relax and that she’d let me take care of her.  We talked about it and she was thrilled, so I booked a plane ticket, made arrangements at work, and off I went. 

I was doing some last minute texting as I waited to hear the announcement for takeoff, and caught a picture message from my girlfriend at the last minute.  She had taken it from her laptop, and her roommate, as usual, was hunched over the desk across the room.  I felt so bad every time I saw her.  She was always working at that damned desk, for all I knew she was more overworked and overstressed then my girlfriend.  I couldn’t believe that I’d overlooked the fact that I could be causing quite a disturbance for this girl by staying in the dorms with them.  On a whim, I decided to say fuck the extra money and texted my girlfriend that I thought we should spend a romantic night in a hotel.  I switched my phone into airplane mode, cued up Netflix, and off I went.  

We met at the airport, and she was so psyched about the hotel idea that she had brought an overnight bag with her and we went straight there.  I pulled out all the stops, and it was the most amazing night.  We drank and talked for hours, got room service delivery for dinner, and I even opted into one of the cheesy romance themed bedrooms.  My girlfriend is still the same amazing woman I’ve known for all these years, but her physical strength has depleted severely.  I tried bringing it up to her gently, because I didn’t want to make her feel self conscious—I love this girl unconditionally.  She insists that everything is fine, even if she’s willing to admit that she feels constantly drained.  The pale, almost translucent color of her skin is what worried me the most; it just made her look so sick.  But she is still the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on.  I fell asleep just studying all of the wonderful little details of her body laying next to me.

Now, Reddit, here’s why I’m posting here.  Our beautiful evening together was only a few hours ago, and I woke up to use the bathroom.  I hope to God that one of you can help me, because every frantic button I press brings me closer to being frozen with fear.  I’ve tried everything I can to make it go away.  I distracted myself for almost an hour, typing out this post with my eyes glued to my computer screen.  We drank three bottles of wine tonight, and I prayed I just woke up to piss half delusional.  But it’s not going away.  I pissed myself from fear and desperation an hour ago, because I can’t move from this spot.  I’m so scared.  My beautiful girlfriend is still next to me, but she’s fading.  Her breathing is shallow now, and she still hasn’t woken from the puddle of urine I soaked this stupid damned heart-shaped mattress in.  Guys, I woke up to pee, and stopped as soon as I sat up.  There is a small desk across the room from the bed.  And when I opened my eyes, I saw the back of a head I knew so very well at this point.  That hunched figure looked so much less human when it wasn’t blurred into pixels on a computer screen.  I swear to God I thought it was the booze when I first saw it.  To reassure myself, I shook my girlfriend and chuckled nervously about hallucinating that her roommate was in the room, at the desk.  She opened her eyes and a look of confusion washed over her face.  

“Baby, I live in a single dorm.”

And then her eyes rolled into the back of her head and she went limp.  

My girlfriend doesn’t have a roommate.  But she’s always been there. 

And now she’s here. 

Please, someone, help me save her.


EDIT: my girlfriend is alive. The figure eventually left, but I still haven't seen it from the front. Dealing with this shit and trying to save my girlfriends life, will update ASAP "

I have a lot of project work under my belt. Been very active in different societies at my university. Even did a 6 week internship last year in the fall. My GPA is decent-ish (3.1).

I really, really want to get a chance to go abroad. But I am looking for a paid internship or a job. I applied through IAESTE few months back. I got nominated for an internship in Korea University. I was so excited. But then out of the blue Korea University rejected me because of ""insufficient computer skills"" which was totally crazy because of 2 reasons: (1) The initial offer letter mentioned they wanted someone with expertise in microprocessors, embedded systems and control systems...All of which I am well versed in and (2) I mentioned a bunch of computer skills (knowledge of different programming languages, CAD, PCB designing, MS Office, MATLAB, Simulation and Modeling, graphic designing etc). So yeah. Very shitty luck.

I am practically ranting at this point...Basically I have been scoring the Internet for internship opportunities. But either they are only for US/EU people or they are on websites which demand ridiculous amount of fees for unpaid internships. I would genuinely appreciate any help I can get. Thank you.

Is it possible to get a programming job quickly [less than 2 months] besides freelancing? A friend suggested me to use a website called Pluralsight, is it any good?

I have 4 paid internships (4 months each) of related experience and the latest company I've interned for offered me a full-time job with a starting salary of $108,000, located in San Francisco. 

I also have some pretty awesome side projects including an app in the App Store which is netting me $25k/year in passive income.

I really do love programming, but lately I've had zero motivation to continue school because the theoretical crap they teach doesn't interest me and it's making me unhappy. I've already failed a few courses in my last term and am retaking them currently. I will probably need 12 more months to complete my degree, assuming I don't fail any more courses.

I'm really considering dropping out since I don't see any point anymore. I'm also not too concerned about future employers because I can't see myself working for someone else forever. I'd rather just drop out, work full time in the Bay Area, and build more apps or start a company on the side (which is my ultimate goal)."
28yaxl,5,2014-06-24,My Apologies if not the Right Place,Somethingwittyimsure,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/28yaxl/my_apologies_if_not_the_right_place/,"So, I don't know. I apologize if this is not technically allowed, as I've not fallen into a set date or approach, but I'm worried that I'm headed towards a decision to commit suicide, one that I would likely take every step to carry out, if the resolve finally comes. 

I'm in this weird limbo where I am no longer simply fantasizing on the way to work or in the daze that comes before sleep what would happen if I happened to die. I suppose it was a security blanket that would keep me aware of the fact that I was simply curious with how people would respond to my disappearance from their lives. I'm not the only one who does so, and that knowledge sort of kept me from ever saying I was suicidal.

But...that's changed. I'm starting to think on it in a more self-directed way, I guess you could say. I'm focusing only on the immediate - the end of feeling like shit, the end of the unending self-criticism and anxiety that I feel every god damn day, just the end of slogging through finding and utilizing ways to feel positive and think positively, only to find that nothing is changing. 

Even now, I am nagging myself constantly with the reminder that I have no good reason to feel this way, that's countered by the realization that that thought is irrational and antagonistic to the ""me that I have to nurture and be kind towards,"" but then that's met with yet more strings of thought that are either slanted towards unending cycles of self-pity and bullshit or irrelevant entirely.

I've talked with my all of two actual friends, but to the one I feel guilty because I've already talked with him already about this mental state when my mood is in the lower swing, and I feel that I'm already straining the relationship when I'm clearly showing signs of no enthusiasm when we're hanging out. To the other, he is clearly bothered by my depressive state but...I don't know - he retreats to smoking weed to block the bad shit in his life, and that's just...not something I'm going to add to. What's worse is that I feel like I'm stagnant with them, since one is just smoking weed (he has a problem and knows it, but it's his life choice and I can't judge him for it), and the other I feel is just annoyed by my presence and will move on in the end anyway.

FaceBook's depressing because all the ""normal"" people have been and are continuing to have their wonderful, perfect lives that smack me across the face. I went abroad for my junior year, but nothing good really came of it. I made no friends, language skills didn't improve all that much (and what little did has regressed since coming home), and seeing the sights leaves no wonder to me for whatever reason. There was no profound change or greatness in the experience, which just stings when everyone else seems to have gone through great changes for the better. I was depressed, went through the end of a failing relationship, and spent the remainder trying to make friends and not succeeding. Back to that ""trying to take on a positive energy"" bullshit an what not. Worked on smiling, maintaining a more positive attitude, started exercising to improve my self-image, etc. Still, nothing changed.

I think I said it aloud today - can't remember, but I think deep down that I truly feel like a failure, and there's a large part of me that I know wants to succeed. I still have steps I can take to reach it, but if there's no friends/loved ones about - ones walking beside me, ones I can actually feel comfortable to be around - then I'll just end up this sad, pathetic, lonely piece of shit. It feels as though there's this dichotomy that I have to either focus on my social shit, or I have to abandon all pretense of social circles and the emotional turbulence it keeps causing if I want to succeed anywhere. And then I rightly think that that's bullshit, but there's still a lot of crap that I have to sift through. And then I feel that I'm at a time in my life when I need to be doing internships, building my entry-level career before graduating, and learning to be an ""adult"" like my peers -- feeling as though I've long been behind them, and the time it will take me to ""fix myself"" will ultimately leave me in the dust. And thus begins yet another cycle.

And yet, right now, I know that if I can't inwardly grasp a sense of that reality of being a sad, lonely figure at the end is capable of being avoided in any possible, realistic way, then I will sadly find that resolve to end this.

I'm tired of always being the one that has the problem, the one who's failing at the things that matter, always having to be taken care of, that my inadequacies are the ones bringing people down. I'm tired of - should none of that be true - constantly feeling as though it is. It's painful. It's painful to the point of tears, and I really just want it to stop, and I don't know what to do about it anymore. I've been trying with all of my power to fight it, and I really don't want this to be a battle I lose."

I'm writing here because I don't know where else to go. I'm currently going through a depressive episode - they happen cyclically for me, and this one is particularly stressful just because I'm going through a big period of change in my life.

Let's start with the background, I guess - I'm 22 years old, currently working full time and finishing up a degree in computer science on the side. I just got a job offer at my internship company (salaried and everything), and my girlfriend and I are about to find a place to move in together. It'll be my first real job and my first real experience living with someone I deeply love. It was actually her idea to try and reach out to anyone I could.

You'd think with a situation like this, I would feel great, and I do - I know that these are things that should make me really happy and excited, but when I'm going through a depressive episode those feelings are fuzzy and muted. It all ends up leading to a frustration and thoughts that nothing will ever make me happy and that I should just give up.

My girlfriend, the love of my life and my soulmate, knows about my depression and has been nothing short of the most loving person I could ask for. Even on the days when I can't seem to smile at all, she's unfazed ready to support me - again, something that should make me happy but only ends up making me feel like a burden, and that she should and could be happier with someone ""normal"" - despite the fact that I know that's not what she would ever wish for, the anxiety and depressive emotions get the best of me.

I'm reaching out because I'm scared that I have all of these (what should be) happy and exciting events going on in my life, but all I can feel at the moment is dull and worthless. I have people who love me, a job that I enjoy, and yet when these episodes happen I can't seem to muster a positive reaction to anything - and now when they wear off, I spend a lot of time just scared of when the numbness will start again :( it's enough to make me think that this depression is too much of a burden for me to bear, and too much of a burden to put on those who love me. I'm afraid that the people who love me now will just become frustrated with me if this depression continues, and that I'll end up alone with all of the sadness and numbness.

So if anyone has any advice, please help me. I'm scared, and I just want to feel things again. I want to be excited that my life is going somewhere. I want to stop feeling like a burden to the people I love. "
28ypha,9,2014-06-24,Where do I go from here?,firerunswyld,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/28ypha/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"So, my fellow redditors... I'm stuck in a rut.  I have a couple of options to choose from.  My story:

From age 16-20, I never worked a job for longer than 3 months, and I quit every one without notice because I never wanted the option of being able to return to that job if I hated it enough to quit in the first place.  I was a very firm believer in the phrase ""do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life.""  I had no idea what I loved, but, by god, I was going to figure it out.

Despite my unconventional career search strategy, I was still able to maintain steady employment.  I interview well, and not looking like I just crawled out from under a rock helped.

So 9 years ago, at about 4 am, whilst stoned out of my mind, I saw a commercial for Ohio/Illinois Center for Broadcasting.  10 hours later, I was sitting in front of the Admissions Coach at the school signing paperwork.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was about to embark upon a path that would change the course of my life.  

The next ten months was a whirlwind of useless classes teaching outdated broadcasting techniques that I was never to use again.  The two things I received for my 10 grand and 10 months of busywork were a) an internship on Rovers Morning Glory, and b) a mantra: Never Say No.

Post graduation I worked as a production assistant on American Idol in several cities during audition season.  This gig had promise.  Easily would have turned in to full time work.  Had I not been co-dependent at the time, I'd have been able to tell my girlfriend to kick rocks when she called me and begged me to come home.  Instead, I quit and went home.  

A few weeks after settling back in to a crap relationship in the armpit of the country, I interviewed and was hired by House of Blues as a stage and lighting tech.  Now, bear in mind this was before the company was purchased by Live Nation, back in the days if Isaak Tigrid.  It was an amazing company to work for.  Help ever, hurt never.  We accept everybody as they are (unless they're assholes).  I mean, come on, the company founder was ousted by the rest of management because he did things like give bags of pot away as Christmas bonuses to ground level employees.  Everybody I worked with was cool.  

I loved the company so much the first two years I worked there that despite Live Nation buying us out, being busted down to part time to save the company money, years of broken promises of upward mobility, and no raises, I stayed for 9 years.

During that 9 years I also subcontracted as a stage and lighting tech and production coordinator for various other local events companies.  I also became an EMT/Firefighter to supplement my income.  I worked for Next Top Model, Discovery Channel, and Fox News in various entry level roles around the country.  

I never did turn any of those opportunities into anything long term, but I did gain a lot of really good experience.  

This year, I started working full time for a business logistics company that pays me a ridiculous amount of money to pack boxes.  My benefits are insanely good.  They pay 100% college tuition anywhere I want to take classes as long as I maintain full time employment with this company.  The Christmas bonus averages around the equivalent of an extra 5 months of pay.  I listen to audiobooks and podcasts all day long.  

At the end of the day though, I pack boxes.  There's no joy or pride in my work.  

So here's what I'm thinking... Do I get my Masters of Science in Entertainment Business from Full Sail, and see where that, along with my already extensive entertainment field experience, takes me, or do I settle in to a career here at the logistics company?

I am currently working as an intern in a software company in France. At the end of that internship (in 2 months) I will have an engineer degree in software development from France and I also have an Msc in computer science from the UK.
When this internship ends, I will have 1 year and a half of experience as a software developer. I have a lot of knowledge in the standard software languages such as C, C++, C# and Java. I have spent one year abroad studying artificial intelligence
I have also done cross-platform development, developed video games and a lot of other different softwares.
I really like working with complex algorithms, on problem solving, anything that is not the design of the software/web development.

I am fluent in french and can speak and write in english. I am a member of an english conversation group and spent one year in the UK to improve my english.

My nationality is french, I am therefore an european citizen.

I want out permanently.

My main problem is I don't know how/where to start. I have tried to look for jobs in domains I like in the UK, Germany and in the countries of northern europe such as Norway, Sweden and Finland but I have not found a lot of success.

I have waited a long time to make this post as I see it as a ""last resort"". I really hope you can help me.
English is not my native language so maybe I have made mistakes while writing.

If you need other information don't hesitate to ask I have tried to give the information needed according to the post in the sidebar [How to ask for help in/r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/).

I'm currently entering my senior year in Computer Engineering and am having second thoughts. I universally loathe nearly all of my CMPE coursework such as circuits, assembly, PCB design, etc. They're a daily grind, not very interesting, and incredibly complex. That being said I've loved nearly every comp sci class I've taken including a python course, two java classes, and a data structures course.

I'm currently working a summer internship as a software engineer doing defense work with Java. I love programming in Java, and while I'm generally not a fan of the defense industry the work isn't bad.

My goal/question is, I'd love to head to the west coast to check out a new place in my life and to work in a more consumer application driven environment than the gov't hub that is Baltimore/DC area. Is it worth it to add close to another year of college to head towards a CMSC degree or should I just stick with CMPE and try to get a developer job with that? 

Additionally, would a big firm such as Google, MSFT, etc. give me a chance with a mediocre GPA and a somewhat unrelated degree? I can't imagine they would, however, I do have a 4.0 in all CMSC classes listed and wouldn't be opposed to going to a more prestigious grad school for CMSC if needed to prove my worth.

I realize this post was poorly worded and all over the place but I wasn't sure where to even start. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

The supervisor for that position emailed me less than a day afterwards and we scheduled a phone interview a few days after that. I sent a thank you email, which he replied to.

I was at college then, and I told him that I wouldn't be home (where the position is located at) for 2 weeks, and told him the exact date I would be back. He said he would contact me then. The day came and I had sent a follow-up email the day before that I just arrived back home, and he replied the next day saying he was just about to contact me, and if I could come in for an in-person interview the next day.

I thought the interview went pretty well, I talked with about 3 different people for 30 minutes each. At the end of the interview, he told me they had 2 more candidates to interview, but he would contact me ""in a few days.""

I had my interview last Wednesday (6 days ago). This would be my first internship (marketing) and I would really love this position. He never responded to my thank you email after my in-person interview. Would it be wise to email him tomorrow or should I just sit tight and wait a bit longer? I understand there must be time for the other candidates to come in, and for him to make the decision with the other employees and such.

I don't know much about how the interview process goes for these positions (most of my past jobs have been work study). I would love any advice in general on how to be responsive, but not overbearing (since I feel I've been deluding him with so many emails; 2 thank you emails and a follow-up email)."

I just found out that I could actually pursue a Math Education masters program with my current degree and passing a certification exam (which is pretty easy for me since it is Math) but I have a few concerns

1) I've been reading a lot recently from people who were teachers and left. Most complain that the classroom is a different ball game than just working with kids. Others cite the school system, bureaucracy and administration mismanagement etc

2) Money: At my rate, I could possibly keep going in my career and make tons more money working as an engineer, but my heart and my happiness is with kids and education. 

3) Immigration: I was brought to America as a child and have been living in the shadows up till recently with the DACA (thanks Obama, for real) and now I can pursue my dream of being an American citizen hopefully. But it's up in the air and the politicians are doing nothing...and I'm in this weird immigration limbo where I can work, but I can't get a green card or become a citizen...yet.

2902s1,7,2014-06-24,Hate new boss (Rant),arnaldSchrodaniger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2902s1/hate_new_boss_rant/,"I use to work under the general manager of a small tech company until a few weeks ago.  There was a new project and the gm hired a project manager who I now report to instead of the gm.  I use to love my job and actually looked forward to coming in.  My former boss, the gm, is a nice, goofy, old, but brilliant man and the work environment was very relaxed.  He can be considered ""one of the guys"" and not a terrible tyrant of a boss that so many people have.

So my new boss, the project manager comes in and things go south.  She is a woman and let me clear this up right now.  I have no problem working under a woman.  Ive had 2 other bosses who were female and they were fine.  I am in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelors in cs 3 years ago so I dont claim to be a programmer extraordinaire.  Im still learning and eager to learn more so I dont think Im better than my bosses or colleagues as Im still relatively new.   However my new boss is different.

My new boss is arrogant, informal, opinionated, and quite frankly, I dont think she can program her way out of a paper bag.  Simply put, she is a ""gamer girl"" type.  She makes it known that she has held many top positions like ""director of ..."" and like people to know she is a real geeky girl.  However, none of her positions indicate any practical programming.  They are all fluff and glorified titles.  I looked her name up on google and found her twitter.  It consists of posting pics of stacks of programming/cs/agile books with quotes like, ""So many books but a real programmer is always ready to learn. #realprogrammer""  She also spouts agile and scrum nonsense everywhere.  One of her other quotes is ""Just trained an intern software developer in agile and hes now a real programmer.""  Heres the kicker, ""Havent programmed in years but with all of my experience, I now manage projects instead of doing them.""  She is 35 years old and got a degree in psychology two decades ago. Far from being an experienced anything.  She is also an avid feminist who likes to bring up issues of gender equality in software jobs such as how few women they are in the workplace no less.  She was hired as a project manager but she was suppose to work with the rest of the team, not just give orders and tell us what to do.  Instead, she pushes her actual programming duties onto others.  A 5 person job had now turned into a 4 person job and 1 person to badger us along the way.

I am a decent programmer in silicon valley.  Ive had multiple job offers and have no problem finding another if this one doesnt works out.  I actually chose to stay at my current one because it was so nice to work at instead of taking another job that paid about 12% more.  Now I might actually quit due to a bad boss.    

Anyways, how do you guys feel about this situation?  I wrote this to partly vent but mostly because I want to know how others feel and if anyone else was in a similar situation.  I just want some feedback about this and it doesnt even have to relate to this directly.  Maybe talk about other instances where you've had bad bosses.


tl;dr New boss is arrogant and I dont like her.  What do I do? Have you had bad bosses, if so, what did you do?

290sgb,11,2014-06-24,You'd think a city like Manhattan would be safe,jcaustin26,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/290sgb/youd_think_a_city_like_manhattan_would_be_safe/,"I've been here for three weeks on summer internship, working in the city is pretty much as expected. My friends and I agreed that we'd all get a place together in Brooklyn if we all got the internships we were looking for, that didn't happen of course and I was chosen to enjoy the sweaty subways and bustling streets of the Big Apple alone.  Thankfully my parents had some old friends who have a place on the Upper West Side, but maybe I shouldn't be so thankful?

I moved in two weeks ago at the start of my internship, my bedroom has it's own bathroom and is kind of annexed from the rest of the apartment so I get privacy, which for a young guy meeting girls in the city is awesome. On my third night there I was pretty stoked about relaxing in bed and watching a movie, that's when I noticed it. It wasn't anything you could see or touch, you could just feel it. 

People say when a spirit is in the room with you the air gets colder, that's a lie. It gets warm, sticky warm, but not so much that you're sweating, just enough to let you know it's there and there isn't anything you can do about it. I sat there in the moist heat watching this movie and my best guess was that I dozed off because suddenly I was watching the credits. It wasn't till the following morning when I woke up to a note from my parents friends thanking me for doing the dishes that I knew something was up. I went to work anyways and that was it for the day.

The weekend I felt the warmth again. I'm going to stress this again because it's important, this is not a ""I'm out on a summer day and it's humid"" warmth, this is a soothing, massaging heat that you feel down to your bones. It's fucking terrible. All I remember from that Friday was hating it and doing everything I could to get to sleep early so I wouldn't feel it anymore.  I woke up Saturday in someone else's clothes.

I don't know who's clothes they are and I really don't think I want to. I later discovered that a woman and her husband had been killed Friday night, their bodies found stripped naked in Riverside Park. The worst part is their 15 year old son Bobby was with them and he has since gone missing. I don't think I'm responsible because the bodies were apparently mutilated pretty bad and the new clothes I had were perfectly clean but it scares the shit out of me to think that I ""warmed out"" the same night this happened. 

The next time was about a week ago, it was late and I was lying awake thinking about this when I felt it. It crept up me this time, starting at my feet and working up until my chest was filled with the moist heat. That's all I remember, nothing was disturbed in my room the next day, which was a huge relief. The rest of the apartment seemed fine too. My parents friends had left a note saying they were heading off on a vacation this week which was short notice if any but it gives me some time to sort this out. I've been doing a lot of research on spirits and demons but nothing seems to match up. All the articles say that they may make you feel angry or you'll hear growling and have lots of nightmares but I've experienced none of that. I'd actually say I'm feeling better than I normally do, I've been waking up rested and feeling very very relaxed. Which is leading me to believe I might be crazy and maybe I just slept walked to the thrift shop, haha. But I'm really posting this here because of what happened last night.

Last night I ""warmed out"" (Sorry I really don't know what else to call it) and when I woke up there were four neatly folded stacks of clothes on the ground in front of my bed, two stacks of girls clothes and two other stacks with jeans and a t-shirt/button down on top.  On the fourth stack was a note with two words written on it, in my handwriting.

""Good work""

I don't know what good work I've done and I haven't heard of any murder's in the area so I'm hoping, like the first night, I just did some cleaning around the hou

290xk4,1,2014-06-24,"Graduate in one year, lots of pressure everywhere and no idea what I'm doing. Help?",monicue1234,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/290xk4/graduate_in_one_year_lots_of_pressure_everywhere/,"For as long as I've been able to grasp the concept of ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" I've had a pretty specific idea in mind about what I wanted to do. I jumped around, of course, as all kids do. Teacher, Astronomer, Writer, Psychologist, back to Teacher, Public Relations.... and now here I am today. A very confused 21 year old with a lot of ambition and drive and not a clue how I can use it, since I don't know where I'm going.

My experience is the usual sort of experience for a 21-year-old. I've had a job for 4 years at home, and then while at school I write for my school newspaper (am now Editor-in-Chief for the coming academic year). I've had two internships - one was very formal, I went into an office and did real work for 20 hours a week. I wrote web copy for the company's products, and began to help reconfigure and smooth out their website.

 The other was... well it's barely an internship, it was sort of this confusing on-call thing where my boss would forget about me for months on end, and then randomly spring up to give me another job to do. I'd spend 20 minutes on the project (usually researching a client or writing up social media copy), send everything back to her, and then there went the communication on that.... anyways.

For every career choice I've considered, I've backed away because either A: it would not be beneficial to my health in the long run (teaching and psychology would drive my stress levels off the deep end) or B: I wasn't really helping anybody (PR).

I'm the kind of person that needs meaning in a job. I can't do it just to do it. I don't care about the money, just as long as it's livable and I can save up money to go to Disney World every now and again. But really, the big thing for me is, I have to do something for someone. I need to make a difference in someone's life. At the end of the day, someone else should feel better because of me.

Naturally, I turned to the plethora of internet assessments to see what my next step should be. My school's Career Services center offered a bunch of different assessments. In every one (and I mean every one) I was told I should be one of three things: a teacher, a counselor, or a religious leader.

So, the teaching one is out for reasons I've already said. Religious leader is also out - I don't really identify with one religion. That leaves a counselor.

I went and met with the Director of the Career Services. He looked over my resume (he gave me a perfect score on that) and then we discussed my options. He recommended a job like what he does - a career counselor.

Well, it sounds neat and all, but I'm looking at jobs in that field and they just seem so sparse... and I live in the Boston area, which has so many schools it's unbelievable.

And then there's the doubt - what if I change my mind *again*?

Other notes: my job at home is in a grocery store bakery. I would say it's the worst job I've ever done, but that would be a lie because cashiering at that store was the worst. So sticking in that company is a no-go. The people are nice, but the job itself lacks everything I need and I feel incredibly drained just thinking about the place.

Working as a journalist would be a pretty fun job - but there's almost zero chance of me making any kind of living off of it. Print journalism is dying. I don't have the skills to be able to be on the writing staff of any paper like the NYT, or even HuffPost. 

And finally, the icing on the cake: pressure from the family to succeed is making it worse. I have all of the ambition to do things, to work hard and smart and well, but I still haven't found a career field I'll truly be happy in. The constant questions (have you figured it out yet? have you started looking for jobs? what will you do? etc etc) are stressful.

I'm set to graduate next May with a Bachelor's in Strategic Communications, and minors in PR and Management. Reddit... what can I do? 

TL;DR: Lost 21-year-old seeks guidance. Too much ambition, but no idea which way to direct it. Had a decent amount of experience. Family pressure to pick something and be successful like RIGHT NOW."

291d83,1,2014-06-25,Public Relations/Marketing person that wants to switch over into some kind of IT role... what would you recommend for me?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/291d83/public_relationsmarketing_person_that_wants_to/,"Hey everyone. I have been pretty dissatisfied with my career and ultimately I know that I regret my major and career choices thus far and that I want to move into some kind of IT role. I could really use some non-judgmental guidance if anyone can relate at all/had a similar path.

Here's my background:
I received my Master's in Communication focusing on public relations last fall, and did a few internships and assistantships related to that degree. Then I had a godawful time trying to find a job in the field (500 ish apps). I finally found one, BUT it is not full-time and is dead end and with no benefits.

 It has also made me realize that I had this industry in general. I write blog posts of meaningless corporate drivel. I make marketing materials that are neither artistic nor appreciated by anyone (people who can't even open indesign critiquing me all day), and most of all I find that most of my co-workers and peers are just pretty stupid. I say stupid because most of them don't want to learn. My own supervisor has told me that she doesn't want to even bother learning basic html or any of the adobe products, even though that's what we pretty much deal with every day. 

So why do I go this way? Well, until a few years ago, I only cared about music, and I graduated with an English degree just to finish college. Then I was pressured highly by my girlfriend at the time to go to grad school because she thought I was a loser and somehow it was the ticket to me getting an actual career. I wish I had better resolve and common sense, but it didn't seem like too bad of an idea at the time, but now I know it was wrong. I know I should be working with computers on a more technical level, and I wish that I had better focused priorities in the past.

Now I'm at a point in my life where I am serious about studying, learning, and actually getting good at something.

As far as computer stuff, I consider myself a little bit versed in everything. I recently completed the A+ certification, but I have been building personal computers as a hobby for about 10 years, as I used to set up networks for LAN parties and all of that. So I am decent with basic troubleshooting and maintenance. I worked at best buy for some time a few years back, but everyone knows the geek squad is just a sales position, not real tech support. Additionally, I do have some coding skills. I am really advanced with my html and css, but I do have beginner level competency with javascript and python. I like coding, but I have hit a brick wall that I feel I won't get over with more schooling.

Lastly, I've realized that I am happiest at work when I am at my computer heavily invested in some type of problem (usually it's trying to figure out how to do something in one of the Adobe programs or a glitch on our website).

Basically, I'm just sharing that so you know I'm not like others who are only interested in the cash grab 

I know that whatever I decide, I will fully investment in, and I am really thinking of going back to school to do pre-requisites for either a computer science degree, data analytics, or IT related.

I'm much less concerned about money and more concerned about job stability, getting to work with smarter, more inquisitive minded co-workers, and being presented with more challenges that have me engrossed by my computer screen for hours (where I wish I had more time at work to finish).

What do I do?,ethioman91,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2922lq/hired_as_an_intern_but_will_not_work_this_summer/,"This summer I started a little late on finding an internship. I wasn't having much luck so I found a website listing a bunch of companies in my area. I found that some didn't really have an application page but they did have their contact information. Being a bit desperate, I emailed the companies asking if they had any sort of internship available or if they were considering having one. The CEO of one company (lets call him Dr. Johnson) said that he would like to talk to me. This company is small, I would estimate &lt; 10 employees. When I talked to him at the 'interview' he was talking to me like he would hire me. He told me to come in around Memorial Day so he could see what I could do on SolidWorks and then start working on a SolidWorks project. The week before Memorial Day I ask him if he wanted me to start on Memorial Day or the day right after and he basically tells me that he wants me to start a week later because he was going to be out of town for three days that week. I am okay with this because I thought that it gave me an extra week to relax. So by the end of that week, I call him asking what time he wanted me to start on the following Monday, June 2nd. He says that from June 9-29 he would be in Germany and that I could start on June 30. Fortunately, He also asked me if I wanted to work under the CTO (lets call him Dr. Patel). I say that I do because then I could start sooner and I feel like I would get more experience if I work with an engineer doing more engineering tasks. Dr. Johnson said he would talk to Dr. Patel to see if I could work under him. I wait for him to respond and he says unfortunately Dr. Patel is caught up in a lot of work and that he doesn't have time for an intern. This meant I would start on June 30 and work under Dr. Johnson. I am upset at this point because this would delay my start by a month and reduce my pay as well. I deal with it and then last week I decide to email him about what I am supposed to do until I start like paperwork, etc and when exactly I will be starting. I get an email from him last night saying that he will not be available in the entire month of July because he will be travelling to Chicago and Shanghai. This means that the SolidWorks project he had planned on me doing is now cancelled and a wasted summer. 

I think I should mention two things. First, a friend told me when I got hired that I should be getting a verification letter, but I never got one. I realize now I should have requested one. Second, the closest thing to work I have done for him is sign a confidentiality form.

I obviously am not happy with this outcome and I want to do something about it. I was thinking about asking him for a referral to another company in my area and calling Dr. Patel to talk to him directly to see if he had anything for me. /r/engineering what should I do?

**TL;DR** Was hired to start working on Memorial day, gets delayed a week because my boss travels, then another 4 weeks for other travels, and finally no internship because he will be traveling some more. Suggestions?"

292qkh,17,2014-06-25,Just shy of 25. Who's stuck in a rut? This guy.,nodfather89,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/292qkh/just_shy_of_25_whos_stuck_in_a_rut_this_guy/,"I'll try and keep this as clear and concise as possible. I graduated in 2011 and since then I was with my County's legislative body, first as an intern (five months), then on a per diem basis (1 year), and finally was brought on full time (1 year). Because my job was highly political, job security had been far from secure, however I believed (incorrectly) that my hard work and persistence had paid off. Why? At the tender, young age of 24 I: 1)Had been the primary author of a County law that was successfully passed. 2) Had only been the 2nd intern to be hired full time in the past decade 3) Was the program coordinator for two committees and the administrator of a privately funded/publicly administered scholarship foundation.    Now as for the reasons as to why I was let go, I believe it was mainly because I crossed (unintentionally) one of the longstanding employees (Clerk of the Board, a position elected by the legislators) by having my hours as 10-5 instead of 9-5, the fact that I had missed the ceremony where the new legislators were elected (I had strep throat the week before my operation and getting better was a priority for me at the time) and the fact that I would be missing the first two weeks of the new legislative session because of my operation. Now I could go on and on about how I had been planning the surgery for months and she had known, the fact that I was frequently forgotten to be added to interoffice emails by her, or the fact that my hours had been OK'd by the former Chairman of the Board. But such is life in politics. I was informed I would be getting let go of after having been made to give up my desk and assurances that they'd have one for me by the end of the day (Friday) but instead I was made to cover the front desk from noon until 4:45 when I walked out. I was informed by the new Chief of Staff that I'd be getting let go of at 4:40 (I had not had the opportunity to speak  to him at this point) As you can probably tell the whole experience left a very bitter taste in my mouth. In retrospect should I have cancelled the surgery once I learned about the coalition to unseat my boss,the former Chairman of the Board? Probably. I view it now as a choice of health versus employment. Prior to my operation I was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and because of sleep apnea combined with chronic insomnia, severe depression, and memory loss from several life threatening concussions, my health was pretty scary when you think about it. **SO** to actually get to the point, I was a very skilled legislative staffer, whose persistence and abilities led me to getting a job. I loved what I did, but not having a tough enough skin has led me to question that career path. I feel like if someone saw my resume they might be able to help a little more. About me? I'm a damned good writer and am pretty tech savvy, I LOVE animals (though doubt I could become a Vet because I can't bear to see animals in pain), and am one of the best cooks you will ever meet. Seriously, my dream is to open one of those joints like you see on diners drive-ins and dives. I am also interested in learning more about coding and software and getting into the tech field. Other relevant info: Live in NY, looking for jobs in Columbus, OH to be closer to my gf, or any decently sized city within a few (3-10) hours drive from NYC. **Please I am desperate for help**, I've stopped going to counseling because my therapist was telling me the same thing on a weekly basis, I've started taking my antidepressants again. Since I quit smoking I put on a tremendous amount of weight (6', 320 lbs up from 270) I have workout equipment in my basement but can't find the motivation to use it. The extra weight and not having a job has made me a whole lot more self conscious to the point where unless my gf is around I don't want to leave home except for running errands (Also she has been overseas since May and is coming back mid-July for a few days, unless I go to Ohio with her ((but even then the thought of me leaving her behind and being separated from her yet again leaves me heartbroken)). If there is another sub that I should post this in please let me know. Reddit, you're my only hope."

293djz,0,2014-06-25,Need help answering interview questions.,[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/293djz/need_help_answering_interview_questions/,"Hi.  I'm a rencent masters graduate applying within the book publishing, magazine and journalism industry.  I've had several interviews the past two months (success! I finally mastered the cover letter) but have not been hired for any of the positions I interviewed for.  Obviously I need to work on my interview skills. 

Some background: I have an MFA in creative writing.  Some of the interviews have been for editorial positions, while others have been for more behind-the-scenes roles, such as PR, fundraising, outreach, and social media marketing. I haven experience in all of these through a magazine internship and through having started my own small press.

For the behind-the-secenes jobs I always get the following question:

1.""You DO know you won't be doing any creative writing in this position.  Would you be happy doing a job that isn't creative?""

In my mind I'm thinking, ""why did you ask me to this interview if my MFA displeases you?"" In all honestly I really would be happy doing these type of jobs.  In fact, I might even like them more because editing isn't all it's cracked up to be.  However the interviewer never seems to be satisfied with my answer.  This question has really been a stumbling block for me. I think some HR reps have a lot of preconceived notions about ""creative"" people, such as them being lackadaisical and disorganized, which I am not at all. I feel I have to break down a few stereotypes.

Other questions the answers to which interviewers seem not to be satisfied with:

2. How do you go about multi tasking and prioritizing your time?

I usually say I try balance my time evenly between long-term and short-term tasks, leaving time for both ongoing projects and things that need to be addressed right away. I then put forward the analogy that most people spend a majority of their time addressing short-term tasks and never get around to accomplishing the more long-term goals the set for themselves, such as writing a novel, which is why making time for both is important.  It's really easy to neglect the long term in favor of the concrete and immediate. I then turn the question back on them and ask them how they prioritize their time.   

3. Would you be comfortable using X, Y, and Z software ?

Sometime's it's something stupid like Excel (who doesn't know how to use Excel at this point?) but more often than not its something a little more sexy like Photoshop or InDesin.  I say I would be comfortable working with those applications. I talk about moments in the past where I had to use unfamiliar technology without any training. What more can I say?

4. How are you with meeting deadlines?

Great! Fabulous! The best! Probably better than you! I cite several examples of times I met deadlines in the past, such as during grad school, as a teacher (I taught middle school English for a year) and times during which I was a freelance writer.  Maybe they're just not convinced? 

Other problems may just be my overall demeanor and appearance. I don't get nervous during interviews.  So maybe I'm too laid back? 
Also, I'm blonde and have the unfortunate circumstance of having a baby face.  I look about 5 years younger than I am, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in people. I've been so disillusioned from my previous interviews that I've actually been thinking of dying my hair brown and dressing differently so as to take on a more ""edgy"" appearance.  Maybe I'll get a wedge haircut like Suze Orman ;)

If anyone can provide me insight to these questions that would be great!

293icw,1,2014-06-25,I've done everything right (mostly). Nothing is getting better.,margherite,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/293icw/ive_done_everything_right_mostly_nothing_is/,"I am 20/f, with a long history of mental illness. I'm will be a junior in college in the fall. Honors, staff writer for the campus paper. This summer I have a job at a bakery, a journalism internship, a family. I have a boyfriend who is the person I've connected with more than I ever thought I possibly could, and after this summer we are set to move in to an apartment near campus together. That upcoming move and that relationship has been my source of excitement and hope for the last months. Nothing has ever been so good for me as he has. And he's been the reason I've held on so long. See, he's been suicidal and diagnosed with MDD for a while now, and last summer was forcibly admitted into a psych ward because of alarming things said to his therapist. Things are looking up a lot for him now, though he struggles. Things are not looking up for me.

Six months ago roughly, I was admitted to a residential treatment facility a few states away for an eating disorder I've had since the age of 12-13, which affected me at varying levels of severity. For a bit of background, I have a very strange relationship with my mother, who is an alcoholic, probably a narcissist, who was extremely emotionally abusive during my childhood, and that relationship probably had a lot to do with sparking my disorders. Too long to explain her but just be assured, she is not healthy in any way. Things have been going downhill for me for years, but I always managed pretty well. I have had worsening depression and an anxiety disorder since early-mid teens, and began thinking about suicide more than is normal at a very early age. Before Christmas break (which was the month during which I spend my time at the residential center), I was a disaster. Living in a dorm, I slept about once every other night, binged and purged constantly, didn't go to class, didn't take my exams, slept odd hours during the day when I could sleep, and was so amazingly lost I would certainly have been admitted to a hospital if I had been home. 

Mid-October, I went to the emergency room for a stomach and esophageal problem (rupture) due to my bulimia. I went home for a few days, got in on some therapy, went back to school. Things got worse. I spent weeks in a stupor and daze, which is coming back now.  I bought bottles of painkillers and considered the best time, day and way to take them. I looked around my dorm for a good spot to tie a rope. My boyfriend found my pills in my purse, and took them from me. He's amazing--should mention that.

At the facility, things seemed a little more hopeful. I started taking an antidepressant and opened up a lot in therapy. I was in residential for three weeks and partial hospitalization for roughly one week. My insurance dropped me very suddenly and in the space of a half day I was discharged; on my way home the next afternoon. Things went bad about a month after I got home, and I stopped taking my antidepressant. Bad idea I know, and I don't really know why I did. Just didn't get it refilled. And actually never even received scripts from the nurse at the facility.

Began throwing up again. If this binge-purging had ever affected my weight in any way I would already be dead, as I wouldn't be able to take it, but I'm one of the lucky ones whose weight hasn't changed at all in my years of bulimia (my years of anorexia were a different story obviously). In early spring, my dad informed me that, though I was never ever alerted during my time in the facility, insurance was not covering me for the full 11 days I was in the facility after the start of the new year, and I now have a bill of about $7,000. Taking care of this has been terrible, as my again-untreated anxiety and depression have a nice way of making me unable to do anything. I called off work today because I just can't. I was scheduled for a doctor's appointment last week to get an appeal to insurance started, and skipped it because I didn't care. It's amazing to me that I've held on so long with work and interning and even managed to do a lot of cool stuff at my internship. But bad days are just taking over and nothing is working anymore.

I can't take care of this bill. I'm lying to everyone. I can't imagine how much longer I can keep up all these lies (I'm taking my meds, I'm doing fine, I'm not throwing up, I'm happy, I'm safe, I'm just tired, and I've been telling everyone these lies). I have been depressed so long; it sounds dramatic but I've thought since I was about 12 that I would kill myself at some point, and it has certainly looked that way up until now. I'm about set to try something. Today I've done nothing, like so many other days, but cry, binge/purge and think about all my safety points (ways to kill myself) throughout the house. Sharp knives, pills, gun in my dad's closet. It's very tempting and my family is going on vacation in a week. It seems perfect. Up until now I've relied on the responsibility to keep my boyfriend safe from himself in order to keep myself safe too; i know if I were to hurt myself he wouldn't be able to take it, and he's told me so in so many words. But it's too bad now. I just want to be done. It doesn't matter how supportive anyone is of me, because I just want to be finished with this stuff and that's it. I can't take the isolation and depression and anger and flatness anymore. Therapy I've done, treatment I've done, and nothing has worked. I need help."
294csa,2,2014-06-25,Is a masters in computer science from cal state school a bad idea?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/294csa/is_a_masters_in_computer_science_from_cal_state/,"Long story short,  I originally attended Cal Poly Pomona and started as a civil engineering major but didn't feel it was for me and wanted a challenge so I switched to aerospace engineering then eventually transferred to the university of Michigan (Ann Arbor).  I graduated two years ago with a GPA of 3.0 (my GPA from Pomona didn't transfer over). I struggled to get a job due to a mediocre GPA and lack of internship. Later I found this tragedy to be a blessing because now I'm pursuing my passion computer science (never had a passion in aerospace , I mostly did it for the challenge and because my father said I wasn't smart enough ).

Problem is I'm going to Cal State Fullerton which isn't a bad school but it's such a downgrade from U of M. I finished my first semester with a 4.0 (general programming and data structures while working part time).

My question to you all is do you think that it would be best for me to transfer to UCLA or San Jose State after I finish all the undergraduate Computer Science courses or should I be fine finishing in Fullerton? 

I would love to work in Silicon Valley and I want to make sure that I can do what it takes to get a job there. I really wish that I switched to computer science while at Michigan but that's in the past now. 

I actually wonder if my degree in aerospace from Michigan would help me a little or if it's worthless. Please let me know what you guys (and ladies ) think.

Pique pique pique. Smock. Smock smock smock. Don't knock my smock or I'll clean your clock!)

*cough*

Anyway, a little background: I'm the customer support intern at a local cable company. We're not tech support per se, but we work closely with them. I work in a town about 15 miles away from my hometown, and this place is full of wonderful people. Just *amazing* human beings. Fantastic.

We've been doing some general housekeeping lately. Being an ISP that started in the days before GMail and Yahoo Mail, we used to provide email addresses. We no longer do this, and we're trying to phase existing accounts out, and convince people to use a different email service. As part of this process, we recently went through the CableCompany.org email addresses and deleted accounts that had not been used for more than 180 days. Most of these accounts had been inactive for far longer than that. I figured that, since logic would dictate that these people hadn't used these email addresses for years in some cases, this would be easy.

*derisive laugh*

Let me paint you a word picture.

[DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/28gld9/how_to_lose_employees_and_make_people_hate_you/) and I were sitting at the front desk, working hard. It was a gray day outside, and no one was very talkative. The skies reflected the darkness in my soul. All in all, it just wasn't a very cheerful environment. Then comes the call. I apprehensively pick up the phone, hoping it's just someone calling to ask about prices. I don't really want to deal with explaining to new customers that we're booked solid through the middle of next month.

&gt;""Thank you for calling Cable_Company!""

&gt;""Yes, my name is Customer-""

Ohhhhh man. I recognized the name. We had just deactivated a couple of her email accounts due to inactivity. Crap.

She continued:

&gt;""-and we have email accounts through you guys. We can't get into most of them, and my daughter just bought concert tickets and had them sent to one of the accounts we can't access.""

&gt;""What account specifically?""

&gt;""name@CableCompany.org.""

Yep. This was one that I myself had dealt with. Crap.

&gt;""I'm sorry, ma'am, but it looks like that account was deactivated due to inactivity. Tech support might be able to help you, but I doubt it.""

&gt;""...oh. Well, what about OtherName@CableCompany.org?""

&gt;""I'm showing that that account was shut off in 2011, after 259 days of inactivity.""

&gt;""Well, what are you going to do about it?""

wat

&gt;""Like I said, you can try calling tech support, but I don't know if they can help you.""

&gt;""We need these concert tickets!""

&gt;""Ma'am, the number for tech support is 555-5555. That's gonna be your best bet. I can't help you beyond that.""

&gt;""...well, they'd better be able to help.""

*click*

I had to sit there for a minute just processing it. What are the odds that they'd need that account so soon after we turned it off? And, more importantly, WHY did they send it to an account that hadn't been used for over 6 months? The mind fairly boggles.

TL;DR: They paved paradise and put up an ISP."

Some background info:
I'm a Junior level CS student in the Bay Area.    I have a pretty good grasp on good code design as well as data structures and algorithms.  My education has been in Java, but I am self taught in other languages and technologies.  My goal is to be employed as a software engineer when I graduate.  I want an internship to further my knowledge in the software design process and learn what it's like to work in an office setting.  Also, I'm interested in both front end and back end work.

This is my first internship, and I'm extremely underwhelmed.  The job title is HTML5 Mobile Web Development Intern. What I'm actually doing is making HTML5 animations.  They have myself and two other interns making these animations, no one else in the office is working on this project.  I have been trying to make the most of this and code as much as possible.  There is no guidance, just make something configurable and responsive.  The two other interns are using a Adobe Edge to accomplish this.  I opted to learn and use javascript canvas.  I created a cool particle system, but was told to not do that.  I hated it the 2nd day I was here, but have stayed to see if it would get better. It has not.  The rest of the office is working on a different project which I've inquired about but that led nowhere.

TL;DR
I don't want to be doing this internship.  I feel as if I could be learning more on my own about what I want to be doing with regards to programming.  The pay is 500$ a month but I'm working 40-45 hours a week.  I think I'm doing myself a disservice being here.  There is no guidance, and the stuff I am working on I'm not necessarily interested in.  The only reason I'm considering staying is to have something on my resume and the 3-4$ an hour I'm making.

So should I stay, or should I go?

I don't have much experience as in the actual field like internship/ research. I know one of the best things to do for cs majors is getting an internship while in college. I just need some advice on how I go about doing that. I know c++, Java, MIPS Assembly language(from a class I took), a bit of HTML and just recently started working with Arduino. Other than that I haven't done a lot. I'll take any advice I can get but I feel my priority right now should be to land an Internship. "

I responded, playing up my very very mild experience and they replied almost immediately offering me an interview next week. After some research I realised the job involved a lot know-how and IT expertise than I previously thought, and I now feel very out of my depth.

The role is within a start-up so I'm concerned they might not even really know what the job entails, particularly as they seem to have a very small staff at the moment.

I am happy to read up on the role, and if I did get it I'd make sure I did the job well, however I am a complete newbie in this area and I don't want to get there and have wasted my time travelling to the interview (it is a long commute into the city) as well as their time interviewing me.

Should I brush up and try and pretend I know more than I do? Or should I go in, as I am, and tell them I'm not an expert but I'm willing to learn?"

I am interested in nothing, and I have no motivation to do anything whatsoever. On top of that I'm very bad with people, since highschool I've been afraid of interacting with new people, I'm very bad at making friends. And the only friends I have left are my middle school/highschool friends who don't get to be around me very often. I can't finish things, I've started my studies over 3 times, and I've given up 3 times. This year I was 2 weeks away from my first diploma, and I ran away from my responsabilities, lied to my family, and went missing from my school and my friends there. I am very ashamed of how I am and of all my lies that cover it up and I think about it all the time everyday, at every second I'm afraid that I'm going to be found out. When people find out, I cut all ties, and I disapear, they insist for some time, calling me and even ringing my doorbell, but after a while they just give up. That's the way I've lost almost all my friends. I've been in love with a girl since I was 13, we got together when we were 18 and we only broke up a few months ago, this winter. She is a very driven person, who loves what she does and is very very invested in her work and studies. And in the end she couldn't stay in love with someone like me so she broke up with me. With her I had something to look forward to, it was worth it to be unhappy if I got to see her every other week end (she is studying abroad). Now that I am alone, and I don't have her to think about for the first time in almost 10 years, I'm put in front of who I am and it's like nothing makes it worth it. I'm in an internship right now that people from my now former school would love to get, but I just don't care. I've had thoughts about suicide before, but since the break up it's been getting worse and worse. And now I'm at an all time low. I don't know what to do right now, everything seems pointless, there is nothing for me to look forward to, that would make it worth it to be bored and pretend I care about the things I do. Something that's been stopping me is my family, thinking about my mother and brothers finding out makes me cry and I cry for a long time. I've most often thought about others before myself because I dispise myself, but for once I'd like to do something for myself only. Right now I feel like suicide would be that something. And at the same time I'm telling myself I'm stupid to even consider suicide, that I'm just lazy and don't want to face my responsabilities. That's pretty much how I feel, thanks for reading."

That being said, I started at kmart back in April.

How the internship at Caterpillar works, I go to school for 4 hours a day or so and I work at caterpillar for 3-4 hours a day as well. This will put me around 3-4pm when I'm done.

My parents however want me to keep my job at kmart, caterpillar, and increase my GPA this year by a few decimal points.

I don't feel like I can do all of that and I'd be perfectly content with caterpillar and school, after all, that will open a TON of doors and opportunities. 

Another thing my parents are worried about is my previous job record, I worked at a full time job 3-11pm 5 days a week and it made me depressed, so I only made it 6-8 weeks of that in the summer. Following that I worked at a restaurant again, hated that, probably about 10 weeks total of working there. 

I didn't have a job again (due to the market), until this April at kmart. 

Now they're worried anytime someone looks at my resume they're going to think I'll quit on them in some time, that being said I hardly put the restaurant I worked at on my resume, along with that putting caterpillar for a year looks amazing.

I'm hoping that caterpillar will keep me longer than the internship requires as well, which is a possibility as they're only hiring me because the intern before is going to college and they need to replace him.

The fact that I don't think I can balance it is my push factor, but I'm wondering if you think me quitting kmart for caterpillar will really hurt me that bad in the future?

Please respond with any advice or questions you have."

-Currently interning at hewlett packard as a software engineer (for the summer)
 -4 years of being on a first tech challenge robotics team in high school, went to national championships twice 
-Will maybe have another prestigious internship under my belt at the time that I apply 
-Spent a year on my current schools mars rover robotics team (competing in the university rover challenge) 
-various other coding / programming side projects (don't know how much this matters)

I can get excellent letters of recommendation from my teachers, and employers (if your allowed to get them from employers. My concerns are however that I am applying from out of state.

I don't know now how much more time I can wait (I need to make payments in about 3 weeks for housing), especially since I may not be hired at all. The timeline goes a bit like this:

1. 3 weeks ago I submitted my resume and had a phone interview request. We had the phone interview a few days later, and he told me he would contact me when I got back from college.
2. I get back from college 2 weeks later (so a week ago) and I contact him with a follow-up email (although I told him the dates in my previous thank you email) and he replies back requesting for an onsite interview the next day.
3. I interview with him and 2 other people for a total of an hour and a half. I thought it went well. After the last interview, he tells me has 2 more candidates to interview and that he'll contact me in a few days. I send him a thank you email.
4. Today (8 days since the onsite interview) he replies to my thank you email saying he's been super busy. He asks for 2 writing samples and for 2 references. I email back within the hour and he says he'll get back to me soon.

Am I nearing the very end of this process? I'm not very impatient, but I really need to get started with a summer job and make money to pay my housing deposit. This is a part time marketing internship for a smaller company (50~100 employees). I really hope I get the position (wish me luck!) but I'm running out of time!"

I'll spare you guys my life story, as you can probably find it in my cscareerquestions posts, the TL;DR version follows:

I'm about to graduate from a school with some very good name recognition as well as a high ranking from US news for Information Technology with a B.S.  One of the requirements for the degree is a completion of an internship, which is at the end of the summer, would be the only barrier to me graduating.

As such, I've been pursuing internships for the fall, and have been looking at a service and support intern position in Denver CO.  I've received an offer for the position, that is literally half the expected salary for someone with my degree.  It includes a rather strange arrangement where after 6 months, I receive a 10% bonus, as well as a 15% increase in pay, at the conclusion of the internship (another 6 months, another 10% bonus) I would (hopefully) receive a full time offer from the company in a more technical capacity in either a consulting or development capacity.

I should note that I am on the east coast currently, and the company does not offer any sort of relocation package.  I'd be basically driving more than halfway across the country, on a salary simply insufficient to afford either the cost of living, as well as to even consider paying back any of my student loans.  Everything is throwing up red flags here to walk.  In order to make it work, they would have to increase their offer by almost 50% of what it is now.

It's the only offer on the table at this point, and while it is for an entry level intern position, I do happen to have 6 years of experience in customer service and tech support for consumer electronics.

Payscale.com places the offer in the 29th percentile with 0 years of experience, 14th percentile with 6 years of experience, if you consider my current tech support experience dealing with customers face to face.

Is this even worth negotiating?  I'd be aiming towards 40k to start."

I have worked a couple of different internships and one job in my field and I absolutely hated it. I did nothing for a couple of months and my parents encouraged me to try and go back to school for computer science because I have always been pretty proficient with computers.

 So I started back classes in May of this year. However to be perfectly honest, I am hating every minute of being back in school. I am having to live at home to save money which means two hours of commuting every single week day, I also have a job, and on top of school, I have no free time whatsoever. I have grown distant from all of my friends as a result. I want to find my place in life. I don't want to have to wait two more years when I thought I was done a year ago. 

Do you guys have any suggestions as to some things I could look into? I'm sick of living at home. I'm sick of having no free time. I absolutely can not do this for two years. One of the things I have been seriously looking into was joining a branch of the armed forces. It sounds appealing to me. One of the things I want to do more than anything is travel and this would be good way to do so. I also have been on an insane fitness kick lately. I have lost 70 pounds since September. However I am hesitant to pull the trigger on committing to the armed forces because I am still about 30 pounds overweight. I wouldn't currently get admitted. I don't know how long it will take me to lose the remaining weight and get in shape to pass the demands of BMT. This is just one thought I have had recently though. I am open to any other suggestions.

I graduated two years ago with a degree in music composition and technology. I found this music company I really wanted to work for and e-mailed the owner about a possible internship. He got back to me and said let's meet sometime, and when I e-mailed him back he never responded. I was bummed, but moved on and found other internships. 

Last year I got a full time job as a receptionist and am currently working there. It's boring, money isn't even good, but it's all I have at the moment. A few months ago I notice the same person I e-mailed two years ago checked out my linkedin page. So I e-mailed him, he remembered me, and asked to meet. I went to the office and had a chat, he said they didn't have a job at the moment, but might soon in the future. They asked if I was interested, I said yes.

Two months I get an e-mail asking if I would like to come in to interview because the position is opening up. I meet the whole team later that week, including who I would be replacing. They seemed to be getting a feel for my personality, since the office only has a few people and we'd be working together so closely. I got along with everyone, things were positive. I send a follow up, he said I did really well and that if I don't hear by mid-June to follow up.

We get to mid June, I email, he says I'm still one of their favorites and they should be able to tell me in 2-3 weeks.

I'm still on a roller coaster of emotions, as you can imagine. 

Yesterday I get another e-mail asking if I'm free next week to get lunch with two employees, one of which I would be the assistant for. I have no idea what to expect. I have never had a lunch interview, if that is what it is. What kinds of questions do you ask? What topics do you bring up? Would they invite multiple candidates out to lunch at different times?

Apologies in advance if this ends up being long. 

For a little briefing: I started college as a CS major and Math minor. I struggled through the first year and I wasn't loving CS and nor was I doing well academically, at least by my standards.  It wasn't until junior year I was able to take a Web Development course and came to love it. Unfortunately, my college doesn't offer web development as a concentration nor does it offer any follow-up courses, so I'm stuck in Software Systems/Software Engineering. I don't feel like I am not taking away much from the concentrations and, for the most part, I'm not enjoying them either. I am doing better academically, but I feel like the only area I have any advantage over my peers is in Web development (which isn't even core curriculum), while I my other skills (particularly theory or algorithms) don't stand up. I possess what I would consider moderate web development and general programming skills, which is none too impressive either.  

Enough with that though. My problem and inquiry is for getting a job after graduation, and that in itself is a little story.  I applied for a number of internships for this summer and I didn't end up getting any offers. I hand picked a bunch of internships I thought I was qualified for and applied. I interviewed for some, but nothing came of them. Most of them felt like they went okay, but last one felt like a sure thing, and then nothing. The interview went great and I felt like I was answering all the questions well (I also aced the phone interview prior), but I didn't get it even though I thought the interview indicated I might have.

For some of them, the theory/algorithm parts is just my absolute weak spot; most of the questions I just can't answer, especially on the spot (if I had more time, they probably wouldn't be a problem, but theory is my very apparent weakness in the major). Coding stuff is more my strong suit and I can handle the normal interview stuff fine. 

All that being said, I'm worried that not having received an internship this summer and not really having a portfolio nor personal projects is REALLY going to hinder my chances of getting a job. That and the fact that I don't stand out against my peers (academically, skill wise, and knowledge) makes me feel like I don't bring anything to the table to start with. 

I'm not really sure what to do to move on. Should I try to land an internship before getting a real job, should I consider going into a specific field, or what? There's a lot of jobs/internships out there, but a lot of them require specific knowledge that I don't know and can't spend time to learn in school (e.g. specific frameworks, etc.). I'm not really sure where they expect you to have picked up some of this information/skills from sometimes for internships and I'm afraid to apply to a lot of positions I feel somewhat qualified to because I lack some of the required knowledge. 

I just don't really know where to go from here, and while I'm not in panic mode yet, I certainly am getting closer. 

Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can offer."

I am fresh out of college and am considering accepting a job offer with a company nearby since I would like to stay in the area. There are a couple of questions that I have though.

1.) The only thing that I've been told with the salary is that it is ""between $40-50k"" and that benefits are ""standard"". Isn't this strange that I'm being given a range like this? Also, is this what I should expect for being fresh out of school? Especially since I never did an internship and this is my first job. (This is a job in South Carolina, btw)

2.) What can I expect in terms of advancement in general? Like if I put in 2 years at an entry level position, can I expect to move up? If so, what should be the ballpark figure that I ""should be"" making by then? And expanding on this, what would be the normal career track for a software developer? I think I would at some point like to move into more of a managerial role, but since I'm new, I really don't know the industry well enough to make that determination.

Also internship questions.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29a8r5/what_is_the_difference_between_an_it_software/,"(Tried to do a search on this, but ""IT"" keeps returning the word ""it"")

I just finished my second year as a computer science major, and I'm currently halfway through my first summer internship for a very large and recognizable company. I'm interning with the IT software development team, but I'm not sure if I like the IT side of things. About 2/3 of what I do is program a .NET web app and webservices to automate processes, and the rest is working on SSRS reports, which has to do with SQL and knowing the basics of how the business runs. I love the programming but I'm not so sure if I like the business reports and having to learn in-depth business concepts. I really love the company, my coworkers, and what I've been coding, they pay me very well, and they've strongly hinted that they'd want me back next summer.

How different is what I'm doing than a non-IT software development position, and how in-detail about business do you need to know for most positions? I don't mind the business side of things and sometimes some of the concepts are cool, but going into detail about it all really bores me. Also, I don't like this city very much. I'm thinking of turning down the offer at the end of the summer (assuming I get one) because I still have two summers after this summer, and I want to see what other coding jobs are like, but I'm not really sure how different this is than other positions. Also, if I change my mind a few years down the road and want to come back, would it look bad if I reapplied? And if I turn down the offer, what's the best way to do it etiquette-wise? I've been telling them that everything's great when they ask me, so I feel like I'd be stabbing them in the back when/if I say no, haha."

I'm an undergrad who will be graduating next May with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Unfortunately, I really don't have a solid plan for after that. I'm academically successful, and have a cumulative ~ 3.8 GPA, as well as two great completed software development internships under my belt (actually, one of the two is upcoming, but will be done by graduation). While my work experiences were very enjoyable and I could probably enter the software field right after graduating, another side of me thinks that getting a Master's degree (in computer engineering, computer science, or a related field) will be useful. However, I am not sure exactly what degree program I would want, or how it would specifically help me.

In summary, my 3 options are:

1. Apply for and enter a Master's degree program directly after undergrad.
2. Enter the workforce for a few years and then go back to school to get the Master's degree
3. Enter the workforce and never go to school again

Do you guys think that given my intended field (software development), getting a Master's degree is beneficial, and if so, which one and why? If so, should I go right away or work for a few years? General comments are also welcome.

Thanks very much,
TrainFan

I am not a fully fledged sysadmin. I'm going to school majoring in a degree for computer information systems, In the meanwhile I intern as helpdesk and tinker in my free time. In short, very knowledgeable I am not. 

My father is a handyman of all types, but his trade is an electrician. As such, he deals with installing and maintaining a lot of different things. His english however  is not very good, and lately he's been putting a lot of responsibility on my shoulders asking me to help him. He is a very hands-on person.

Lately, he tends to pick up projects that he doesn't really understand, and assumes that because I am good with computers and speak english, I can help him out. This is really frustrating for me, because some of the things that he asks of me are completely out of my desired field. I understand why he does this. Some contractors have big projects that can lead to other projects.


But this is bad for me for a lot of reasons: As an example, he recently accepted the task of installing some intercoms that are configurable through the computer. He gets the wiring part down, but has no fucking idea how the software works and that's where I apparently step in. I have no idea how an intercom works. And his goto reply to that is ""read the manual"". If I tell him I don't understand, his signature response is ""I thought you were good with computers, what's wrong?""

....

How, or at which fucking point can I explain to him that ""no, just because it works on a computer doesn't mean I understand how it works""? And ""no, helping you out once or twice does not make my assistance a commonplace thing""? 

Is it selfish of me to even think this way? I'm finding myself left increasingly frustrated slogging through manuals for shit not even remotely related to sysadmining, like a fucking truck cooler. (Fucking AL52 - Alarm List Full)

I also find it INCREDIBLY STUPID that he picks up projects he doesn't know how to do. His goto response to this is ""If I don't do it, how else will I learn it?"" 

I just don't know anymore. Am I in the wrong here? Is there any way that I can break it down to him that he is wrong? His lack of basic fucking common sense has left me at a loss of words.

Through a friend, I have an offer to work at a startup company.

It's only about 6-7 people right now, through the first 2 phases of user-testing, and starting the pilot soon, but seems like it will be stable. 

The company itself seems stable and promising, but the salary is not going to be the best, and I will up for either a killer commute or for a move in the future. The plan now is to train onsite for a couple weeks, then work remotely most days, with one or two days a week on-site after that in my current role, but with a plan for the future to relocate closer to the company and take on a more involved technical role after graduation. 

The pay is not the greatest, but it is more than I am making at my current internship (although most of that will go to the commute costs). The main beneifts is that it seems like I will have a lot of chances to learn and work with things I am interested in doing more and that there is potential for me to grow into a role that will fit my long-term career goals better. I'm just wondering if this is all realistic.

I know that there is a high failure rate for startups and am not looking to get rich quick off of equity or anything like that, but it seems like a good opportunity to learn and get some real-world experience.

In the interview I was told that I would be offered a permanent position, including a very high wage and that the 6 months would be a time where I would be shown the ropes (I later discovered this was promised to every person that came in for an interview).

To begin with I enjoyed the job, within a week my boss made me feel uneasy, about 2 months in things changed drastically. There were 13 other employees and the Boss working in the office. The staff warned me that the boss was very difficult and if they could leave they would immediately. I started to see this side of him myself, he would aggressively swear at staff and clients. He would swear at me and call me names on a daily bases. 

Furthermore, he began making sexual comments to me despite the fact that he has a wife and 3 children. He would comment on my clothing, stare at my chest and body when speaking to me and constantly told me I was pretty, he would touch my hand, arm and shoulder any chance he could, one time he even tried to take a photo of me on his ipad claiming that it was for a staff section on the website (which never happened).

He accidentally sent me an email that was for someone else talking about how he thought I was stupid, then went on my email and deleted it thinking I hadn't seen it.

My colleagues told me that he had a habit of using interns and making excuses not to take them on once the intern period was finished.

But during the entire internship he promised me a full-time position at the company with this grand wage and I believed him. Once the internship had finished he told me that the next week I would start, I worked one week where, at the end of the week he told me via email that he would contact me at some point the week after because he wasn't sure if he could take me on because profits were down (which was untrue the company was doing very well). He never contacted me to tell me he didn't want me back I found out from my colleagues and he didn't pay me for the time I spent there once my internship had finished.

He is still using my work email, replying to my emails as me.

Furthermore he is continuing to bad mouth me to his employees (I made good friends with pretty much everyone that worked there and we still chat on a daily basis). I worked really hard while I was there and managed to increase sales. Since I've left sales have been down. 

What can I do now? I feel as though I was used and wasted a lot of time to be treated like crap.

A little background. I'm in my mid 20's and graduating with a bachelors in CS from a upper tier, but not top tier, school. 

I'm essentially rushing through the curriculum and finishing my degree in 1.75 years since I pay a flat fee per quarter rather than paying by unit. Due to this fast pace, I haven't had much chance to take time and learn languages/frameworks taught outside of school; I spend literally all of my time to master my courses and obtain a strong foundation in Computer Science concepts rather than just 'learning a language'. I have, currently, a 3.9 major GPA - but with 0 internship or experience in computer science (I have experience in other fields unrelated to compsci).

I have tried to grab an internship this summer, but they all denied me since nearly all of them wanted individuals with knowledge in web based languages and frameworks - which I did not learn yet. 


I'm graduating in early March 2015 - taking heavy courseloads until then. I have a bit of time this summer and I'm taking the time to learn Javascript and PHP. 

So my primary question: How competitive will I be after I graduate in getting a competitive salary with no experience, but high GPA? I'm still trying to land an internship this summer, but as time goes on, my hopes are diminishing. What else can I do to increase my odds of landing a good job upon graduation and to make myself more competitive?


Languages that I know and expertise relative to undergrad level:

C++ (high)

Python (moderate)

SQL (low - but good at relational algebra)

Java (low - used it only for one school quarter)

HTML/CSS/JS (in the process of learning right now)


I'm trying to get myself into GitHub as well to make a portfolio at least, but the task seems daunting. How difficult and time consuming is it to make a noticeable portfolio? (I'm trying to avoid putting school-based projects into my portfolio.)"

Anyway, a lot of grad programs and jobs have training but also there is a sense that this grad will cost us money for X time and after this time they will be useful and being returning. To all the managers out there, in general how much time is this?

All of my family that I have been closed to has passed away so those two people are pretty much the only people that I care about in my life.

I am very *academically* successful at college and based on the fields that I am studying, it should not be too difficult to find a job post graduation for me (I already have my first internship this summer and it pays very well but it is not where I would want to go full time since (if I get that far) it has me doing menial tasks).

The main problem is though, that I do not really care about money, or careers, or job prospects since none of those things make me happy. I just do not want to lose my friends which will likely happen once we graduate since we'll probably go our separate ways. I would be willing to throw all  my work in college away and work minimum wage (or even being homeless) if it meant I wouldn't lose them. 

I know that you can still keep in touch after graduation but I know that will not work for me since during summer (when I am home, as opposed to being at college), it is incredibly difficult for me even if I am able to communicate with them through facebook etc.

As you may have guessed, based on my small number of friends, I have pretty significant social anxiety and find it difficult to make friends. I truly got lucky in meeting them and I know that even if I somehow got over my social anxiety, I am not going to meet anyone like them again. What is even more scary is that after college, it is going to be infinitely more difficult to make friends since college is such a social environment (not that I was very good at making friends there...). None of this is helped by the fact that I do not care to drink alcohol, or be around people that drink, which severally limits my ability to socialize or meet others since most people enjoy those things (fortunately, my two friends have similar opinions).

I just think that best option is to kill myself after graduation since after that, I will likely never be happy, which, in my opinion, the only reason to live (i.e. sounds selfish, but not for me, since I enjoy making other people happy).

I know that most people will give me advice (or suggest I see a therapist) about overcoming my social anxiety, but I do not think that will make me happy since I still do not want to lose my friends since they are the only people that I care about. Think of it like this, most people have a family that they care about that will be with them no matter what, but I do not have that since my family has died before I got to college, so to an extent, I think of them as my family.

I have been thinking about doing ending my life after graduation for a while, and I honestly think the only solution is if I somehow got a job in the same location/area as one of them but that might be that likely depending on where everyone ends up."

Essentially, I got an A.A. in Gen Ed and then tried to figure out where to go from there as I was thinking of transferring to a major university, but then I started looking really close at some of the A.S. programs my state college offered and what they would eventually help me get certs wise. I took quite a few classes and already fulfilled most of the Gen Ed and math requirements for the degree as well as all the electives, so I just had to take a few more classes that were centered in the Computer Science department itself. I chose (and fell in love with) the CCNA classes, CCNP Routing, and a Virtualization course centered on VMware in the datacenter. 

Since then I used some of the loan money to acquire various Cisco switches and routers as well as a server off of eBay. In retrospect, I probably shouldn’t have but I don’t have any regrets doing so.

My issue is that part of my A.S. degree is a work cooperative. The school sets up interviews for an internship and/or job. If I get it, I have to get my boss or HR to fill out paperwork for me weekly describing what I’ve done and how I could improve, etc. I have yet to get a job/internship and I have gone to every interview and felt like everything was Okay. The interviewers and I had a good back and forth and I was excited at the prospect of finally working in a job that would actually use my skills. Alas, it is not to be (yet).
 
I am trying to figure out what’s wrong with me (or my resume) about why I’m not getting these positions and internships. The only thing I can think of is that I don’t have any actual experience in a corporate environment or any real work experience in I.T.. However, I am able to answer all of their I.T. related questions and I feel like I have proven in the interview that I know what I’m doing up to a point. I would think that after this point is where they would come in and help give me experience and knowledge that I don’t have yet.
 
I was working on getting my CCNA in the middle of all of this and was about halfway done and then I got devastated and kind of gave up for a little bit. I have the opportunity to either pick it back up, or work on something else for a while. I recently won a contest where I got a 74-409 exam voucher for free. So, I was thinking of focusing on that. It’s not VMware, but its virtualization and it’s free. I also decided I should probably study for the MCSA exams and attempt those at some point. I’m just not sure what will be worth the most to me at this time. Initially I thought it would be the CCNA, but that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore according to several articles and posts I’ve read. 

So I am currently at a loss of what to pursue or do at the moment.. generally feeling lost. I just want a job doing what I love… fucking around with technology and helping people in the process.

So, can anyone point out any issues with my resume?

Any tips for interviews? I dress nicely, am polite, and do my best to be honest and professional in regards to my experience and what I wish to accomplish.

Any advice on what to focus on for the moment cert wise? What would be the most help to me to get the internship/job? (All jobs/internships so far have been for helpdesk or junior sys admin. Also, I do not currently have any certs besides ones given by my college for completing certain groups of classes)

Anything to add? Bueller?

2.  Also not sure about the case, I picked this midtower because it has 5 fans, is that too much?

3. The motherboard is listed as a micro, is that enough? or should I opt for a bigger card?

Could use some advice here. Posting on a throwaway for confidentiality. 

**I really want to work in the UK and Europe, as well as do something that I actually like, but based on my current trajectory, that won't happen. So I'm coming here for advice.** I'm interested in possibly getting a second degree in something more technical than my first, but not sure what would be most useful/interesting. Here's my story so far:

**Personal info:**

* USA citizen, no additional citizenships (no arrests or anything that would affect visas)

* 22 years old

* No loans; about $16,000 USD in savings

**Education background:**

I'm graduating from a top 50-university in the USA with a BA in International Relations and Business, and I spent a year abroad at a top tier university in the UK. While I am glad my IR major led to abroad opportunities during university, I am finding that it is limiting in terms of international opportunities after university because I have no hard skills and the job market looks bleak in the UK/Europe so they're hiring domestically/EU more.

**Job outlook:**

Anyway, I have a full time job starting this August when I graduate at a high tech company. This job is doing things like business strategy, sales, and marketing. I've been doing this job for a year already as a remote intern, and feel like I won't be learning much new soon. (Though, obviously, full time vs remote part time intern is very different, so I will have to adjust.) I accepted the job because I didn't have any direction and wanted a safety net. It's not my dream job, but I'm grateful to have it, I like the people, and it pays pretty well. So I'm okay staying here for the next year or two. 

**Key issue: How to 1) find which skills to develop, and then 2) develop them**

*However*, I don't want to get complacent in this job. I want to keep improving on my skills and for that I need your help! How do I strategize developing skills that would be necessary at an international level? I can do math (have gotten A's in all classes up to basic calculus and statistics in university) and science, but I have heard so many people say I don't know what I'm getting into and that unless I'm *really* passionate (""can you talk someone's ear off about it?"") about engineering/computer science/etc, I won't like it.

That's just my problem though: I don't know what I like! Obviously I'm not a good judge of my own preferences because I picked IR and after 3 years I'm sick of it. So I'm having trouble trusting myself and others when it comes to these decisions, leaving me in a ""wheels spinning, going nowhere"" phase which is stressful and irritating. So, help me get out of this rut....Any suggestions on where to go from here? How do I know what I like until I try it?

**More about myself**

*I'm sorry if this looks like some kind of diary. It's not linear, my thoughts are not organized. I write things down as they come. I write about what feels important to me, and I understand they might not sound important to you (like how I got to pick a mobile OS). All of these things lead me to where I am today.*

I fell in love with computers early. Then it was the Internet. Eventually I started programming and discovered the open source movement. I hated Microsoft for some reasons, and only used Linux from 2006 to 2009.

When I was about 5, I knew I wanted to be an inventor. When I was 8, I wanted to work with computers. At 11, I knew that I wanted to study Computer Engineering. At 15, I was convinced that I would go for the PhD.

I always had a fascination for Apple products, it started with iPods. I watched every Keynote. I'm fascinated by Steve Jobs and relate a lot to him. I never owned a Mac or a iPhone, but I owned many iPods and an iPad. I don't consider myself an Apple fanboy.

The iPod triggered an interest for mobile computing. I started to learn everything about mobile computers, smartphones, etc. I still do to this day.

Before getting my first smartphone, I spent a lot of time comparing platforms and deciding which one I would get. I decided webOS was the superior mobile OS, and waited for the HP Pre 3 to be released. But HP killed it. 

At the same time, I discovered Windows Phone. I always hated Windows Mobile (with the start menu and stylus), and it was a shock when I discovered Windows Phone. Metro completely changed my opinion of Microsoft, and I immediatly bought a Windows Phone and started developping apps. Thanksfully, I was forced to learn Microsoft technologies at school, so it got easy. That's when I stopped hating Microsoft and embraced them.

Most of my professional experience has been related to mobile. I did QA on mobile for 18 months. I started building Windows Phone apps in my free time. I had an internship as an iOS developer. I'm now working with Xamarin to build applications on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. I see myself staying in the field of mobile for a long time.

Ever since I first saw a Palm Pilot or an iPod, I started drawing mobile devices. I loved to design the hardware, but my main focus was on software. At 12, I was already drawing UI that - I feel - had more potential than what we're using today. People would manipulate things and actions, not apps. I never stopped thinking about how computer UI/UX could be improved, with a focus on mobile.

My job is interesting, and I learn a lot. However, I don't feel I'm reaching my full potential. I always wanted to do Research and work on challenging and unresolved problems (in knowledge representation, HCI, UX/UI, etc), but I don't see myself doing 3-4 years in school learning stuff I already know just to get my bachelor degree, so that I could start a Master and eventually apply for PhD. When I quit, I was convinced that I would work for myself, or start my own company, and that a degree would be useless. I'm not sure what to think anymore.

I've been following startups a lot since 2010. Most of what I read is about startups in California, mostly SF. I gained a fascination for the United States, and couldn't stop thinking how great things are there. In Canada, I can't barely name 10 important tech companies. We have BlackBerry and CGI, while the US has Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Palantir, Twitter, etc. Bell Labs was in the US. Xerox Parc was in the US. This is where it's at and that's where I want to be.

I think I'm becoming jealous of tech workers in the US. Their salaries are 2-3 times what I'm paid here (for the same job), and the cost of living is overall much lower there (other than rent in specific cities). I'm wondering why I'm staying here, and then I realize that my lack of degree makes it very hard for me to move to the US.

Every day, I'm thinking of starting a company. I have tons of ideas. I have a vision. I'm obsessed. I want to change the way people communicate, through technology. I'm convinced it's one of the most important problem of our time, but I struggle to find people that share this opinion, or care enough about this problem to do something about it. Finding investors would kickstart the process, but they're not as generous and risk-tolerant here as in the US. It's probably going to be difficult anyway, as it's way up there in term of risk.

I'm not sure I want to be a programmer anymore. I'm not comfortable using archaic tools and methodologies, knowing that we're capable of much better. Programming is too manual, system architecture is more appealing. I don't get how most of what programmers do today is not automated. I like defining the ""what"", not fiddle with the ""how"". At work, I tend to envy the job of the designers, especially the UX part.

Am I delusional? Am I lazy? Am I asking too much? I don't know. What I know is that I struggle to find any opportunity to work on problems that I deeply care about. I feel like I'm wasting most of my time working on solutions to meaningless problems. I feel most developers are.

From a rising senior with an internship at a bank,were19,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29hqlf/graduate_school_or_career_in_the_industry_from_a/,"So currently I am a rising senior in college with a computer science and cognitive science background. For the last few years I have been deciding whether or not I want to go to grad school or get a career in computer science. In my junior year I decided I wanted to get an internship that summer in comp Sci. Currently I'm a software engineer intern at a bank in the NYC area and I don't really like it. It is slow, it's boring, there is nothing here which grabs my eye and makes me feel like I WANT to work here. I was looking for an experience where I would want to put the extra time and hours to learn things. I wanted to be invested and challenged in what I'm doing. I wanted to work with people who would be invested in what they're doing, but it's as if once 5:00 pm hits, everyone adopts the attitude of ""Not my problem anymore""That being said, I am more confused than ever about what I want to do. I don't know anything about the work culture of west coast companies and how they approach things. I want to see what life is like there but I don't know if it will be right for me. What's it like over there?  How is the attitudes different from working at a bank? Will I actually get to learn or create things? What is the lifestyle like at a startup? Would I just be like a replaceable cog in a company, or would I mean something? Is it the sort of place where you put in more time not because you're expected to, but because you want to solve the damn problem before you go home and forget?As for graduate school, I love school. I love Learning, I love reading papers, and exploring new things. But I don't know if graduate school is right for me. A large part of me wants to get a phd so that I can work for cool companies like vicarious or IBM or some other place that's looking for researchers. That has been influenced in part because I look at all the cool research they used to do at bell labs in the late 80s and 90s and it sounds so awesome, like they were actually akin to mad scientists in a lab. Is this too immature of an outlook on graduate school? What is it like to go to graduate school? Would I be looked badly upon if I wanted to go to graduate school just because? Are there any benefits for going to grad school for vs,be it masters or phd?Finally, thank you guys for the time you took to read through this."

I am a recent graduate with a finance degree from a highly credited business school, and I am am looking for advice on how to get into equity research.

A little bit about me:

I am an introvert, I like working with numbers, I like being able to make decisions, and I like being able to take a creative approach to solving problems. I have been trading stocks for four years, and have a strong interest in due-diligence research.

I have had two internships, one supporting financial advisors at Merrill Lynch, and another doing due diligence type work for a botique equity research firm. 

I have been interviewing for equity research associate positions, but haven't been able to land a job. It seems that these type of positions are more focused on cold calling, and less on modeling, which I am willing to do, but it is hard for me to be enthusiastic in an interview when I am told that 90% of what I will be doing is calling a bunch of people that don't want to talk to me. 

That being said, I like the autonomy of equity research, and the rapidly changing environment. However, I find it hard to show enthusiasm for a job that consists of mostly cold calling.

Am I applying for the wrong type of job? What can I do to make sure the next time I get an interview, I am able to get the position?"

(I apologize in advance for grammatical errors and flaw vocab choices. I came from another country but I stayed in U.S for long time that asking Reddit feels more comfortable)
I graduated this winter (2013), but I did not get the diploma, because I couldn't pay the tuition up to this moment. Situation is little more complicated than simply getting a loan and it is a major problems from getting a job, but it is not the main reason why I am asking for help.
I had to stop going to school for financial and family reason (2008), but came back to school after few years. After getting a 2nd chance, I believed and had pressure to ace my performance in school then job market, but it miserably failed. When I barely graduated school, all I had in me was loathsome body, chronic illness, depression, and financial problem. I lost will to live, avoided everything, and hid in the cave for awhile. It's bit hard to describe how I felt back then, but I can say for sure that it felt horrible and I do not ever want to go back to that time.
With my friends' help and some changes in mind, I've been working at the temporary job to support myself and payoff some personal debts first. I would say it did more than I expected. I've been sleeping regularly, slowly working out, and struggled to fix my habits. I got more problems to fix, but I believe I made good progress. Moreover,although there are many fears still in me, but my head is more clear and I remembered what I really want to pursue in my life. I've trying to keep doing something so I do not give time for myself to get eaten by guilt and shame, and I made some general goals and plans. However, there are some insights and information I need to stand up again. Here are some long term plans and situations.

1.I'm going back to my country within this year. And I want to be physically and mentally prepared when I go back because it will hit hard.

2.As a first step, I'm trying to apply to interns either in U.S or my country most likely. Applying should happen soon. (Aiming for U.S companies that has branches or business in my home country because of few brief experiences.)

3.Tuition situation will be also solved hopefully within this year.
4.I majored international studies(BA), and my knowledge is well-rounded but not too deep.(Economics, history, and etc.)

Some of them are bit unrealistic, but I need a goal so I don't stop and keep gaining momentum. What I would like to ask are

1.I'm currently starting to study again to expand myself, but I would like to know what would be good for me to study for interviews as well. 

2.I still feel sick from time to time and still under pressure, fatigue and fear. It would be not easy to get rid of them especially because I've been carrying them for many years. To the people living with good self-discipline, how do you motivate and restrain yourself with long-term persistence?



Writing this down actually made me feel better somehow. Now I got to run to work, but I will be back to check soon. Hope you guys all have a good day."
