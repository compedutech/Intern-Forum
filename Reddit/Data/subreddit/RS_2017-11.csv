Lots of the questions will revolve around basic qualitative questions to understand my experience in maths with a focus on stats as well as going into developing plans around questions product managers have and figuring out what data to record and how to analyze them.

Does anyone have any insight into how much hard math I should know? I'm a junior in university studying game design with a marketing minor but I have yet to really dive into any insights analyst classes. I haven't even taken a stats course since AP Stats in high school.

I've analyzed data from usability tests but thats different.

I'm trying to just refresh my memory as much as possible and from what I remember stats math isn't too difficult mainly understanding what biases can occur and how to remedy them is the hard part. Can anyone confirm that?

What level of math do you need? With calculator or no calculator?

What kind of paradoxes are common and I should definitely know? The recruiter mentioned ""Simpson's Paradox."" Never heard about it until now -- should I have?"

I've applied for 20~30 jobs and got a few interviews last month. These interviews didn't go really well probably due to lack of preparation. My grades are decent and I've done 3 internships, but somehow I 'm not getting any interviews recently, and I couldn't find any entry-level developer jobs to apply for anymore. There are other entry-level jobs but they either require web dev experience or Java experience which I don't have. I only did low-level system development (C) during my internships, but only a few companies hire C programmers in Vancouver.

I think I should probably stop searching for jobs now, focus on school and try to learn something new so I can apply for other types of jobs after moving to Vancouver in January. Also, I can have more time to prepare for interviews since I will not need to worry about assignments/exams at that time. But I'm really worried that I couldn't find a job in Vancouver and I need to move back to Toronto, so it is ideal for me to have a job offer before January.

The problem is I have never done any internships and have never had any job opportunities. I have no experience whatsoever. 
I have recently convinced myself that I hate doing business and feel incompetent in my field of business, for I feel like I just went to class for the degree and nothing else; not even to pursue to the knowledge/theories in business classes.

The only thing I feel like I learned anything about business is people skills and how to observe the situation, and maybe a little bit on business thoeries but nothing on how an organization is structured or how to read a financial statement. After graduation, I convinced myself that I wanted to learn computer science and to become an android developer, so I have been studying since then.

While studying I have been getting opportunities to do sales jobs, which again I am not interested in, and feel cocky for since I believe my degree holds more value (I also believe these sale jobs are scam posts in linked in as well). But after so much time of not having any experience whatsoever, I realized that I not doing anything or growing at all.

Right now, I really want to get a job and make some income, while I learn coding; I feel like learning coding and getting a job with coding while not having a degree in Computer Science; makes my dreams seem unrealistic. So right now I believe that I should get a job in something that I at least have a degree in business. 

But the issue is, I feel like I will resent working in business and not find the line of work meaningful (I know I sound spoiled). So I'm really lost right now.

Do I go back to school for a CS degree, or do a bootcamp in CS and then try to find a job afterward; or should I be looking a jobs in business. 
I know I say I hate business, but I have never done any real work in business so I am unsure whether I am just being bias, since I was not interested in the management aspect of business. 

I know that I enjoy doing work involving analyzing and solving problems, hence why I have started learning code, but is there a job like this in business. So what can I even do with a business management degree besides business consulting, and sales? I am so lost and unsure what to pursue here. Do I go for that small business job and build my resume with that experience or do I pursue what I believe I will enjoy doing in the future? 

Any advice that anyone can share or give would be very much appreciated. 
Thank you!"

Before getting the job, I improved as a programmer by doing side projects, doing college classes and practicing interview questions.

So, I am a teenager, will be graduating from high school soon. I am the one to whom you compare yourself when your father compares you to Sharmaji's son; at least you didn't do as bad as I did. And it's pretty evident to me that even though I will get the pass marks due to country policy, there won't be any college waiting for me. And, my parents seriously lack the ability to pay exorbitant fees or donations to get me into some private college. I think I can make it to a local college, but I guarantee you that I will end up dead within the first four semesters. These are less colleges, and more recruitment centres for political parties to fill their goons quota. And I, for the love of God, can't figure out when to keep my trap shut. Sooner or later I will say something to someone, and bam! My body will be in a ditch.

And I know the most sane advice for me would be to just study and work as hard as I can to avoid getting such low scores. And believe me,  I am trying, I really am. But each night is just ending in more tears for me. I seem to lack the minimum capability to make sense of the written materials and books, I can't even recall what I studied an hour back. The only subject that I think I will be okay in is English Literature and Vernaculars since I love reading stories and shit. At this rate, my future looks pretty grim. My friends are studying to be doctors, engineers and shit and I will be stuck forever in this shithole of a place.

Now the thing is I know a bit of programming. Not good enough, but many  other guys (not Indian, I met them on various forums and groups) I know, who have been learning with me and are around the same level as me, are gearing up for internships and apprenticeship after high school. While most of them will attain a college sometime in the future but they ain't that worried about jobs without degrees. Does India have such opportunities? Can I intern for any companies? If not a coding job, any other things I should look into? My town, or half-village or whatever, doesn't have any such opportunities, (unless I am willing to work at a tea stall, in which case it has plenty). I haven't been really to anywhere  that is not within a few miles radius of this town and as such I lack first hand experience about any other places. I tried searching on internet, but most internships are for college students. So is there any such opportunity in India? Or am I just fucked, plain and simple? Anyway, thanks for reading this long."

Currentl I'm a network Admin and I have been in the Computer/IT world professionally for about 4 years now. Immediately out of high school I found a full time job and started working right away. I knew that in the Computer world experience and certifications can sometimes speak louder than a degree. After working with computers and networking I've come to realize that this isn't what I want to do. As I'm sure many people have done in their lifetime. 

I've always said that if I go back to school it would be for Engineering. That is the only other thing that has interested me and after working with a couple of Electrical Engineers I know that I would like to get my electrical engineering degree. 

Unfortunately my current role requires me to travel very frequently (at least 2-3 times a month) and getting into school is going to be problematic with this role. 

At the moment I live with my Fiance in an Apartment and out rent alone is a fair amount. So I need to have a job that can at least help cover our bills while I am going back to school. I would like to get into something like an internship where I can start gaining electrical engineering experience while also going to school(internship). 

However I would have to find this job before starting school so I can make sure that my schedule is able to accommodate my class schedule. Have you guys ever been in this situation or seen where this situation is possible? Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  "

I know, I know, Japan seems like a dream for many people, but to be honest, for me the only important bit was the name of said large company to be written in my resume. The ad was well made, had all the logos and important information on it, so I had no reason to be wary.

I wrote a long E-Mail to the address on the ad, praising myself, my knowledge and the company, and, to my delight, I got an E-Mail back that informed me that I was going to be accepted! Along with it, there was a massive contract about all sorts of things, that, on hindsight, I really wish I had read. But, being in a state of glee, I just printed the whole 200 pages, signed multiple forms about data protection, some disclaimers, packed the whole thing up and sent it to an address that I got via E-Mail. So far, so good. A few months later I received further instructions alongside with some plane tickets, so I packed up my stuff and went on to make the jump over the great puddle.

I arrived at the Tokyo Airport from where I took some weird kind of space train south to Kumamoto. I guess that should have been the time for me to get nervous, since the company that I was visiting is located in Minato, Tokyo. But, whatever. I was kind of bummed out that day because I thought that I was going to be working at a third-party company that was owned by the big one and that wasn’t necessarily what I got in mind. I reached the assigned hotel in Kumamoto and checked in for the night. Upon reaching my room, I found a letter for me which informed me that tomorrow an official would come and pick me up from the hotel to take me to the designated location. That’s fine, I thought, and proceeded to go to bed. It had been a stressful day with all the travelling and the new impressions, and I wanted to be well rested to make a good impression in the morning.

I woke up to a dark hotel room. Something was off, I knew that right from the moment I opened my eyes. I was a exceptionally light sleeper, and would often wake from minor disturbances. I kept laying still to figure out what had set me off this time. After a while, I could make out a very silent hissing noise. The air conditioning, I thought. I tried to resume sleeping, but the sound, as silent and small as it was, kept me awake. It began to seep through the integrity of my whole self, penetrated my sanity and with every second that passed on, I felt myself slipping deeper and deeper into a furious rage. Suddenly, I had enough. I flipped my bedsheets and sprang up from the bed. Except for, I actually punched myself in the face because my arm felt like it was made from lead, and fell face first to the ground as I rolled from my bed. Something was very, very wrong. I tried to stand up, but felt it very hard to even move my limbs. The metallic taste of shock and panic rose in my mouth. Was I having a stroke? My panic rose, as I felt darkness chewing away at the edges of my vision. Suddenly, everything went dark.

*A dark alley. Screams in the distance. Sirens. People running, falling, stepping on each other in an insane frenzy as everyone scrambles away. I look up. The sky is dark, lit by an orange glow of a hundred fires. I feel powerful, huge. I look down. I’m on all four. My hands are disfigured limbs of pure monstrosity. Three fingers, two thumbs. All with obsidian claws, sharp as a ceramic dagger. Somehow, I am fascinated by it. My arms are muscular, scaled, but also overgrown by a shiny fur, like the one you would see on a Doberman dog. The insides of my palms are dark. A fluid is dripping from my claws to the floor. I know it’s blood, I can smell it. I raise my hand to my nose and take a deep breath. Thousands of different smells hit me like a strong wave. A new part of my brain jumps to life, and I instantly feel a massive amount of information flow into my consciousness. Eighteen different people. Seven women, eleven men. None of them older than 35. One of the men had tuberculosis. Another was pumped with excessive amounts of some kind of antidepressant. I feel bad about them.*

*As I lower my hands, I take a look around me. I am in some sort of hallway, in a building. The place is heavily messed up. My hands and feet make no audible sound as I begin to travel down the hallway. In front of me lies a body, trampled by the fleeing pack of humans that try to get away from me. As I move closer, I can hear the heartbeat. The woman is on the edge of death. Somehow sensing my approaching, she turns herself around in a last attempt of defiance. My arm rises, the claws spread out. Wait a minute, I don’t want to kill that woman! No matter how heavy her injuries may be, I’m not going to be the one who ends her life. I realize just now, that I’m not the one in charge of this body that feels like mine. I feel a mild surprise, that didn’t emerge from my own self. Something is in this brain together with me. No, the opposite is the case. I am inside another brain, and now I’m busted. It doesn’t want me there, where I fight against its will to do unspeakable things to the poor woman down there on the floor. I feel a strong reluctance against my presence. It’s so much stronger than me, and slowly, very slowly, the raised claws start moving again, faster and faster, gathering more and more energy, targeted right at the face that stares up on me, wearing a mask of pure, unadultered terror. Right as it hits, I feel like I’m getting flinged away. Everything goes back to black.*

*I’m sorry, random woman.*

Blue Sky. A bright sun. Birds are flying. I think those are… yes, those are seagulls. It’s warm around me. I raise my arm, and to my relief, it is my regular, human arm that I spend countless hours on shaping at the gym. Sand falls from my hand into my eyes. I sit up, rubbing my eyes to get it out. My head hurts. I feel a thirst that could empty a whole bathtub. With the sand removed, I take a look around. I’m on a beach. A rather nice one, to add. Nice, white sand, a nice, blue colored sea. Palm trees. It’s a perfect cliché of a holiday beach resort. Minus the people, I must add. To my left, the beach ends in bushes and rocks that look volcanic, you know those, sharp edged, black volcano stone. To my right, the beach continues a couple hundred feet and disappears around a corner. Behind me is a jungle of palm trees and other plants, seemingly impenetrable. As I try to get up, my hand brushes cold metal. I look down, and its... a shotgun? Some kind of Mossberg, I guess. I pick it up, it’s loaded. To my other side lies a backpack. I open it up, and the first thing I see is two bottles of water.

Never in my whole life have I ever tasted something that good. It’s amazing, like an elixir of the tears of god. That’s a stupid metaphor, its fresh water. I keep sitting for a while, trying to figure out what the hell happened to me, how I came here, and what I’m going to do next. I have no idea what happened after the hotel room. My clothes are the same that I came to Japan with, say: a T-Shirt with the logo of a metal band, khaki cargo shorts and my trusty shoes with separate toes. I can feel my headache starting to fade, and I decide to get going, shoulder the backpack, take the Mossberg (you never know), and start to head down the Beach. Maybe I will find someone who can tell me where I am, and how I got here.

End of part one."

Another option is to work any job I can find there for a few months until I can find something that is related to my degree.

I don't have a good level of Spanish so I feel this may restrict a lot of opportunities and I also don't have that much experience.

That turned into 5 on-site interviews, 3 of which have been rejections and the other 2 upcoming ones I've lost all confidence for.

I've become a social recluse turning down all social activities to apply to jobs/practice technical questions/interview. Or struggling to finish my schoolwork because of lack of time.

7a5ztv,2,2017-11-01,Leaving Retail,MaskYourExpressions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7a5ztv/leaving_retail/,"I've been working at Costco. Important things to note:
- Health and Dental
- I make $15/hr, and time and a half on Sunday. Eventually I top out at about $21/h. Bonus checks kick in around the same time.

However, my building is a hellhole. So with these benefits come
- Verbal abuse from supervisors and management
- Favoritism in regards to everything
- Expectation of doing the job of 3 people.

Needless to say, I hate the job with every fiber of my being and I want to quit. However, I also currently go to college for Computer Science. I'm half way through my (hopefully) second to last semester. My grades aren't the best due to working while in school, and I've never gotten an internship. But I really really dislike the concept of loans, so I've avoided them...until now?

I want to leave Costco, yesterday. I won't go into it, but I find the actions of management disgusting, disrespectful, and unforgivable. However, I've never been wealthy and I have no help from family or anything, so there's a mentality that I can't shake that won't let me throw caution to the wind and just quit. College tuition is taken care of, but leaving the job would require me taking out loans in order to survive during that time. I live very basic means (currently in my car), so it won't necessarily be a large loan. Still, the idea of leaving guaranteed long term income, not knowing if I'll land on my feet after school, worries me. There are a lot of stories on this sub about that makes me feel like I shouldn't put all my eggs in the CS basket.

Costco actually has a college retention program. This allows you to take time off, only working during winter/summer break. You need to apply for it at the start of a semester, though, making it so I would have to wait until January to put in for it, when I'm at the end of my rope now. I want to use my last semester at school to really dive into the tech field, without the stress from Costco weighing me down.

Has anyone here even been in a similar situation? I have some ""escape tactics"", but I'm curious to what the general view is.

My name is Sarah. In May I graduated from a 5 year double bachelors program where I double majored in German and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering. The program is 5 years because you go to Germany for a year (study and internship).

After school I took a job at an elevator company doing a training program to be a project manager because it was the first job I was able to get after searching for many months and I was starting to get scared I wouldn't get hired so I just took it. I'm realizing its not a perfect fit but I will probably stick with it for a while just to get some experience out of college.

I have so many varied interests that I have no idea what career/job would be right for me. They include the following:

* Statistics/ statistical methods/ experimental design
* Process improvement/ process optimization (not keen on the idea of working in a factory but I'm interested in improving non-manufacturing processes)
* Traffic systems/ traffic flow management
* I'm really good at CAD (Solidworks) and I love doing it (including fluid mechanics simulations, stress/strain evaluation, all the advanced stuff as well as regular drafting)
* I'm really good at Excel and I love using it to solve problems (using the different formulas, learning new ones, using the solver function and setting up optimization problems that way, I have basic handle on writing and employing macros using VBA to make tasks faster/ make ""excel calculators"" for repetitive tasks)
* I really like computer programming (i have a good grasp on Python but that's the only language I know), in my last year of college I did an independent study writing a genetic algorithm from scratch in python and I absolutely loved it
* I'm interested in Big Data and IoT but I don't have a computer/software engineering background so I don't know how I would ever enter that field

Does anyone have any advice on a good job/ place to look that I might be able to combine some of my many interests? I kind of feel like I'm all over the place and I just don't even know what I should be searching for. Searches for ""Industrial Engineer"" on places like Indeed.com usually turn up with manufacturing engineering things and like I said I'm not too keen on the factory work environment. 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice :)"
7a6b35,1,2017-11-01,Advice: Should I get a M.S. in Data Science?,avpan,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7a6b35/advice_should_i_get_a_ms_in_data_science/,"Hello,

Just a little background, I already possess a M.S. in Physics (2015) and since been trying to transition into the data science/analytics industry. I have done things such as The Data Incubator bootcamp and have a decent grasp at basic concepts like machine learning. So I'm not a complete noob. 

Unfortunately, I have done interviews and always fall short of landing the job. It has mostly been due to experience in knowledge and work. But it hasn't been all bad as I am freelancing to pick up projects when I can and currently working on a contract that could potentially lead to a full-time job. 

My parents are tired of me failing in my job prospects and my father keeps insisting I go work as a physicist instead of a data scientist, despite the fact I've spent all my resources into learning more and more about machine learning and other topics in the field. As a result, they are almost forcing me to apply to graduate schools to get another M.S. (stereotypical asian family).

My question, ""Is it worth it to even apply to graduate schools now?"" If I did apply I would only apply to ones I would really want to go to vs. just to get accepted. 
i) It forces me to retake the stupid GRE (hate it and std exams with a passion) because my scores are expired. Not hard, just annoying
ii) Would I even be competitive vs. other applicants.
iii) Is it even necessary? My gut instinct says I should just focus on building my career and see where my freelancing and continuing job search takes me. 

The pros of continuing another degree would be to focus on fields I'm most interested in like NLP (i know some stuff, but it getting some expert knowledge on it would be awesome). The fact that I could be eligible for internships since I would be a student, that would finally get me that ""work experience"" in industry that so many jobs are looking for. 

I'm not looking for interview advice or anything because I am very well aware of my current weaknesses (which I am working on rectifying). 

I'm at a crossroads in my life and seeing what professionals and others think I should do. "

My life has always been quite messy growing up (losing our homes/cars/college fund in 08, watching my mom struggle to bring us out of homelessness, a generally dysfunctional family life growing up, etc.) which might explain some of my disorganized tendencies although i don't necessarily blame that for my current state.

I used to have a decent job at 18 working in the mmj field. I can happily say that I was good at my job, had good feedback with customers and ALWAYS picked up extra days but NEVER took days off unless I was deathly ill. I even came to manage the shop alone the day after having surgery. However, this is what inevitably drove me to quit. I was spending 2 weeks straight working 10 hour days, no lunchbreak, stuck inside a windowless store and although I was banking, It was taking my life away from me for merely $10 an hour. That was 2 years ago.

Since then, I've gone back to school, taken some oddjobs and internships in fields before realizing that it wasn't for me. I'm currently unsure of what my next step should be. I have interest in so many things. I love politics, law, PR, film, computer technology. My biggest dream would be to become a documentary-film maker but I feel that I'd need the experience in other fields to get there along with film school. I'm very close to a Journalism degree incidentally but I've found that I would rather continue with classes focusing on broadcast media rather than print journalism. I don't want to be a print journalist but I would use it as a stepping stone.

7aa46x,3,2017-11-02,Help with statement of purpose,hillenburg,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7aa46x/help_with_statement_of_purpose/,"Hello, can you please read my SoP and suggest potential changes?

Equipped with an insatiable curiosity and a screwdriver, I was amazed when I discovered what lay underneath a CPU cabinet. The sight of complex circuits, a number of chips and a ton of different devices was more than enough for me to fall in love with computers. The experience inspired me to learn more and more about computers. It was fascinating how software and hardware integrated with each other. I wanted to experience first-hand how writing, compiling and executing a program feels, urging me to learn programming languages. And just like that, I was hooked.

I started studying Machine Learning (ML) via a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC). The mathematics involved was fun to code and it was nothing less than magic watching mere equations create models used for prediction and classification. By the end of the course, I successfully implemented a Multilayer Perceptron that could accurately classify the MNIST Dataset. I began to have a predilection for the algorithms and the underlying mathematics; it was then that I realised that my interests lay in pursuing ML.

At the end of my fifth semester at VIT, I interned at i3Systems Pvt. Ltd., a start-up utilising Machine Learning to automate medical insurance claim processes. Dr. Mallesh Bommanahal, CEO defined two objectives for the internship. My first objective was to create a classifier to segregate medical reports. The approach was simple: vectorise the text and then feed it to a classifier for training. To find the best classifier, I worked with Random Forests, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron. After the requisite experimentations, it was decided to incorporate the Naïve Bayes Classifier in production. My second objective was to create a Computer Vision (CV) model that could identify and mask the name of the patient on a medical report. Utilising a concoction of Tesseract and openCV ensured the objective was met perfectly.

Impressed with my work, I was given a return offer of another internship at the end of my sixth semester. The objective was to develop a custom spell checking algorithm to fix OCR errors. Utilising a general dictionary was not helpful as very specific words and phrases needed correction. At first, I was trying to meet my objective using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which performed with an accuracy of 85% at best. However, while looking out for possible tweaks, I came across a blog that suggested using n-grams. After building a prototype, it was found that the n-gram algorithm had an accuracy of 92%, which with further adjustments increased to 97%. It made me realise that not all problems should be solved using complicated approaches; sometimes, the simple ones do a better job.

During my sixth semester, I worked with Prof. Muralidhar A in VIT on a research project that focussed on developing a new algorithm for mining High Utility Itemsets (HUIS). HUIS are the combination(s) of different item(s) that yield high profit in any transactional database. It is imperative to recalculate HUIS whenever the value of any item changes, creating a huge computational overhead. The proposed algorithm suggested saving states beforehand and utilising them later to improve efficiency. The proposed algorithm worked similar to and at times better than the existing one. The paper was published in International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IJPAM). My interest in neural networks led me to contact Dr. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya, a professor at the University of Manchester who is an active part of the spiNNaker Project, which aims to simulate the human brain by generating biologically inspired neural networks. Working with her on creating a model to simulate the Thalamic layer of the human brain made me understand the importance of mathematics and computer sciences in the present world; no scientific research is possible without the both of them.

My undergraduate course at VIT has inculcated in me not just a hunger for knowledge but also a moral responsibility to share ideas. Alongside securing 6th rank academically with a CGPA of 9.45/10 among a batch of 220, I have served as a member of The English Literary Association (ELA) since my second year. Through ELA, I had the opportunity of organising a TEDx event in the college, which received a highly positive response.

At VIT, I made various constructs using Python and ML libraries. Using Tensorflow, I created a Video Analyser that detects frames from any video clip and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict whether I would like the video clip or not. I further downloaded transcripts of the episodes of a TV show and trained a LSTM model to generate sequences of its own. After 100,000 epochs, the model could create its own transcripts, astounding me with the power of AI.

With an enormous increase in availability and accessibility of data, computer science has become one of the leading areas of research. I would like to further delve on this area: to develop and improve ML algorithms so that various sciences can benefit from advances caused by the ripple effects. My capstone project for the UG degree focusses on this domain where I will be working closely with LSTM, CNN and CV. The idea is to closely monitor speech and facial expressions of a person to validate any statistical claims made.

At University of Southern California, I look forward to collaborating with Prof. Hao Li. His work on capturing facial performance using deep convolutional networks has been very successful and is a prime example of using CV with ML. The possibilities of extending this algorithm to generalise users while retaining the accuracy metrics excites me.

In conclusion, my passion for computer science has taken a firm shape over the years. From a simple construct in Turbo C++ to working in various fields with successful start-ups and interacting with inspiring researchers, every experience has helped me develop and nurture my interest. The opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at USC would provide me with an increased exposure and knowledge of current trends being adopted in ML. With my interests lying at the confluence of machine learning and computer vision, a Masters’ degree in Computer Science (Data Science) would be the next important step in realising my passion for researching and developing ML algorithms to create a better future."

Since this sub helped me so much when I was looking for a job, I wanted to try my best to give back. 

I'm a self-taught developer working at a mid-sized tech company (Not at a Big-N), I don't have a CS degree or any internships, and I didn't graduate from any boot camp. If I can land a job, I know that those of you graduating or whom have graduated can too! 

I asked my manager, who hired me, what it was that set me apart from the other candidates. His response was simple: I had working, easily demo-able projects that followed many conventions that they use. 

The single biggest thing I see lacking from most Github profiles or personal websites is a link to a working version of your projects. This is what helped to set me apart. For what it's worth, my one project was A full stack ToDo application, very simple in its presentation but I worked really hard to get all the pieces right and use modern best practices. This includes making the front end with Bootstrap, Sass, and React/Redux and making the backend using a Node/Express.js API and a Mongo database. It also had authentication/authorization for users to log in and view their specific To dos. I hosted it online at Heroku. After my interview, I even noticed my manager had created an account and made some blog post himself, to test out how the app worked. 

I realize not all companies are like this, and some just want you to known algorithms front and backwards. I just don't think you can underestimate the impressiveness of having a working application that uses the latest technology, especially if the job you're applying for uses that very same tech! 

Edit: Just to clarify, this was not the only thing that landed me a job. I still had to go through the interview process and answer questions on design patterns, do some whiteboarding on Linked List and Stack/Queue questions and discuss the pros and cons of certain technology choices. I also live in a US tech hub with lots of job opportunities, and still had to send out 300+ applications to get this job. "

A large technology company reached out to me on LinkedIn offering me a position post-grad that would likely pay around $90-100k/yr.

Should I inquire about the salary I'd be offered at my current company once I graduate? Should I mention the other company as leverage?

So you know my question, here’s a bit of a back story. I’m 20 years old and currently attending community college in Upstate NY studying CIS (Computer Information Systems) after a major switch from Computer Science, I couldn’t pass calculus but I also think I wasn’t applying myself enough. Anyway, since I did switch my major in my second year of college some of my credits didn’t transition over so fluidly to my new major leaving me with around 8 credits that were worthless to my new CIS degree. This led me to have to stay an extra semester in college and I’m currently in my third year, fall semester finishing up my associates degree. Problem being is that the one class that I need for my degree was not offered this semester so I couldn’t complete my degree this semester. Basically I’d have to come back for one class for a whole semester, which is worthless to me because it’s a two year degree school, not a four year. So my plan was to transfer out to a four year school and complete both my associates and bachelors degree there. 

... Fast forward a couple months and I have a girlfriend who now goes to school in Manhattan and she moved down there. Me being moved out of my parents house for the past year and being completely independent from them figured it was time for a change and I’m (basically) living down there and commuting upstate for school two days out of the week and some other days for work. I’m in the process of getting a transfer down to a store in Manhattan with my job but it doesn’t pay all to much (around $14-15 an hour, full time). I want to try to “get my foot in the door” of a technology company down in Manhattan because were going to be there for the foreseeable future. 

I have programming experience on my own and have even ran my own freelance business for programming and web design which did well and I had quite a few clients. I want to apply for jobs with these larger tech companies but also want to know the best way to go about it so that someone like me without a full college degree yet but with experience can score something entry level or even an internship with a company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft etc. I already have a resume that I complied and have my certification from Apple as well as a side note. My job currently is also in a technology related field. 

What’s the best way to go about this Reddit? "
7ad1qc,0,2017-11-02,Best MBA programs Purely on What's Taught and/or Learning Environment?,skwanh,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/7ad1qc/best_mba_programs_purely_on_whats_taught_andor/,"I'm not really interested in going to an MBA program for career networking/opportunties. Rather, I'm far more interested in going to business school to learn about the business curriculum (marketing, product development, entrepreneurship, etc). I'd sign up as a full-time student to truly commit myself to that.

I would prefer to go to a top 25, top 15 school because I'm well aware that it just wouldn't be financially feasible to go anywhere below that- and I'd like to think that knowledge transfer between students would fare better at a better ranked school (I'm open to being convinced otherwise)

So my question is: what are the best schools to just learn, from professors and each other? I truly do not care about recruiting from other companies or getting a plum internship at a big company or hooking up with a consulting firm after graduation. I really don't need that stress in my life, and honestly, I do just fine at my current job to go after unnecessarily cutthroat job opportunities. I'd like to be able to start my own company after getting an MBA, and hopefully the knowledge I learn in business school would help with that, but my main focus is enjoying the two years I spend going to school.

What do you plan on doing?,michiharuharu,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7ad5fe/im_worried_about_my_plans_after_graduation_what/,"I'm graduating next fall, a semester ahead than planned. I currently attend school three hours away from home and majoring in a major within the human services field. Typical higher paying jobs in my field require a masters degree, but I don't know if I want to go straight to graduate school after graduation since I have no experience in my field besides my planned internship next fall. If I do go for my masters, I've been contemplating going for something different than my undergrad major to get a higher paying job. I just don't know what though because I haven't found a love for a field yet. 

If I don't go for my masters, I'll probably go back to my hometown which is a suburb outside a large city. I could get my own apartment with roommates, but I know I'd save more money living at home for a while and I don't know if I'd find a job right after graduation. The only problem with that is that dating and hanging with friends would be awkward/difficult while living at home. 

I've also entertained the idea of job searching within the field of my undergrad degree that is above minimum wage and somewhere new. I want to experience more than just my hometown and college town, but I'm afraid of doing this by myself since I'd have no job security and moving away is expensive. 

It's a lot to think about considering I have almost exactly a year until graduation. I feel like it's much easier for those within the STEM field who can get jobs right out of college with large companies after their internship. My internship has to be within 60 miles of my college town which is a pretty rural area and I do not plan to stay here after graduation. Anyone else at the same point in life as me and stressing? What are your plans?"

7ae89r,0,2017-11-02,What I Learned at the Ameren Accelerator --- a startup story,retapeoj,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/7ae89r/what_i_learned_at_the_ameren_accelerator_a/,"Last spring was an exciting yet challenging time for RB. Coming out of LightFair 2017 we were confident about our potential but we knew we had a ton of work to do. We had customers but our team was still small and there was a bit of uncertainty in the air.

In our little office in Sun Prairie Wisconsin we focused on rebate data collection, project submittal work and making our software more user friendly. We were making strides and confident we were heading the right direction yet still unsure about our future.

When we first got notice about the Ameren Accelerator it was in an email via F6S, I still remember the first thought I had when I looked at it, this was exactly what we needed.

I mean really, a investor owned utility running a startup accelerator!? Could this be real?? Seemed too good to be true.

The email was from Brian Dixon, the COO of Capital Innovators in St. Louis. A few days later another email came in from their Program Director Trevor Tune. We applied, interviewed two times on the phone, travelled to St. Louis to pitch our business and were fortunate enough to be one of 7 companies that were selected for the first Ameren Accelerator cohort out of 210 applicants, all focused on the energy industry.

As I write this today we still haven't finished the program. On Thursday October 26th we will come together at Demo Day where will be present our business vision in front of our peers, the investor community, Ameren, our customers and friends. The entire cohort is diverse, innovative, forward thinking and we are all solving real problems in the energy sector. 

I wanted to lay out my thoughts on what I learned at the Ameren Accelerator with the team from UMSL, Ameren and Capital Innovators.

* The best ideas may actually come from your customers, listen to them!

The Ameren Accelerator was unique in that the lead investor is a potential customer for our company. This is special because most of the time incubator programs have a wide range of potential customer segments. In this experience we could all agree on at least one thing - the electric utility as a potential client. This helped in our working sessions, with our mentors and in our collaboration as a cohort. We all have a shared customer segment and therefore could offer insights from our own perspective as to doing business with the utility sector.

Ameren also had select business leaders join our teams for the program. This was incredibly impactful. We worked closely with their team and there were a few key individuals who helped us really understand the business. Understanding your customer is really the first step in building anything and by putting us in the same room we really unlocked a lot of great insight, things that otherwise may have been missed.

* It's better to invest in your team than invest in someone else's.

Early on in the program we decided one of our goals at the end would be to launch our next gen RB website. Initially we considered going out to a 3rd party to build it for us, we met with a few local development firms and got quotes. At one of our weekly goal sessions I presented the situation to the other companies. Everyone encouraged us to think about doing the redesign ourselves.

We knew that we wanted to use wordpress but nobody on our team really had much experience with it. At the same time we were matched with our amazing intern from UMSL, Bailee Warsing. She brought a new set of skills to our team and was more than willing to try and learn wordpress.

Bailee, together with our marketing manager Aaron Campbell worked to design our new site, fill it with content and make it look beautiful. And now, we have the expertise in house to handle anything we need to do on the front end. If we had hired out for this it probably would have looked beautiful but would it have been as impactful to our team? Probably not. We did hire a consultant to help us, Brianna from Being your Brand helped us fill in the knowledge gaps and trained our team on how to use the system.

* You have to know what problem you are really solving.

Sometimes the problem you think you are solving is not the real problem at all. We learned early on from our mentors that the solution we’re building needs to solve the end user's problem, not the utility client's problem. If we focus on figuring that out we will find our place in the industry.

Defining and really understanding the problem you are trying to solve is such a focus for early stage startups and you can very easily head down the wrong path just by mis-interpreting the problem. We spent a lot of time on this in our working sessions.

* Hard work is really the secret sauce.

There are no guarantees when you start a company. The only real thing you can control is your effort. Effort can be any number of things and yes it can include thinking. I tell our team that at this point all we need to do is continue to work hard, build our software, listen to our customers, try to earn new ones and think about ways that we can improve the efficiency of utility rebates. These are really the only things we can control.

We come from a background and deep understanding of the utility sector and we're not afraid to ask the questions that need to be asked. We are well aware that we have a lot to learn. Asking the questions and being willing to put in the work to understand is the key foundation we need to make RB successful.

* Connections are valuable but realize that not all of them will turn into opportunities immediately, patience is a virtue.

Realize that when you're building a startup you are forming a thing. Ideally it's a living growing organism that evolves, adapts and innovates to create solutions to the problem you are solving. Sometimes when you present a new company or even an idea it can get the cold shoulder. Change can be difficult and anytime someone is trying to build something there is always a bit of skepticism which surrounds the build. Doing nothing is much easier in most cases.

Patience is a core value that we need to effectively embrace when starting something new. You must be patient and willing to let the the no's wash over you. There will be plenty of them and even more non-responses which sometimes can be worse.

Be ready to always look at your business with a clear lens based on feedback from the no's and think of new connections through the lens of how they can help you in the future, not necessarily right at this very moment.


* Your Core Values are what really matters.

The core values of your company should always remain, no matter what strategic direction you take. If they don't stand true to their core for your company than they are not core values.

What I have learned from the Ameren Accelerator is that if you are consistent in your message to industry and within your team, the values will ring true in everything you do.

It's kind of like staying true to your cause. The core values for us represent the basic things that we are working toward every single day. Keeping it simple.

* Small wins can grow into big ones.

Sometimes we get it in our head that we just have to get this one deal closed or get a meeting with this one investor to be successful.

In reality success is measured by all the small stuff coming together and forming a story. Being persistent is critical but you don't need to try to close the big deal everytime you get the decision maker on the phone, small steps can add up to big success.

Timing is very important and the pacing of your company speaks loudly. Be ready when your time comes by being prepared and confident about what you have built.

Also --- storytelling is key.

* Building the core team is like building the foundation, hiring the right people is critical.

We have been fortunate enough to have met some amazing people who are forming the RB core team. Everyone has their own skills, strengths and unique value that they bring to the team.

Hiring the right people is so important, a great hire can produce 10X results whereas a bad hire can pull down the entire team. Taking time to find the right people is a worthwhile investment.

* Creating a system that can operate independently without constant oversight is hard work but thinking about it early is key.

A company is a system of people and technology, working together to produce work that is valuable.

RB has found through this experience that we work best in a system that has a clear flow of information, transparency and trust. I am not interested in building a company that needs me to make all the decisions, all of the time. This is why hiring curious, intelligent and hardworking people is so important.

We are building a company based on shared decision making, at all levels. We're not even sure what that means at this point but we do know that everyone will have input. We want to be a sustainable business working toward a sustainable energy economy.

* Family is key.

We're still a small team but we are bigger than we were back in the spring, we're now at 12 employees and it does feel like a small family. It won't always be like this but I would hope that we will always maintain a respect for one another, trust, a willingness to laugh at the problem and fight through the hard work while always listening to our customers.

We want the customer to feel like they are part of our family, because they are. We are building a member based organization, all centered around the intention to drive energy efficiency forward by making the utility rebate process simple.

And, speaking from my personal experience my family is owed a serious monster truck of gratitude. It was not easy on my wife Katie the last 12 weeks. We have 4 little kids and they have ""home by Halloween"" wired into their little brains, knowing that Daddy will be back home full time by Halloween.

Katie helped me in so many ways these past 3 months, from picking out the clothes that I wore to handling me on the difficult days when nothing seemed to go right, to helping out with key decisions. She is a rock and I am thankful for her love and support.

And, in an odd twist of fate our seed investor, my father in-law Tom was traveling through St. Louis on our final day of the accelerator and got to sit in on one of our cohort meetings. Tom was our initial seed investor back in the summer of 2016. In that meeting Warner Baxter, CEO of Ameren was in attendance and it was a real pleasure to see Tom shake his hand and say, we're partners in this investment.

It really does take a team / family to make anything happen in a sustainable way.

Peace,

Joe"

Is this justifiable, or am I being too hard on myself?",cscqimpostorsyndrome,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7aef2z/im_graduating_next_month_and_i_dont_feel_like_im/,"I'm a senior studying CS in my last semester at a large state school. I have a 4.0, but I've never pursued any independent learning in CS outside of class, so my knowledge ends where my courses did (mostly in the theoretical domain). I did have 3 semesters of co-op experience, but they didn't have any work for me to. I'm not saying that as an exaggeration, I mean that literally. Every now and then I would ask my manager if they wanted me to do anything, and they'd always say no. I would clock in, sit in on meetings, then go back to my desk and read books, play on the internet, watch movies, etc., but I did not produce a single line of code for them in a year. Now as I look towards getting a job post-graduation I don't think I'm remotely qualified to do any of it.

I always assumed in previous semesters that they'd teach me some stuff and eventually I'd know how to do computer science, but now that I'm working on my senior design project (with vastly more knowledgeable team members) I'm panicking at the idea of doing this professionally every single day. I don't understand project architecture. I don't get how a project can have components in more than one language. I know the definition of a server, but the idea of an app communicating with a server is incomprehensibly complex. I don't know any frameworks and I don't have any opinions about IDEs. I've never made a personal project. I'm completely out of my depth on a project that is supposed to take 3 undergraduates a semester to finish. Nothing in my education has prepared me for this, and I always assumed it would. 

It just seems like there's such a massive chasm of difficulty between the trivial (fizzbuzz) and the absurdly complicated (useful projects that run on a bunch of different frameworks with complex architecture) with very little in between. Am I overreacting to think that I should be looking for an internship instead of a job, or delaying my job hunt to spend some time trying to actually learn how do computer science? If I accepted a job that required me to produce things as complicated as the senior project I'm working on, I think I'd crash and burn in a matter of months because of incompetence. 

P.S. If it matters, the project is basically a clone of Tinder, plus/minus a few features."

At the moment I am trying to decide which is the better option to go for, based on specific criteria:

- Which company will be best experience wise/Where will I gain the most valuable work experience. I've called both companies and they have told me that interns do substantial and relevant work, but I have learned it can be hit or miss at both.

- Which company will look best on my resume? Yes this is kind of a superficial reason to select a company, but it is only and internship and I would like to have my resume boosted to be able to apply to a company well suited to what I'd want to be doing, further down the line.

I am not too concerned about good fit for now, since worst case I can always leave the company if I do not feel at home there. Does anyone know if working with a large investment bank has any tangible benefits over a smaller, less known Silicon Valley tech company?

7aeuuc,2,2017-11-02,my me too story,letsgetitoffzechest,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7aeuuc/my_me_too_story/,"Over the past few weeks, I've struggled with what medium is correct for sharing this story. I don't know how to get the feelings out, and I'm so scared people are going to tell me I'm lying because of just how fantastical it is. So maybe I should start by saying however crazy, this happened to me, and I've been carrying it around with me for far too long. For years I believed the lies he told me, how he had proof that everything was consensual, not realizing that i was just falling into his trap again and again. Let’s call my boss “ Bill”. I was a young male of 18, fresh off the mom and dad boat and making my way into the real world. By some miracle ( at 22 the miracle is now more apparent to me) I scored a job at a traveling zoo that runs a course from virginia to georgia, stopping at county fairgrounds and community festivals, sometimes doing college lectures and rescue efforts as well. I thought I was happy as can be, feeding and caring for monkeys and kangaroos and even a big tiger. I was a dumb fucking kid. Over the course of six months from october 2013 to march 2014 bill raped me 5 times. When I came back to the establishment in 2015 to false promises he raped me again. He convinced me that it was all consensual and he promised me things, but when i didn’t want to do it, he would coerce me harder and harder until I gave in. he drugged me on three separate occasions with opiates to have his way more easily. He insisted on not using protection because he was allergic to latex. It started early on, when I first arrived to work at the zoo, although for him, the planning probably started when he picked up the telephone and heard easy prey on the other line. The funny thing is, when i called him to ask about the job, i was suspicious of his establishment. Something didn’t add up. I called him out on it, said his pitch sounded like bait, he got upset and hung up. I called my mother to tell her about the job prospect and how it sounded weird and together we looked online. This man was famous. He had animals on the today show. His monkeys were in movies and perched on actor’s shoulders. I fucked up. I called him back apologizing. And of course he accepted. The next week I was on a bus down to the zoo and there we were, in the midst of a carnival, training monkeys and riding camels and horses and all was well for a few days. So i thought. The first night i got shitfaced at a party the fair was throwing. Bill noted my attraction to alcohol. The first weekend, Bill saw the flirty attention I was taking to look at a gentleman in the crowd. But Bill also saw the same flirty attention I was giving to a female in the crowd. Bill took note of my sexual confusion. I remember the first night we drove together in the main semi, after the fair was over and we were packed heading to the next location. His tone got more and more sly as we talked through the night, I remember him telling me stories i would one day find out were lies, but at the time, I trusted him and they awed me. I was a sheltered kid and i didn’t know any better. And then i heard him say “ who don’t you give it a little wiggle”. I looked over and he had his fucking cock out. I’m 18, alone in a semi with a guy who’s bigger than me, away from all known family and friends, traveling to god knows where in the middle of the night. The situation has delved into creepy as hell and it’s all my fault, but I do it, because, what the hell, it’s only a cock and i can’t lose this job and be dumped in the middle of the road. I wish I had made him pull over then. I can’t fucking BELIEVE i didn’t realize how BAD that situation was. I had no idea how hard it would traumatize me. Time number one. In november we made our way to savannah georgia, for an annual festival at a racetrack. Bill had a partnership with a hotel there and they paid a contract to stay on the racetrack/golf course for the entire month, bringing our animal activities to the public attending. Of course, with that contract came hotel rooms, and that’s when my hell really started. The first time, Brian brought all of us to the hotel to sleep (didn’t happen very often,because usually we had to stay with the animals and make sure they were ok) and at the last second, pulled a switcheroo and told me I’d be staying with him. Him asking me to give him a back massage ( which, again, far away from my family or friends) ended up with him being naked, and that turned into him coercing me to take my clothes off, because he just wanted to see, and before i know it I’m in the middle of his fucked up fantasy. Another man using you in that way without your permission is probably the worst feeling i can describe, and that time fucking hurt. I can remember how it felt to this second. I thought about leaving that night, but where the hell was i going to go. And then that happened again. And again. He made me send him text messages “telling him what i wanted him to do to me” and i would just make stuff up because i didn’t know what else to say. This was the clincher. I knew the second i’d try to tell someone these messages would come out and nobody would ever believe me. He’d had other interns before me and I’m pretty sure he did this with all of them. The third time he brought a bottle of pills and told me to take one. It was oxycontin and it made things a little bit easier. This whole time he convinced me if i told anyone, my life would be over, he’d out me to my family, he’d tell them all the nasty things we did together. On the fourth time, I finally had the strength to leave. I waited til night,I made it as far as the hotel itself from the racetrack before I realized it was cold and HE realized I was gone. I think he knew I was going to tell the police so he begged me to come back. He bought me a plane ticket home to my parents that night and he told me to take a vacation. I don’t think he was thinking very clearly. I never got on the return flight. I never wanted to see him again. In 2015 I began to miss my animals, badly, and the trauma from the previous events hadn’t fully taken over my life. Like the dumb kid i was, I decided to give Bill another try. I rang him up and he told me everyone out there missed me, and if I came on down, We would talk about how things were better (there were other problems I was having beyond the obvious one with Bill). I made my bed on the couch at his place when i drove down, because someone was in the spare room, and i thought that would be sufficient enough to keep things pg. I was wrong. I hadn’t even been in the house for 5 hours when Bill decided to pull his shit again. I told him I was going to yell out and he still put his hands down my pants. I should have yelled. I left again that night, drove all the way back to my home in california, and i told myself that that was the end of bill. I couldn’t prove he raped me, so i needed to move on with my life.
I can’t move on. This tears at me almost daily. I’ve literally never typed it out before, and I’m sorry that details are so sparse, but actually reading it like this, I can’t believe how fucked up it sounds. Any questions that might clear up an inconsistency I’m happy to answer. I’m not looking for sympathy, but I want to be able to share this with someone, ANYONE before it eats me alive. This man is still my facebook friend and every day I see him with another success i will never have, because of the things he’s done to my body and head. The fact that i let him get away with doing something like this to a young adult makes me want to kill myself."

What's your general day at work like and how's the salary? 
    
I have an opportunity at an internship in a Fortune 20 company in this type of position, and I was considering working on IT &amp; security certificates (Security +, CCNA, then CISSP), as well as self learning Python and other tools, to advance into a more technical role within the company. This is a company I really want to work for.   

I was wondering if this would be a smart move, or if I should aim for a more technical role (IT Security Intern) with a lesser-known company and build on from there. They're implementing AlienVault and I'd have to monitor their SIEM. Surprisingly, the pay is less here.   

For scope, I've already had a helpdesk internship and a sysadmin internship.

7afuac,2,2017-11-02,A nervous undergrad's attempt to not screw up,pengweather,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7afuac/a_nervous_undergrads_attempt_to_not_screw_up/,"Hey guys,

I got a lot of questions I want to ask regarding applications for graduate school, but I kind of don't know where to start. Hopefully I can delineate my thoughts and concerns in an organized manner. 

I'm currently in my fifth and last year as an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I did decent on the GRE and have a solid cGPA of 3.72 and a major GPA of 3.97. For now, I'm still undecided whether I want to do a Ph.D or get my foot into the industry, however I do have interest in continuing my education in graduate school, hence why I'm going for a Master's after talking to a few of my professors. I have completed my statement of purpose and getting ready to do my personal history essay. However, after I got several of my professors to go through my SOP, I think I may have goofed up and want to get your opinions on this matter.

I first tried to read SOPs that people have written and posted on their personal websites, however they were mostly for Ph.D programs, not really meant for Master's. When I read through the SOPs, they were very specific with what they want to research and who to work under. They also have done a plethora of research beforehand and talked about it in the SOP. For me, on the other hand, I've only done about 3 months of undergraduate research in 2016 and currently starting a new project with my professor where we hope to get a conference paper by the end of May. I'm just worried that it is not enough for a Master's. 

Additionally, I had a hard time writing my SOP. Most of the examples I've read had people discuss their interest in STEM since childhood whereas for me, my interest in Electrical Engineering didn't really begin until my 3rd year. Also, I've been exposed to different areas of Electrical Engineering. For my internship last summer and the Hyperloop project I am in for my senior design class, I've mostly focused on implementing SCADA and controls system. The research I'm going to do this semester involves wireless communications, more specifically into using software-defined radios for beamforming. Furthermore, I've been taking classes on passive and active RF technology and currently designing a rat-race hybrid that I hope to get fabricated by the end of November. However, in my SOP, I was really vague about what I want to do for my Master's. Everything I've done that is related to Electrical Engineering project-wise don't tie in together since they cover different things. Plus, I feel like I don't have enough ""credentials"" to say I really want to focus on RF, control systems, etc. I want to go to grad school to give me a better idea of what I want to specifically do but I feel like that will cause my application to go straight into the trash. Everything I've read online is making a bit nervous to be quite honest. 

But enough of my rant, here are the questions I have.

1.) What do admissions look at in applicants pursuing a Master's vs PhD? Will writing about my work experience, my projects, undergraduate research, internship, etc. suffice? 
2.) How ""broad"" can I be for my SOP if I am applying for a  Master's? Will discussing what I've done that is Electrical Engineering-related be too broad? Should I just focus on say Controls and not mention about stuff I've done that is RF-related or Comp-Sci related?
3.) I've been looking at the EE departments of schools such as Berkeley, Stanford, UIUC, CU Boulder, etc. to see what research groups they have. For the Ph.D SOPs that I've read, it seems like they use the last paragraph to talk about which professors they are interested in. Is this necessary if I'm just going for a Master's?
     - If so, I've read through some of the publications that were published and quite frankly, I got lost after the first page but I was curious about it. Is it appropriate to ask specific questions regarding the research they have done?
     - If not, what should I mention? What courses I want to take?

I know this was a long post but I kind of had to let it out. Any honest feedback or criticism is greatly appreciated. You guys have been an incredible help so far.

After my final rotation, I will be able to choose which department I would like to work in. My dilemma is that I don't know if I want to go the executive route (fast paced/high pressure/longer hours/getting higher up faster) or the technically skilled individual contributor (better work life balance/longer projects/get to play with data, which I enjoy). 


The feedback I received was that I would do very well in both environments, and it was really up to me what I wanted in my career. I interviewed with Dept X and Dept Y and so far I can't decide which team I want to join. Dept X is willing to let me use my time to learn new languages like Python and focuses on long term projects. However I don't see this work being super important, and this will likely take me longer up the career ladder. Dept Y is a integral part of the organization and the staff routinely meets with senior management and the CEO, which means more pressure and quick turnaround times but likely to work in my favor during promotions. 

Personally, I am ambitious and would like to see myself in a senior position and living up to my potential but the stress, responsibility and high pressure scare me a lot. However, I feel I can overcome this fear by being immersed in it. At the same time, I enjoy the technical aspects of the work and wouldn't mind satisfying my intellectual curiosity as well. I also enjoy a more laid back environment but I worry that I will be too complacent. It is an extrovert vs. introvert situation and I'm 50/50! 

How did you decide in your careers? "

7ag9p4,1,2017-11-02,Should I attend a Coding Bootcamp or work and Self Teach given my circumstances?,thes8m8,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7ag9p4/should_i_attend_a_coding_bootcamp_or_work_and/,"Hello,


I am wondering if I should attend a coding Bootcamp or self-teach with my circumstances.  I would like your input!


**Background:**


Right now I'm 22 and a sophomore at a community college.  Weighing lots of options regarding college transfer plans, I believe my best option would be to transfer to a good UC school in Fall 2019.  That gives me a solid 2 years before the transfer takes place.  Apparently for the UC transfer plan I might have to be enrolled for 2 semesters before hand (which would give me time to finish my sophomore year in college) as I'm currently not enrolled.  This means I would technically focus on college starting Fall 2018.


That means I have a year of free time before starting college (if I decide to go to college).


I think this is perhaps good that I have a year of time for decision making as I'm very new to programming and want to play with it more before dedicating myself to heavy math courses such as Calculus 1, 2, and 3 etc.


**Situation:**


With a year of free time, I have some decision making to do.  I definitely want to flirt with programming more to make sure I want to take it in college, but I'm not sure how I want to approach this.


My parents want me to do something, whether I am working full time or going to a coding bootcamp.  It doesn't matter what it is and they will support it.  In a perfect world, I would spend all day learning online in my own time as it's much cheaper than bootcamp, but again, my parents require me to be enrolled in a full time job, or full time school (can include bootcamp).


**Options:**


My first option would be to work a full-time minimum wage job, and code when I get home.  I calculated it and would probably have ~4 hours at most a day (if that) to self teach while working 8 hours a day aside of my other daily activities.  I don't need the money as my parents will pay for schooling, it's just a ""need to be doing something"" type of deal.


My other option is to go to a bootcamp ASAP, try and get an internship or a job after, and then continue self study into theory like data structure and algorithms while I am employed which is a stretch as likelihood of hiring is unknown.  This option would have me coding pretty much all day ~8+ hours programming every day rather than working a pointless minimum wage job.  If I don't get an internship or job, then I can always go into college for 2019 and if i do get a job, I can always go into college 2019 as well if I feel it would be important for career growth.


**Question:**


So should I do minimum wage and less time self teaching, or coding bootcamp with a big fee and more time programming.  If I do coding bootcamp, I was thinking of Epicodus in portland as I see it's much cheaper than others but seems just as legit and one of the best.  Portland is like 15 hours away from home so it's a big move... any input of this particular or bootcamps in general?  Would it be crazy to go that far and move just for a bootcamp, are there better ones in california of the same cost?  Also, if I do coding bootcamp and I DO get a job, do you think that the first job will lead to more with ease or should I still start college 2019.

My First and Last Letter: The History of my Depression

Sorry to my friends and family, and whoever ends up reading this.  This is my first and last letter, a story of my depression. I tried to fight it no avail, and it's something it's something that has haunted me for over 10 years. I don't know why but it all started when my grandparents and I moved into my aunts household. While I may have looked like boy in 6th grade that was simply obsessed with playing video games all day instead of eating or communicating much with my family, I was trying to escape the sadness that existed in my mind. Everything was twisted from there, and I was already thinking and researching ways to commit suicide in the most painless and least gruesome way possible. I was confused and clueless as to why I felt so worthless and unloved, when I was surrounded by people that cared for me. There was only teacher in middle school that saw something odd about me and asked if I was alright. That year was the last year that I ever had any good grades in school, and then came a downward spiral of hopelessness. I never had a father figure or anyone that taught me how to be a man, or a strong, independent individual.. But I felt like needed to be, and I never really understood that it was okay to ask for help. I kept everything to myself, and I lied about my grades and report cards. In 7th grade my aunt picked me up from school and asked me how I got cuts on my forearm, I told her that I got scratched from the fence playing tennis. I cut myself. I cut myself because I felt and truly believed that all I ever deserved was pain. 

By the time high school came along I still had no aspirations or any dream careers while all my friends were thinking about college. Instead I was doing drugs to escape my reality. I always told myself that I would kill myself after my grandparents passed away. I eventually wanted to join the Navy and try to discover myself and start my life over, but that was not an option for my family. That was the one thing that I was slightly ever interested in, but instead there was only heavy pressure and emphasis on going to college and getting a good job. How could I do that when I didn't care for it? I kept failing and failing and there was still only pressure to go to college and get a degree like this person or that person. My whole life I've been compared to random successful people and relatives. I barely graduated from highschool. So I didn't join the Navy and went to community college, I failed miserably, and eventually dropped out. I have no blame for any one person, but for the Asian culture and upbringing itself that mental illness doesn't exist and that education is the only way to success and happiness. 

When I reached out to friends and family I was only shot down. ""You can't be sad"". ""You have no reason to be sad"". ""You're too young to be sad"". ""Just get a good job and make money you won't be sad"". I wish that everyone that I've told just accepted that I was sad, and even more that I needed help and support. One of my friends brought me to church and I thought I found hope but I didn't understand why I was still depressed. Church was good and fun for the years that it lasted but it wasn't enough to save me from myself. Then there were people that spoke like they had a magical cure that said ""just don't think about it"" or ""just read the bible and pray"". I never needed anyone to understand my pain or try to fix it, I just wanted someone to be there. I wanted to be happy, but my soul was tired. In college one of my psychology professors noticed that I failed to turn in my final research paper. She gave me a chance to turn it in late for most of the credits and to possibly talk about it after class. I rejected both offers. I want to stress the importance of reaching out and offering proper help  towards those in need. I reached out to her after finding out that she also one of the counselors at the school hoping to talk about my depression. I couldn't get any service because I stopped attending but she led me to a mental health clinic in the area. I was on Zoloft for a while and I had to double my dosage eventually. It was actually alright and I was doing better until I felt comfortable enough to share my suicidal thoughts with my therapist. She took it like I was possibly a danger to myself and made it aware to me that some people might be sent over to evaluate me and that I might be held until I was stable under drugs. I felt betrayed and I was beyond angry and frustrated. How can I get help with the thoughts in my head without speaking about them? I'm sure she was either an intern or just highly inexperienced, as it was a low-cost/free clinic. That was my first experience with a therapist and it left a very bad impression. I never came back and I dropped the medication and sessions. 

Videos games and fishing were good distractions, along with all the other hobbies that I found like thrifting. Those were the only things I was able to enjoy in solitude, other than that I hated being alone. Working helped too, but they were just that. Never a means to a solution. By this time I have also given up all drugs and smoking to no benefit. How can I be so young yet my soul, mind, and body be so tired? I could never put the pieces of my life together. I've been called selfish in the past for having suicidal thoughts, and there's a good chance that whoever reads this will think I was selfish in thought or action. I want you to have an open mind. I fear death just like everyone else, if not more because death knocks on my door every single day. Do you know what it feels like to wake up every day wanting to die? To have thoughts of worthlessness pounded into your existence for years and years coming from your own mind? To not have any energy to do simple things like get out of bed, shower, brush your teeth? During the time of writing this letter I have been struggling with insomnia and lack of appetite as well. These seem like trivial things but there's symptoms of mental illness in many forms, and they were mostly undiscovered because it either wasn't hard to hide or people were not properly informed on how to approach my situation. How can people help if they have no idea what it could look like? How can they reach out without aggravating  or increasing the risk? Days have passed like clockwork and after many years of rejecting suicide as an escape it has sadly come to life. 

I hope whoever reads this understands that I tried to live a normal life despite everything going on in my head. I hope you know that I chose to be vulnerable about my depression even after my trust in people was broken. I hope you realize that I truly believe in my head and heart that I've exhausted all of my options, and that I see no other escape from this but in death. I can't wait any longer for some terrible disease or curse to strike me, or for God to take my life away. I hope that this letter raises awareness of mental illness and the importance of observing the growth, behaviors, and symptoms of the mind, especially in children. I was depressed and I had many reasons to be. In the same vein I had little reason  to be depressed. My thought is that external and also internal factors resulted in depression being a part of my being.

It's a selfish request but I would not like any Christian or Buddhist ceremonies or speeches, for in death or life I am neither. If perhaps there is the chance that I end up in a braid-dead state I request that all life support be cut off immediately. I don't want to live any longer or to end up in the same condition as my grandfather in his last days. My only wish is that if my brain is in good enough condition for it to be donated to science to hopefully further the research and treatment of brain disorders, if not I would like my remains to be cremated and laid to rest. I'm sure that would bring my  soul great peace. It's the one thing I've yearned for my entire life but was not able to grasp. I didn't want to bring anyone pain, especially my family and close friends, but I could not bear this any longer. I chose not to go back to drugs or anything because it is only a vicious cycle with no end, and I don't want anyone to think that drugs or any addictions were the cause of my suicide. It was depression and depression alone. I'm sorry  for whoever finds my body in the state that it may be in, as I would opt to simply disappear if I could than to share any part of the pain and hurt I have suffered. I thought that I could just hold everything in and hope that things would sort itself out eventually. I reached out for help the best that I could. I can't bear the pressures of life any longer. I'm sorry I was  not the greatest grandchild or nephew. My shame I seal to the grave, but I hope that I was able to paint a clearer picture of the chaos, bitterness, and sadness that was my life. If I could sum my life up in one sentence it would be this:

I never wanted to die, yet I've always wanted to die.

Assuming the only factors I'm taking into account are my ability to get a full time job from a company I want down the line, and an opportunity to greatly increase my programming knowlege, I am wondering which would be better.

The big bank seems like it would pop out on my resume to recruiters, but I'm not convinced I would get a lot of hands-on work. Meanwhile the smaller company is actually a tech firm and would likely give me lots of opportunities to learn a lot, but many recruiters may glance over it on my resume because it has a relatively dull name and is virtually unknown.

Sometimes when I'm under pressure I don't perform the best in timed settings, and I tend to use my time to learn other outside skills, work on projects, apply to internships, clubs, work study job, parties/hang out, occasional Netflix, etc. so I don't spend much time studying compared to my peers.

If it matters, I go to USC and I'm majoring in computer science and business administration. It's my freshman year so I'm hoping I adjust better next semester, but my classes are supposedly going to be much, much harder with a much larger workload (guess I didn't do a good job planning my schedule based on expected workload from classes). I expect to get around a 3.3 this semester, but I'm wondering if I should really drop some of the outside things I'm doing and just focus on my classes.

Ideally, I'd like to learn more applicable things (which I feel like I'm doing by working on projects, joining CS project-based clubs, web dev-ish job, etc.) and I just don't see a huge benefit from some of my other classes. Obviously I don't want to fail and any learning is beneficial, but I've always had the mindset that I only have 24 hours a day so there's only so much I can do and it's up to me to choose where to spend it.

It might be important to note that I didn't come into college with much coding experience so I can't breeze through those classes. Basically, am I doing the right thing by being so involved on campus and doing career stuff or should I really just be heavily focusing on my classes right now? In the end, if I don't have a great GPA, but it doesn't disadvantage me in any way, then I don't really care. Just don't want to limit my opportunities because of it."

I don't know if it is right subreddit to ask this question or not . If it is not, i am sorry for advance. 

I am one of undergrad students in Turkey. This year is my freshman year and I am a bit worried about the amount of people who study cs in worldwide. 

I have chosen cs faculty due to neither money nor good career  , I really like cs and I have been interested in programming and computer hardware since my childhood. Also, I have already known python and Linear Programming. I have done a summer internship.
However, I took introduction to programming course last week and all of industrial engineering freshman students were taking this course and this situation caused a bit anxiety on me because of the fact that most of people learn programming and i thought we(people who have cs degree)  won't have supremacy  as programming won't be rare skill in worldwide. I know that cs is not only about programming, but also solving problems,algorithms etc.  Therefore, I am not sure that if cs will provide good career opportunities or not ? There are bunch of people who are more experienced than me, they might answer my question . 

Thanks for advance , have a nice day"

7allyv,1,2017-11-03,Should I code in Java?,csmie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7allyv/should_i_code_in_java/,"Despite having experience and a portfolio of projects in many languages, I've been using Python to study and code in internship interviews, but I've seen job descriptions or HackerRank that seem to look down on the language. At times, in interviews, I get a sense that people think I'm less of a programmer because I choose Python.

IMO, any language should be respected. Computer science is not about a specific language, and the best software engineers should be able to learn and adapt quickly given that a job demands switching a language.

I am tempted to switch to Java for interviews since some companies tend to be snobs about this language and cannot be convinced that you can switch gear on the job to code in Java if you code in Python, and the ones that aren't snobs about it, don't care anyways. That said, I don't like Java. But, a lot of local jobs demand Java knowledge (even if the actual job does not require it or would require a variety of languages :D). If given the choice besides Python, I would go with C++ since I use it for personal projects, but again, not many jobs that I'd go for require C++.

Please advise."

I'm currently a mechanical engineering student in my junior year of my degree. I want to create an updated resume for myself because I plan on applying for co-op internships in the summer and I also want to apply for a promotion at my part time job for next semester. That being said, I'm trying to decide what would be best to include on my resume and I'm having trouble deciding if I want to include some work experience I've had with my dad.

Basically my dad is an HVAC technician and all-around handyman with a good number of certifications. So usually a few times every year a family friend or someone of the like will pay my dad to do a private job for them and my dad will pay me to help him for the day. These jobs have included a variety of things including installing and replacing outside air conditioning units, boilers, water heaters, gas pipe for an outside grill, and really anything you'd see in an average basement. Keep in mind that all of this work is under the table, so it's not like I'm doing official work for my dad's business (He doesn't own one).

I think that this might be valuable to include on my resume as a MechE student because almost all of it is hands-on HVAC work, which is definitely a prospective career field for me. So I have to ask, would it be worth including? And if so maybe how would I word this on a resume without making an employer read it and think ""Aww, daddy's little helper."" Would it be wise to list it as working for my father's business even though that's a slight stretch of the truth?

Any opinions are much appreciated! Thanks for your help "

I'm having a lot of trouble deciding which internship to accept, so do you guys have any thoughts? Here are the offer and company details:


**Location:** Bloomberg in NYC, Salesforce in SF. NYC seems really exciting but im currently around SF for school, so I'm more familiar with the area.

**Compensation:** About the same for each.

**Housing:** Bloomberg has dorm-style intern housing in NYC, Salesforce has luxury intern housing in SF. Both are about 10-15 min from the office.

**Type of Work:** Bloomberg has interns to fill out a form to match them with projects they are interested in. Salesforce will have me working in their Infrastructure division, probably in database management.

**Full-time Conversion:** Both companies issue return offers to interns after the summer is over, if the intern performed well. But Salesforce almost exclusively hires full-time employees from its intern pool, so its conversion rate is pretty high.

**Company Growth:** Salesforce is rapidly growing and changing right now. Not really familiar with Bloomberg's trend.


I'm really lucky to be in this position but I'm pretty conflicted over what to choose. I'll be definitely trying to get a return offer in either case. Which company do you think would open the most doors / has the better work environment, growth, and culture?

The premise is basically humanity' first embassy to another species, presenting a tenuously-agreed-upon united human front despite Earth's remaining borders and divisions. It's going to be a story about interesting ideas, strange new alien beings, interpersonal conflict, moral thought, romance, action, adventure, and all the rest, but most importantly, it's going to be a story about *people*. What follows is sort of a prologue chapter, introducing several characters in a series of lighthearted snapshots. I know this isn't the usual type of story posted here, but I'm hoping it can kick off into something much bigger and better. Enjoy! And feel free to leave any feedback!

_______________________________________

**Chief of Science, Dr. Ian Green**

“Daddy, will there be any other kids at the Embassy?” 

Dr. Ian Green turned to face his daughter. Only nine years old, Jessica had already begun to look strikingly like her mother. Dr. Green sighed internally before forcing a smile he hoped appeared genuine.

“Yes, Jessica, there will be a lot of people working there. I know for a fact Dr. Paulsen has two kids, and I guarantee you there will be others. Certainly enough that they’re sending over some teachers for a school, at least.”

Jessica tried to smile back, equally forced. Dr. Green knelt down to face his daughter, holding her hand.

“Listen, Jessie, I understand how hard this is. It’s hard for me too, I’m leaving almost everyone behind. But this is important stuff, and you’ll get to be a part of it!” He smiled again, more real this time. “You’ll be growing up surrounded by some of the smartest people humanity has to offer, learning from all of it, and one day you could be involved in the Embassy too! Think about that! You could be the reason we have great relations with the Vettars, great scientific research… Of course, you don’t have to, you could obviously leave when you’re older, but I think it’ll be a great environment for you.”

Jessica looked back at him, tears welling in her bright eyes. She set her jaw and blinked, wiping the tears away. “Okay, daddy. Let’s go to the Embassy,” she said, in a tone so firm it could only belong to a nine-year-old. Dr. Green laughed in spite of himself.

“Yes, ma’am. Lead the way!”

**Designated Ambassador, Emily Shemyakina**

“Ms. Shemyakina, I have all your bags packed and waiting in the car. They want to leave for JFK soon; the whole team is meeting at Cape Canaveral to depart tomorrow morning.”

“Thank you, Johnson. Remind me again why I can’t bring you with me?”

“The Committee wouldn’t allow anyone with a criminal record, Ms. Shemyakina,” her assistant said ruefully.

“It’s a stupid rule. You’ll fly with me to Florida, I’ll insist on you coming. I know how much you’ve always wanted to see the stars.”

Johnson smiled, but his eyes did not. “Thank you, Ms., but I don’t want to cause you any trouble…”

“Nonsense. You’re coming with me. Those UN suits can all suck a fat—”

“Aren’t you a suit, Ms. Shemyakina?” Johnson asked, eyes glinting with amusement. Emily pretended to swat him away.

“Well, I mean, technically, but I’m not the same as them… am I?” she asked, false pleading in her voice.

“No ma’am!” Johnson laughed. “I can’t imagine any of them even being brave enough to get into the ship, to tell you the truth.”

“Exactly! Now go get me my sleeping pills—I’m horribly afraid of airplanes, you see.”

An hour later, Emily stepped into the car, deep in conversation on her phone.

“Yes, of course, Mr. President. But don’t think for a second that I’ll put the country above humanity—the UN Committee outline a very hard agreement, and unlike you I respect that organization… Yes, I understand… No, I will not allow that. I have a perfectly capable assistant already, bringing in a covert CIA operative is the actual last thing I want… I’m sorry, sir, but we’re representing humanity up there, not the United States. And believe me, that’s far more important.”

The shocked face of her assistant greeted her when she hung up, his mouth almost comically agape.
	
“You didn’t just…”

“Yep!” Emily said brightly.

“That wasn’t…”

Emily simply nodded.

“But he…”

“He did. But a girl can’t let herself get bossed around all the time, Johnson! Besides, wouldn’t you be more shocked if I’d actually agreed to go back on all my principles and secretly serve one nation at the Embassy?”

Johnson slowly nodded, gears turning behind his eyes, mouth closing slow like a drawbridge. Emily laughed.

“What are you staring for? If this Embassy goes how I want, defying the US President will be nothing but a footnote! Pay attention, Johnson—you might get interviewed about me some day.”

**Defense Coordinator, General Lucas Moore**

“Look sharp, all of you! This is the biggest assignment any human has ever faced. I’m not gonna lie to you, I don’t know what kinds of things we’ll be facing up there, but we need to be prepared! Each and every one of you volunteered for this, and you were all hand-picked, the best of the best, so I know you’re all up to the task. Are you ready to defend the Embassy?”

“YES SIR!” came the resounding shout of twenty-four elite soldiers.

“Very good! Remember, the Vettars are not our enemies—yet. Don’t be hostile, but always, ALWAYS be on the lookout. Is that clear?”

“YES SIR!”

“Alright, soldiers! Dismissed!”

General Lucas Moore stepped down from the makeshift podium, haphazardly constructed near the Cape Canaveral launch site. He paused to wipe a bead of sweat from his brow before surveying the team milling about before him. Twenty-four men and women, all elite troops, with minds for strategy and officer credentials to boot. With him in charge, twenty-five. That was all that stood between humanity’s first real outpost, an embassy to a new world full of strange alien beings. He wiped away another bead of sweat. 

“Commander Ryker?”

“Yes, sir?” Ryker responded, turning from his conversation and approaching the general.

“I have a question of a… sensitive nature, that I’d like your professional opinion on.”

“Anything, sir.”

“Do you think this is enough?”

**Barack Moore, son of Gen. Lucas Moore**

Barack stood apart from the group, watching. A total of sixty-three future Embassy residents, leaving home simply because of their parents’ work, stood underneath a vast canopy, meeting those with which they would spend the next several years. Most were younger, but Barack identified a group of twenty-one near his own age, slowly splitting from the rest as they noticed each other. It was around them he moved, taking the group in as he walked; all dressed in varying styles, showing the diverse collection of people brought together. It seemed as though no two people were truly alike. He surprised himself by noticing at all, but save for him, none of the teenagers were black, something that interested him slightly as he contemplated from where all of these different people had come. Still, he did not move towards them, instead observing from eleven paces away. One foot, then the next. Always equal.

“Oh guys, look, another kid who’s out of diapers!” a girl called, to the laughter of those around her. “Get over here! My name’s Ashley, what’s yours?” Barack, discovered, grinned and waved back at her, stepping around two running toddlers to arrive before the group.

“Hi guys, I’m Barack,” he said.

“Oh, like that one President!” Ashley said, her blue eyes flashing with her smile.

“Yeah, I guess like him,” Barack said, laughing nervously. Quickly, he changed the subject, anxious to make a good first impression.

“So what brings all of you guys here?”

“Um, our parents, duh,” the same girl laughed, the others joining in soon after. It seemed that Ashley had established herself as a leader of sorts; it made sense. She seemed very friendly, with a warm smile, as well as her beautiful flowing blonde hair, and large breasts…

“Hey! Creep! What’re you looking at?” she asked, still slightly laughing. Flustered, Barack took a step back with his left foot, then matched it with his right. He realized that, in his surprise, he had taken a larger step with the left, and compensated with a smaller left-step and a larger right-step.

“What’s he doing?” another person asked, the first voice other than Ashley’s he had heard. He stopped and tried to let his hands hang naturally.

“Sorry, I don’t know, I’m a little spacey from the flight in, you know?”

Ashley grinned mischievously. “Well we’re all gonna be a little spacey soon, aren’t we?” Groans echoed through the group, drowning the few who had actually laughed. Barack wiped sweat from his hands, grateful to escape scrutiny for now. But still he worried; it was only a matter of time.

**Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Vivian Chen**

“No, Dr. Warren, it’s fine, I’ve already done three checks, nobody has anything contagious or infectious at all… Not even a cold... Yes, of course I checked the ship’s crew! They’re going too… Yeah, I know, this is why we had everyone living in quarantine for a month!... Yes, okay, all except the Ambassador, but I’ll check her when she gets here. Everyone else is fine.”

Dr. Chen hung up, hands shaking with annoyance. If Dr. Warren had perhaps only called three times, or perhaps at least sounded as if he trusted her judgment… but no, of course he wouldn’t. A seventy-year-old man who consistently made jokes about Asian women driving? Driver-operated cars hadn’t even been around for decades! She sighed. Soon, she would be beyond his reach, symbolically at the very least.

She turned and immediately bumped into one of her hurried-looking interns, spilling the papers he had been carrying. Apologizing, she began to collect the forms from the floor, only to realize exactly which intern had just overheard her conversation: Jason Warren, grandson and heir apparent to the one and only Dr. Warren. Her boss. The all-too familiar tightness in her temples only grew stronger at this sudden remembrance. 

“I’m sorry, Jason, here are all the papers you were carrying,” she said, quickly stuffing them back into his hands. Jason opened his mouth to respond, then suddenly coughed. His face reddened as he hurried away.

“Wait! Jason!”

Dr. Chen breathed an exasperated breath. A coughing medical intern was exactly the last thing she needed right now. But, for the moment, that would have to wait; an alert on her phone told her that the Ambassador’s motorcade had just arrived. She pulled a notepad from under her coat and quickly wrote down several more tasks, muttering to herself incomprehensibly.

**Pilot &amp; Director of Exploration, Carlos Goldberg**

“Hey Carlos, check it out, they’re all set!”

Carlos glanced in the direction to which his co-pilot was pointing; “READY FOR TAKEOFF” in large green letters flashed across the screen. Carlos grinned, stretching his fingers. Looking around the front of the cockpit, he took in every detail, every instrument, and could not help but whistle in appreciation. His crew raced back and forth behind him, making final preparations for the launch.

“Well, guys, how are we feeling?” he asked the room, grinning wide, like a child receiving a toy. His crew smiled back at him, checking their stations one final time before all strapping themselves in to their various positions. Carlos’ eyes darted over a photo of a young woman before hurriedly coming to rest on the screen before him. He flexed his fingers again.

“Jenkins, turn on the PA, will you?”

“A reminder that none of the crew is named Jenkins, sir,” said his co-pilot, her eyes shining with amusement.

“You know I know that, just let me have this! Turn on the damn PA, buzzkill,” Carlos said, laughing jovially. His co-pilot flicked two switches and the PA system crackled to life—the crackle, of course, was more than unnecessary, but Carlos had insisted it be added digitally.

“Good morning everyone! This is your captain speaking. My name is Carlos Goldberg, and I know what you’re thinking and the answer is yes! That is a real name. Diversity and stuff. Anyway, I’ve heard it’s customary for a pilot to give a little inspirational speech before a launch, but I spent last night watching old movies, so forgive me for having nothing written. I will say this: all of us, and I mean every single human being aboard this hunk of metal, are about to embark on something historic. Something monumental. Let’s not be petty, let’s not be silly; humanity has a chance to put its best foot forward here, and that foot is us. We would all do well to remember the importance of everything we do at the Embassy. And we may not know what’s in store for us yet, but we do know that we can meet it with open minds, open hearts, and the best of the best that humanity has to offer. So everyone strap up and enjoy the ride, because we’re going to space, baby!”

7aov2j,1,2017-11-04,Potential spring sophomore transfer,fuckinglemoncakes,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/7aov2j/potential_spring_sophomore_transfer/,"So I recently got all of my decisions back from everywhere I applied. I got into UCF, a couple other FL schools and my out of state pick UCONN. UCF and UCONN are my top picks. Clearly they both are completely different. I’m a Floridian (Miami specifically) and my brother is currently at UCF along with a handful of people I went to high school with so it’s a pretty safe pick, I can drive home whenever, I know people in the area, etc. I kind of don’t know much about UCF itself though, my brother (senior mech eng major) is a total whiner and I feel like he exaggerates things and makes everything sound awful so I want other people’s opinions. I’m a bit reserved and kind of a home-body but at the same time I’m really open to talking to people first or being approached. I’m not into the party scene, it LOOKS fun but it’s not who I am at all, I probably wouldn’t enjoy it even if I wanted to. So, what’s there to do if you aren’t a huge party person? Is the average person friendly? How hard is it to make friends, etc. and if anyone knows, are there any opportunities for geology majors when it comes to internships, etc. I’m just torn because I’ve only ever been at my CC, I’m not positive what I want in a university. I’ve always dreamed of going out of state, UConn has a nice campus, they have SEASONS, it’s a fresh start and I simply like the program I got into (geoscience) but UCF is home, I feel comfortable in Florida and I know it’s a good school..ahhh so stressed because I don’t want to make the wrong choice. I’m sure most of you either have no idea about UConn or know little about it (or maybe not) but I’ll ask anyway..if you were me, UCF or UCONN (or an out of state school you’d like)? "

Sorry it’s taken me so long to post the next part, and I’m sorry it’s shorter.  It’s not always easy to find time to do things for myself anymore.  Keeping this façade up is draining on its own and trying to find a way to fight back is even more daunting.  The hours I have to work are minimal.  Even telling you guys this story could be considered a waste of my most valuable resource: time.  I need to do this though, for the sake of my sanity.  I need a way to reach out to people again.  I thought it would be like when I was a teenager, just coping by throwing myself into my studies, but things are different now.  I miss Jonny and Franky, hell I even miss Alexis (cold-hearted bitch), but most of all I miss Jill.  I want to reach out to her so badly, I want her to know that I didn’t choose to walk away.  Things were different, I was ready to make the sacrifices needed.  I still have the ring that she never got to see.


That’s not why you’re here though.  You’re here because you decided you needed to know the truth of what’s out there.  You’re here to learn of what I’ve been going through and how I’ve managed to stay alive. You’re here because maybe, and I pray I’m wrong, maybe it’s spread to your town and you need to know how to blend in. I promise, it’s possible, but it’s far from easy.  If anyone out there is experiencing what I’m experiencing, don’t hesitate to reach out.  I’m willing to help you, but only if you’re willing to help me. It’s probably safer if you just run though, go into hiding somewhere far away and hope it will all blow over for the best.


Jill, if you’re reading this…I’m sorry.  I am so sorry I couldn’t tell you what was going on sooner.  I know you know where to find me, but please…please…don’t come to me.  I need you to stay as far away as possible.  I need to believe that there’s still hope for you to be safe; to not be involved in any of this beyond what you saw happening with Franky that day.  It’s not safe here and I don’t know if it ever will be again.

---


I spent the next couple days packing for my trip back home.  Jill didn’t leave my side during this part of the ordeal, she made sure I knew she was there for me.  I didn’t pack too much in terms of clothes, just enough for about two weeks (I would make due by mixing and matching after that.).  The bulk of my luggage was for my research.  I was going to be helping my mom, but I needed to keep working, it was one of the main reasons I was able to get approval for an extended leave of absence while maintaining my internship.


I woke up bright and early in the morning on the day of trip.  It was going to be a pretty long drive, nearly 10 hours if I didn’t make any stops. I had just finished getting the last of my luggage into the back of my Jeep Wrangler when I heard a throat being cleared from behind, begging for my attention.  I leaned back out of the vehicle and turned around, locking eyes with Jill.


“I hope you don’t think I’m letting you get away from me again so easily.” A sly smile graced that elegant face of hers. I could hear the exhaustion in her voice; she was trying so hard to mask it. It caught me off guard but I couldn’t help but smile.  The way her golden brown hair locks fell to the sides of her face from amidst a messy top-bun, it was the single greatest sight to see so early in the morning.  I noticed she had a duffel bag slung from the shoulder where her purse usually was and a mid-size trolley set in front of her.


“Look, it’s not like that and you know—“ I had barely begun to speak before she cut me off, “Shotgun!” I let out a sigh of defeat and placed her luggage in the back. The trip may have been guaranteed to be longer, but the extra time on the road was worth it.  Jill’s presence was soothing. I was expecting to drive to be filled with mounting dread, the weight of which would grow heavier and more burdensome with each passing mile. It didn’t matter that I was taking an unexpected detour in life, it didn’t matter that these next few weeks (maybe months) would be difficult as I helped my mom to adapt to living with whatever medication they would place her on, it didn’t matter that I was once again going to be surrounded by memories of my dead sister.  Nothing of that nature mattered because, for the first time in life, I wouldn’t feel so alone while I dealt with it.


After a couple hours of driving, Jill told me I needed to pull over.  I suspected she needed to use a restroom or maybe just wanted to stretch her legs, so I pulled in to the next rest stop we came across.  It was quite the surprise when she told me to switch her places so she could drive.  I tried to argue, but she insisted, and I could never say no when she got persuasive.  My interest was really peaked when she said I would need to put a blindfold on for a while, she had a surprise planned for me. I laughed a bit as I put it on.  I’m not sure how long I lasted with the blindfold before I landed in my nap, nor was I sure how long I had been out for when the Jeep stopped rather abruptly, stirring me from my slumber.


“We’re here!” Jill cried out with glee, pulling the blindfold from my eyes. My eyelids cringed away from the high sun, it must have been around noon.  I wasn’t able to look around, my eyes didn’t have time to adjust before my passenger side door was pulled open and a dark figure loomed over me.  For a moment, I was terrified, still in the tail-end of my groggy state.  The next moment I had a pair of arms wrapped around me, still buckled up, in a hug I instantly recognized.


“Dad?  What? How?” the words were stumbling from my mouth as my terror was replaced with complete confusion. 


“Surprise,” Jill exclaimed, “I looked your dad up on Facebook after you fainted the other day, hoping he might have some insight.  He didn’t, but he was very interested in getting to know the girlfriend you never introduced to him.” She nudged me in the ribs, teasing with a false sense of insinuation in her tone. I rolled my eyes a bit at this, but she was right.  There wasn’t any reason for it though, I just hadn’t seen my dad since before we started dating the first time.


“That’s half of it,” my dad chimed in, “the other half is that after you got the call about your mother, Jill decided to let me know what was going on.  We talked a bit more and decided that she would be going with you and that you two would stop in here for the day.  I’ve missed you, champ.” My dad’s voice wasn’t as heavy as I remembered.  We talked a lot still but it was mostly online, due to our differing schedules.


“Well thank you so much for planning all of this without me and effectively kidnapping me with my own vehicle.” I teased, planting a kiss on Jill’s lips before she could respond.  I didn’t want to give her wit the chance to strike me down, not in front of my old man at least. It worked, for the moment; I knew I wouldn’t be able to disarm her so easily every time my father was around.

July 13, 2015


It was the day after my mother was released from the Psychiatric Ward.  Things were worse than I expected.  The past two weeks had been great, showing Jill around my hometown, and then my dad coming up a couple of days after we arrived.  It was really nice to be spending time at home like this again, I didn’t think my father would ever step foot in that house again.  Dad even pulled me aside at one point, telling me how I had ‘struck gold’ with Jill, even giving me a serious conversation about how I should consider tying the knot.  I had no idea how much that conversation would influence me. He suggested maybe having my mom move out of state, like he had, maybe bring her to Illinois with me so I would be close by again. He didn’t want to talk much about his incidents with seeing the dead, but he said it hadn’t happened again after he moved.  Now she was a wonderful and sad memory, not one that haunted him in his waking life though. That idea was completely scrapped the day mom came home though.


She was…unresponsive.  Doctor’s said the medicine was pretty strong and sometimes it would take time for her to system to regulate it, allowing her to be communicative again. Jill was pretty upset by this, she had been looking forward to meeting my mother, especially after she and the old man had hit it off so well.  I think she had a mental sigh of relief when she was called back home, although whoever called wouldn’t say why, they insisted that it was important. (It later turned out that her parents had been in a pretty bad car accident on their date night. They both survived, though her father ended up in a wheelchair.). My dad offered to drive her home, I don’t think he was able to handle seeing my mother in that state either.  To say he was heartbroken, judging by the look on his face, would be putting it mildly.


Things had ended up just as I feared they were going to be before Jill’s intervention.  I was alone, taking care of my mom, nobody to distract me.  Maybe this was a good thing though, after all, I hadn’t kept up with my end of the agreement for my leave my absence.  I hadn’t worked on my research at all, not even a single iota of thought.  I was going to change that today. If mom’s catatonic state the day prior was any indication for how the foreseeable future would play out, then I wouldn’t have any trouble doing my work, especially since I wasn’t the only one taking care of her…


The doorbell rang, as I expected it would, sometime around nine in the morning.  I had already cooked breakfast, hoping she would at least be able to eat a decent breakfast before her medication. When I got to the door though, I was shocked by who I saw: Franky. I nearly choked on my bite of sausage.  What the hell was Franky doing here? Did he come to see me? How did he even know I was here? How did he know where I lived? That’s when I noticed he was wearing the uniform of a Visiting Nurse.  Franky wasn’t a nurse. What the hell is going on?


“I’m here to see Patient 2-9-3.” Franky droned, his voice completely monotone. He was looking right at me, but his face had no expression, it was like he was looking right through me. I was in a conscious stupor and Frank pushed right past me, heading to my mother’s bedroom.  Had he been given a tour of the house without my knowledge, how did he know where he was going? I shook myself out of it and decided to follow him, seeing if maybe this was some type of elaborate prank by Jill.  I was several steps behind him and when I entered my mother’s room, he was already kneeling down next to her bed.  There was a voice-recorder on the nightstand next to it, a light indicated that it had been switched on, and he was filling a syringe from a brown bottle. Frank looked at his watch, placing the needle against my mother’s arm.


“9:07 A.M., patient is asleep. Administration of medication to Patient 2-9-3 commencing.” Frank’s monotone voice came, clearly speaking for the sake of the voice recorder.  He pressed the needle into her vein and applied pressure to plunger, sending whatever the medication was directly into her veins. My mom’s eyes opened within seconds of the needle being removed, she was wearing the same blank expression as the day before.  The same blank expression as Frank. Something wasn’t right here, what was that medicine?


“9:07 A.M. Administration complete, patient is awake. Will entrust care to the male offspring of subject.” Frank’s words rang out in the ears, they were sending up red-flag after red-flag, but this was Franky, one of my best friends. This definitely had to be some sort of joke that my mom was in on.  I decided to play along, I wanted to see how far they would take it.


“Hey Franky, what exactly is that medicine?” Franky didn’t respond. 

“Hello? Franky, are you listening to me?” I continued, trying to get him to acknowledge me as he placed the voice-recorder into his pocket and packed the rest of his supplies away. I reached out and placed my hand on his shoulder, his head rapidly turning in my direction, staring at me with intent as I spoke, “Uh, Franky, you alright man?” 

“I’m sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.  I am Dr. Francis.” That monotone droning again, this was starting to piss me off. 

“Yeah, no fucking shit. You hate being called Francis though.” I argued, hoping to call him out on the bullshit.  He simply stared at me, blankly.  

“No, I am Dr. Francis and I must be leaving now. Goodbye.” One final statement and walked out of the room and out of the house. Man, they were dedicated to this ruse.  I simply let out a sigh and helped my mom to the kitchen table.  She might not have been able to enjoy the breakfast before being put in this state again, but I could at least feed her.  I may have suspected that it was a prank, but I still had to feed her. Just in case. At least, that’s what I told myself.


Hours passed, and I had her sitting in front of the television.  I don’t remember what I had her watching.  Hell, it could have been static and it wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference. I was just getting finished setting up for my experiment. It was a multi-phase experiment, but I wouldn’t get passed Phase 1.  I turned the device on and it began to emit high frequency EM-waves.  I wouldn’t be able to gather any data that night; the moment I flipped the switch, my mom began to scream from her place in the living room.  I jumped to my feet, rushing to get there.  I nearly took myself out, tripping on the power cable and ripping it out of the wall on my way.  The screaming stopped before I got there, but she had contorted into something similar to a fetal position. I shook her shoulders, trying to get her to respond, to see if she was okay.  It was no to avail though, she seemed to have returned to that same catatonic state.


This wasn’t a joke, there was no prank going on. I grabbed the house phone (I had programmed the Psych Ward into the speed dial) since my phone was in a different room.  I wasn’t sure what was going on, but I figured it must have been some type of adverse effect to her medication. I explained that I didn’t know what happened but that she seemed to have some type of painful reaction based off the position I found her in and the screaming I heard, they agreed to send someone out immediately. I was on my knees, holding my mom’s hands in mine as I waited for them to arrive. It was about 20 minutes before I heard the doorbell.  I wiped the tears from my eyes and went to greet them, expecting it to be Franky again.  I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to a woman this time.


“Thank you so much for coming out though.  What happened to the guy from this morning though? You know, Franky- I mean, Dr. Francis.” I inquired.  He may have been behaving strangely, especially by somehow having a medical job (Come on, he’s the fucking bug guy!) but Franky was still one of my best friends and it was nice to see him.  She blinked at me, unresponsive at first.  That’s when I noticed her face.  That same blank expression, but it got worse… Her mouth opened up and out droned that fucking monotone voice, “You are mistaken. I was here this morning. I am Dr. Francis.”"

My parents, however, are openly disappointed in the fact that I am not pursuing medicine. They send me articles about wage caps and  job security and predict I will have to live at home (ect., ect.). They are also extremely off put by the idea of my working right after under-grad (say it is essentially like a HS degree).

I don't have much of a rebuttal, because I don't know many working ECE's (outside professors). What has been your experience? What do you think of working right after undergrad? How are things going for you - ever regret not picking a different path?

I hope this is the right subreddit - first time posting.

7ara34,290,2017-11-04,TIFU by ruining both an entire expensive getaway trip and possibly my professor's career.,ennealioo,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7ara34/tifu_by_ruining_both_an_entire_expensive_getaway/,"This happened back in college around 2006.


Just so folks know, I'm as laid back of a Midwesterner you can imagine. Nothing gives me stress. Stress doesn't induce panic. However, on this particular night, in an intimate crowd of 300 in Paris, I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.


To the TIFU: So I was invited to join a university professor as a photography intern to both Puerto Rico and Paris. We would be spending a few weeks in each location. We were essentially hired to shoot and deliver a final evening video presentation at each trip. A recap, if you will. Now, keep in mind, this was for C-level management of a major vehicle brand — as well as multi-car dealership owners from around the country (USA). We're talking millions in costs for the brand and hundreds of guests who were accustomed to top-notch service. 


Now, my role was to head out on daily excursions and take photographs of the guests. Think of places like the Louvre to underwater snorkeling in the ocean. Easy-peasy as I buttered up the guests with charm and delivered some cool photographs in the end. However, the main reason I was sent was to create a computer slide-show that would Hollywood Blockbuster the guests. Puerto Rico was trip one, presentation went without a hitch, and the guests were dazzled.


Fast forward to the moment I'll never live down. On the final night in a 10 day trip to Paris, I was putting together the slide-show on a small laptop with hundreds of photos throughout the week. What I forgot to do was resize the images as they'll be projected up to a massive screen. Instead, hundreds of photographs were getting loaded into a program, on a slow running laptop, into said presentation program at full resolution. This, just hours before go time.


What ensued was to be expected. At first, the computer started up with the obligatory wheel of death. Eventually, it reached its limit and just crashed. For two hours it wouldn't even start up. On top of that, moments before the wheel of death, the video file (think stop-motion animation) of the CEO at the Ritz Hotel Chef School was now coming up corrupt. ABC'ya later, all that work out the window. 


Dear God, dear dear God, we're in full panic mode.


Thinking on his feet, my professor basically said ""ennnealioo, screw it, let's just play the images from start to finish right from the computer folder. Screw the program."" as we finally got the computer started in the ballroom where the event was being held.


The evening was all set. 100+ guests were seated. Meal was served. The master of ceremony made a huge introduction for our photo presentation before a b-list music group was to get on stage. I hit play, hoping some miracle would allow for the images to run straight through so people could at least see their trip recap. Not today. That's now how this one goes. A moment later, I realized that I'd clicked the photo option to ""shuffle"" as I clicked play. That means 4 of the same image were getting shuffled back and forth to summarize over a week of incredible travel for hundreds of guests. Cue laughing. Hundreds were now laughing hysterically. And, to top it off, my professor was pacing behind me saying ""well, my career is over... this is it... I'll never be hired again""

The nightmares continue to this day. 

TL;DR Traveled as a college photo intern to help a major company's destination event. Night of major event in Paris, my computer crashed. So hundreds of guests sat and watched the same 4 images summarize their entire 10-day trip to Paris. Professor told me it was career suicide."

**The Situation:** Marty's parents offered me a free place to stay while I worked on getting my second degree, but I graciously turned them down and moved in with my sister instead. 

As it turns out, I am really unhappy here. I don't have any friends, I hate my job, and I am struggling to balance work and classes. I'm barely able to support myself, living paycheck to paycheck. Marty is going to be moving back home in a couple months after graduating while he looks for a job. I went to visit him recently, and told him how unhappy I have been. After hearing all of this, he suggested I take his parents up on their offer after my current lease is up.

I have been living on my own (or with roommates) and paying all of own bills since I moved out of my mom’s house five years ago. The idea of living with Marty’s parents seems almost like a step backwards for me, and I don’t want to lose any of my independence. When I told Marty this, he made the point that it is common for recent grads to move home for a short time while doing unpaid internships (likely scenario for me) or searching for a job. He also said I might not even end up living with him/his parents that long depending on how long it takes him to secure a job, and that we could move out together when the time came. I expressed concern that I would still be in school and working part time, but he said he would be happy to pay for the majority of rent/bills and support me while I’m still in school. Marty has always been very reassuring and supportive of me in everything I do, and I am so grateful to have him.

Marty’s parents live near Big City, where there would be many more job opportunities for me. I would also be able to actually start saving up money for a while, which would be nice and put me ahead of the game. Both degrees I have wouldn’t necessarily require me to do an internship, but the industries are easier to break into with one, and I definitely can’t do an internship (most are unpaid in these fields) unless I move in with them. Since I’m still not sure what I’m doing, it would be nice to have that as an option. I feel like moving there in general just opens more doors and gives me more opportunities. The fact that I would be living with Marty is just a bonus (a very nice bonus). Overall, I think it would be a more productive environment for me, and I would be surrounded by a good support system. 

The answer seems obvious to me at first, BUT then there is the flip side. Moving to Big City means I would have to finish most of my classes online, which isn’t a deal-breaker, but also certainty isn’t ideal. And yeah, Marty and I have a wonderful relationship that I see lasting many years down the road, but isn’t that how most people in relationships feel? Realistically, there is a possibility that we could break up, and I can’t bring myself to rule that out no matter how happy I am with him. Whether that is me being insecure or appropriately cautious I don’t know.

Or maybe I haven’t given my current living situation enough time. It’s only been three months. Maybe I will make friends eventually and find a better job too. I could survive doing long distance for the next year and a half. I can finish my degree in person instead of online, maintain my independence, and not worry about what will happen if Marty and I split for some reason. Staying here is an option, but I think for me, it would mean knowingly heading into the next year and a half in a constant struggle to pay bills and fight my depression.

I am trying to be objective about this whole thing, to make a decision that is best for me both financially AND mentally, but I just don’t know. I know the decision is mine to make, but any advice or thoughts would be so greatly appreciated. 

**TL;DR:** My bf of three year's parents offered to house me while I finish my second degree. They live near a big city with the potential for more opportunities. Right now I'm struggling to pay my bills, have no local friends, hate my job, and am generally unhappy. Moving could be great, but also a disaster on the off-chance Marty and I split. Trying to decide if I should risk it and move, or stick it out where I am until I finish school. 

**EDIT:** added TL;DR/formatting."

Ideally I would leave it till next week as I have deadlines and could use some a day for practice.

I didn't prepare for interviews and applied to internships all over the world. I got interviews at top companies, and they didn't go so well. I have only one chance in London left, and that's it (for now I guess)

I am studying CS in the US, and everyone pushes the rhethoric that you must have an internship. I am also a non-US citizen, so sometimes I notice companies reply within a day, saying how they cannot hire me, and I assume it's because of my citizenship. Going back home isn't an option, since work ethic where I'm from is terrible, and I already did an internship sophomore summer there and hated it.

I need advice on what to do and if you know any companies who are particularly supportive of minorities and non-US people that focus on work in CS?

Since I hate the interview process overall, I am getting to a conclusion that I might want to start my own business. Do you think that's a possibility as a Junior in college who isn't from here? I would love to start a business anyway so this experience might push me into it, but I would like to do it in a big city in the US or generally the ""western world"" with the possibility to support myself with food/apartment. Are there any people/places you know who can get me to a startup scene that can support my living/food costs?

I know it's a complex issue, but if any of you could offer any advice that would be great. I am aware that I might have rushed with applications, but I put a lot of effort into some of them, and some that I didn't want to work for not so much, and didn't get much opportunities nevertheless.

I interviewed with two big tech companies, 1 startup, and a company who I fit very well with based on my old field of study.  I took the startup interview when I was sick and failed miserably.  I was also rejected from one big tech company after the interview despite the interviewer thinking I performed excellently and having been asked really easy questions (intro data structures or intro to cs level questions).  

So far, that leaves me in the final rounds for the other two companies.  


Since I am new to CS, can I still realistically apply for internships in Spring for this summer?  This whole semester kind of flew by fast."
7atz57,85,2017-11-04,My friend is struggling with mental health and I don’t know how to help,SkytossMasterRace,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/7atz57/my_friend_is_struggling_with_mental_health_and_i/,"My friend of 4 years has been lying about his entire university life. In his current state, he has pretty much dropped out of university due to his refusal to accept help and address his mental health issues. He’s been getting along and hiding this from his friends by coming up with lies to convince everyone that everything is fine (it’s not). Recently, we discovered that he’s been lying about everything: his resume, his academic status, his jobs, his accomplishments, literally everything. This post will just detail the reasoning behind his fall, and how he’s progressively gotten worse over the course of our friendship.

In first year, I met William (not his real name of course). He lived in the same residence as I and we were in the same program. He was a quirky individual with some not-so-desirable personality traits. He’s the type of person to message you asking for something, to which you’d respond shortly after, and then he’d disappear for days. 

Anyways, we ended up joining the same club together shortly after the term started. I made some close friends at this club, and William just sort of joined as well. As the term progressed, I discovered he had a crush on a girl in one of our classes, Lydia. Lydia happened to be close friends with one of the members of the club, Richard, and she slowly integrated herself into our friendship circle.

At first things started off innocent and cute. William would walk her to classes, chat her up, and study with her after school. They would always be together, and we would tease him about her, asking when they’d become official, to which he’d vehemently deny any sort of romantic relationship with her. Over time, however, we realized that this innocent crush had devolved to a mild obsession. 

As she started to deny his offers to walk her to class, he’d camp outside her residence waiting for her to show up. He’d get all mopey and depressed when she ignored his messages and doubled his efforts to be around her as often as he could. He would wait for her after class (since we were all in the same program) and basically walk with her from class to class since we all had extremely similar schedules. His obsession with spending time with her got the point that whenever we wanted to find him, we’d just ask Lydia where she was (since he’d never reply). After some time, Lydia started hanging with us less and less and eventually just left the friend group.

Now, Lydia wasn’t very upfront in her relationship with him. Whether it was because she genuinely believed he just treated her as a very good friend, or because she just wanted to tool him around is something I’m still not too sure about. But we all knew that she had 0 interest in him, and to my friends and I, it seemed like she was just leading him on. My friends had tried many times to convince him to move on, to which he’d repeat the same line: “I just think of her as a really close friend.” At that point we realized that there was no point talking to someone who’s deluded themselves to this extent. He was obsessed with her, and wouldn’t stop until he had her.

In third year, William was still into Lydia. I had lived with him for 3 years now, and I’ve been very aware of the changes in his personal habits. His personal hygiene was literally at an all time low. What used to be a consistent, every-three-day showering routine (I know, still pretty gross), turned to a biweekly (that’s every other week) affair. I was literally in disbelief at how far he’d let himself go. He’d leave his laundry in the washing machine for hours, letting it sit and start smelling musky, before drying it in the dryer. His room smelt like something had died inside it, and he would make terrible messes in the kitchen. He would make protein shakes, drink half of it, and just leave it opened beside the sink for days. Literally a nightmare of a roommate.

Now, it was because of this deteriorating hygiene that I had decided that I needed to live with someone else. I was looking for a sublet for the following term, and found a very well priced suite with 4 rooms. Now the only problem was that I only had 2 friends with me, one of which was a girl who asked if we could look for a female 4th roommate so she wouldn’t rip her hair out from how annoying living with 3 guys would be. Lydia had posted in one of our group chats looking for roommates and our female roommate reached out to her as our fourth. When Lydia  messaged me asking to join our housing group, I gladly accepted and secured the sublet. It wasn’t till a couple months later that I realized that was a mistake.

Now I wanted to be straight up with William. I privately messaged him that my friends and I would be living with Lydia, and subsequently dug myself into the deepest shithole of my University-of-Waterloo-attending life. All Hell literally broke loose after I told him. He went on a social media rampage, followed by a blackout, in which he just deleted everyone off of his social media and retired his account. He started sending me passive-aggressive texts, saying things like, “Congrats bro, you can have her, you win.” I just want to clarify that at no point in our now-three year friendship had I shown any interest in Lydia. Literally none. I barely spoke to her.

Following the social media blackout, his behavior started getting very erratic. He stopped going to classes, and became super defensive with our group of friends. He would skip important lectures, group meetings, and even tests. He would lie and say things like he was there but we didn’t see him, or that he was enrolled in another section (there was no other section). His favourite excuse was that he “had to go take care of something”. We basically stopped pestering him about skipping classes, but we noticed something was up when he skipped multiple exams. We weren’t completely sure what was going on, but he ended up enrolled in the following term so we thought he had his shit figured out.

At this point, the lies started escalating in ridiculousness. William pulled us all aside one night and told us about a serious health issue he was having, to which he needed to undergo surgery. We were all concerned for him, but in the following weeks we noticed that he seemed to be perfectly fine and didn’t take any time off of from video games or hanging out (he insists he underwent surgery to this day). He told us about a friend of his, who was a previous girlfriend that was obsessed with him, and would buy him all kinds of things, who suddenly passed away when we asked to meet her. He later confessed that she wasn’t real.

At this point, all this information serves to provide some type of context and background into the type of person that William was to us. The rest of this story will now detail how we discovered his true personality and how dangerous his lies had become.

Last term, Richard and his friends decided to give William another chance at being a roommate and lived with him over the summer since it would be his last co-op term. However, at the same time, he claimed to be enrolled in Waterloo, and also claimed to be working part-time. It was more than a bit suspicious, especially when he seemed to only work this part-time job, and would do nothing else but play video games at home. He would claim to have morning classes and tutorials one week, just to magically have none the next week. Aside from this shifting schedule, he had time to go to Richard’s classes, as he would constantly ask if he could attend them. Ironically, he seemed to never go to his own classes and seemed to skip tests and midterms without a care in the world.

At this point we started getting really suspicious. Suspicion hit the roof when William asked Richard to edit his resume and accidently sent him a folder. The folder, aptly titled ‘resumes’, contained over twenty resumes, each with a different purpose, each with a different set of credentials. Some were resumes with his real educational background, while other resumes had him claiming to be a student at McGill (McGill is very close to his home). Some had work histories in fast food, some in business management internships (he is not in business), some were health-industry related co-op jobs that he was in no way qualified for or had worked for in the past. Does he even realize that employers can see his co-op history when he applies for the job as part of the package?

The point of this story is just to get some help from him, help that he clearly needs. He compulsively lies, has no personal hygiene, and is still to this day, obsessed with Lydia. We’ve already tried many things to get him to see help. We’ve told him to go to a therapist, to which he lied about seeing (surprise), when Lydia straight up told us that he was “studying” with her the entire day.

At this point, I’m close to the point where I’m done with him forever. But I just wanted to make one last attempt to help him. /r/uwaterloo, what can I do?

P.S. would UW mental health counseling service offer assistance to students that are on probation or no longer in the program?

7av981,1,2017-11-04,I don't feel like I fit in or belong at my university,cscqthwy,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/7av981/i_dont_feel_like_i_fit_in_or_belong_at_my/,"Hey, I'm a Junior at a university that's known mainly for partying and football, two of my least favorite things. I'm a pretty geeky, mellow, introverted dude. I like playing PC games and am currently interested in developing them. I knew that I probably wouldn't enjoy it here before I even got here, but due to a lack of planning and knowledge by both myself and my parents, I ended up here anyway. I constantly fantasize about what it would have been like to have gone to a different school, or what it would be like to transfer now. I'm in Computer Science, and our department is very small and unknown. We have a small CS club that only meets when I have class.

I understand that partying, football, and greek life can hypothetically be avoided at any college, but I feel that this school attracts very different people from myself because of its reputation regarding those things. People tell me to go to clubs that interest me, but I've found that there aren't a lot of clubs for stuff I actually care to invest time in, and even if I went and met people, they'll still be very ""different"" from myself. I also can't really go to parties--I'm not in a frat and don't get invited to them. Even if I went to a party, I would be very self-conscious about being surrounded by huge brodudes and sorority girls, neither of which I can hold a conversation with. Without giving away too much, even the location of this school is not at all ideal for someone like me, and one of the main activities to do in town is clubbing. I've tried it, and it was a pretty shitty experience. I generally think that a lot of my social issues would be minimal or nonexistent had I gone elsewhere.

One of my biggest problems because of all of this is that I end up blaming a lot of my problems on this school. Can't find friends that I can actually relate to? Blame the school. Can't find a girlfriend? Blame the school. Difficulty getting internships? Blame the school. Feel inadequate at programming? Blame the school. This is not a minor problem--it's made me feel isolated, and given me a lot of depression and self-hatred because I could have chosen to go somewhere else--or transferred sooner.

I know that I only have a year and a half left, but that's part of the problem. I feel like I've squandered my chance at a great college experience. I've never had a girlfriend or even a hookup, and I don't feel like I've made many lasting friendships here. With the exception of a few people, I can't really relate to most of my friends here the same way I did with my friends from high school, because they are usually very different ""types"" of people than myself.

I may take a gap semester in the future for unrelated reasons. Should I apply to different schools then? Of course if I transfer, it will make everything harder. I'll probably have to trudge through more classes than I would if I just stayed here. I won't have any friends initially. My grades and credits may not transfer completely. It seems silly at this point. I could try, but I don't think it's a realistic goal, really.

So how do I cope with being here? How do I not get depressed like I generally do every year here? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing?"

I have a 30 minute phone screening interview next week which according to them is going to be based on my experience and an assessment on my potential fit with their AR team. Can anyone who has gone through a similar process give me some useful tips regarding the interview prep? What kind of questions should I expect from this interview and how should I prepare for it?"
7avw7t,1,2017-11-05,Should I study abroad if I'm already doing my degree 'abroad' ?,memomelo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7avw7t/should_i_study_abroad_if_im_already_doing_my/,"TL;DR : 

- Doing degree in Tokyo, planning a year abroad in London, UK (where I had briefly lived in before)

- Scared splitting time between 2 cities would do me more harm than good since haven't really experience all that Japan have to offer just yet.

- Also scared that I won't make lasting friendship since I have only recently made friends in Japan in my 2nd year if I were to leave next year and graduate at different time compared to them.



For some context, I'm currently a 2nd year student studying in 
Tokyo, Japan planning to go abroad in my 3rd year (specifically London) but...well abroad isn't really abroad because I have lived in London before but I want to return since most of my friends based in London would be graduating + different courses selection, easier access to internships and opportunities to travel around Europe.

But on the other hand, I have also been reconsidering my decision lately since I honestly haven't been in Japan for that long + I spent most of my first year here not being very social so I have only recently made more friends to enjoy the ""real college life"". Not to mention, my Japanese is passable but not by any mean stellar so staying would probably be better if I want to improve. I have also been holding back on joining clubs or taking up part time jobs since I have the mindset that I might leave in the 4th semester.

So now I have to make the choice between fully committing to my current abroad experience in Japan or just go to London anyway. I'm honestly excited to live in London again on one hand but also afraid that I haven't made enough ties or learn all I wanted to learn in Tokyo + since post-study abroad I would be graduating at a different time than my friends in Japan right now.
I'm scared that if I split my times between the two cities, I'd end up with no close friends in the long run(of course this really depends but people tend to be closer if you're around physically for longer ya know...) + might come out of my 4 years with sub-par Japanese. 

There's just a lot of things to consider and I don't expect most people to have similar experience but... thoughts ?"
7awjtd,7,2017-11-05,How good is Seattle for finding SDE job? esp. for new grad from UW-Tacoma?,datadataguy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7awjtd/how_good_is_seattle_for_finding_sde_job_esp_for/,"Just accepted into UW-Tacoma Computer Science&amp;System Master program. And I've basically determined to be there for the following reasons:

1. I'll get a degree from ""University of Washington"", for which I'm a huge fan. It's funny that I just figured out UW is multi-campus university unlike UC or UT schools, which are totally independent.

2. UW-Tacoma CSS program is no comparable to UW-Seattle CSE, which is in the same league with MIT/Berkeley/Stanford programs; but looks already quite good to me, or at least way better than I used to think. I went through their course slides and homework assignments, and I do think that's UW-level, and nothing less challenging than those big name school (I'm also taking online MSCS from Georgia Tech). Also, students accepted into their Master program I've known so far all have very strong backgrounds, which is surprising for me. Maybe this is due to UW-Seattle CS is soooooo impossible to get in.....

3. I've visited Seattle, which is so cool, and much more lovely place for me and my spouse to settle down. I don't like Bay Area with unbelievably expensive housing price and huge crowds.

4. Most important reason: I guess Seattle is offering lots of SDE jobs, and to some extent would prefer local students, esp. UW students?  During my trip to Seattle, I heard people say Seattle economy is booming, expanding, because many IT companies flooding in and establishing their office in Seattle. Is that true? Also, greater Seattle region doesn't have that many schools like other regions, say Boston; thus UW students would have a very high chance to find a job? But would UW-Tacoma CS student be counted as UW students by HR?

Also, I'm new grad, eager to find intern. It's getting tougher and tougher for new grad, as many people are transferring to CS major. So maybe Silicon Valley is still the best place for new grad to secure the first job?

Eager to listen to any comments or suggestions. Many thanks!"

How hard/demanding does a coding challenge have to be to have you say ""fuck it I'm out.""

also, if someone could give their own perspective; i was under the impression that most coding challenges had a couple of questions that you code a solution to, but my most recent coding challenge involved deploying a web app that functioned as a chatroom (allow users to login, start private conversations with other users online, etc.). Now, I'm unfamiliar with whatever modules and libraries they want me to use, but I'm pretty sure I could do it in another language so I think I could bruteforce it if necessary, but I don't know if this coding challenge is asking a lot and I don't particularly feel like wasting a weekend doing free labor."
7ax1c6,3,2017-11-05,"Getting an internship (delay graduation), or take a semester of courses at a top school and then seek an internship, will either one significantly put me in a better position career wise?",lorde_swagster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ax1c6/getting_an_internship_delay_graduation_or_take_a/,"I hope this post is okay here. Sorry if this is the wrong place, but anyways. 

Quick about me: GPA: 3.66, research experience X 3, completed exchange at Top 50 school (1 semester), 2 side projects. Finishing my second degree (major in CS). Because i already possessed a degree, I was able to fast-track this one (2 years instead of 3.5). Downside is that I only had one summer to complete an internship and was by no-means ready to do so. 


** Option A: Internship over the summer (if I manage to get one), delay graduation by 4 months. ** 

- pros: work experience and dollars (we all love those). 

- Cons: Home school is O.K for its computer science rankings (somewhere in the top 250) probably not as well known. 

** Option B: Finish my degree over the summer by taking courses at a top university in Canada. Graduate, and then begin looking for internships/jobs. ** 

- pros: Resume contains two top 50 CS schools, as well as home school (top 250). Able to work on side projects for longer which may be more helpful into obtaining the job in the field that I want. Graduate end of summer, can do internships then or find a job. 

- cons: would graduate with zero internship experience (although I have 3 different research experiences all in CS and side projects), and No dollars :(


Suggestions? 

Thanks in advance!

7axnz6,9,2017-11-05,I am unable to get along with strangers,slightlydazed_,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7axnz6/i_am_unable_to_get_along_with_strangers/,"This is my first time writing about this and asking for advice on this platform in general. 
So, I just started uni a few weeks ago. I'm studying law. I live in Berlin, Germany and have lived here for about 3 or 4 years. I am 18, almost 19 years old. 

In summer I broke up with my long-term partner. We'd been best friends for years and went through a lot of shit together as a couple. I recognized that I didn't feel the same things for them as they did for me and that I didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. We parted without fighting and in the beginning, I took it okay - I felt like a huge burden was lifted from me and was hopeful for the future. Since I wanted to give them time to process everything and get over me, we didn't stay in contact up until last week. 
After the breakup I was on holiday with my family and back at my internship at a theater immediately after. Only when my internship ended and the semester began I realized just how truly FUCKED I was regarding my social life: I have no friends. I had been relying on my partner so much that now they were gone, there was no one left whom I really trusted. I still have my twin sister and my family but I just feel that the relationship to a friend is something very different from the relationship to a sister, especially since we have starkly different personalities. 

I really wanted to make friends in Uni but somehow I fucked up every opportunity. I figured out that talking to strangers for no apparent reason besides wanting to socialize is something I cannot do. Standing in a room with several hundred others whom I don't know and just walking up to someone seemed do-able in my head but when I was in the situation I just panicked. When we went drinking in small groups I got so dead drunk immediately that I left before getting to know anyone (I was that nervous). 
Now I'm a few weeks into the semester. I didn't make even one aquaintance. 

I don't get this - after all, I'm not a shy person. I can easily hold presentations, ask questions in front of many people or participate in discussions. If I know someone, I can talk their damn ear off. The problem is: I'm fine, when there's a REASON to talk or when I am SUPPOSED or ALLOWED to talk. Asking someone for their name or just iniciating a conversation with a stranger bc I find them attractive doesn't have an actual reason. I get so scared that I'd be embarassing myself or that people wouldn't want me to talk to them or be annoyed that I can't bring myself to even try. I found that just accepting the fact that I can't do this makes it a lot easier to survive social events and my classes because desperately trying to do this and failing everytime gets me terrified and depressed during and after the event. 

The biggest problem is: this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I'm already struggling with depression and I'm on medication. I don't have a therapist atm and for various reason I really don't want to get one. Usually, I'd just wait until time and luck makes me find new friends but right now I'm desperate for contact to another person, if I don't solve this somehow I'm just going to get more and more depressed and suicidal, I really don't want that to happen.

I feel like I'm a failure of a human being, I don't know if I'm actually ABLE to be normal around others. I get so tense and scared, also people never approach me on their own - probably because you can literally see how bad I feel on my face. I'll just stare at someone while fighting in my head about wether I should talk to them and that probably terrifies people!! Damn.

Whenever I'm somewhere with others I feel like I need to leave immediately or they'll think I'm weird and obtrusive. But normal people probably don't do that, right? Is it fine to linger around? Is it normal to initiate conversations? I don't get this. Can someone please explain the rules of socializing in college? I really don't want to bother anyone or make anyone uncomfortable.

TL;DR: After breaking up with my long-term partner, I found myself having no friends. I struggle in pursuing new people and at this point my non-existent social life is taking a toll on my mental health. How can I solve this? "
7ay4o2,5,2017-11-05,"I'm feeling hopeless and ""behind"". I would appreciate some advice.",A_Thursday_Off,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7ay4o2/im_feeling_hopeless_and_behind_i_would_appreciate/,"CAUTON: Venting ahead

TL:DR: GPA is below a 3.00, can't find any internships, scared for future.


I know tese types of posts are a dime a dozen, but I need a venting outlet as much as I need the advice. I'm an aerospace engineering student currently in my junior year. Over the summer I failed a course, which brought my GPA below a 3.00, to a 2.94. I'm currently retaking the course, and doing much better, (On track to get an A-) but I can't shake the feeling that I've screwed myself out of internship opportunities for the summer by failing the course instead of just dropping it.


I've applied to around 20 internships, and so far, absolutely no response of any kind from anyone. I've seen people on the sub say they've applied to 50-60 internships, and only get a handful of interviews/offers, but with each application I fill out I feel it's more and more pointless, ESPECIALLY when I hear my classmates talk constantly about their next interview.


I've been to career fairs and events, and have been told by recruiters ""You have great experience, but your GPA is too low for us"" which only further demoralizes me. I've been trying to pursue opportunities with smaller companies, but with aerospace, I find it difficult to find any. I suppose my biggest fear is that I won't be a viable candidate academically until the summer after I graduate, at which point, recruiters/employers will question why I haven't had any professional experience."
7ayn34,48,2017-11-05,Reading through the posts of people fresh out of college looking for jobs is terrifying. What can I do during my senior year to prep myself for post-grad?,stressed_cs_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ayn34/reading_through_the_posts_of_people_fresh_out_of/,"I recently discovered this subreddit and have read through the sidebar and top posts. Using a throwaway since there will be some personal info here and I don't need my Reddit history info attached to that.

I'm expected to graduate at the end of Summer 2018  (about August). I've applied to a few internships so far. My degree is a B.A. in Computer Systems. My college isn't anything special, it doesn't show up on any top lists. I'll be looking for internships and work in the southern California, Orange County area and beyond.

I know my resume isn't as impressive as some people I've seen here. I put some languages I know and have used in school like C++, Java, HTML, and CSS, but I'm not sure how good I need to be to say I'm proficient, you know? I've used C++ the most, but I haven't in a long time. If you asked me to write a terminal program right now, I'd be googling a lot of things to refresh my memory. What do employers expect when you say you know a language? Or are ""proficient"" in it?

As far as projects go, for class I've done a LAMP server with different user level logins, as well as a DevOps project. Both I only have pages of extensive, detailed documentation with code, no online example. Other than that, over summer I was making a game in GameMaker 1.4 (which uses a priority GML language) for an independent study class. It looks impressive as far as the hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code, as well as considering I did all the art and music, but it's incomplete and GameMaker has no real job applications. How are these projects? Once again, if you asked me right now to build a LAMP server, for example, I'm going to refer to my documentation and google things. If you asked questions about it, my memory is hazy. Is that expected?

Other than that, my main hobby is music and I've produced plenty of albums in plenty genres, played shows, work with local bands, and stuff like that. I have thousands of plays. I just don't really put that on my resume too much. Is this something worth noting?

So, with all that information, what should I be doing to prep myself for graduation? What kind of projects should I be working on? What languages should I be learning? Basically, how should I be spending my time? Especially considering right now is the time to apply for summer internships.

I'm seeing a lot of posts here of people with seemingly better resumes than me who have said they've applied to 200+ jobs with no luck which is terrifying for me. At least I can say I believe I'm a good interviewer and personable. I've had good success applying and getting part time jobs over the years.

One last quick aside (sorry for the long post), my name is foreign. It isn't too clear where from unless you're from there. The pronunciation isn't easy but is very memorable once you know. People usually get a kick out of it and crack a joke since it is kind of funny. English is my first language and I was born and raised here, though. How should I tackle this issue on my resume and applications?

Thank you so much for any and all responses."

I went to a SUNY school with a direct funnel to the Big 4. I got my masters and bachelors and am on track for a CPA. I got work at one of the Big 4 and worked there for about a year. After a year, I was laid off due to over-staffing in the department. Officially, I am registered as mutually separated, as per the company's terms on lay-offs. 

I am an eagle scout, I have run a small business out of my dorm room, I had an internship in a small local firm at the beginning of college, I've worked as a consultant for a public company during college for a project, and the such.

Despite this, I cannot find work. I have been out of work since July. I was aware of the upcoming lay-off since March. I was warned from a partner that lay-offs were going to happen and my position was a likely candidate since I had a masters and was thus paid more than other people doing the same work. I was also given 6 weeks severance where I was allowed to say I was still employed. It was technically a ""twilight employment"" if you would.

Despite all those advantages, I am still out of work.

I am working with some staffing companies. I mostly post to job boards like indeed, ziprecruiter, careerbuilder, etc. I live on Long Island and look for work either in NYC, upstate, or LI. I keep all my social media profiles clean as hell and made sure my linkedin had 500+ connections. I have had my resume looked over many times and cleaned up. I have references from my old job as I left on good terms, even gave them some wine on my last day. 

Yet, all I've gotten is two phone interviews (one from a friend of mine's referral) and one face-to-face interview and no offers. 

What am I doing wrong?"

On the first day I was shown to my desk in this huge 20 people open space office and told to wait for the senior that will give me assignments. No one introduced me to the collective nor did i have a chance to do so.

Senior showed up after an hour or so of me just sitting at the computer browsing stuff. No one seemed to care much who I was or what I was doing there. I introduced myself, we shook hands, talked about the project and I started doing the assignment.

The assignments were pretty much individual so I didn't have the chance to cooperate with anyone from the team, besides the two seniors who were supervising me. 

During the month i was there, I didn't even once go into the break room and I always ate lunch alone. I was the only intern plus this was my first work experience(i am a student in my 20s) so I was really terrified. My social awkwardness didn't help much. 

Only two people, from the team, approached me during work, because they were curious what I was doing there, and if i was their new colleague. I introduced myself, smiled, explained i was an intern and that was about all the social interaction i had with the whole team for the whole month. 

Anyway, I got the offer for the job at the end of the internship, was praised for my independence(haha). I was really thinking of declining, because of the whole social experience I had, but at the end I accepted, since my financial situation isn't best and I could really use the work experience on the resume.

A month has passed since the end of the internship, and my first day is tomorrow. I am really terrified/anxious of how its going to go. I really hope I at least get a proper tour and chance to introduce myself now. 

But i am afraid I am going to be shown to the desk again, and left there doing assignments. I could really use few tips or a game plan for tomorrow, so I don't find myself cut out from the team in a month or two.

Should i march into the break room and start introducing myself or should i ask for the lunch invitation(who can i even ask) or how would i even approach the whole ""quiet guy from the internship"" situation.

I don't mind working alone but the awkwardness is killing me. Hope you guys can help me. Thanks.

**TL;DR:** Had an awkward internship, didn't interact socially with the team, got the full time job at the said team, need tips on how to amend myself."

Conversely, I'm worried I might hate the team &amp; culture at Job A -- I know certainly I would hate the location. 

If it makes a difference, it's an internship decision, and both companies offer high intern conversion rate so I'm kind of treating it as a full-time decision as well.

- Did you guys gravitate towards CS/Math internships or business internships? Was it out of genuine interest or was it simply easier to get an internship in one area over the other?
- When should I start applying for summer internships? I have heard from some people that I'm kind of late for applying to US internships but people generally apply to Canadian internships around January. How accurate is this?
- How successful were you guys finding a co-op or internship during your first year? Do you think I have a chance of getting at least a couple of interviews if I apply to over 200 companies?

On the bright side, I should be able to just work with my current research group full-time over the summer if I can't find anything, but that wouldn't be ideal because I did that last summer and am trying to diversify my experience.  I also might try and get an REU if nothing in industry works out.

* I'm an undergraduate student in Data Analytics

* Currently interning in IT Business Intelligence at a medium size company

* My goal is to become  a data scientist/machine learning scientist in the future. I hope to achieve this by progressing through industry, obviously, and perhaps with the help of a Masters in Statistics as that is my primary interest.

I have two internship offers on the table: Software Engineering @ Target, or Data Analytics @ Ford.

For someone who wants to become a data scientist, does it serve me better to take the software engineering position to diversify my skill-set and hone my competency in writing industry level code (especially since I'd have something to show for software engineering w/ a relatively short time commitment) while supporting my statistics and data processing knowledge through my coursework and current internship.

OR is it the case that if I want to become a data scientist that software engineering is only semi-related and that I simply keep going down the path of data analytics and continue to increase my experience with tools like Qlikview, Hadoop, R, Python Alteryx, etc. that an experience at Ford might afford? (no pun intended :P)

**tl;dr:** to progress towards becoming a data scientist do I do as much data related as possible stuff or is dabbling in pure software engineering valuable?"

I struggled my entire college life trying to figure out what I wanted my career to be. I picked economics because it seemed practical, thats it.

It wasn't until recently that I fully realized I'm actually great at math, love building stuff, and have always had a passion for computers and gaming. So I started to pursue programming in my spare time.

Thats my life story out of the way..

I really want to become a programmer as a full time job. Is the best possible way to get hired by creating a portfolio of good projects? 

I'm kind of in a limbo, I don't know what I should pursue exactly. I've been learning swift and xcode so I can develop a handful of apps for my portfolio. But, I also want to learn C# or C++, so I can apply for an internship at a gaming studio or something. Then, I also see tons of people suggesting to learn python...etc 

I'm just not exactly sure what I should be doing. Should I just put my head down and continue learning swift, develop apps, and move on to c++?

Sorry if I sound like a complete novice, and stupid as hell. That's because I am. I just want to learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible, to make up for all the time I wasted."
7b313p,4,2017-11-06,Mental Health thoughts,GTopinions_throwaway,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/7b313p/mental_health_thoughts/,"**TLDR** Action Team's mental health report focuses almost entirely on how to better react to issues rather than how to prevent the issues. Abrupt ending after realizing either this is preaching to the choir, or worse, to those who actually care but won't do anything. 

So the Action Team produced a report on [mental health...](http://www.president.gatech.edu/student-mental-health) And after going through it briefly (there sure is a lot of words, in true GT style), focusing on the recommendations, it's rather disappointing. Of the 10 general recommendations, only #7 is proactive (maybe #8 too), meaning we're going to make sure we can address all of these problems with the best tool set we can have!...that's all good, I'll spare you the sarcastic remarks about implementation, but I won't spare you my thoughts on the focus of reacting instead of being more proactive about stopping the need to have all of this. 
We* are a school that conducts an enormous amount of research into many fields, including in the relevant fields of education/teaching/psychology/health/wellness/etc. But the school that produces it, doesn't even care to implement/embody those theories it so touts/celebrates as coming from some of the best minds in the fields! _insert recruiting jargon here_
I have had a laughable time trying to figure out the required classes for graduation (MS in one of the Engineering fields). It's so frustrating watching everyone struggle with just simply understanding the logistics of their degrees. What if we were to grade some of these syllabi or degree guidelines produced by the schools/departments? How many of them would get a passing grade? 
Speaking of grades, it's so miserable watching people so frantically struggling to achieve goals that are varying/confusing/poorly set. Let's stop to think for one minute, if you assign a report+15 minute presentation a week before it's due, is that healthy? Is it even necessary? It's incredibly frustrating and deflating to watch TAs grade work you've poured hours into in just 2min because they've got 50 more to go. Why don't we take the time to help each other? Not ""well, you can come to office hours to get more help"", but ""here's what you did wrong, here's what you did not understand""...this is hand holding but it's the clearest example I can come up with. The intent of school is not busy work, it is to understanding difficult subject matter. 

I'll take a quick break and try to give myself a bit of credibility here...My undergrad was done through 4 different schools over 6 years. I've taught undergrad and grad classes as a student. I've worked in the industry, and have interviewed potential new hires (FYI, an industry tid-bit, KSU students are currently more valued in my particular engineering field than GT students. Hadn't even bothered with GT recruiting until I came along, and the last effort resulted in exactly 1 applicant from the entire department for a nearly no-matter-what-you're-hired intern position with a competitive starting pay...go figure).

Back to what's now turned into a rant unfortunately...We know the problems, we know what stresses us out. So do the professors, not hard to figure it out. Deadlines that are too short for the amount of work requested. Material that's not covered/explained well enough, or worse yet, not at all because of poor planning and class time running out. Professor's who are disconnected with their current industry practices (unless GT is only set on producing researcher scientists). Expensive class materials. Confusing grading systems...let's expand on this one. Every student is pushed to get the best grades. An A is 90 or above. Well, if you get a 5 question test and get one wrong, there goes that A. If that was worth 20% of your grade, there go any hopes of recovery. And thus, you're understanding of the subject matter explained to you over 16 weeks is based on those 5 questions. 

I apologize for the lengthy rant, I'll stop here, never saw anything good come from trying to solve an actual problem, it's too much hard work, easier to figure out how to improve the band-aids...

*I say ""we"" cautiously, I don't have any school pride because I feel let down by GT and the stereotypical ""number in the system"", no hard feelings, just don't expect me to have any school pride. I assume that's fair.

Last summer, I interned as a Data Engineer at an awesome company and really enjoyed the work. It involved some Data Science with the way we analyzed the data and presented trends, as well as some engineering/developing large-scale ETL processes, dataflow pipelines, and optimizing Spark clusters.

I did accept a Data Engineering Internship at a Big N company this summer, but part of me is wondering how difficult it will be to get back into Software Engineering. The fields are pretty different and I feel like the more I follow this Data Engineering path, the less I will be prepared if I ever want to switch back to Software Engineering (and vice versa).

However, ServiceNow seems like a more fun culture and overall experience, and is an actual tech company so it may afford better experience (not sure about this though).

The wage for each position is roughly the same, so I'm not factoring logistics into my decision for now, aside from what I have mentioned above. Does anyone have experience with either of these companies? It would help me out a ton!"

7b93p7,1,2017-11-06,Bad optics in hiring?,bigdaveyl,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7b93p7/bad_optics_in_hiring/,"This post is a bit of a vent and observations about something that happened during my latest job search.

So, I applied for a programmer/analyst job at my alma mater which is a state school.  They were hiring for two positions and ended up bringing in six people for an on site interview.  

After a 4+ month process, they decided to only offer one of the six a position, and re-post the job to find the second person.

I had decided after fourteen years doing statistical type programming (which included a bit of programming in industry specific languages/packages) to move into something more mainstream. I tend to have more luck applying to more ""junior"" roles since I can't say I'm a ""senior java guy"" or whatever but have programming experience.

I was browsing Linkedin the other day and it looks like they hired a woman, only a year out from graduation, had no relevant internships and was working in retail for the last year.  She had a decent GPA, better than mine as an undergrad but I went to grad school and basically had straight A's there.

Of course, the only feedback (yes I asked) was ""better fit.""

I completely understand that there are people that could fit their organization better than I could, it just seems like on the surface this is bad optics that the one person you hire seemed really green and that no one seems to ever be completely honest on what exactly they are looking for or how candidates are graded out.  I hear complaints from HR/Hiring managers that they get candidates that argue with them or that if they say too much, that could open them up to liability.  How does this situation exactly diffuse any of that?  I mean, they won't share how I compared to the person they hired, so what am I to assume?  If I were three years older, I could threaten to sue, but I shouldn't have to sue them to figure out why I wasn't hired?  And I would pose that this sort of thing would actually make candidates more apt to argue and/or sue."

It's based on the ALEKS program, so every student is going at a different pace. The students have to work in silence the entire class period. 

We have a lot of issues getting them to do their work. My mentor teacher just tells them, ""I know this sucks, but if you don't want to do this next semester you have to work."" He's also tried letting them make teams to earn points based on how many topics they complete (this was the students' idea), but the students can't get it together and turn in team names, so that's not working either.

I know it's boring to stare at a computer for an hour doing math, and I would love to find a way to motivate them to work and to pass. So many are failing. My mentor teacher just lets them, because ""they're responsible for the education."" I agree to an extent, but I think they're kids who fell behind for a reason, and this can't be the best nor only way to motivate them. What should I do? Does anyone have a similar story?"

I’m trying to figure out a way to differentiate my “internship” from other normal internships for college students.

I am a 22M who is pursuing a BS in Computer Networking and Cyber Security. I chose this path because it became a growing field within the area, and a lot of people told me to follow it because thats where the ""money"" is. I currently do not have any job experience within the IT field, neither have I been an intern, OR have any certifications. I am currently working on getting my A+,Security+, and possibly my Network+ within the next year. I am not too confident in my skills within the field and I am afraid that I am working towards failure. This, would be a job for money.

Another option that I am considering is, switching majors and schools, and pursing culinary arts. I always dreamed about being a chef, and I LOVE to cook. I am currently a member of a group, where we would sell food, and where I would cook for it. I also cook a lot at home, and for several friends and have had several compliments about my cooking. The only issue is that I am afraid of the cost to go, and the outcome (money made back after paying debt of going). I have also heard that being a chef requires a lot of working hours. I normally cook for maybe 3 hours MAX a day and at least 12 hours a week. I cant imagine doing 12 hour shifts or anything. Though, thats only me assuming. I havent really talked to any chefs or researched much about it. Though, I should because I just love food so much. I have imagined myself opening/being a chef at a steakhouse or maybe a sushi chef.

What I didn't know at the time was that a severe chronic anxiety disorder, and mild/moderate ADHD were the primary reasons I couldn't focus and absorb things in classes, and sometimes was unable to finish entire exams. Severe anxiety also affected my ability to socialize.

I tried applying to jobs back then, like financial analyst, cost analyst, pricing, budget analyst, etc. - But they quickly denied me, or asked over the phone what my experience and GPA was. I couldn't get internships because of the GPA, and I'd freeze up in interviews because of severe anxiety. 

I've had a few very brief jobs - two were sales-based, and one was making phone calls to aggregate/update data. With sales, I'd freeze up, hyperventilate/stutter, and not be able to sound convincing at all. I quit both those within a week. I don't have the personality for sales anyways, and don't like lying to people/trying to sell them stuff they don't need.

With the phone job, the same thing almost: Even though we had a script of questions to go through, I got super nervous again, lost my place, and a couple times panicked and hung up in the middle of the call. I left that job after 2 days.

I've been to numerous career fairs and been denied almost immediately or get no reply. I've applied to government positions too. I even got my doctor to write a Schedule A letter for gov't. jobs for preference for people with disabilities. A few hiring coordinators asked me to send it, then I never heard anything back from them. I also went to a couple temp agencies who did brief interviews, took my resume, then never did anything else for me. Bender Consulting Services (for people with disabilities) did the same thing - I talked with a guy on the phone, sent him my resume, and never heard anything else. That was over a year ago.

For some years I took a detour into geology and other science courses, but then got scared off of that when I thought I'd have to live in a trailer for weeks at a time in the middle of nowhere. Also, geology is so cyclical that people get laid off all the time. 

So then I started taking more accounting courses, and now have enough courses to be eligible for the CPA. But I don't think I want to do accounting long-term. I think I'd rather look into an MBA, MPA, or something else. I thought if I had ""eligible for the CPA"" on my resume, that might be as good as a degree in accounting or finance, and might be able to get something now.

In addition to accounting, I looked at what jobs people with economics degrees typically get. Marketing research, operations research, data analysis, and others came up. So I looked at what skills were offered, and earned certifications in Tableau, Google Analytics, and SPSS. I also thought about SAS, SAP, and some others. 

But I think the 3 is enough - I just want a job already. Adding an MS Excel cert might be the only other I'd consider - but who hasn't used Excel in business classes? That cert seems like a waste of money. I haven't applied much yet with the new certifications and associates, but I think it will be the same thing when I apply again: ""what was your GPA, when did you graduate?"" (even though it was over 10 years ago, and I'm an entirely different person now), and ""what's your experience?"" (same problem I was in before, but now I've overcome the problem that caused it)

Now I'm in my mid 30s and think every day about the time my disability has wasted. All the people I met in college now ignore me, so no help there - they likely think I'm lazy, or just a loser.

I'm aiming this post at professional career advisers or counselors. If you come on here to insult me, it won't do anything. I've heard it all before.

Thanks for reading, thanks in advance for your suggestions."

Now, I'm not even being picky with who I'm applying to- I'm literally going on linkedin, handshake, etc. and mass applying to any company that isn't unpaid.

One of the reasons I even decided to go to this school was because I was promised ""oh companies will love you"" and shit like that, but all it's done is fuck up my GPA and leave me 0 time to prepare for coding interviews (if i could even get one) and committing to side projects that are ambitious.

I'm just so lost and worried that I won't have any offers lined up for the summer and I'll be at home chilling or doing research that I don't particularly care about while my classmates are interning at ____ and blah blah blah.

I would like to remain working in this country and industry, and have so far enjoyed the firm and think that I have done a well-enough job to warrant a full-time offer. 

What I need help doing is going about asking if there is a position for me after my internship contract ends. 

I have three bosses. The first, is around my age with one year extra experience who I work with day to day. I would be going for the same position as them and feel that they have liked me well so far as they did not get a sense that I would be asking for a job at the end of the internship. I am nervous to ask this one in the first instance in case it creates any tension between us in the remaining weeks of the internship. 

The second boss gets my weekly updates on progress and so far, I have been able to deliver most of my milestones at or above expectations. 

The third boss, is basically the founder. He is not involved in my day to day and, while he has asked for a few items directly from me, may not have a good sense of my capabilities.  

What is the best strategy to approach this? Go directly to the top decision maker or speak more frankly with my immediate boss to get a feel first?

7bcs1d,1,2017-11-07,Can anyone help me with my SoP?,wolverine1411,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7bcs1d/can_anyone_help_me_with_my_sop/,"My decision to pursue graduate studies has been motivated by my eventual objective of meaningful research in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. I would like to embark upon this venture through the Master's program offered by the Computer Science Department at Arizona State University.
I was twelve years old when I first had the experience with the computer while using Logo commands in school for drawing various shapes from a little turtle. I loved it because while working on it I was able to experiment with my creativity. I would often ponder on how e-mails are sent instantly and how games are developed on computers. Then, I learned C++ in junior high school. In the final years of my schooling, I was especially most drawn towards computers as I learned a lot about programming. Furthermore, I was introduced to logical, creative and “behind the scenes” side of applications. With the accomplishment of the school project, “Examination Management system” I had the epiphany that with lines of code a lot can be achieved. Since my project was awarded as the best, my confidence was greatly reinforced. In hindsight, I can say from a “hello world” program to every complex program, from every #include to getch() and simple command to an intricate one, my passion for computer science has boosted. These small moments of revelation led me to figure out my deep penchant for computer science engineering and hence to the decision to pursue under graduation in it. 

During my first half of the undergraduate program, I learned about various programming languages such as C++, C#, and Python. These gave me a perception of the fascinating virtual world of computing characterized by miraculous lines of codes. This understanding and fascination led me to program the Game of Tetris in C++. This little project, not only helped me to implement my knowledge, but it also enhanced my creative side.

Over the course of first half of my undergraduate program, I participated in various programming contests, as well as headed the technical society of my college. I was always into the practical side of my studies which that is why I created various applications for my college such as online attendance, online class schedule, and others. I also created an online examination system for specific subjects which stored marks of different students in the Computer Science department.

By this time, Cloud Computing was on a rise. Every newspaper, science journal, scholar, the engineer was called “Cloud” as the future of science and technology. With a limited number of resources available, it was difficult to gain knowledge about it. But I was lucky, as IBM collaborated with our university to provide us with specialization in “Cloud Computing and Virtualization”. I studied various Cloud Computing models, Business Intelligence tools, and Cloud Service providers. 

The work I did during my summer internship at IGATE, an IT company in India, helped me to gain deep insight into how “Cloud” has made our lives so easy and how it is slowly coming up with solutions to data storage problems. During this internship, and because of my academic project, in which I created a public and private cloud on the LAMP, WAMP and XAMP servers, I developed a keen interest in this technology. 

Along with Cloud Computing, I was introduced to another technology, Artificial Intelligence. During my semester of fall 2015, I studied this new age of evolution. Artificial Intelligence, which lies at the confluence of human intelligence and technology, captivated me. With the knowledge of programming languages, as well as Artificial Intelligence, I always tried experimenting with them together. This experimentation led me to program an implementation of various aspects of Genetic Algorithm in JAVA, as well as, the creation of chatbot framework in Python.

During my final year of my undergraduate degree, I carried out research on “Security issues in cloud” in which I delved deep into measures and tools that could be used to enhance security. I created a system where we could send and download any file only through a keypair and extensively researched on the intricacies faced in private and public cloud. With my focused efforts, I gained insights into the many layers that exist in private cloud and how on each level and layer we can create a system which can ensure security. 

With a goal to sharpen my skills and to experience the ways a company works and to implement my knowledge in real life, I started working as a Project Engineer and later as Associate Analyst for WIPRO Technologies in 2016. I worked on Wipro and Salesforce project “Ventiv”, in which I had to carefully monitor the Cloud Resources and the Services provided. 

While working on “Ventiv”, I learned about how to build and manage Cloud resources and how to efficiently use Cloud services as a software, application and business processes. I was also actively involved in finding and solving bugs and errors. At Wipro, I created various reports of resources available and was also involved in the pricing of resources. Also, while working on this project I studied about the view control technology and also about various tools such as Salesforce Lightning App Builder.

It was during my time at Wipro, I learned about the immense power “Cloud Computing” holds. Aligned with my interest and motivation, I am eager to explore the domains of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. It would be fascinating to see what will happen if we combine both these technologies. The grooming at Arizona State University will endow me with tools I need to attain these goals. At your university, I will gain the chance to engage myself in research under the guidance of distinguished professors.The best academic resources and facilities at avant-garde labs will be useful to upgrade my knowledge and prepare myself for aspirations centered on research.

As an intern I'm supposed to be helping out with the Helpdesk, Imaging computers, AD management and a few other things. 

But then..... A few hours after my interview I received a call from a company I had applied about a month ago wanting to set up a phone interview (the position is as an Entry Level Helpdesk in a call center, paid holydays, PTO, vacation time, you could say it's a great package?! and the other thing is the salary ranges from $10-$12 I hadn't heard back from the Intern position yet, so I said what the heck what can I lose, well I did pretty well in the interview and I'm supposed to be going in for a 2nd one in a few hours.  

Pause, I hope you're able to understand the dilemma I'm going through right now, I can't choose which company I'd rather work for. As an Intern i'll be exposed to different roles, which is something I'm interested in, but there aren't any benefits, no holidays off, no vacation, nothing.

I have no IT work experience, no projects or internships to boast about. I guess I'm your typical hobbyist whose experience outside of school is all self taught and comes from acting as my family and friend's IT guy/tech support or building desktops for myself, family and friends for years.  

I was an HVAC mechanic &amp; service tech until an injury ended that career. I healed up and went to college looking for a new one. 

All the googling I've done told me a that today a resume longer than a page is the kiss of death, so I've done my damnedest to stick to one page, the heck with the margins.

I believe it is now the point to apply for full-time positions. However, I am having trouble deciding what positions to apply to.

Throughout my seven years study (four at community college, remaining three at university ), I have participated in three notable internships (Project Management, Process Engineering, and Systems Engineering) and various engineering projects. Most of these experiences had mechanical design (CAD) components to them. So, yes, I can apply to positions that I know for sure I CAN DO... but do I really want to design?

What really struck my passion string was what I did for my last internship. It was a project that required me to take an objective and, on my own with some inputs from others, design, develop, present, fabricate, integrate, and test. For this project, I have developed the mechanical design of the test fixture, the electrical system, and the automation software control and test interface (LabVIEW). The LabVIEW code was comprised of SEVERAL queue messaging handlers controlled by one master event loop. This fixture had to control the actuation, communicate to the SCARA robot, and acquire data at the right time. Although I would have liked to use Python, I was able to get the test fixture up and running faster. I would like to say that I have successfully accomplished this project.

Even though mechanical designing is my backbone, I want to branch out into software development. However, every time I look for jobs online, all I see is mobile/app/web positions. I am not interested in these.

Please advise me on what CS positions I should narrow my job search to and, if you have any, suggest companies that might have positions that I would be interested in. Here are some project examples that I have in the pipeline (just waiting on facilities,  funding, and time): robotic hexapod, quadcopter, AR video game, etc. Also, most of my experiences on my resume is related to mechanical engineering, please advise on how I should revise or improve my resume for CS job opportunities.

Some more information:

I live in the Bay Area so I know there are a lot of tech opportunities. I am open to relocating (namely... Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles, Vietnam, Japan...!).

I program mostly in Java... Scala most recently... And am learning Python. I have used C++ before, but I would not call myself an expert. I have DSA and OOP checked."

I've been living with my girlfriend for 3 and a half years, and recently we moved to a new city where she's starting her post-graduate degree. We both graduated together back in September, and I'm currently unemployed, having just finished off a summer internship. I had planned to take a short break before looking for work again around Jan/Feb next year, but just got an unexpected offer for my dream job, to start in 2 weeks. The problem is that job is based in our original city, 500 miles away, and I now need to make a call on whether to move back there for it without my girlfriend.

We would definitely want to stay together, but it would be quite a strain, both emotionally and financially. I'd hate to be away from her for too long, especially if she needs me around. My girlfriend suffers from mental illness, and can occasionally depend on me for taking care of her, sometimes for a couple of days at a time. The journey between cities is at least 5 hours, so I could realistically come back for weekends if I can cope with that journey time every week/two weeks. That said, tickets are expensive, not to mention that I would have to pay rent for 2 different places at once. My salary would cover it, but I would only just be breaking even.

How can I possibly make a decision here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Other info:
* My girlfriend's Ph.D lasts at least 4 years, and she has no intention to drop out
* We eventually plan to move back to our original city once she's graduated
* The job is in quite a niche field, and there are no similar companies in our current city
* The job is with the international leaders for this field, so would be the best start to my career regardless
* My background isn't quite the same area as the job - I got an interview by chance through a lucky connection, but otherwise would struggle a lot to get my foot in the door at other companies due to my lacking experience
* My girlfriend would greatly prefer me to be around to support her through her Ph.D, but also thinks I should accept the job, and doesn't want to me the deciding factor


**tl;dr**: I've been cohabiting with my girlfriend for the past 3+ years, but I've just been offered my dream job in a city 500 miles away, and my girlfriend is unable to move with me. How can I make a decision on whether to accept it?"

* Canadian. So I need a visa to work in the US. 
* Will not have my undergrad CS degree completed until April 2018. Looking at going to Master's for September 2018.

Company A

* Coop'd there 8 months in Canada office in 2015
* Interned 3 months at US HQ in Bay Area for Summer 2016
  * Received a return offer - full-time or intern
* Was due last Friday, got extended till this Friday
* Recruiter is saying they only give internships of ~3 months, I need January - August 2018. Likely can't do full time since I won't have a degree by January and US gov't checks before granting TN visa.
* Manager told me during summer to extend my degree (which I did till April 2018, could have graduated December 2017) so as to be eligible for internship. Said something 8 months is possible. Now, not as confident. Slow to respond. Said we may have to wait until I'm there to figure it out, which is issue with visa and my sanity.
* I have not even seen what sort of offer (basically $/hr compensation, rest of perks same as 2016) I would be getting on internship here. I have seen the full time offer and know that it is lower than others/should be increased. Expecting a lowball as I have been there a long time, having a B offer would allow me to counter.

Company B

* 1st Round telephone on Oct. 27
* Same recruiter whole time. On Monday Oct 30, tells me they want 2nd and final telephone round. I give times and say my deadline is that Friday. I email a 2nd time on Wednesday. He responds Friday. 
* I extend my Company A offer by a week. Still last Friday, the original Company A deadline. I send my availability for this week by end of business last Friday, mentioning again the new deadline of end of next week/7 days and that I would prefer Mon or Tues interview.
* It's now Tuesday, haven't heard back about even when the 2nd round would be happening.

**What do I do?** 

I would totally rather go with Company B if offered a choice. **I assume I should email the B recruiter ASAP?** I don't have a phone number for him. I haven't double emailed him yet since his last communication. **Should I ask A for another extension, and explain why?** When I phoned last time, she phrased it like ""for right now, we are only extending one week"". **In any case, I want time to negotiate both/any offers and need enough time to allow for that.**

UPDATE: Asked for an extension on Company A offer via email. I am waiting on B, as was the reason for the first extension, seems valid to extend again."

I'm a mechanical engineering student and have received a really great opportunity during the spring semester, but am really on the fence on whether to take it or not.  I'll outline my situation below and appreciate any thoughts from you folks with more career guiding experience!

1). It's in another state and I would have to relocate for the semester.

This is a big deal to me.  I would be away from my friends and girlfriend of 3 years for not only the 4 spring months, but also during the summer (I have accepted a summer internship already).  With this, I will also have to pay double rent because I live in a fraternity house near campus and they won't allow subleases from random other people.  This double rent isn't absurd by any means but it's a bit of a financial downer.  I'm mostly in it for the experience.

2). It is a great experience, but maybe not what I want to do for a living.

I'm looking to go more into something like product development as a career.  This co-op is focused on manufacturing engineering/industrial engineering work.  Now, the job sounds exciting, and a great way to enhance my engineering skills.  I have never worked in this field and may end up completely loving it or hating it. Either way, I think the experience would pay off big time.

3). There are other co-op's that I have yet to hear back from

The are many co-op's that I applied for where I haven't heard back from yet and may be a better fit.  I have had interviews with other companies for more local co-ops and while they are conveniently local, these experiences SEEM like they would be slightly less involving (the companies are lesser known companies) and product they produce is less exciting to me.  There is another job that I feel I have a good shot at in product development, and while that job is also out of the state, it's a bit more up my alley in what I was looking for - I would take it in a heartbeat.  I just don't know if I should take the chance of waiting for this opportunity, however.

4). I would have to go an extra semester.

This isn't that big of a deal to me, but watching my friends graduate before me would be a little sad.


The points of these different factors that affect me the most are actually the fact that I would be away from my friends and girlfriend for so long.  All of my friends and I were really excited to go through our later design classes together and if I took the job I would never get to experience that with them because I would be a semester behind.  My girlfriend has a hard time dealing with distance, but encourages me to take the job if it wish.  

For those with more career experience, are these silly things to worry about when it's literally only a tiny slice of my life?  Do you recommend taking a risk with a job like this now while I'm still young?  What are your thoughts on rejecting the offer I have now for other offers?

My decision for the position on the co-op I've already been accepted into is soon (days) so unfortunately I can't wait and see how the other companies pan out.

TL;DR I have a good co-op opportunity that's out of the state, but would have to leave my friends and long term girlfriend for 9 months.  This job is a completely new experience to me and would be good to have, but I'm very insure on if I would like it or not.  I have other opportunities available to me, but I don't know if it is wise to deny this offer and wait on others.

Thanks for getting through all that, I appreciate any feedback :)."

I'm a junior in a CS-Related undergrad program, and I work as a web developer on my campus part time. I've been there long enough and was doing enough public-facing front end work that it landed me a couple new part time/full time if I want. 

Basically went out for beers one night and had an interview the next week, super low key, friend of a friends startup. For now I go into an office but in the future I'll be able  to work fully remote. The second gig is through a family friends-brother in law in finance and is working fully remote for a cryptocurrency startup. 

Problem is, I'm 25 and school's paid for (100% tuition, most my housing) by grants, so I'm not desperate for cash. The other problem is even 10 hours a week at each job is 20 hours a week and I'm taking 15 credit hours already and I'm really falling behind in my courses since I said ok to the new gigs. 

The reason I'm in school is to land a decent paying job, but I don't want to sell myself short. In my head all I was thinking was I wanted to start applying for summer internships but when they offered the flexibility of working remote along with double my current pay it was hard to say no. 

But now I'm working one of the two new jobs while finishing a project at the old job before I'm done there, and those hours are taking up when I would normally be doing homework. I'm still holding down an A and A- in my other classes but I'm getting a D in a required math course. 

Once I'm done with my old job im sure the load of the in person work will be fine with courses but I'm worried about having time for the cryptocurrency startup. In an ideal world though I'd almost prefer to not work at all right now so I can do my best in class. How do I go about cutting out some commitments without burning bridges here?

Thank you

I am in a very unique situation with no one to turn to for advice so here I am.

Having just graduated from a top private US college with a degree in Economics, I am currently studying a masters in data science in a European university with a strong Econ and data science program. I had very little background in coding before the program started in September but I am working on strengthening them right now. The program has a strong theoretical focus but at the same time we are learning and using R, Python, SQL, Hadoop and some other data science-related software. I am a fast learner when it comes to quantitative subjects so I am doing pretty well so far. Together with the masters thesis and industrial practicum I have to complete next semester, I am confident that I will have the necessary skills to apply for and obtain junior/entry-level data scientist roles. 

The catch is that I am on a government scholarship which requires me to return to my country after one year of work overseas. This scholarship is also the reason why I am pursuing my masters in Europe instead of the US (sponsorship for a masters is only available if you pursue it on a different continent to your undergrad). This is a major issue because I need to find a job/internship by the end of February (another stipulation for being allowed to work overseas for a year). This is a huge problem because at this point in time, I don't have any work experience or possess any past projects or experience in computer science. Despite a 4.0 GPA in college, I've been told by recruiters of a few big companies I've had a referral to that I lack the requisite experience and qualifications to interview for a job in data science. Being in Europe might also be a factor as I am not a US citizen although US work permits are significantly easier to obtain  for nationals from my country compared to others. I have a friend from the same major and same year in college who is currently pursuing his masters in data science at the same college who's already had an interview with Palantir while my online application was rejected within a day because ""do not have a position which currently matches (my) background and experience at this time"".

Despite my interest in quantitative subjects in school, I'd never actually done an internship or projects related to data science or computer science. I've also never recruited because I was guaranteed a job from my scholarship. As such I'm completely clueless as to what I should do it at this point in time. One option, could possibly work out, is to stall for time so that I can apply for internships and jobs in summer next year although I would not bet on it. Assuming that that is not an option, what would be your job-seeking advice to me? What kind of company would be interested in hiring me as an intern/full-time worker? Any general comments are also welcome!"

7bjdf6,33,2017-11-08,Advice for non-seniors - academic and otherwise.,KappaNabla,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7bjdf6/advice_for_nonseniors_academic_and_otherwise/,"As a senior this year, I finally ended up caving to my misgivings/insecurities and made a reddit account to browse A2C and chanceme. Overall, I think I made excellent use of my time in high school insofar as academics, but the pressure/toxicity of this time gets to everyone. I've seen a lot of people on this reddit asking what they can do to make the most of their time in HS (improving ECs/resume mostly), so I thought I'd try posting some of my own thoughts.

1. Have as much fun as you can junior year (especially during summer...). If you're taking the standard ""rigorous"" senior schedule of 4-6 APs, first semester will be the most bullshit, busywork filled, toxic time of your life. This is coming from someone who normally can't wait to go to school in the morning. 
2. For the scientifically inclined - the olympiads (bio, chem, physics, math) are a fantastic way to add some awards to your resume that many people don't take advantage of. The truth is that most people focus heavily on ECs instead of awards. That's why you see lots of people listing ""national merit, ap scholar, csf, etc."" on their resumes when obviously none of those mean much. As a general rule of thumb, if an admissions committee can infer an award based on other parts of your app, it's meaningless. If you did well in your AP Bio/Chem class, it's definitely worth it to put in the &lt;50 hours you'll need to get semifinalist status. I'd also encourage everyone to sign up for the AMC (math) - while you will probably not make USAMO by starting to study in sophomore year, making AIME is within reach for almost anyone given sufficient prep. One of the most efficient time investments you can make in high school if STEM is your thing.
3. Drop everything that you can't commit to 100%. Don't waste your time. 
4. Starting a club is great, but to be entirely honest, it means literally nothing unless you can demonstrate that it wasn't done for the sole purpose of signaling to colleges that you possess ""initiative"" or ""leadership"" (the club has a measurable impact, isn't just you and five friends, makes sense in the context of your applicant profile/narrative). I see a lot of people wasting time starting a club (sometimes even 2 to 3!) so they can put ""founder"" on their application. 
4. Sleep more. Everything will improve as a result.
5. If you're feeling dismayed about a lack of local opportunity, create your own opportunity. And go hard. Commit. Trying to be one of thousands of teens that start a ""nonprofit""? If you really want to impress, file with the IRS to become a 501(c)(3). The process, while tenuous, can 100% be done by a motivated teen with a parent to sign onto certain legal stuff. And once you have that 501(c)(3) status, start soliciting corporate sponsorships. Demonstrate impact. Source: people at my school, including myself, have done this.
7. If you're doing research, take the time to submit to science fairs. Even if you don't win, you'll probably learn a lot of valuable presentation skills. And if you do win big, so will your college apps. Another very time-efficient investment for the STEM applicant. If you've poured in 100+ hours into an internship, why not put in 20 more for the chance to hook your app?
8. Look out for your friends. Having someone close to you who you can confide in and trust during the application process is invaluable. 
9. Ask him/her out. Go to homecoming, especially if you haven't done so already. Stay off reddit once in a while.
10. Read. Reading is the best hobby in the world. A genuinely well-read high school student is rare, and stands out.

I might add more as I think of stuff, but hopefully that helped a bit. For the seniors reading this post, best of luck - we all need it :)."

Other information:

1. I have a year of work experience
2. I did two internships as well
3. I am currently working on two research projects with my professors
4. A lot of extra-curricular activities (if that matters?)
5. I can definitely get 2 or more letters of recommendation


I do have a good score on my IELTS and TOEFL.


Apart from that, I contacted a counselor who suggested that I apply ASAP and perhaps get a conditional offer, however, she said that I cannot apply again in case of a rejection. Should I wait until I graduate with a better GPA to apply or go ahead and apply now and in case of a rejection apply again upon graduation?

Here's my problem. I want an internship so it would make sense to take this since its good pay and well, I got the offer. On the other hand an hour commute is a bit much and if it is doing something that isn't my area of focus but still in my major, I'd rather be doing robotics or automation. Here's the kicker, my resume is pretty good and I have already had an internship last year but I applied to 42 internships so far this year and only got this one interview (which I got because I knew someone in management).

Up to this point, I have only worked in research labs over the Summers for various reasons. So, I've decided it's time to get an internship to make things a little bit easier once I graduate.

I have considered graduate school, however I think it would be best for me to go into industry with an employer that offers tuition reimbursement. If you have differing opinions, they are welcome.

Now then, my resume needs some updating, though I'm not quite sure where to start. I've considered replacing some of the outdated information with a ""Relevant Coursework"" section, but I'd like some input on that.

Quick disclaimer: I am still in University and have been working as the sole IT Personnel as an intern for the past year. I am not very knowledgeable on these topics so please bear with my relative stupidity.

My boss just asked me to submit a proposal for a new Server to replace our outdated Dell R620 and our ReadyNAS 4220 on very short notice (wants me to submit the proposal by 2:30 PM EST today). His only criteria were that: A) its capable of running Windows Server (not specific on what version), and B) that it increases our total storage capacity (not specific on by how much).
I was thinking of going with a Synology RS4017xs+ as it increases our drive bay number by 4 (an increase of ~20 TB of storage using a RAID 6 Array on 4 TB drives over our current 12 Bay ReadyNAS 4220). However I noticed it does not contain any slots for OS Drives (we are using 2 SAS OS Drives in the current R620 with 5 Intel SSD's in RAID 5) so I am not sure if we would see an increase in overall server performance.

Can you help me figure out what would be the best configuration to meet his criteria? Any help at all is appreciated and I will try to answer any questions as best I can.

Any ideas?

- Assist in the distribution or delivery of marketing materials

- Assist with fulfillment of marketing offers

- Seek and analyze competitor marketing and sales materials both on and offline

The pub wants to hire me for next semester, and the job/duties sound good. But is it worth it to take the job as my last internship before graduation (and my first real marketing job) when its just a small pub in Virginia? Should I try to find larger companies to work for?

I eventually want to telecommute. I get about $33K right now in a very physical job and I can't dip lower, especially if there are no benefits. I am willing to work on-site if I'm building my value to ultimately work remotely. I am in no sense an expert. I have manual testing experience which makes me think learning to use Selenium would be the natural course for me. Would an Automation Tester be a good path for my needs? Is it common for automation people to telecommute? Is there another possible path for me that I'm not seeing? Thank you very much for any help you can provide.


Personal Experience:


I'm have good mathematical computation and working memory index (RAM).


I have installed and used several (~8) linux distros and I am thrilled by using the command line but I'm very much a beginner. Linux excites me but I spend a lot of time googling how to do stuff. If I have to remember all that stuff, I am screwed.


I have taken the beginning java course a couple times and some CCNA but no certificate.


California State University junior standing in Business Admin classes. I did an unpaid internship and was then hired as the full time wire operator for UBS (placing security trades on a couple different systems). I tried to juggle both and raise my daughter and basically crashed and burned the job and school. I haven't been back. My daughter is doing great!


Professional Experience:


2011-2015: $33K as a MANUAL QA testing contractor. My clients/projects included: software for a medi-tech device, a personal finance tool, a web-based investment platform, several others for shorter durations. We basically supplemented the clients' internal QA teams to help test new builds and roll out smaller changes daily.


I was a click monkey and I wasn't particularly good at writing tests but that's my experience. I was comfortable being online all day and on IM with my internal team and the client's QA team. I used the tools of the trade: JIRA and other collaborative environments and bug trackers, SalesForce and database to a lesser extent, and multiple other tools here and there. Morning meetings to plan out the day and evening progress reports.


2016-current: Mail handler for the U.S. Postal Service. About $33K currently with good benefits which is important because I support my daughter. This job is purely physical and I don't want to do it forever. x-posting to the USPS sub to see if anyone knows of any way to get behind a computer for them. I can transfer my job anywhere there is an opening starting in early Feb'18."

I have a few other offers than these, mostly from Bay Area startups and a couple game workshops in Norway and England.  

This is my Junior year internship so I want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success for a FTO out.  I have past internships at Exxon and SpaceX, but did not receive a return from SpaceX as my team ceased to exist as Elon decided to axe the project and it was determined that there was not a business need for people with my or my team's skillset.  Both past internships were in a specialized subfield of CS that isn't commonly used in general SE, and I want to make sure that I am doing an internship in something that will allow learn new skills.

Right now, I am trying to decide between Box , Quora and Intel, as they seem like relatively prestigious companies and I want to play it safe.  My concern about Intel is that upon graduation, I would be stuck in a predefined salary bracket of between $65k to $85k.    This is about half of what I would make in the Bay Area, but it is in Austin where the cost of living is a lot lower (as a side note, Intel's internship offer is $3k a month lower and doesn't provide housing, a car or any other perks than Box/Quora).  Another concern I have is that not working in the Bay Area would substantially limit my career growth.  My concern about Quora/Box is that the cost of living in the Bay Area is high, such that my salary would go a lot less than it would in Austin, TX.

Is working in the Bay Area that important?  I want to go to business school someday and would like to do project management or work in some sort of management eventually.  Also, how are Box/Quora viewed in regards to other mid-sized tech companies like Intuit?

If it matters, I am a female EECS student at MIT with a GPA that is pretty much exactly average."

My friend seems to be hitting a brick wall and I'm trying to advise him.

Background:  He is over 40, was working in IT for years, but hit a plateau, and decided to go back to school for computer science. 

He is getting frustrated because it seems like he's getting passed over for significantly younger candidates, and from hearing things through the grape vine and on LinkedIN, don't have the same level of experience or passion for the subject matter that he has.  I.e. They hire some 24 year old that's a year out of school, and had no significant internship experience/side projects/etc. - i.e. they have only ever worked retail.

It does seem like is doing all the right things, getting job coaching, doing practice interviews, etc.

He completely understands that he's not sitting in on the interviews, so he doesn't know what is said.  But, it seems like employers aren't upfront/clear about what they are looking for and how candidates graded out.  We both have been on hiring teams before and we've given feedback to candidates on why they were unsuccessful and never really had problems.  I guess the question here is that why aren't companies more upfront?  Like, instead of saying ""we went with a better fit"" (duh), it doesn't necessarily look good when you hire someone 20 years younger with no significant experience.  What is the problem with saying ""We felt the person we hired scored better on the written programming quiz""

Oh, and I don't think over qualification is an issue, as is the salary he'd likely make would be the same (or more!) as he made before he went back to school.  But, he'd have a higher earning potential.  Also, he did programing as part of previous jobs but it wasn't the same types and it wasn't his primary responsibility."

First background: I've been doing IT support off and on for years with friends, family, friends of family members, etc.  Just last year I finally decided to get some formal training.  I'm just about done with my schooling (Internship in January and then home free!).  This just happened this morning as I got to the resource center (library) to do homework.  

A student asked for my help, she had made a pamphlet but when she prints it the second page doesn't print upside down.  I thought it was going to be an easy fix but then I saw what program she had used to make the pamphlet:  MS Word......WHY?!? WHY?!? WHY?!? don't they ever teach these students MS Publisher? I mean it sooo much easier to create and manipulate these things AND it takes care of making sure both pages are oriented correctly when printed.  So I bite my tongue and see if I can just rotate the content 180 degrees.  Nope.  Word won't let you rotate tables.  I think well if this were my printer at home I'd just print the two pages individually reinserting the paper to get the correct orientation, but this is a big laser copier/networked printer and I don't know how the paper gets oriented as it passes through.  So I think, well maybe I can save as a pdf and then manipulate the second page as a single object.  Nope, the school doesn't have the software to manipulate pdfs and I don't have the time to search for a cloud-based editor.  So I try bringing up the word document in publisher, only publisher f's up the formatting and spreads it out over 3 pages.  I'm starting to get frustrated.  Finally I have an epiphany (and believe me it hurt!):  Use the ""snipping"" tool to take a screen shot of the second page and save as a picture.  Word lets you rotate pics.  After making a copy of the document (don't want to screw up her hard work if it doesn't work).  I do this, delete all content on the second page, insert the pic, rotate it and viola it works!

7buve2,449,2017-11-09,Mr Pettigrew's Teddy Bear,Davi3s,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7buve2/mr_pettigrews_teddy_bear/,"Mr Pettigrew’s teddy bear was somewhat of a legend in my town.
Everybody knew Mr Pettigrew, and everybody knew about the small fluffy teddy bear that he kept in his classroom. 

I had first hand experience with the teddy bear when I first attended Montgomery Pre-School at the age of 6. I distinctly remember falling in love with the old bear as soon as I had been dropped off on my first day, just like every other kid. I had clung to my mother alot that morning, first in our front yard, then again in the car and most obviously, in the doorframe of Mr Pettigrew’s classroom. But once the old teacher had emerged for the first time, laying that soft bear into my arms, it was as though an untouchable safety net had been cast around me, protecting me from all evil and hurt.

Looking back now, I’m unsure how I warmed to it so much. The teddy bear itself was scruffy and looked extremely old fashioned. It was a rusty brown colour, with a small blue bow drawn on its left ear. Its right ear was always fraying to the point that it was barely even attached, and its mouth was simply an array of zigzags, courtesy of embarrassingly shoddy sewing. 

But the worst part were the eyes. Or should I say the two wide black buttons recklessly glued onto its face, mimicking eyes. They were far too large in proportion to the toy’s actual face, dominating atleast a third of its head. Even worse, it always felt as though there was a small red glow resting in one of them, almost as if a demonic presence was simmering within its body. Of course, this didn’t bother us much as kids, but the more we discussed it as we grew older, the more unsettling the idea became. 

Despite this, everybody loved Mr Pettigrew because of that teddy bear. 
So it came as a real shock when he passed away on a bitter December morning, only a few years after he had retired. 

By this time, I was fresh out of college, working as an intern at The Montgomery Police Academy. I specifically remember the moment I heard the news because I was filing some mind numbingly boring paperwork for my superior. 
I had overheard a conversation from across the room go something a little like this.

“You hear that old Pettigrew bit the bullet this morning.”

“You’re kidding me?”

“Nope, died in his sleep, poor sod. Hopefully that awful teddy bear died too?”

“Don’t be horrible! My youngest loved that man, said he was the kindest teacher she ever had.”

So that was that. 
Mr Pettigrew, Montgomery’s finest teacher had died suddenly in his sleep. The news spread quickly and that evening our local news company had even broadcasted a twenty minute memorandum remembering his ‘Immense teaching qualities’, ‘Dedication to Montgomery’ and his ‘Warm heart’.
It was lovely, really.
Although, I imagined we would mourn for a couple of days max, before resuming our lives as normal.

But that was not the case. In fact, the death of Mr Pettigrew would be nestled in our minds for much longer to come.

It was only a matter of days after he passed that the first death occured. Gina Randolph died on the 21st of December. She was found in her bedroom by her parents, her wrists slashed seventeen times. The cuts were so deep, they presumed that she had died of blood loss minutes after the first incision. The incident sent shockwaves across the local community.
Nobody could comprehend why a young girl who had everything going for her would just kill herself, only a few days before Christmas. 

Gina’s death was initially reported as a tragedy, just an unforgiving and terribly sad tragedy, and it wasn’t treated as suspicious. But just a few days later on Christmas Eve, it happened again.

Lee Salt, a young man who had graduated from law school the previous summer was found late in the morning, hanging from the door frame of his bedroom. He had used an old rusty bike chain that had lay forgotten among the junk in the families old shed at the bottom of their yard. Interestingly, It was revealed that somebody had desperately tried to break and enter the shed, evidenced by the broken window and unusual dents in the door. This was taken by the Salt family as clear evidence that Lee didn’t kill himself, that maybe he was murdered. But those suspicions were gently pushed aside and his death ruled as suicide just like Gina’s. Some agreed with his parents and petitioned for a curfew in Montgomery based on what his parents had said. Others nastily speculated that Lee was so desperately craving death, that he broke into his own shed just so he could end his life that much quicker.

But it wasn’t until the third and final death, the day after Christmas day that things started to get really strange. 

Clarissa Brookes had taken her car out late that night, telling her parents that she needed to get gas, but she never returned. Early the next morning a search party was employed and her body was found a few miles away. Clarissa was found slumped against her car on a small dusty backroad behind an isolated woodland area. She had stolen her father’s 9.1 millimetre and shot herself in the head three times. When she was discovered, her car’s engine was still chugging slowly. 

Much to the authorities’ surpise, Clarissa had driven in the opposite direction from the closest gas station, and there was nothing in her car that suggested she was trying to run away. However, there was one thing recovered from her car. Something that would eventually serve as the single most crucial piece of evidence throughout the whole investigation. 

From inside the passenger side’s glove compartment, a small crumpled piece of paper was recovered. Initially, the search party were confused. They simply couldn’t understand why Clarissa Brookes had left a blank piece of paper with nothing on it but a small sketch of a small brown teddy bear.

The discovery led to a lot of questions. But once a member of the search party joked that Mr Pettigrew’s teddy bear had killed her, an investigation was opened into a potential link between the loveable teacher and Clarissa’s tragic death.

This ridiculous investigation soon gathered speed until eventually poor Mr Pettigrew was posthumously being blamed for Lee’s death aswell, and sure enough by the new year, he had supposedly killed Gina too.

I refused to believe any of it, along with anybody else in Montgomery who had any ounce of decency and self respect.
And so naturally, the case went cold.
Of course it did. He was simply a scapegoat.

Until one day in late February when an unidentified person came forward purporting to have crucial information that the police simply had to know about. I overheard in the office one day that it involved critical evidence, evidence which would finally reveal the truth about absolutely everything from beginning to end, no exceptions.

But typically, the name of the person and what they had said was kept strictly confidential from the public, and the situation was no different for police interns like me. And this continued to be the case up until late June. When out of nowhere a meeting of ‘fundamental importance’ was scheduled by the Chief Inspector, requiring compulsory attendance with absolutely no exceptions.

So on the 23rd of June, the entirety of The Montgomery Police Force was bundled into one room. The boss, Chief Inspector Saunders stood up at the front of the room. He cleared his throat as the room breathed in anticipation. 

“Ladies and Gents… For the past few months we have been in the process of gathering crucial evidence in the case concerning the deaths of Gina Rudolph, Lee Salt and Clarissa Brookes. We are of course very grateful for your patience and concern. But the evidence we have been subject too is extremely sensitive, and we needed to make sure we had gone through absolutely everything before we jumped to any conclusions.”

He paused. 

“My friends, Mr Pettigrew was not the man may have known or heard about. Whether you believe it or not, he was a manipulative, evil and disgusting man.
As you might well recall, back in April, we had a young lady turn up at the station in an emotional wreck. She informed us that he had sexually assaulted her as a child, on multiple occasions.”

A collective gasp filled the room.

“She told us that she had put her childhood and Mr Pettigrew behind her, but when she heard his name in the news reports, it all came back to her. She was extremely scared, and she said that she deliberated for the longest time whether she even believed it herself. This took immense bravery, and since then we have received many more claims.
Currently, there are 54 individuals in the Montgomery area alone who claim to have been sexually harassed or assaulted by Mr Pettigrew during their time at Montgomery Pre-School. And we believe that list included Miss Rudolph, Miss Brookes and Mr Salt. We believe the guilt and suffering became too much for these three individuals when his name was introduced back into their lives, and they made the ultimate sacrifice.”

I was completely mesmerised, there had to be some kind of mistake. I saw a few others shaking their heads towards the front of the room

I think Saunders noticed this, because he subsequently turned and nodded at his colleague sat at a computer.

“Show them the tape.”

The lights were slowly dimmed and an old tape recording began to play on the whiteboard behind him.

The rustic recording was flakey and made a light crackling sound. But you could just about see the silhouette of a young child and hear muffled conversation between them and whoever was behind the camera.

“How are you today, [inaudible]?”

“Good.”

“I hope Mr Teddy Bear helped you with your math questions earlier?”

“Yes. Thanks Mr Teddy Bear.

“Good. Mr Teddy Bear thinks you look very handsome today. He likes your shiny red shoes.”

“Thanks.”

“Can Mr Teddy Bear see what’s under your shir-“

Saunders fumbled for the remote and quickly cut off the tape.

As the tape shut off, my mind began to scatter. An overwhelming sense of déjà vu lingered in my head. 

*What the fuck…*

I remembered having that exact conversation.

I remembered a how Mr Pettigrew had asked me to stay back at lunch one thursday because he said he was ‘lonely’ and ‘needed a friend’.

I remembered the shiny red shoes that I had begged my mom to buy me only a matter of days before.

The awful things that had happened that lunchtime.

No… There was no way… How the fuck did he film it? Even at that age I would have questioned it.

I felt sick to my stomach, and the room suddenly became a messy haze.

I groggily stood up, stumbling to the side and eventually collapsed onto the floor. People all around me began to comfort me, asking what was wrong. But I wasn’t paying any attention to them. I desperately scanned the room for a door, when my eyes met with a small security camera perched between the wall and ceiling. A small red glow slowly flickered where the lens was, almost as if a demonic presence was simmering within its body.

So back in May of 2017 I was laid off from my job and began receiving unemployment benefits.  Almost exactly 1 month after the lay off I began a 2 year paid internship program (eligible for engineering students in their last 2 years of their major) that eventually turns to a full time egineering position upon graduation, allowed me to work on a flexible schedule due to my school course schedule. During these summer months I was still eligible for unemployment benefits but the amount was adjusted depending on the amount of hours I worked that week for the internship. As the summer semester ended and fall semester began I took a temporary leave of absence since my fall schedule did not allow me to work. Since unemployment services saw my hours worked per week went from 20 to 0 they thought i was terminated from work and denied my unemployment benefits from continuing. I appealed the decision because I was not fired but the appeal was denied because  you are not eligible for unemployment benefits if you mutually agree with your employee to take a leave of absence. Not trying to get into a sob story but I have a wife and kids and the unemployment benefits were helping us pay for bills and our apartment.

What steps should I take when it comes to moving to higher level languages? I've had a handful of interviewers over the last year tell me that they're very impressed with my low level language experience but looking for someone with more high level experience. Should I just swallow my pride and take on an entry level position? Is there a field I can look into where I could find some middle-ground between low and high level to make my transition?

Can't seem to find any in my state either so I'm at a further disadvantage when applying out of state. 

I feel like my GPA and school are holding me back when people look at my applications since they see a 2.7 and a school that's unknown in a state full of amazing universities. I mean I had recruiters at career fairs straight up end conversations when I told them my gpa and two mock my choice in projects.

I'm not sure what else I can do, my resume isn't getting any better content wise, my gpa is basically locked behind 3.0 despite my lowest grade being a B- in the past 2 years and my lack of out of school experience is probably holding me back as well since I'm a 5th year senior. I thought my projects were a good choice, showing a strong grasp of more advanced programming concepts earlier on plus working with and contributing to API's but they seem to have come off as childish.

I'm currently a Sophomore in College studying Network Engineering, and I recently was invited to a second round of interviews with a bigger financial company. I'm very excited and I want to be sure I'm as well prepared as I can be.


I've just finished my first quarter at the school and am now completing my intro to networking course where we covered the OSI and TCP/IP models and their various layers.

I'm trying to prepare by going over the topics we learned so far which has generally been a brief overview of the TCP/IP stack and the common protocols concerning each layer. Subnetting was also covered but only in an IPV4 environment.

I wanted to ask the community here what I should expect in the technical interview. I was in the Army for 4 years and worked some customer positions but I've never been in an interview environment like this. So I'm not sure what to expect.

If anyone has some similar experiences that they can share that would be great.

7bwwy9,18,2017-11-09,Computer science and my spiral into major depression,Blupoh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7bwwy9/computer_science_and_my_spiral_into_major/,"Hi Reddit; Internet. This should probably go in /r depression but oh well. I had a somewhat bad and peculiar day. I am writing this on a whim, as I have no one or any where else to turn to. I woke up today from a reoccurring nightmare I have had for many years. My depression medication makes my dreams very vivid, making it all feel real, and I find myself waking up in cold sweats when they occur, and all my energy is just gone. I will save you the details of these nightmares, but they share a similar theme: My friends (letting them down, disappointing someone, being abandoned) and school (missing a deadline, bad grade, big project, being trapped). 

I started university right out of High school 7 years ago at WWU. I wanted to study a natural science like biology, maybe a minor in music as I studied the violin and piano for 10 years prior. But nothing really fell into place. I ended up taking a lot of math classes just to have a foundation for my pursuit into a science. Then I took an introduction course to computer science, just to fill in some credits. Its not that I never had an interest in this subject because I do love video games, and play a wide variety because of the art and the technical craft behind it. At the back of my mind, this was the field of study that was hot and employers wanted. I had absolutely no programming knowledge going into this class, and I really struggled, but I passed it with hardwork and dedication, and I came out very fascinated by code itself so I pursued it. This excitement however, was short lived. The next course was a so called ""weed out"" class, and I found myself spending every school day in the lab, hammering out assignments after assignment, with  new road blocks and problems with each new deadline. Sometimes I wouldn't have a clue on how to even start to code something so seemingly simple. But again, through hard work and just the sheer amount of time put into it, I too passed this class. That was the end of the second year at WWU and that was only my second programming class just because the classes were very hard to get into due to demand. And so starts the 3rd year. This is supposedly the year which you declare your major, but I have only taken 2 CS classes, I took my third programming class, the one that focuses on object oriented programming. This was where everything truly started falling apart. First assignments were already difficult, supposedly really easy, but I didn't find them to be a breeze at all like all my classmates. Got a D- on my midterm, despite all my time spent in the lab and talking with the professor. I am a good student right? no. The third lab was just impossible for me, it is the lab where you fill in a rectangle of varying sizes with tetranomes with recursive calls, and despite my all my time in the lab and the effort put in to solve this thing, it will remain the only CS assignment I will have never completed to this day. I saw someone complete it in an hour time. Was I doing something wrong? What am I not understanding? Am I not smart? Fuck do I even belong in this class? In college? Around these people?  Despite this, I somehow passed. Maybe I pestered the professor too much. I took physical and noticeable tole on my body, from the sheer amount of stress it took to complete this course on top of another rigorous course. So I took a break from CS the next quarter, but I noticed this pain simply continued and never let up. Come spring, I was barred from registering for classes for the next fall quarter. Why? too many credits and no declared major. WELL FUCKING DUH IF ITS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CS COURSES WITHOUT ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE CLASS THAT IS THE PREREQ. So I transferred to UW CS program at the end of that year, with no real reason, direction or enthusiasm, just to get the hell out I guess, just to say my time was maybe worth a damn for something.

In fall 2014, a new school, new classes, same shit. At this point I have fallen deeper and deeper into my depression, I just haven't realized it yet. This next programming course was the  dreaded CS 305 at UW tacoma. Very rigorous, fast paced, programming intensive and the gateway to all the upper level courses for computer science students. This is where you make or break as a CS major, and guess what? I passed it. How? All my waking hours in the lab, in office, studying and programming. And I broke. Right after thanksgiving break, I saw the school health counselor. Something has been wrong with me this quarter, this last year, this last 4 years, 8 years, 11 years, since childhood. It was the first time I ever told anybody anything about how I felt. About my stress, anxiety and dread about being in school and how unfit I am to be a CS student, among my peers that are all extremely smart and can breeze through these courses easily. I dreaded being in school everyday. I wake up and go to class and stay into the evening at the lab, watching others be successful in their study or pursuit into internships and career opportunities. I truly did not belong here. Not among these people who are so smart. Them: check out this search engine I made and im presenting to Microsoft. Me: Help fix my null pointer exception. segmentation faults. Impostor syndrome? No. I really am the impostor. The following fall quarter of the next year I got an official diagnosis of depression. I was at an all time low. I would stay up to 6am doing nothing, wake up at 2 for my 3 oclock class crying, I was unable to complete any programming work to any degree of success at this point, I was unable to sit down and focus let alone a problem, but I pushed through lighter electives like I always have with the most bare minimum. I took a medical leave for winter and was on medication (zolaf). Even returning to school in Spring right after, I was still not all there, this field continued to be unrewarding as always. Remember why I had some interest in this field? For the art of the craft. UX design. Human interaction focus design. There is a grand total of 1 class. Everything else wants you to program first. The higher elective classes are group project based, and this is my chance in which I can show everybody how bad I am at programming. Great /s. And it really got to me to a point I just had to grit my teeth through every waking moment. I felt terrible when I just could not contribute. When all the work fell on others to pick up my sorry excuse as a student . I took another medical leave and break starting this summer, so I can  file hardship withdrawal on courses I had no capacity of even taking. And that brings me to today I have been out of school for 6 months and still on break as advised by my CS adviser to recover and get well. This morning, I get a call from a recruiter from Revature, a tech company. He said that he saw my linkedin account (which I haven't touched in 3 years) and noticed I finished my degree earlier this year. I told him I actually had 1 class left (which I do, Computer architecture), and he said to contact him again if I am interested after completing the degree. And that thought of completing school lingered and I just...started to cry, like I have simply forgotten why I am in this state and why I am here right now, and with this call and nightmare combined has simply reminded me of all these horrible things and trauma from school. These 6-7 years in college and still no degree, a feeling of lost and hopelessness in myself. Everything, yet nothing.

So I am here, and I don't know what to do. I am on this impasse, and my CS adviser is expecting to hear from me soon (she is aware of my problem) I thought I was getting better, but that really is not the case. Going back to school really scares me, and I'm just at a complete lost of what to do next.

Thanks for reading. "

I'm a sophomore/jr in uni, and I live an hour away from campus. I'm looking to move out next semester and into the city, where I'll be closer to campus and possible internships. 

My first option is to move out near campus. The average rent would cost me around $500 including utilities, that is if I really find a small, cheap place to stay with a roommate. I would be in the city, closer to my university campus and internships, and it's the city- there's things to go, you know? The problem is, I've been struggling a lot with depression lately and I've had anxiety attacks at work and I'd either be sent home or my job would be kind enough to look the other way if I couldn't show up, or I show up late. I know I'd have to really push myself to make rent every month. I'm looking to move out with my best friend (as she's the only one I know who is actually looking to move out) but she's my only friend really and I worry that being around her all the time may ruin our friendship (i've heard stories about how it's not a good idea to move out with best friends). 

The second option is I move in with my friends. Rent would be about $300 in a really small house between 4 people. Moving out with them, I'd shave off about 15-20 minutes of driving, but that still leaves about 30-45 minutes every day for school. I wouldn't be too stressed or pressured to make rent because 300 is fairly solid, and I'd keep my job, who have been working with me due to my situation/home life/depression. The only downside is I'm still in the same town I've lived in all my life, and I sometimes wonder if this is a good idea, because moving out is supposed to be a fresh start for me. I'd still be pretty fair from campus, too. 

Any advice/experiences other people have with moving out/college experience would truly be helpful."

I just received the news that my interview with LinkedIn last week went well and I am in the team match phase.

My co-op advisor is also aware. The co-op will last 6 months, and the internship will be 3 months. 

My instinct tells me I shouldn't renege, because it's much worse than politely declining an offer, not just for my career but also out of ethical reasons. I also would actually prefer a 6-month experience because I've never done any software engineering internship / job before and want the extra exposure. That being said, it's hard to ignore the LinkedIn name - I feel like it has a better reputation... I do not know where I will be happier or where I will learn the most, if anyone has had experience with either company, would love to hear your perspective.

7bycnm,64,2017-11-09,Here's my technique for how I handle feeling overwhelmed with work,ravagedbanana,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7bycnm/heres_my_technique_for_how_i_handle_feeling/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share how I personally handle feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities. For context, I was only recently been diagnosed with ADHD this year, but I've been struggling with it for most of my life. As a third year college student at a highly competitive school, this technique has kept me from drowning in an endless river of responsibilities.

We've all been there: You have a research paper due in a week, and a project due tonight. Meanwhile, everyone else is applying for internships, and the pressure is slowly mounting. (Figuratively me right now) You feel paralyzed in a positive feedback loop of anxiety; you don't want to do your assignment because you know the paper that will take tons of time (and well, working sucks), but you don't want to start on the paper because you have more urgent responsibilities, and you *definitely* won't be prepping for interviews. What do you do instead? Whatever you do to procrastinate and get that instant dopamine fix until you finally crack under panic and shit out some half-assed work.

How do I avoid this? The technique's simple. ***Procrastinate on larger tasks by working on smaller tasks, and interest yourself in your work.*** [As somebody with ADHD, I've come to understand that I'm just fundamentally wired differently than other people.](http://www.oaktreecounselor.com/blog/adult-adhd-lazy) As somebody with ADHD, you crave dopamine in a way that others don't. Why don't you stop fighting who you are, and instead reframe your responsibilities in a way that appeals to your own desires for interest and novelty? This sounds counterintuitive, but I honestly believe that I find things boring not because they are intrinsically boring, but because they are *work*. Honestly, is browsing reddit for 5 hours really that much more exciting?

I guess when it comes down to it, the ""technique"" is just the same as the advice to [start with small items first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhFQA998WiA). However, this way of rephrasing the problem is much more personally relevant, because I find that it's near-impossible for me to work on the things that I *should* be doing, but when I'm procrastinating, I can hyperfocus on the same task for DAYS. In the end, I'm still procrastinating on something, but at least I'm getting *something* done. It's the lesser of two evils.

Take my example. Researching European literature for an afternoon sounds overwhelming, but in comparison, this computer science project is so much more fun. I'll put off the research paper and get my gratification by working on the easier, smaller project. Now that that's one, I know that I need to apply for internships and prep eventually, but that sounds like mind-numbingly boring work. Why not do some reading for the paper for the time being? After all, some old dude's ideology sounds way more interesting than filling out forms. Finally, once my paper is done, I can finally relax and work through some interview questions, knowing that I don't have any other responsibilities hanging over your head.

**TL;DR: Procrastinate by being productive, be productive by procrastinating.**"

I learned a lot and now have a few projects to show. Some of my cohort mates already landed junior positions right out of bootcamp.

I feel like I still want to go back and do CS, which means I can really only be applying for internships rather than full time. But the problem is, most companies looking for interns are only looking for those in a 4 year degree program. What should I do in this situation? I've applied to a few places and have either been rejected or ghosted. How can I stand out or convince them to even give me an interview? Or have any of you been in a similar situation where you got internships without a relevant degree? I should also mention, I'm in Canada and am willing to relocate within NA for a role.

Thanks!"

For the past few months since then I have been looking for jobs. Whether it be I.T, Computer Science related or just Game Design I have applied in all technical fields. Before graduating, I tried my hands on getting internships but that didn't prove fruitful either. I have worked on side projects throughout college too. However when it comes to getting a job and all, they all tell me that I don't have enough experience. 

I have submitted my resume for review as well, and most people tell me, that for my level it seems fine (even though they also point out the lack of experience). I am starting to run out of places to look (I'm currently looking at state and county jobs at the assistant I.T. levels and hoping it gets me a job at least).

How do I stay motivated?  It would be great if some of y'all shared stories of your struggles as well.

Thank you all."

As a freshman I am trying to figure out a game plan for the next 4 years and what goals I need to meet in the time to come. I want to start as early as possible so I can learn and expereince as much as I can. I've already gone to 3 different banking seminars/forums this semester that my university has hosted just to experience how top level finance guys operate. I also plan to rush a business fraternity for the networking oppurtunities in the future. 

Anyways, I was wondering what are some things that I should be focusing on right now? I joined my schools investment group which will help with internship oppurtunities. What can I do to increase my chances of landing an internship? 

Also I will be going to breakfast/lunch events with banks and firms in the future to practice networking. I have an idea how networking works but would love to hear some tips.

I feel like this post is kinda all over the place but just looking for tips on how I can succeed early on. Thanks. 

Also if you have any recommendations of books about IB/Finance/Networking I would love to hear them. Networking especiialy. "

I really feel as I have no where to go and no where to relate I feel so so incredibly lost and I am so scared for my future .  I feel as I have little accomplishments to be proud of . Seeing kids my age graduate from college and winning these awards makes me feel like complete Shit. I do not know one bit of programming but it is what I want to pursue and I’ve tried in the past but I’ve never grasped it , I always always try to find a tutorial from scratch but all of them are way too advanced for me despite the begging warning . All I know how to do is play softball , download illegal  games from Pirate Bay, and play Xbox and I have a steam account  and I like rust   ....?? I am an incredible writer (though it doesn’t show here ) but the one thing I love I do not even know about ? It’s incredibly frustrating I know it’s what I want to do theirs no doubt about that but I just want to start NOW , not later I want to start now but I really have no idea what to do , I’ve tried getting into internships but I am far way too young even for the high school ones , and YouTube videos are way too difficult to grasp I always ask “ why why why “ I am never content with just going along . Scratch is far way too kiddy and easy for me it frustrates me .  My dream job is google and my dream school is Harvard , I believe I can achieve my dreams I’m just stuck and I really need some advice . I’m completely stuck and confused .

I was thinking of being a white hat hacker but I’m just unsure , all I know is I want to work with computers , I Am a fast learner I have the motivation, drive , the energy  I’m a natural fast learner I just don’t know what to learn or what to do. 
I want to make an achievement something to set me apart from everybody so hopefully google or Harvard will be able to notice me ( I sound so gullible hah) but theirs nothing special about me really . I am an amazing public speaker and I have all these little things about me but nothing big really no big achievements . I’m just truly frustrated how I am good at everything that doesn’t interest me but the one thing I love I can’t figure out how to do? .  

I know it’s what I want to do I won’t change my mind , I am stubborn enough already , I just want to be the best at what I do .  Not the best I can be , but the best in my field . I have no limits or boundaries except my lack of research despite the hundreds of hours I’ve done researching . I’m simply
stuck.  I just wish I’ve started earlier so I wouldn’t have to be struggling now . I can’t relate to anybody everybody around me wants to either be a doctor or cosmetologist. And google is so so highly competitive and so is Harvard . Yikes.! I want to make connections somewhere somehow to get me ahead but my options are very limited due to my school not having a single interest upon that nor my family / friends aghhjjg .

The problem arises with balancing school work with the internship, since I have class 4 days a week.  They specifically said 20-30 hours a week at Workiva would be optimal.I'm worried about being stretched too thing between school and now work.

Even if I left each class on campus and headed to work at every moment, I would be at 16 hours a week..

1.) Should I consider dropping a class (which ideally would not set me back a semester) so that I can spend more time at the internship this spring?

2.) Should I be worried that they will rescind the offer I signed if I can only work 16 hrs/week?

3.)What is the best way to ensure I get brought back on this summer full time as an intern?"

(long)",Nothingtonamehere,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7c0bay/il_adultmalei_was_attacked_but_i_was_the_one/,"I will give as much detail as possible as this is ongoing, but I need some advice. First off the story as concise and accurate as possible. I was choked after a verbal disagreement. No threats were made during the disagreement it was just a heated conversation that the other participant couldn't handle and got physical. Without warning I was being choked. Knowing the person I gave them a chance to let go after about 3-5 second of being choked. I did not retaliate and they let go as I showed open palms during this incident. After they let go, however they were stilled upset and began to gallop towards me. Now to lay some context in place this person has been convicted of a felony and has been arrested multiple times for being violent. Once coming towards me he looked as if he was going to swing with his fists raised. I had no choice but to defend myself as the nearest exit was far enough away that running wasn't a choice. I did not hit the other person super hard (at least within my own personal opinion of how hard I can hit). I struck them twice in the face, however it was not enough and I got pummeled pretty hard for not going any harder. I was bit multiple times and I sustained other injuries. I was humiliated during the altercation as they spit tobacco on me when I was down defenseless. Anyways after the altercation I was asked to leave by a third party person who owned the property. Then I was begged me not to call the police. I have known these people for a long time and they have hurt me before... I am used to not calling the police. I have been the victim of abuse in so many ways since I was a young child by this person and many others that not getting the police involved was normal for me. Also, it has always been put in perspective that if I called the police this person would go to prison again and it would be my fault not theirs. At the time I still listened to them. I believed that it was my fault for their wrong doing. Any time I've been hit or verbally abused I've been lead to believe that it is my fault for being who I am. So... once they begged me not to call the police I didn't. I gathered my things and left the property. I did go to the ER to get the bite marks checked out. The police questioned me, but I was told to go separate ways and let it go so i denied to comment. 24 hours later I received a phone call from their county police station. This county has an interesting way of getting the whole story. Apparently the other party went to the police after asking me not to, so now I had this ""local"" warrant out for my arrest. The warrant was only allowed to be carried out in that specific county, and I live far away so they couldn't arrest me. The person then filed a civil order of protection. Fast forward to recently I fought the O.P. and won. It was denied in my favor. (i have no criminal history and the burden of proof was not given by the petitioner properly). However, promptly afterwards I was arrested and thrown in jail... (even the judge seemed confused as to why I was being arrested as no one told them this was going to happen apparently.. I may be wrong on this as it's speculation). they were going to book me for three days since there was a holiday or something. Luckily someone was looking out for me and had a last second bond set for me and I did make it out. I had to spend every penny so far that I have defending myself and to pay bond. The police refused to let my attorney be present during the time they asked me questions (I refused to answer anything). They also refused to let me make a phone call when I was in the jail cell. How were they able to arrest me without knowing the full story? The charges are from the states attorney. The charge is also incorrect as it states I am being charged for strangulation... In court during the O.P. hearing it was given information that I was the one choked. Why isn't this information being used? Why do the have a false charge? I have a clean record as I have never gotten in trouble. In fact I am a late college student who is doing internships and doing well in school. The states attorney is going charging me with a felony for something I was a victim of, let alone for it being my first suspected offense ever. This states attorney states on their linkedin and their webpage how they have a 91% conviction rate for all violent felony charges.  I have a decent attorney, but I am worried they aren't taking this seriously enough and I need to do some outreach work on my own. Would it be appropriate to seek help from a senator or house member? any organizations? Is there anything I can do...? Or do I sit still and just gamble on a 9% change of charges being dropped... I have evidence of my defense and what happened.

SIDE NOTE: This does not pertain to the main story, but another question I have. When being booked I was mocked by one of the police officers. When I was being asked questions like ""am I a homosexual, do I have suicidal thoughts, do I have medical problems""... This police office was saying yes to things like suicide and that I had mental health issues and that I am homosexual. There isn't any problem with people who have those issues, but I said no as he would say yes and laugh. What the hell? Oh and I had to watch videos, and sign documents on prison rape.... I wasn't aware that I was in prison yet. Really a garbage situations and I am pretty upset. Keeping it together though.  Thank you to everyone who reads my convoluted story. 

edit: is there any way to bump this?"

7c2goe,2,2017-11-10,Negotiating salary for transiting from intern to full time at an MSP?,Jimisacun,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7c2goe/negotiating_salary_for_transiting_from_intern_to/,"Asked this over at /r/personalfinance but figured I'd ask here too

I've been an ""intern"" at a small MSP for about 5 months ago. We have about 40 company clients and are steadily growing. I've been making $15/hour as an intern, and I'm the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happen to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I do mostly help desk work but also go to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 75% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field, or at least for my MSP. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week.
I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians"". There is not really a set in stone L1, L2, etc. I do both kinds of work

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000

As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?

or is this a reasonable offer for an MSP?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including, or if I shouldn't bother asking for more

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

      I am an undergrad computer science major at CU Boulder.   I still have over a year and a half left for my degree to be finished but am already thinking about when I get out and the job search.   Something that I have come to realize from my schedule is that I will have little if any time for an internship which I know can be a big help in this field.   So I want to work on some individual projects before I graduate to have stuff to show people, and I think it could be fun.   

My question is what kind of projects would be the most relevant for somebody who is interested in going into either computer systems type of positions or hopefully(but possibly not straight out of school since they all want experience) security analysts or any kind of security positions?   What would appear valuable to these kinds of positions?   I know if you want to be a dev then building apps and programs is a good way to go but I don't believe this is really the most relevant here.  Also, it doesn't seem like many of the people around me like systems and aren't interested in going that route so I don't hear many ideas.   

What I'm hoping to get out of this post is just a list of either fun (and relevant) projects some of you might have done, or want to do.  Also, maybe a good starting point, and shove in the right direction towards the information I need to get started would be extremely helpful.   Thank you for everyone's time.

7c4fd7,90,2017-11-10,Something happened in the woods,HB_CamTech,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7c4fd7/something_happened_in_the_woods/,"Howdy Reddit, I work as a camera technician for a ghost hunters esque tv show yet to be released which is going to be centered around some supposedly haunted forest in Eastern Europe. I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t reveal the name of the program for legal reasons and of course I’ll change all the names, but I promise everything that happened in this post is from my own experience.

I would like to preface by saying that this story isn’t nearly as interesting as some of the others I’ve seen from my cursory glance of this subreddit, and yet I still don’t feel well at all thinking back on last week. I was originally planning on forgetting about this but after a quick long distance call to my therapist, I’ve learned that writing all this out may make me feel a bit better. Since I’m writing all this from a motel with god awful WiFi, sorry if this shows up at a real late hour, you know ‘cause of time zone differences and all that jazz. But I digress, let’s get to the juicy stuff. Let’s get to what you came here for.

On the first day of filming prep, Me and the crew arrived at a small, crowded airport. The shows producer, director, and star (we’ll call him Rob) decided to shove past me because he felt he had to be first to the luggage. I’m almost sure I heard him muttering something under his breath about how these are “untrustworthy people” and that he didn’t want any of them “swiping his luggage”. I personally felt a little embarrassed to be seen with this guy in public. Me and the rest of the film crew complacently waited for the luggage belt to become less congested and we were on our way.

The first order of business was to get some grub. We stopped off at a cute little cafe where an infuriatingly pleasant elderly couple made us some pretty tasty sandwiches. Our editor (I’ll name her Caroline), struck up a conversation with the couple which I understood pretty much none of. There I sat, thinking about how much work I had put into my high school Spanish classes all to be stuck in verbal darkness for what could possibly be the next 6 months of my life. It’s funny how things hardly ever turn out the way they need to, and nobody bats an eye at any of it, at how horrible things happen and we’re just expected to climb over the newly planted hurdle in our path.

Other than that lunch was nice.

By the time we finished eating it was around 5ish, and our sleep deprived selves were exhausted. After checking into the motel I’m currently writing from, we each trudged up to our respective rooms and got settled in for the night. I turned the radiator on and put my sheets over it to warm them up. While I waited I realized how close this motel actually was to the forest. The sun was beginning to set and in the distance I saw it’s iconic figure. I could see why locals were afraid of this place, a great sickly dark green mass of uncertainty where people feel just a hint of their primeval instincts, attempting to keep them safe and scared in the face of uncertainty. Why are places like this so innately terrifying. We fear lions because their ancestors were our enemies in humanities vulnerable stages, but there’s something so specially unnerving about these wooden spires, adorned with long, slender growths tipped with soft, fleshy green. 

The sheets were probably done. I was putting them back on the bed while spacing out into the forest. I noticed what I assume were the headlights of a car, bobbing between the trees. The lights were mesmerizing, and they were gone. That night, I dreamt.

I am stumbling 
out of the woods towards the town, 
it’s early morning. 
My stomach.
My belly was sick
Sick 
with someone else’s blood.
There is something 
I’m running from from
Something 
Oh god, I've misbehaved haven’t I

And I was in my bed again. Grateful I was free from that distress. Time to film.

We all crowded into our rental van and made our way it of town. Buildings fell away into farmland which itself eventually devolved into a simple, rural landscape. I looked ahead and saw it quickly approaching, that looming congregation of trees hiding anything and everything beyond their thick wooden mess. Thick, brown, calcified cylinders tangling their long fingers and reaching up into the cosmos.
We parked our car on the edge of the woods, grabbed our equipment from the trunk, and began our trek. First off, they had me set up some tripod cams. I began placing them in miscellaneous areas of our path. I set one next to our van looking in on the woods, one looking down a hiking trail, and the final camera placed in front of some old shack Rob would say is a “paranormal hotspot” to the audience. Along we these, all the actors carried cameras with them. By the time all that was done it was getting pretty dark and we decided it was time to get filming. Caroline retreated back to the van where she had equipment set up to watch all the camera feeds remotely. The rest of the group and I wandered deep inside.

“Rolling”
“Hey there all you paranormal enthusiasts! Tonight, we’re gonna make supernatural history!”
“A bold claim, Rob”, I muttered to myself from behind the camera, as the sun was slowly masticated by the gluttonous trees.

Filming went as planned for the next two hours or so, with Rob and his unpaid interns reacting  to the smallest snap of a branch like an underpaid B-horror movie actor. And then we found it, the clearing. Somewhere in the middle of the woods, this perfect circle with absolutely no trees, no foliage, not even any weeds. The treeline stopped abruptly at the edge. Maybe out of reverence, maybe out of fear.
Upon entering the clearing I immediately felt car sick. I had to focus on my footsteps solely to keep from throwing up. Even Rob wasn’t his charismatic self. No commentary. Just a wide eyed tension, as if he was walking through a minefield, and a foot in the wrong place could lead to instant, thoughtless, obliteration. We stopped in the middle of the circle. I waited for Rob to start back up with his talking, 

but he didn’t,
None of us did.

That's when the camera detected motion.
The camera.
The one I had set up looking in on the woods. The feed showed absolutely nothing and yet all of us were glued to the screen. Now cam two.
Again nothing. Nothing. Cam three. Nothing.

Wait.
My heart sank as I realized the camera was focused in now on a different location than before, on for figures huddled together around some lights in a clearing.
On us.
I hesitantly looked up into the woods, the sliver I still had of my primal self whispering for me not to. I made eye contact with the trees.
Silence.

*BWEEEEEE*

Oh god.

One of the interns tries to silence the feedback coming from their walkie-talkie.
EEEEEEEEEEE
Rob starts yelling at the intern to turn it off. He stands up quickly, accidentally unplugging and knocking over nearly all of our lights and equipment.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
My flashlight begins rolling along the ground and almost barely lighting up something in the distance.
An intern begins having an asthma attack.
What is it!
What the hell is it!


Pale

Then the earth swallowed Rob. 

I scrambled for the flashlight and shone it on where he stood. Just a hole. A perfectly circular hole. Shining the light down it, I found Rob, clinging to the edge with trembling white fingers. I helped him out and made sure he was doing alright while the intern finally just took the batteries out of the walkie-talkie. He had some minor scratches but other than that he was fine. The hole must have been nearly invisible to us in the dark. Rob managed to stutter out that he thinks he dropped his camera down there. I shone a light into the hole. The sides were completely smooth, definitely not made from the same material. The hole stretched so far down I couldn’t see the camera. Luckily we had a live feed going to Caroline’s Laptop in the van.

The walk back seemed to drag on for hours and we all gave a collective sigh of relief upon seeing the van through the trees. I explained everything that happened to Caroline who didn’t seem much up for discussion as she looked equally as pale as the rest of us.
The drive back to the motel was done in a solemn sort of silence. We all muttered our respective good nights to each other and went up to our rooms.
I was rather exhausted and managed to fall asleep without even talking my clothes off.
Yet another dream.

I’m in town
No one else
I’m guilty
I hear my mother 
call to me
It’s not her

I woke, rolling over to the alarm clock on the dresser.

4:00 AM

I tried to swallow and found my throat bone dry. I got up and walked out of my room to the ice machine at the end of the hall. I saw light streaming out from under Caroline’s door. She was reviewing and editing the footage. I made my drink and fell back to sleep. In the morning we all clamored into Caroline’s room to review the footage. She was obviously sleep deprived, after all she had been reviewing that footage all night. Caroline put her laptop on a small coffee table and we all gathered around it with food out chairs. She began clicking a pen nervously as she explained how some of the footage wasn’t usable because the data got corrupted. Rob grave her a dirty look as if it was her fault. She started pulling up the footage and we all began peering into the small screen. The clicking stopped and I noticed red in the corner of my eye.
A small circle of blood was pooling on the table around Caroline’s fidgeting hands.

“Um, Caroline, I think you’re bleeding.”
She looked down at her shaking hands. She had pushed the pencil about an inch into the palm of her left hand. I got a napkin and one of the interns got some bandages from downstairs as the blood began to drip off the table and onto the carpet.

We decided not to finish watching the footage.

I guess that takes us to me writing this right now. I hope you guys found my distress fun to read about and please let me know if you wanna hear what happens after we continue filming next week.

I am an IT intern doing basic desktop support. I've been an intern for 6 months now and they don't have any desire to let me leave, yet also no idea to when I transition from intern to employee. One of our main admins who dealt with the communication and phone systems left without notice and we have a bit knowledge hole in our department. People are tying to pick up where he left and take on more responsibilities, yet no one has touched any of the voip or phone systems he worked on. I was wondering if it would be alright if I asked my boss if I could help tackle some responsibilities in this area to help out. Some of our tech we use is Ice call center and plantronics phones/skype for business. I'm not asking to become the next communications admin, but just to help hold down the fort and get some new experience in till they can hire a new full time admin (their main plan at the moment). Would this be a bad thing to ask for and to have possible training as an intern? Thanks."

One of the internship has minimum wage pay but the work seems interesting and their is a good social aspect to it (i.e weekly football, social outings, poker etc...). I have asked people who did the internship here before and they all enjoyed it and recommended it. 

The other offer is another place with interesting work. However the pay here is noticeably a lot more than the other internship. It is however further away, I have to get 2 buses to get to, so add another 20-30 mins to my trip as opposed to the first one. Not sure about the social aspect of it and havent found anybody who has done an internship here for a review.

So my question is what internship should I choose? I'm kind of torn between the two. Many thanks in advance"

I interned at a startup and a big-4 company already. I recently got an offer to work at a major and established unicorn / big N (that will IPO soon) and at another big-4 job (different one), and I'm having trouble deciding which one I should take. It was advised to me to take both (back-to-back in the summer and in the fall), but I feel like at this point I should just graduate and just choose one summer internship. I've already missed an entire school year doing internships during the school year, and taking another semester off to deal with mental-health issues, further delaying my graduation.  I also don't feel like my resume needs more padding, and I'm also afraid that I'll be missing out if I don't go full-time earlier. I also feel uncomfortable that it would delay my graduation again, and I would have graduated from a bachelor's six years after I started.

I guess I'm wondering what people's opinions are about taking a long time to graduate when you're already a year older than everybody else you came in with (I took a gap year), whether or not it's worth it to take an internship if the sole reason is that I'm not sure which company to work for and scared that I will regret a decision. I'm also seeking opinions on whether or not it matters if I started working full-time 4 months later than initially intended, and if a company will retract my offer if I do graduate 4 months later than initially mentioned"

I'm fairly new to reddit, but I've spent a good chunk of my past couple weeks on this sub and have gotten some great advice from you all. So thank you. My situation might be similar to those of you out there, so I thought I might share and hopefully others can also benefit from this. 

I originally studied Biology at mid-tier UC (UCSB, UCD, or UCI) before switching to CS at the end of my third year because I was unsure if I wanted to go the medical school route and my entire family lineage has never worked in an industry that is not engineering. 

Truth be told, I disliked CS with a passion because I wasn't used to having to actually produce results, where in bio, I just studied the night before and kept a 3.5, and I sucked because I didn't put the time into it. Fast forward, I finished all my CS courses to graduate by the end of my 5th year. Because I switched in late, I was taking a lot of classes out of order and did what I had to do to pass my classes without going insane (piggyback off my classmates for assignments - surprisingly I did better on the exams than classmates almost every time). I graduated this summer, and during my first round of applications, I only heard back from two companies, both of which were through referrals. I also knew I sucked ass at programming or anything technical/CS related and was applying because I was otherwise going to be sitting on my ass doing nothing. I was lucky to get a couple interviews but low and behold, I f***ed both of them up (one with Big N and another decent company). It sucks because those were good opportunities, but I also am thankful because I won't have any fear going into future interviews.

I have since turned things around, and I actually realllly enjoy computer science (it really has only been about a month/month and a half). I've attended a hackathon and learned JavaScript (and other stuff) because I want to make apps with ideas coming from ways I can improve my life that is not already offered or done in other apps (and to not only be proficient in python). 

I was wondering..do any of you know actual companies who are willing to take on graduates as interns who didn't have the opportunity to do internships while in school? I have a ton of leadership experience but no professional/tech experience.

Thanks in advance :)"

Three month rotation with security operations team. (This was an autonomous full time term-limited role with a purpose similar to an internship.) Due to the exposure and responsibilities, alumni exit with the requisite abilities to perform an IT Director role for a small company.

Credentials: I had a CCNA routing/switching until August, CompTIA Sec+ a couple of years ago. Associates Degree in InfoSec / Assurance (majority of courses Cisco Network Admin). 
Skills: In addition to solid networking knowledge, and those required by the jobs I've held (Linux, All OS troubleshooting, Server Admin), I have researched security concepts, read security blogs and books regularly, and dabbled in penetration testing for around 5 years. So I have a pretty decent entry level grasp of platform and network IT sec. Also, basic Python and Javascript programming experience. 
  
That said, does anyone have a particular suggestion for what kind of role my qualifications would make me a good candidate for? I love Linux, solving problems, learning new technology, and especially security. Always on the lookout for an entry level InfoSec job. They are few and far between, but this is my dream career. Doing more self study in security every day. Any other general advice? I know my short tenure in each of these roles is a limiting factor in general.

The general saying is that, 


""The big 4s do not distinguish between positions! They will hire a Software Engineer; which by definition will mean they're smart enough to work in other fields also!""


and also, all companies focus VERY much on core fundamentals. I would like to know why even for a Data Science intern positions in EVERY COMPANY, INCLUDING THE BIG4 AND COMPANIES APART FROM THE BIG4, there is always a Data Structures and Algorithms round?

I am considering emailing the employee who sent me the offer and asking if it would be possible to work in a field more related to CS/Programming like the software engineering position.

 It's worth pointing out that I got this offer from a job fair type of event and I believe I won them over with my interviewing and likeability  more-so than raw achievements. My GPA is subpar at the moment and my transcript has some ugly blunders from a few years ago at a previous college.

Here is a story about first “real” job after having finished my university degree within finance and management. 

Please comment and ask some critical questions to help me reflect on the situation I got into. 

Also I would like to know how to sell myself in the future. 

My entry to the company

In August 2016 I started to work in a larger European diary company and started in the Scandinavian headquarter in Stockholm that is responsible for the product milk. Julius and Romeo hired me as an intern. Julius is the CEO of the business unit and is a very confident man with a MBA from Harvard. In his unit he had Romeo to lead the project department, this for example entails to take ideas and make them market ready. 

A year ago, Romeo received the assignment to make one idea market ready and he hired me as an intern so support him in the process. In the beginning of my entry I felt very excited because Romeo enabled me to being an entrepreneur in larger conglomerate. He had an endless backlog of tasks and I received the mandate to solve them solely. By that I mean tasks such as developing a go-2-market strategy, developing product requirements, developing the value proposition and doing pricing. 

Also the supervision was extremely well organized. In the beginning Romeo and I had brief but very frequent talks in order to align. This was very helpful because we both needed to build trust. After a month or two I was so deep in the project that I did not require so much supervision anymore so Romeo trusted me to drive the business development of the product. Through Romeo I received great reputation in the business unit and Julius also started to give me some lightweight tasks that I mastered. 

My internship however was limited to a specific time period. Romeo and I had few good talks about my future, and he hoped that I would continue in the company. 

As such I was not reluctant to stay in the company as I had a great time and enjoyed the both Julius and Romeo as they were excellent boss’s. However I wanted to move to Copenhagen to go back to my friends and girlfriend. 

Luckily we had an operational site in Copenhagen, both Julius and Romeo talked with the local director in Copenhagen and they gave me the opportunity to start in Copenhagen.

The transfer to Copenhagen

In February 2017 Niklas the local director hired me.  I received the task to continue on the business development of the product that worked on in Stockholm and to work on some corporate development tasks. That meant that I closely with the sales department looked into sales targets and strategic partners. Together with one sales manager we created meetings with top clients and interesting partners for the product. 

Having talked to Romeo, he was very excited. He loved that the Danish operational site created a good outlook for his project. 
Furthermore, I started to work on the corporate development project. I have a finance degree that means I had the theory in place however I looked for some guidance from Niklas to get start this project.  

However a few months after I started Niklas started to neglect giving me the guidance and whenever he looked over it I received bad feedback. I checked with other financial analysts in the company and they actually liked my work. Additionally Niklas blocked any further development on the business development of the product even though Romeo and Julius loved the progress. 

8 months after I started at the Danish operational site I got fired due to mismatch between me and Niklas. I learned a few days afterwards that Romeo and Niklas hate each other and feels that I have been in the middle of a political battleground.

Basically, I'll have to take 3-4 CS classes every semester, and take some classes without their pre-requisites. My other option is to take an extra semester, and spread my schedule out.

7cac3l,0,2017-11-11,Negotiating salary when transitioning from intern to full time at an MSP?,Jimisacun,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7cac3l/negotiating_salary_when_transitioning_from_intern/,"(Asking a second time before making a decision)

I've been an ""intern"" at a small MSP for about 5 months ago. We have about 40 company clients and are steadily growing. I've been making $15/hour as an intern, and I'm the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happen to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I do mostly help desk work but also go to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 75% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field, or at least for my MSP. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week. I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians"". There is not really a set in stone L1, L2, etc. I do both kinds of work

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000
As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?
or is this a reasonable offer for an MSP?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including, or if I shouldn't bother asking for more because this is a good entry level IT offer

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

But I've also got spinal stenosis, and it makes it extremely painful to sit in a chair for more than 4 hours a day.

I've gotten through my school work (and freelance work)  by lying flat (on my bed or on the floor) when programming. 

When I get out of my classes (depending on type of seating available) I'm usually in a lot of pain for like an hour or two.

7cc4q3,29,2017-11-11,The loneliness of temping (vent); would like to hear from other temps if you're out there and feel the same,sewdeficient,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cc4q3/the_loneliness_of_temping_vent_would_like_to_hear/,"This is a long vent about the nature of temping and the last year of my life as someone who has only been able to get employment through temping. Obviously, there are probably a lot of temps or former temps here that don't relate; humor me. I don't need to be reminded how well life works out for other people but not for me. 

If you *can* relate, I'd love to hear from you. 

In five years, I have applied to easily twenty or thirty temps and interviewed with them. Many would bring me in, take my resume, and never call again; some probably don't even exist anymore. That's the nature of recruiting, I guess, people get paid for having any candidates at all. 

I left childhood teaching in 2014, worked as an ""intern"" unpaid at a not for profit for about a year, and have temped since September of 2016, recruited from an Excel class. I'm 30. The only job experience I had was assistant teaching and babysitting and a lot of freelance work, maybe three years' worth - a whole lotta nothin', to interviewers. So I had to start from scratch, at a time all my friends were settled in their careers. 

I realized the calendar date and am horrified at...how little I've accomplished.

Yes, it's gotten me some experience. But I've never been on an assignment that lasted longer than two months. Most have been much shorter - two weeks here, four weeks there. Three months in a seasonal position. All shitty, low level jobs. The one I was best paid at, I was fired from. My supervisor just didn't like me, even though I tried my best. They already had students to hire for cheaper who knew the office better (it was at a university).

Most recently I lost an offer to work an administrative job at a music label for a few months (my literal dream job - because it's in a big, fun environment, big enough to absorb me and pay well, and the sort of setting I'd like to work in permanently...even three months would be valuable) because I had already done two weeks at an accounting office that gave me the impression they would need me three months, and the Dream Job recruiter was someone who had fucking ignored my emails and pleas for a YEAR. A *YEAR*. That was the first conversation I'd had with him in that time; the first time I spoke to him, he said he had no work for me. The staffing agency is horrible; I worked with two other recruiters there who never called me again, after placing me at a job I was fired from in nine days (the school job).

I didn't want to leave this latest assignment so abruptly, asked for a later start date a week later so my current staffing agency could find someone else - Dream Job passed on me, of course. I feel more stupid and ashamed of myself - for cowardice, for being in such a horrible position with these terrible options - than words can describe. 

Especially considering, now my boss at this accounting office is going on a trip to their London office and letting me go this week, something he failed to tell the recruiter that got me this job. It just adds insult to injury, makes the stupidity of my choices so much worse. In the beginning he was so nice, and I felt like I'd be doing him a huge disservice if I bailed after two weeks there into an assignment that was supposed to last 8 weeks. *I probably would have inconvenienced him a few days.* I had been such a long time since a supervisor was nice to me. 

I cannot describe the cruelty of realizing the idiocy of that sort of loyalty for an opportunity like this. And granted, I would have been sad for leaving no matter what, and I dreaded bailing, then getting fired. It's happened before.

I was also afraid of burning bridges with my current agency, of course, and the real possibility I would have left job 1 and been fired from job 1 quickly -I didn't trust the recruiter who brought me the job.

But as it turned not, not only did he cut me loose early - I sat on my hands most of the day and just try not to bother him after he made it clear I mostly just get in the way, requesting tasks to do while he does his work. I spend the two hours after I finish imagining him resenting me where I sit for having to pay me, this useless, unskilled dumbass, and thinking of how unspeakably stupid I was to pass up the other job. How *furious* I am at myself, and him. A million ways I could have foreseen this happening to me. 

In the end, it doesn't matter - it changes how horribly these jobs always turn out or feel when they end. It's never that one ending or loss - I relive all I them. I relive the last ten years that led me here *every. single. day*, pore over horrible snapshots of being a massive depressed fuck up in a useless degree in college, aimless grad school (even worse degree - teaching)...I tick down the list of friends who left me behind years ago. 

 I wanted to scream at my supervisor here, for telling my recruiter he'd need me for eight weeks, when he was letting me go after three to travel; for not giving my recruiter or myself a realistic picture of how much work there'd actually be; for his ""tricking"" me into being loyal and feeling I'd rather finish this assignment and get a reference from someone who made me feel so good that first week than leave with a day turnaround for a new office I could just as easily be fired from quickly (but one I would have loved, LOVED to work for). Of course, I'm angriest at myself. For cowardice; for dumbness. For being disposable in many ways (stupid; awkward; anxious; half the time I'm 20 minutes late, which makes me ashamed for the rest of the day and scared to talk to anyone. I stay late, I've tried setting my alarm clock earlier; no matter what, due to health problems or train problems...I end up coming at exactly the same time.) I know that's a big ""no duh"". Trust me. 

Having options like this in front of me is a punishment, I tell myself, for bad choices, bad character, being stupid - on and on and on and on, for hours, every day. I'm angry at the mistakes I made to get here, to be so worthless and faceless a labor unit I can't fucking get an employer to delay a start date a few day for me. Of course I can't - *I'm just a worthless temp*. 

Fire me three weeks earlier than I was told this job would last, *after I turn down an offer I've been waiting five years for?* Sure - I'm just a stupid fucking useless temp! 
 

It's not just the horrible pay, and living at he mercy of recruiters who are ten years younger than me; so many of them have the same useless liberal arts degree I do, and escaped poverty by headhunting, an apt colloquialism if there ever was one.

It's the loneliness and shame. The very nature of temping at this stage at this age is underwritten by a little voice that reminds me never to get comfortable or feel valued; I wear a smile, I ask questions, I'm enthusiastic and try to make the most out of each job, but that little voice tells me how silly it all is, how **embarrassing,** *because the companies I'm working for would never hire me to to stay and more likely resent having to hire some imbecile doing tasks an ape could do and that a machine might in six months. There's no point getting to like people, as I will inevitably, given that a job becomes most of your social contact.

It's affected my social life, of course, much in the same way being unemployed at this age would. I don't really feel like I can answer the question, ""So what do you do?"". In a room full of people who will inevitably love their careers, have been at their jobs for years, and have some relationships between their life outcomes and the value others have placed on them, my answer is embarrassing. I'm not a marketing consultant, or a teacher, or an administrative assistant. I'm not an *employee*, with years of experience in one office, one industry,admired and groomed by colleagues and superiors of my field. I'm a worthless, disposable temp doing work they'd never hire someone to do full time and would prefer to get a machine to do, for wages or duties more befitting teenagers; the few times I've been sent to temp with others, they're between the ages of 23 and 25, if that.


I have never actually felt I could be hired in the setting or for the sort of office I'd really, really like to work for. I apply to big companies (e.g., makeup companies, studios, huge food conglomerates) that are also well reviewed for work culture and pay. I never get responses, naturally. Their average employee probably has five years of specialized executive experience. As a temp, I have to take the work when it's offered, where it's offered, at the wage is offered, for the time period it's offered. In this case, I didn't even get that - and I'm furious.

I've come to feel like sort of a tumor in offices or a strange ill-fitting piece of furniture that supervisors tolerate but want to remove as quickly possible.  The people around me have the skills, experience, and other assets that make them *employees* - in my case, I'll be there for a month (if that), a money hole, lucky to make 15 an hour, terrified the whole time of fucking up that office's systems, their tasks...something. Making work for people. Doing additional work in an attempt to be thorough and because no one will explain what's useful to them or not, and it's a given I don't *really* know about this office or what they do at the level a hired employee does. 

On top of that, my friends' experiences with temps were different and led to longer, higher paying assignments and eventual permanent employment. Three and five years ago, my friends both got permanent jobs eventually at decent companies through the same temps that now send *me* to month long gigs where I can expect to make 14/hour and seemed to have completely changed in the five years I begged them to take me on (temps only started placing me a year ago, as noted). The awfulness of the jobs makes me think, they're only taking me because these staffing agencies are now terrible and are useless to me in this job market. I've asked for temp to perm work. They won't give it to me, and I have never interviewed for a paid job and not been passed over, even when round 1 (e.g., phone interview) goes ok. Every interview for a permanent job these temps send me on is for horrible positions (I don't behave that way of course) or positions I'm unqualified for. The one job I was of course did not hire me - I lacked the not for profit experience they wanted. 

All my temp positions are data entry, usually in tasks an administrative assistant would actually do, but somehow it never counts as worthwhile experience to the customer service jobs and admin jobs I apply to on my own. For every 25-50 I apply to by myself, I might get an interview that goes so so and where I won't even get a rejection email in response to my thank you note. I've never actually been placed as a long term administrative assistant or receptionist, even though I have the experience through seasonal jobs I found myself (that paid...11 dollars an hour). 

I can't divorce the two, the worthlessness I feel going on interviews for jobs I apply to independently, and these temp assignments at companies that would never, ever hire me as a full time employee (something I try to ignore while I'm there, but it eats away at me and makes me hate myself for being so unskilled at this age). I'm really trying; I research the companies and my supervisors, ask questions at my temp jobs so I can figure out how to make what I do sound purposeful on a resume, leave my contact info with thank you notes, make sure to ask if I can add them as a reference later, list each gig on my resume as best I can and flesh out what I contributed to and software I used, and try to be professional. 

But this month - getting cut loose early, from a shitty job i stayed for after passing up the sort of opportunity I'll never have again - forced to choose between a horrible recruiter I have no relationships with, and a firm that's placed me the last year but for terrible pay, and short-term jobs - all of it, all of it makes me feel horrible. 

I really liked my boss at this job. I feel like I'm bound to disappoint people that offer goodwill - the worst fucking thing on earth - no matter what, either due to incompetence, lateness, or the hesitance that comes with being in an office of strangers when I know I shouldn't. I feel betrayed, and then berate myself for being stupid enough to feel that - you're not a person owed anything if you're a temp. 

After a year of really mean, snide, unprofessional, indifferent, and condescending bosses and some truly toxic offices (another fun perk of being a temp - I have had more than a few supervisors that treat me like garbage and are very clear they do not respect or like me as a person nor think my work is important, in an office of actual perm employees they've interviewed, hired and gotten to know over time), I can honestly say I would have been very sad leaving, but the way this turned out...was a fucking slap in the face. I want to yell and scream at him, and tell him I turned down on offer for a job I might have been suited for; how could he make me feel needed that first week? 

You're a temp - don't get attached to people emotionally, don't expect anyone to be nice to you or find out you who you are, because *you're not supposed to be there*.

I know one solution, to go back to school - but I will still have a resume seen as garbage when I get out, I'm broke, and right now, I don't even know the path to follow. Realistically, the ones I have in mind are all pretty boring and difficult to turn into career if they're not among your natural talents, with a strong performance record or portfolio- probably finance or data/marketing analysis, since those are the settings where I'm hired to do very low level work).  When I was in college I unquestionably would have flunked out of the higher-level, more-employable arenas I do low skill data entry work for now, and there's no guarantee I wouldn't do terribly pursuing an MBA (with no valued job experience or contacts, in this time - who would care)? I feel trapped. 

I just wanted to talk about what I know about my life today and now. All the options ahead of me are horrible. This latest humiliation caps off a year of terror about the future and bottomless self-hatred - for the person I am every day, for the past that led me here. I'm not a young enough person to comfort myself with the idea I still have time to alter the course I'm on easily and find what I want sooner than later - on office that pays me a living wage where I feel respected (maybe even liked!) and valued. All of my friends have that. All my acquintances have that. I'm the only one that still has as much clout of as a teenager fresh out of college - or even less, since that fresh grad is younger and likely has more desired skills than I do. The expectations have gotten worse in the years since I've graduated; even with the continual sitting in on workshops, they don't really help, so I fall short of what's expected of me in this labor market and for my age cohort, and I'm ashamed. 

Unemployment is terribly lonely; being disposable is lonely; being a temp is disempowering, but I have only ever had success finding even shitty wages, finding any work at all, through temps. 

I have no financial future, realistically, just based on my age. Or it's at that much more risk. I spend every check I earn on rent, food, odd consumable items, and metrocards. I have no savings. I have no investments. 

I have less financial security than the average college freshman who has taken a single decent accounting class. 


The fact that I'm such an unnattractive candidate to employers seeking permanent employees is all making me feel like garbage today; I do not know what to do. 

I'm sorry this is a book. 

I don't have anything; I'm feeling so fucking old and trapped; you get to an age where eventually, if you have a problem you can't fix....and whether or not you think you deserve a way out is beside the point. I have no identity apart from this and the things that make me suffer; every working day I revisit the failures and shortcomings of a feckless, stupid, weak-willed, sheltered, and ostensibly lazy (I don't think so - but stupid, yes) person, paying for the same. Office by office; horrible, horrible moment where I simply cannot do even the simple, short-term task I am expected to; employer for employer; team for team. They are an audience of people living an adulthood I can't imagine. "

How should I proceed?",Dreadh4llow,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cczm8/thinking_about_quitting_my_first_real_job_4/,"Hello! So I've read numerous Reddit threads about similiar problems as mine, but nothing has quite covered my situation, so here goes:

I graduated university this summer with a bachelor's degree in Journalism and Communication and right off the bat got my first ""real"" job in a hotel group as an online marketing coordinator (I do have various 1-2 month long internships and projects in my field under my belt as well as retail jobs). The job in itself is fine, I like WHAT I am doing on a day-to-day basis (online marketing and doing social media etc) but the big problem however is HOW things are run over here - my direct boss is constantly overloaded with her work, meaning she's stressed 24/7, which carries over to the rest of the team causing a very negative and toxic atmosphere, she complains that I don't work incredibly long overtime like her, everything work-related there is unorganized and INCREDIBLY hectic and stressful, there's little to no strategy involved in the tasks that I have to do and the workload is immense. The people who've worked the same position have never lasted there for over a year. Combining that with the fact that I am paid 35-40% less than people on similiar positions on average leaves me in a pretty bad spot to be in right now. I feel the mental impact that place has on me and it feels emotionally very taxing to continue and I've only been there for about 3.5-4 months.

I've been quietly on a job hunt for about a month and have attended 4 interviews (all marketing and communications related) thus far, some of which have not yet replied their final answer and some that have politely rejected me. Each and every company I've been interviewed for has left a way more professional, well thought out and easy-going impression and feel than what I have ever experienced (as well as a more competitive salary) in my current working place.

So my question is how should I proceed with this situation. I've been thinking of quitting for now, moving on to some ""easier to get into"" field like customer service or administrative job until I find a job that I really want so that I can continue work related to my speciality.

The other option is to suck it up, devastate myself even further and succumb into the endless void of a mess that is my current job environment and keep on going to interviews. I just dread the thought of sitting down in that office so much that I'd rather work anywhere else right now BUT staying would look better on my resume.

What are your thoughts?"

(I basically sat at home for that year.) So this year, I went for MSME and successfully found an CAD intern job. Sounds Great, right? However, I am basically a volunteer since my stipend is only enough to cover the gas. And the workload I think right now is equal or even more than a full time. (I work from Monday to Friday, two days 3 hours and three days 9 hours. Although technically sounds like I am a part time, but sometime I stayed longer than 9 hours in those three days, plus, I recently have to work either on Saturday or Sunday also. I feel like I am being rip off as a slave labor and I don't learn much from it. I worked for this company about 2 months. Should I quit before I find another intern/full time? If I quit, I worried I might sit at home again.
To summarize my point 1. Paid is only enough to cover gas for amount of workload I inputted in. 2. Worrying I might sit at home again if I quit."

7cholv,2,2017-11-12,I like challenging myself but it's costing my grades,catna2012,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cholv/i_like_challenging_myself_but_its_costing_my/,"Hi guys, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I would love some insight (and maybe pointing me into the right direction). 

I'm a sophomore in college, and I study molecular cell and physiology. I'm not the smartest student, but I try to work hard and efficiently. I don't plan on becoming a doctor, but I know that grades matter for the most part in jobs that relate to my major to an extent. However, I feel like I'm stuck making a choice. 

My school is a state university and I enjoy the opportunities they provide, but our professors seem to often display a pattern of either not being a good teacher but gives easy exams, or very competent professors that give out harsh exams that fail the majority of the class. I like to challenge myself and learn from mistakes, and in a perfect world I would love to always learn from the best professors in our school. However, I know the impact my GPA would be on applying to grad school or job hunting in the future (at least for my very first job), and I'm scared that even though I've learned alot and have faced good challenges that made me grow, my GPA would be what stops me from going anywhere. I guess why I would seek help right now is because of two things:

1) do I go to the professor that would teach me what I need to know in the future but potentially tank my GPA, or stay with the professor that gives out easy exams and only require minimal studying but leaves me clueless in the future when academic knowledge is required in my field?

2) what can I do to beef up my resume if my GPA is not as good as the other candidates? 

I don't know much about how society works in terms of newly graduated students, and how on earth I'm going to make it out there. I'm frankly terrified. 

(I'm joining a research lab in my campus, and I'm trying to get into internships in forensics both in my home state as well as Taiwan. My GPA right now is very average if not below average, which is a 2.9, and I'm trying to figure out other ways to help me be more competent in society when I graduate) 

TL;DR: I want to learn as much as I can, but my GPA would potentially suffer because of mistakes made in the process of learning. Scared and a bit lost at the moment. "
7chybk,1,2017-11-12,"Worst situation imaginable, relationship at risk...",quantumloopy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7chybk/worst_situation_imaginable_relationship_at_risk/,"This is going to be a really long post so please bare with me.

I've been dating my girlfriend now for 2 years and we're deeply in love. She's currently working in healthcare and I'm in my final year of university, despite being the exact same age. She comes from an *ultra* conservative background with extremely strict parents. I too am conservative but nowhere near as extreme as her family is.

Now I've met her parents just over a year ago and they liked me. They thought I was a good boy and charming, handsome etc. The only problem was that they wanted me to switch churches over so that I could attend with them, which in all honesty I wasn't willing to do (due to cultural issues; in both my culture and hers (same background), it's considered weak for the man to follow the woman in the matters of religion). Stupid I know, but I couldn't stand to see my parents upset at the fact that I would switch denominations just to please a girl's parents. 

Her parents didn't like that too much and basically forced her to stop talking to me. So for about a year now, she's been seeing me behind their backs and without their knowledge. We both hate living a lie like this, but it's the only way we can do it, and here's the reasons why:

1. Because of our ethnic backgrounds, it's considered immoral if the girl moves out of her parents house before she gets married.

2. Because of her conservative upbringing, her parents have pretty much full control over her life. Everything from who she talks to and what she does on a daily basis goes through them.

3. She's very family oriented, meaning she hates the idea of upsetting her family.

Now, all the above pisses me off to the highest extent possible, but it is what it is and I certainly can't change our ethnic backgrounds and the cultural norms that come along with that package. 

Our plan is this: wait until I finish university (few months remaining), hopefully have a job by graduation to start making money (I've got a fantastic internship lined up which should convert to a full time offer pending graduation), and then she'd reintroduce me to her parents. As of late, her parents have been asking her about me, saying I was such a good guy. Due to some certain issues that's happened in their church community, they've sort of relaxed their stance on the whole church difference thingy, so it seems like they're willing to give me a second chance.

Now all that was our original plan, but something major happened last night that changes everything.

Long story short, a good friend of mine got married yesterday, and he invited me to go. I brought my girlfriend as my plus one, and we attended the reception. As we were about to leave, she sees her brother-in-law's best friend (remember, her family are super close, and word spreads pretty fast in our circles). She says hi to him and he asks her how she knows the bride, groom etc. Turns out he's related to the bride!!!!

Now I'm pretty sure that he saw me, but I'm also certain he didn't see us holding hands or anything like that. But she *lost her shit*. I've never seen her that hysterical once we got to the car. She was about to throw up from anxiety. 

She's certain that the guy she saw there would tell her brother-in-law, and in turn, her sister will find out and *could* tell her parents. Now here's the real shitkicker.

She blatantly lied to her parents and her sister as to whose wedding she was attending. She told them that she knows the bride (not true, was my friend the groom getting married) from uni (which she certainly doesn't). So basically, this elaborate lie could quickly untangle if her sister tells her parents ""oh someone we know saw her at the wedding, and he's related to the bride"" (bare in mind, the guy she saw there also knows her parents quite well, all from the same ethnic background). Keep in mind that her sister is from the same strain as her parents, meaning she's more than likely to side with them rather than have her sister's back.

Her parents, as said before and can't be stressed enough, are the type of people to absolutely destroy her with questions and ruin her life if she's caught in this lie. 

My girlfriend decided to sort of 'beat everyone to the punch' and told her parents that she saw me at the reception (in a random encounter). They asked her how I was doing and what we talked about etc. You know the usual stuff.

But like I said before, I'm not the issue here. It's the risk that she could be caught out in this massive lie and our whole relationship comes untangled. We're so so so sick of living this lie and it eats us up, but we have no other option due to the reasons I stated earlier in this post. 

We're worried, and we need advice. I usually would never spill my heart out like this, but I'm so lost as to what we should do. At this point, we're just hoping and praying that the guy she saw there won't open his mouth when he sees her brother-in-law, and that no connection whatsoever is made to the lie she's told both her parents and her sister.

Any advice is welcome at this point, and I'm terribly sorry for writing this long post. "

The one things that's holding me back is I feel like I'm going to crash and burn hard at this place: I've only had one Software engineering internship in the past and I put a widget on an existing site (It took about 2k lines of code), and my feedback I got from my manager was good, not like stellar or anything. And from what I've been reading on glassdoor, it seems that everyone there is a genius, and I'm worried that I won't be able to perform at their level. I also was a bit of a creeper and looked at what some current engineers had done in the past via LinkedIn, and there's no way I hold a candle to them in terms of projects or classes (especially because I've always been average in terms of how well I do in CS classes). I have no problem working really hard, but at some point, I feel like it might not be enough and I'll end up getting fired for performance that's not up to their level. 

So my question is, especially if you were a new grad coming into this company or any other company, what experiences did you have? What did they expect of you? In addition, how do you think I can gauge whether or not I'll be okay at the company? It's really hard to know without really getting a sense of what they expect from their new grads or knowing what team you'll be on. 

Thank you all so much!"

I am a transfer student and missed the boat on making friends freshman year, and I do not want to be in a sorority, but it seems like 90% of the girls in my classes are in one. To be honest, I sort of enjoy not having lots of friends, it's less of a distraction, I'm more productive, and I can do whatever I want. I had 2 jobs this semester, and I was in a fashion club and 4 classes so I had lots going on. Now, 2 of those have ended and I just have my classes and a job. 

In my hometown, I have lots of friends and things to do, and my social calendar is usually pretty busy whenever i'm back home (it's a big city and people are more mature, generally). I really just don't feel like I fit in, and i'm tired of wasting my energy trying to make friends with people who seem to not be interested in being friends.

School is going well, I'm kicking ass at my internship, I'm making money, My hobbies are modeling, hiking, and gardening, and I like not having distractions. 

I just don't have many friends. Last semester, my roommate tried to help by inviting me to things (church youth group type stuff that I really don't enjoy). I went a couple of times but it was just not my thing. I know she was just trying to help, but she said I seemed lonely. 

Now I'm self-conscious that I seem lonely to my current roommates. I don't have a lot of free time, and when I do, I like just hanging out at the apartment doing chores or just watching TV. Is there a way to not have them think I'm lonely?"

I'm a Computer Science major, never liked it, but stuck with it because it is a safe career path.  I've had 2 summers of well-paid internships, and hated every minute of it.  I always wanted to do acting, or to be a musician (though that is more of a hobby of mine), but I always thought that risking financial ruin by studying art or music at college was an idiotic move.  Well, after several epiphanies, my attitude has taken a 180, and I realize that I'd rather be poor and do what I love rather than be wealthy and do something I hate.

At this point however, it would be difficult to go into the direction of being an actor.  You don't exactly get much acting experience from sitting at a desk typing Java code.  I know that I have to take some type of action, so I'm wondering what steps I should take to make this dream a reality?

Should I tough it out and finish my degree, even if it takes 1 or more years to finish?  Should I tough it out even further and work in the Computer industry afterwards to build up enough money to move to L.A.?  Those options are what people mostly recommend to me, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of a better way.

Hi all,
I'm currently a vfx artist a AAA video game studio in california. I actually got hired on after an internship whilst pursuing a degree in CS in my home state on the other side of the US. That is, I didn't go back to school. I already have a bachelor's in art so finishing my degree wasn't too much of a concern really, honestly I just went back to school in hopes of getting the job I now have.

However, after doing this job day in and day out, especially for artists, the crunch is bad 80hr work weeks and the pay...it's alright, but I'm only just about making what my friends who went into programming are making and they don't have to work insane hours.

Also...doing programming and being in vfx, the way the tech is going, I feel like my job will be less and less reliant on pure artists who can work a program and rely more on artists that can make a program.
I was thinking of going back to school for programming and moving in with my parents to try and finish up quickly and then move forward with maybe a masters then finally a job on the engineering side of...anything really- not just video games.

I've talked with a couple of people at my current studio and a former boss who's now a senior lead at another AAA studio and the suggestion seems to be to stay working and learn practical stuff on my own time or if I really want the degree...do it while I work.

most schools in california don't do 2nd degrees, so it would have to be as a master's, but for that, they want you to have a bachelor's in cs, if not the coursework. which, i'm thinking if I'm going to do the courses, I might as well move back with my folks, and get the bachelor's...

I'm 26 right now, so...kinda old, but finishing my degree would only take about two years so wouldn't be too bad if I do full-time.

So, just wondering...what would y'all suggest?"

Now even though I am from a shit college, I am interested in CS and understand and love whatever I learn or do. I have a good grade(8.5), have participated twice in GSOC (it's a program by Google where you are paid to contribute to open source) and also did an internship earlier this year. 

Unfortunately, that is all the experience I have. Now I was interested in Android development since last year and although I spent some time learning it back then, it's only recently that I have become somewhat good at it. In fact, I actually have been spending the last few months learning more about about advanced concepts(like Dagger, Rx, etc for those who know about it) and have implemented them in an app(intend to showcase it). I am like really into it right now. But I still don't think I am good enough to work in a team so I need a couple of months more to polish my skills and also publish another app, which I am working on currently, on the play store. I am also thinking maybe go the indie route and work on stuff that I love(like open source). What I am worried about is will that harm my job prospects? Is it true that if I am not employed by end of this year, I won't ever get a job? I am also not that good with algorithms so I think if I give it a few more months(yeah, it's too late to do that but maybe I can improve a little?), I can improve on both and be better prepared.

40 credit hours is almost another two years of school, whereas with 6 credit hours, I could be graduating this summer. 24 of the remaining credits are CS classes, whereas 19 of those credits are electives outside of CS (things like diversity, upper division writing, physics 1, etc.)

I already have an internship turned part-time job from this last summer, and they've told me they want to keep me and turn me full time asap; so work experience isn't too big of an issue, since I have roughly 6 months work experience, and a decent job pretty much lined up. 

Some other considerations:

If I transferred, I'd have a higher GPA on my transcript and diploma (3.7 compared to like a 3.0), since my grades dipped when I first transferred to my current university. 

If I transferred, I'd also graduate with a minor in math.

Also, current university is not an ivy by any means. It's a solid state university with a somewhat decent reputation around the country, especially for stem. 

I know you guys probably get sick of these types of questions ('help me know what to do with my life!' type), but I think I could benefit with some thoughts from the community while making this decision. 

Would I be stagnating my career by transferring to a less reputable school? What's worth more, a year and half of work experience, or a degree from a better (although not huge name) university?"
7cnymg,37,2017-11-13,Confessions of a (soon-to-be-former) GIS'er,Grmull89,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/7cnymg/confessions_of_a_soontobeformer_giser/,"Hello GIS'ers or those who wish to pursue a career in GIS. I am writing this in order to document my experience working as a GIS Analyst over a period a few years. This post isn't a rant, this is just what my GIS experience was like and why I chose to leave the geospatial industry for the IT industry. 

Overall, I had a neutral experience working the GIS industry. Not great, not terrible. Every industry has its perks and drawbacks. The industry is unique in that it's at the crossroads of IT and graphic design. The IT side of things being data science and application development. The graphic design aspect of it being just that, designing something aesthetically pleasing. All of those aspects are the ""plus"" side of the industry for me. And now the bad side..

Over my career, I've met other geospatial professionals, and all of us have the same complaint that we're all grossly underutilized and terribly mis-and-micromanaged. With the exception of my college internship experience and my first professional GIS gig, I was supervised by somebody who had ZERO GIS experience. Zero. They hadn't ever touched the software and didn't understand what it's capabilities and limitations were. It was a constant struggle explaining to the Office Manager or my supervisors ""GIS really excels at X. It's not Autodesk so it can't do Y or isn't built on the premise that it be used for Y.""  

GIS is largely a data-driven system, and the other major obstacle that I experienced while working in the geospatial industry (especially the broader Oil and Gas Industry), is the fact that nobody wants to pay for data, send crews to collect the data, or the dataset that they're asking to be displayed is a scientific result of any number of factors. The other thing that really soured my taste for wanting to work in the Oil and Gas experience was my supervisor once told me ""These maps you're making really don't matter, DNR/DEP/EPA just look at them and throw them onto a shelf with the rest of them"".  So that rubbed me the wrong way, because I began to think ""Well if what I'm doing doesn't matter, then what am I doing here?"". 

I actually resigned from that position and went to work for an IT company doing just straight project management stuff and really liked it. I spent a little over a year at that position, and resigned because I wanted to be sure that it was the Oil and Gas industry that had soured me on GIS and not GIS itself. Upon taking the position that I'm currently in, I realized that it was GIS that had me down and it didn't matter what industry I was in. 

I had made some professional connections while I was at the ""IT company"" and I actually started down a certification path while I was there and put it down whenever I resigned, but picked it up again once I figured out I wasn't happy. I studied, got certified, applied, and got hired by to do Linux System Administration. 

Although my next endeavor won't be a GIS-oriented position, I still enjoy working with the software. I still like maps, like working with the data, and it's actually piqued my interest in exploring an IT career like Database Management or Application Development. Please take this posting with a grain of salt. If you're thinking about a career in GIS, don't be discouraged by this review, your experience may be vastly different from mine and I hope it is. If you're reading this and are experiencing the same pitfalls working in the industry, take comfort in the fact that the GIS discipline is a cross-roads of trades, and you can EASILY transition into something that suits your taste. Good Luck!"
7coj9y,8,2017-11-13,Should I reach out to my recruiter after doing poorly on a coding challenge?,ImJustPro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7coj9y/should_i_reach_out_to_my_recruiter_after_doing/,"I've been in contact with this company for some time now. It is a very large company, but the office I applied to is rather unknown and small, so the pool of applicants is small as well. I've applied for a Software Engineering intern position with this company and finished the coding challenge for them yesterday.

The coding challenge consisted of 10 multiple choice and one programming question. I aced the multiple choice, but the programming question - I choked. It was a very easy question. I jumped with joy when reading it because I knew how to answer it. Unfortunately I became obsessed with the idea of optimizing it that I got distracted and forgot to accomplish the basics. It only passed a few test cases, but had errors on most. 

I have had personal contact with the head recruiter and have made myself stand out through conference calls with them. They seem to have been impressed with my questions and my resume. I'm debating whether I should contact him and explain what happened and maybe ask for another challenge to complete, or send the proper solution to him - but I also think this would make me seem like a sore loser.

What do you guys think?"
7cokyr,3125,2017-11-13,I have been rejected by over 100 jobs in my past 2 years as a developer from code bootcamp. My story. Never give up.,Tychos1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7cokyr/i_have_been_rejected_by_over_100_jobs_in_my_past/,"I would like to preface and apologize if this is the wrong place to post. But I'd just like to share my experience since getting into code. 

I was working at an engineering job right after college and basically hated what I did. Very corporate america, my boss had 3 bosses, I had 2 managers, felt like cattle in a cubicle farm. I started looking at remote jobs because I couldn't figure out why I needed to be in a cubicle to write excel sheets and create power points all day. When I looked up remote jobs I realized they were all basically software development. I wondered why I went to school for mechanical engineering anyway since I spent all of my time playing video games, building my own computer, everything IT except for code.

After that feeling of regret wore off; I looked up boot camps in my area. I knew that if I tried to learn myself or online I would get stuck, become frustrated and probably quit. I wasn't comfortable with being uncomfortable yet. Unfortunately, most of the code boot camps designed to actually **get you a job** were from 9am-5pm for three months straight. I didn't have the finances to just quit my job and I wasn't going to take out a loan to go either. So I went to this 'after hours' part time(specifically noted that it was not preparing you for jobs) boot camp a few days a week at night and on the weekend. They refused to list the job statistics for students after the program but after harassing them about it they gave me a 'less than 28% of students get a job after this program'. I decided maybe if I bust my ass enough I can be part of that number. It started off pretty easy, I had taken an HTML class in high school, no big deal. Then came CSS - oh this is a thing I connect to the page and change how it looks. Then came Javascript - oh this is neat...wait..what, but I don't understand..so this works but this doesn't? Why? Oh that's just that way it is. okay.jpg. Rinse repeat that process of continually being baffled until I eventually accepted a continuous state of 'I'm not sure how to do that, and I've never done that before, but... I'll figure it out.'

This type of attitude has served me even beyond the local scope of programming into the global scope of my life. 

Toward the end of the bootcamp most students had dropped out. There were 4 left. Not many people my age(25 at the time) want to give up their Saturday morning to come into a classroom and learn to code. I wasn't the exception, especially when rocket league had just released and one 5 minute round warps space-time and 3 hours goes by. I managed to keep it under control and show up every class. 

I started shotgunning out resumes to almost every job posting I could find with the word development in it. I'd like to take a moment and apologize to the 67 HR people that stated 'Do not apply unless you have x experience’' and 'please stop applying to other positions at this company'. I would rather take a chance then not, it's not like I lose anything when they say no. I figured maybe if I could get their ear for only a minute then I might be able to convince them. Eventually a brand new startup messaged me back and brought me in for an interview. It was for ruby on rails. Nope -  0 experience but I'll learn whatever you want me to learn. They gave me a code test, maybe as a sick joke to get me to go away. I took it and spent about 8 hours trudging through it until I finished. I brought it back and to both our surprise it looked good. Then they told me no, sorry, not enough experience. We shook hands and I went about my day. I decided to call them up and ask if I could work part-time. Let me be an intern, don't make me the main man on your technology but let me work on something easier. 

I knew that they were a fresh startup on the block and that if they had interns it might let them look good. Gives that curb appeal of 'we are hiring the fresh minds in the tech space'. Anyway - they said 'We'll consider it, let me call you back'. They called me back and said 'Yeah can you work 20-25 hours a week? We'll pay you $18 an hour'. I was prepared to work for free so when I read that I was floored. Feeling like I was on top of the world I asked if I could also work from home a few days a week since I was going to keep my full-time engineering job. In retrospect I was probably pushing it. They agreed though, for whatever reason. I thought I had achieved the dream, and in a way I had. It was a startup environment, I could bring my dog, they had beer fridays at 1:00pm, a snack room, an xbox if you wanted to play during lunch. I thought I was hot shit. Yeah I'm a 'software developer' now throwing my title out like a left hook. Then I showed up for my first day at work to get my equipment and it hit me.

Now I actually have to produce for this company. None of this means anything if I can't code. I don't know ruby on rails, I've never used git in a professional environment. I merged my own pull request on the first day. That was bad. Luckily I didn't delete an entire repo like the other guy on here. Suddenly everyday felt like wait why did you hire me again? 

I struggle bussed my way through 6 months and kept my full time job as an engineer.  I started looking at other full time jobs in software because every day I showed up to my engineering cubicle I lost a piece of my soul. 

I found a full-time PHP junior software position and they brought me on. I maintained my intern job as well. I knew there were growing pains but it felt more like I was being torn from limb to limb. Under experienced and overconfident. I'm pretty sure Kendrick Lamar was directing his lyrics at me. Sit down, be humble. I now try to be a student in every aspect.

I worked there for about 5 more months and I was replaced by someone with more experience that was willing to take the same pay as me. The joys of being a junior developer.

I decided you know what, I've been doing this for a while - I'm going to try and get a fully remote job. I applied to a few places and actually received two job offers at the same time. For the first time I felt like it was starting to pay off. Two companies want me? I have a choice? What is life? I accepted a fully remote job doing react and PHP. Things started to come together. I started to think 'I have an idea about how to do that but it probably wont be optimized'. After a year the US election happened and I was working for a government contractor. Suddenly the budget was under review and there were no more contracts. No more work for us to do. The entire development team was let go. 15 people. 

Enter my most recent job. For whatever reason it was more difficult to find another fully remote job this time. I was declined by 90 jobs. Endless interviews, after interview #4 for company #63 it can get hard to stay 110%. I had a portfolio, decent resume, passed code tests, followed up even willing to take less money. I'm not sure why it was more difficult this time around. As my funds ran out I decided I'll work locally. I eventually accepted an office job and work remote partially. It's not my favorite thing but it's good for me. It keeps me on my hustle and networking with people is everything. I enjoy being in the office and enjoy the people I work with; they are flexible when I want it. When I was unemployed and constantly getting told 'NO' - knowing that I am approaching homelessness was difficult to process. Especially because I had received two offers at the same time just a year prior. One piece of advice I think about is 'Keep your head up when times are tough, and your head down when times are good'.

Even now I don't think I am 'the best' developer. I'm confused and stumped pretty regularly. I used to wonder if 'code was for me'. Now - I embrace the struggle and can look back and see all I've learned. At code camp I was always the last one to finish the in class projects or moved on with it incomplete. I've dropped out of college 2 times before finally finishing. Academically I was never amazing.

I now work two jobs. One full time as a front-end developer and a part-time where I teach code to students but this isn't intended to be a promo for that so I wont name it. I just like helping people learn since I know what it's like. 

If you're in one of my many situations never give up. 

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR** Went to code bootcamp because hated corporate america job. Worked at a startup, remotely, and now partially. Has been a rough upward ride overall.

**Edit** If anyone has any questions - feel free to send me a message here and I'm happy to help. Oh boy someone found it. If anyone is interested I have a small [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA) channel where I talk about these topics and more. Prepare^for^cringe. I'm still learning, but my goal is to help and motivate others with transparent information. 

**Edit** Thanks for the gold kind stranger.

**Edit** So I received a few questions about free resources and the bootcamp I teach at along with my thoughts on other bootcamps.

*This isn't intended to be a promotional and I'm not sponsored to write this*, but whatever - check these out if you want.

It's called **OpenClassrooms**. Weekly Mentor meetings.  **Price:** $300/month and has a job guarantee. I teach there so take that with a grain of salt. Do your research and find what works for you. If interested there's the discount code, OPENCLASSROOMS12 if you want to try it out. I don't know how many there are. First come first serve I guess.

I personally attended  **DevMountain** in 2015 in Salt Lake City, Utah. It has a pretty great rating and overall I thought the curriculum was modern but there just wasn't enough time in the evening courses to fully prepare for jobs. It also has no job guarantee. **Price: $4500**

**LambdaSchool** Completely free until you get a job that pays more than $50,000/yr, with a part-time option

**Thinkful** is also great. Weekly mentor meetings. They have a job guarantee. **Price:$8500**

**Bloc.io** - Basically just Thinkful that costs slightly more. Job guarantee.**Price:$8800**

**Free Resources I used to learn and still do:**

[Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Huge awesome community. 

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Pretty great for beginners. They're always updating it.

[Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) - Follow along tutorials.

[Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/) - Make games and learn. Pretty interactive.

Udemy Courses. - Plenty of free content with project based learning.

Personal experience with PCs going back to Windows 95, LAN parties, Family Mr. Fixit.   

The internship entailed server backups (Backup Exec), WSUS/SCCM, general user issue troubleshooting, router installs, rolling out new PCs (imaging, adding/removing from AD, inventory), printer maintenance, network troubleshooting, setting up conference rooms.  The manager at my internship had hoped to hire me but the Federal hiring freeze dashed that hope.   

Aside from not having my own admin privileges (had to use my supervisors credentials) I was treated as part of the team. The guy supervising me had said I knew more than he did.  I actually left him with a few scripts to automate parts of his day.

I had been in a VA program as a disabled vet and that program seems to have been affected as well because 90% of the job leads offered were Federal.  So I've been conducting a job search on my own, without much success.

Now I realize that I need more professional experience to beef up my resume but what positions fit what I have?  I've had a handful of recruiters contact me but the salary offers seems pretty low for the Boston area.  

I've been targeting Desktop Support level roles at around $20/h.  I just got off the phone with another recruiter looking to fill a position at $14/h.

Let me first thank you all for creating and contributing to such a positive community which helps so many individuals.

I'll start with the TLDR to save you the scrolling: BS and MS in Neuroengineering ([MS thesis](https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A4303) was MATLAB-heavy brain-computer interface research), 5 years working in the OR, more than halfway through GA Tech's OMSCS with Machine Learning concentration and will finish by end of 2018, working on second Nanodegree (first was Deep Learning, now doing AI). Live in Brooklyn, happy to work anywhere in NYC. Hoping to change careers Q1 2018; should I intern?

OK, the full version:

For some background, I live in Brooklyn, NY where I work in brain and spine surgery as a [surgical neurophysiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_neurophysiological_monitoring). I have a BS and an MS in Neuroengineering from Drexel University, and due to some serendipitous circumstances early in my career, I'm 29 and peaked in my industry two years ago; I'm at the top with nowhere else to go. This is not a humblebrag, it's the result of a young, poorly developed and mostly unregulated industry with little mobility. In interviews, I'm very, very comfortable, and tend to come across as intelligent and articulate. In addition to my work in the OR, I also co-own a small animation firm where I act as technical director and audio engineer, and I volunteer actively with [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/).

My MS thesis involved developing from scratch a MATLAB GUI toolset for analyzing brain data from brain-computer interfaces, and then using the GUIs to analyze data which I collected from human subjects, and then compared to similar research findings. This was my first real exposure to programming.

After working for about two years, I started taking free Udacity courses on Python, and yadda yadda yadda now I'm done 6 classes of 10 in GA Tech's OMSCS (online MS in CS) program, with a concentration in Machine Learning. Considering my lack of a CS undergrad degree and the fact that I work and volunteer full time, I think I'm doing pretty well, with As and some Bs. I've also completed Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree, and am in the early stages of Udacity's AI Nanodegree. I chose to do the Nanodegrees in parallel to the OMSCS because I want to completely immerse myself in CS and data science so I can best digest and internalize the concepts, ideas, and skills.

I'm going to be finishing the OMSCS program by the end of December 2018. However, I'm really dying to get out of my current career for a number of only tangentially relevant reasons which I won't expand upon (unless y'all want me to). My girlfriend and I are in the process of buying and renovating a 3-family house here in Brooklyn, so my thinking is that once we're moved in and paying our mortgage with rental income, I can afford to take a (likely quite large) pay cut in order to pursue a CS internship while I finish my MS, so that when I AM done, I can comfortably be applicable for a full-time role.

**My question is, should I be aiming for an internship, or higher? Will an internship be a necessary precondition for me to be qualified for a full-time position when I finish my MS?**

My gut feeling is that my lack of a CS undergrad degree may leave me with some fundamental gaps in knowledge, though I'm doing pretty well in my MS program and am fascinated with the content and *LOVE* the challenge of completing my assignments. It's hard for me to delineate between impostor syndrome and legitimate recognition of my own limits.

Thank you all for your help and advice! :]

7cs9xq,1,2017-11-13,2 Questions (about a major and essays),clashofclans202,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7cs9xq/2_questions_about_a_major_and_essays/,"#1: What is the informatics major like at UIUC? I've heard it's basically front-end CS. Is this true? What is the major exactly like?

#2: If it is true that informatics is similar to front-end CS (multimedia, web design, basic coding but not nearly as in depth as a proper CS major), then I might be in a bind.

My essay talking about CS (the major I want to do now which may change to informatics based on what you all tell me) basically talks about how I first got my programming book when 13 years old and how it sparked my interest in CS and motivated me to take CS courses at school and online. Then in 10th grade, I took a intro CS  class at school and the web development unit was what I fell in love with and was passionate about. How it motivated me to take an online web dev course, and how it inspired me to get a software engineering internship the following summer at a web dev firm. That's basically the essay in a nutshell.

The thing is, the essay talks about backend and front-end stuff. Even in my internship (in my essay, I talk about my experiences in the internship), I did graphics design and media creation and web application FRONT end for a majority of my time (I may have done a small backend task but that's about it). So if I chose informatics as my second major, I'd basically have to reuse the same essay. My CS experiences and web dev experiences not only made me interested in backend stuff, but also front-end (in fact, I kinda prefer front-end more). 

So what do I do? I don't have anything unique for the two different majors (should I declare an alternate backup major) and the one essay I have now  could potentially accurately describe how I have explored both majors. Even for my CS essay, I don't wanna remove the part about the internship. It was a ""software engineer position"" and that is pretty similar to CS.

Thanks!"

7csled,1,2017-11-13,electric motor choice for a 4-pointed rotating loader,PauliCOJ,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/7csled/electric_motor_choice_for_a_4pointed_rotating/,"Hello, I'm an engineering student and i'm currently carrying out my internship. Right now i'm working on the design of a ""self-loading rotating system"" which is one part of an automated weighing and sorting system (which i'm also working on).
After having designed the shape and dimensions of this self-loading rotating system, I must now put it in motion.

here""s a picture to illustrate the loading system.
https://pasteboard.co/GTxy4Z9.jpg

The tiles are stacked in the top vertical magazine. my goal is, once it is full, to rotate this system by 90° in less than 0.6s so that the vertical magazine becomes horizontal and can be unloaded. then the process repeats itself  with the magazine that was horizontal before the rotation. the rotation would occure at most once every 20s.
Here's another picture of the whole rotating system (the turquoise blue parts are static, they don't rotate with the system)
https://pasteboard.co/GTxyISt.jpg

There are several sizes of this system that have to be interchangeable, therefore i'm using the biggest to have a powerful enough motor.

I tried to calculate the required torque to travel the needed distance (quarter circle) in 0.6s by using the electromechanic i had last year.
Here's a link to my calculation steps: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vhx1gcw2tt

If my calculation are correct, i would require a 6Nm torque, although i think i forgot other formulas to define the required force.

My concerns are the following:
     1. Are my calculation correct ?
     2. What type of motor would be the most adapted for my system ? I'm currently looking at stepper motors, either with a small torque but with a reducer to compensate or only with high torque. These motors seem quite well fitted for my case but DC motors could also be good as there are only 4 positions.

TL:DR
What would be the best electric motor/motor-reducer to rotate by 90° in 0.6s a ~9kg~ system with a moment of inertia of 0.345kg*m² ?

Thanks beforehand for your help.

If I do, how can I do so gracefully?",internreadytoleave,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7csm0o/is_it_dumb_of_me_to_want_to_leave_my_internship/,"I'm a senior CS student and I've been an intern for 6 months.It's not awful and it pays well (1000 per month for part-time), but I just don't feel happy at all. Communication with my coworkers is less than ideal. The  employees I work with are usually remote and often don't communicate reliably. Sometimes they give me somewhat open-ended projects, then don't respond to questions I ask, so I am forced to do it my own way. Then it turns out wrong and I have to do it over. It's not like the biggest deal in the world, but it's disheartening/embarassing and has happened multiple times.
 One  of my coworkers is also really grumpy. If I screw up on something or ask too many questions, he gets very visibly annoyed with me. I seem to screw up a lot and don't feel confident in what I am doing. I know I won't get a job offer after this internship (even if I did, I don't think I'd take it).

I am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression and this job is just wearing at my mental health. I just absolutely dread/fear coming in sometimes. But I only have 4 months til I graduate. 

I have concerns with either possible decision:

1. I quit and miss out on having 10 months of work experience rather than my current 6 months(this is my only degree-related work experience) and possibly make my manager a bit upset (he complained about a previous intern leaving early than expected) and thus may not have a great reference. Though there is no official end-date for my internship- it is just assumed that I would be gone once I found an actual job. So it's not like there is a commitment I am breaking. Additionally, I can deal money fine wise until I graduate, but it would obviously help to have some extra. 

2. I stay and end up getting fired (my biggest worry- I honestly think this may happen) and having to explain myself when I get asked about it in interviews for new jobs. If not fired, I will still have to deal with the daily anxiety that I get from this job. I also will not have as much time to schedule possible interviews in between class and work and will have little time to prepare for them.

Would love some advice on what you think I should do. Am I being dumb for wanting to quit? If you think quitting might be a good idea, how can I say why I am leaving without sounding melodramatic and burning a bridge?

I thought my interviews went really well, and got particularly good feedback from my interview with one of their engineering managers. Answering one my questions, he even let slip something like ""You'll find out what that's like when you get here.""

So I think I *may* have only just missed out on being part of a group of 22 (source: HR interviews) interns for the Summer. 

The thing is, I have a friend who yesterday got an offer, but I know he's got a better one at a trendy Unicorn that's he's going to take. Also, he knows someone that got an offer too (they interviewed same day or something), but they're probably not going to take it either as they have an offer at AMZN.  

So my question is, is there a certain number of people, that should they take other offers, would cause the HR team to reach back out to candidates and offer them 'second chance draw' positions? 

Say if this group of 22 offers became ~18 following through, would they try and do a top up?

Well, fast-forward a year and a half, and I'm ready to leave. This job, the one that was supposed to be a great start to a career, is menial work with a public that treats me like shit. I did far, far more interesting work--for a much more pleasant public--as an unpaid intern than I do now. And the pay sucks. It's enough to support myself, and I'm grateful for that, but I don't feel like I can afford even small luxuries. I haven't seen a movie in theaters in over a year. Doesn't help that I have no one to see them with, as I've been trying and largely failing to make friends here. 

I've been looking for a job in another part of the country (a place I've lived before, and know I like) for almost a year now. I've gotten almost nothing but rejection emails. About three weeks ago, I got a Skype interview. Because of the timing (I suggested a morning interview several days in the future, which would give me time to prepare and set up a more interview-friendly place than my apartment; but they insisted on doing it 15 minutes after my shift ended) I had little time to prepare. I completely bombed the interview. I saw one of the interviewers making faces the whole time, and I got a barely-friendly rejection letter (""We have decided not to grant you an interview"") a week later. Since the mail takes 3-5 days to send, they must have written it the day after the interview. 

I thought I'd get another interview soon, since I'd sent out several applications around the same time, but one by one those employers all said no. I'm still waiting on a couple to get back to me, but I'm almost certain they'll say no too. I'm still looking for jobs every day, but I'm not finding any I'm qualified for. I've applied for every opportunity I can find, and now all the opportunities have dried up. 

I feel like I'm not getting anything better because I don't deserve anything better. I work hard at my current job. I've gotten good performance reviews. My managers all seem to like me. And yet no one else will hire me. I applied for a small promotion with my current employer near the beginning of this year, and the position was given to someone with more seniority. I feel like I'm never going to get out of here, I'm never going to get anything better. I'll be working this shitty job until I die. "
7cwo4w,64,2017-11-14,Should you move to California after graduating?,fuck012345678,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/7cwo4w/should_you_move_to_california_after_graduating/,"The idea of relocating to the bay area upon graduation from university is deeply ingrained into the culture of the University of Waterloo. Many undergraduate engineering and math students strive to get high paying internships in the bay area during their co-op terms, and by graduation, a large number take full time positions in the area. Based on engineering cohort exit surveys I've seen for various programs, the number of students taking a position in the bay area hovers around 30-40%ish depending on the cohort and how focused the given engineering program is on software development. The sentiment on this subreddit is that 'Cali jobs' pay more and are more technically challenging. There are new posts on this subreddit all the time from students anxious about whether they can get a co-op opportunity in the golden state. 'Can I get Cali in 2A? 1B?', 'Should I go Cali or Bust?', 'I feel like shit because all of my friends got Cali jobs this term and I didn't', etc. Is all the stress really worth it?

The following post is my criticism of the idea that everyone who is able to get a fulltime job in the bay area should take it. This post does not focus on other areas of the states like NYC or Seattle, as I know little about what it's like to live in those places, however some of the points in this post apply to these locations as well.

**Finances**

A lot of people convert their base salary in USD to CAD, and then say that they make X amount of money more than Canadians at the same salary. Is this a fair comparison? To really compare, we should compare net pay after rent and taxes. 
Let's compare salaries with realistic numbers. Based on a new grad survey I have, the average eng grad working in software in USA makes about 105k USD base, and the average eng grad working in software in Canada makes about 80k CAD base, typically in Waterloo or Toronto. Let's do the same analysis on these two salaries:
105k USD =&gt; $70,964 USD after tax

80k CAD =&gt; $62,816  CAD after tax

Now we need to take into account rent. This is a bit tricky, because rent is highly dependent on the individual. Do you live with roommates? Do you live with your landlord? (it's not worth it, trust me). To keep this simple, let's first assume that you want to live by yourself in a 1 bedroom apartment in the center of whatever city you live in.

The Rent

It's no secret that the rent is high in the bay area. We can simplify the bay area into two locations for analysis. San Francisco and South Bay. San Francisco has high rent but a better public transportation system. South bay has a weak public transportation system but lower rent. We will use San Jose as a fairly typical city in South Bay, and Waterloo and Toronto for the Canadian salary comparisons.

Let's do a fair comparison, of a 1 bedroom apartment in the city center for all four cities.
Based on my source [1] this comes out to:

[rent monthly cost] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in local currency] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in CAD]

$3,259.86 USD for SF =&gt; $31,846 USD =&gt; $40,590 CAD 

$1,703.08 CAD for Toronto =&gt; $42,379 CAD

$863.79 CAD for Waterloo =&gt;  $52,451 CAD

$2,372.09 for SJ =&gt; $42,499 USD =&gt; $54,169.44 CAD

This analysis suffices to show that just because salaries in California are on average about $20 - 25k higher, the actual net monetary gain is not as clear cut. You can repeat the analysis for people who would prefer to live with roommates and the rent numbers sums would be smaller. Let's do it. Taking the data for 3 bedroom apartment outside of the city center and dividing it by three, we get the following numbers:

[rent monthly cost] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in local currency] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in CAD]

$1485.41 USD near SF =&gt; $53139.08 USD =&gt; $67710 CAD 

$721.77 CAD near Toronto =&gt;  $54154.76 CAD

$495.61 CAD near Waterloo =&gt; $56868.68 CAD

$624.52 USD near San Jose =&gt; $63469.76 USD =&gt; $80883.96 CAD


My interpretation of these results is that you are going to make more money in the US relative to Canadians only if you rough it out with roommates and a long commute for a long period of time after graduation. Also, you can see that the net salaries in the local currency in the second rent comparison are very close. You will also have more expenses like groceries in the local currency which will drive the conversion rate benefit down. So you are also only going to make more money in the US if you time your conversions from USD to CAD well and move back to Canada after a few years. You are more or less speculating on the price of oil, as the CAD is kind of a 'petrocurrency' [2], and the price of oil is volatile. In my opinion these gains of USD to CAD are not very significant, and you're going to have to have lower quality of life in your twenties to get these small monetary benefits. Is it really worth it?

In addition, while San Jose / South bay may look like the best location financially, you also have to keep in mind that you will likely need to buy a car in south bay to have a life there. The public transportation system in South Bay is very poor. There's the San Jose light rail and the Caltrain which have stops which are very far apart, and then there are buses that run very infrequently. The point is that you're probably going to buy a car if you move to the south bay area permanently. There's not much way around it. Unless you want to be stuck at home all the time, or Uber everywhere, you need a car to actually have a life in the large suburban sprawl of south bay. So you need to buy a car, and owning a car comes with costs. Gas and auto insurance. In Canadian cities like Waterloo and Toronto, the public transportation system is much more developed and a car is not at all necessary. Gas prices are high and auto insurance varies considerably depending on if you're male or female, but is still high for young drivers. This is something to consider if you plan to move to the south bay.

As co-op students we do not look at the cost of housing as US interns often get stipends or corporate housing. We do not really even look at the tax rate too much, as we get a lot of our earnings back because of not working for a full year at a time. It is easy to overlook these factors and get the idea that US salaries are way higher than Canadian salaries for fulltime, but is that really the case? Admittedly you will make more money in the US if you make frugal decisions in life, but is it really worth the move? As co-ops, we quickly convert our earnings to CAD and see the benefit of the exchange rate every term when we move back and forth. Someone who spends 5 years in the bay area then moves back to Canada might have the experience of 5 years of frugal living with roommates and then slightly higher wealth in Canada. 

Some may mention high stock benefits another benefit of moving to the bay area.  You generally only get these if you work at a 'big 4' / top public company, and if you can get a job at the 'big 4' in California you can probably get one in Canada, or you can transfer your offer to a Canadian office. So I will not account for these in my analysis.

The one take away from this is that we should not take our 105k bay area salary and multiply it by the exchange rate, and imply that since we make $134k CAD, we are building wealth much faster than someone who stayed in Waterloo or Toronto. From the above analysis, we can see that this is simply not the case. Now that we've discussed the matter of finances, let's talk about some more subjective things. This will be mostly opinion based, so your millage may very.

**Quality of Life**

I can't speak for San Francisco, but as someone who has done co-op terms in South Bay, frankly, it's not a great place to live for someone in their 20's. As I previously mentioned, the public transportation system is very underdeveloped. This means that if you want to get around, you need to have either a car or pay a lot in Uber fees. And there's also... just not much to really do here. It's a massive suburban sprawl filled with corporate campuses and apartment complexes. In my experience, it pales in comparison to a city like Toronto. It is comparable to a Waterloo with basically no public transportation. San Francisco is probably better but has its own issues like crime, and the rent is insanely high. Without a car in South Bay you're essentially like a senior citizen, too old to drive, stuck in their own house. Given the high rent prices, you will likely be living with roommates for a long time after you graduate, and you will have to buy a car and pay insurance premiums if you live in South Bay. Will your quality of life really be better if you accept a bay area fulltime offer? I would argue no, at least not in the short term.

**Career Trajectory and the Future**

Another common idea that I hear all the time is that the bay area provides more opportunities for career growth or more interesting work. Actually I somewhat agree with this. It seems to me that bay area companies are much more serious about software development, and value software skillsets off of the generic web development path that don't get as much use in Canada like machine learning, distributed systems, networks, etc. Of course there are companies in Canada that require these skills as well, though.

The thing about moving up the career ladder in the bay area and getting promotions here is that you will have to keep in mind that you will likely want to move out of the state eventually. Settling down in the bay area, meaning getting married and having kids, is expensive, not only if you want to buy a house (it's near impossible), but daycare is expensive here as well. The argument I typically hear is 'work in the bay area, earn USD and come back to Canada to reap the benefits later'. So if you follow that mentality you will have to have a 'temporary' view to your entire life in the bay area.  Your friendships will be temporary, as you will have to move away in X years. Your employment will be temporary, even though you're a fulltime employee. You will have to uproot your life in 5-10 years when you decide to move out. That might mean restarting at another company and having to climb the corporate ladder again, or you may be able to get a senior position due to your experience. If you're the type of person that can easily adapt to change, which I assume most people here are because of co-op then this may or may not be a big deal. Really depends on the person. But I will say, restarting your social life in your late twenties may be difficult, and you may struggle to make deep friendships like you can make in high school / university with people you are forced to spend time with.

**Family and Relationships**

If you're a Canadian citizen, living in the bay area means living far away from your family, and probably most of your friends too. As a new graduate, you will typically have about three weeks of PTO, maybe 4 if you're lucky, or “unlimited” if you're unlucky. With three weeks of vacation, it's likely that you will be able to take at maximum 3 but more realistically 1-2 trips back to Canada per year. If you're considering living in California for say 5 years after graduation, you should ask yourself: am I willing to see my parents 5-10 more times in the next five years? Because that's a realistic estimate of how much time you will actually be able to spend with them. Some people are okay with that, some are not. If you have a girlfriend in Canada, the same logic applies, unless they want to move to the bay area with you. That's pretty unlikely unless your girlfriend works in tech, because who in their right mind would want to move here without a huge paycheck? Also, what happens if your parents get ill and need someone to take care of them? The bottom line is that if you spend a long time in the bay area you will be alienated from your family, and you will have very few opportunities to interact with them except over the phone / skype.

Finally, I conclude that moving to the bay area is not worth it, at least for me personally. It's marginally better in terms of finances, way worse in terms of quality of life and personal relationships. I made this post because in my early years of university I used to be so obsessed over getting a high paying tech job and doing co-ops in California, but to me the bay area is very overhyped and not at all worth the move for fulltime. I can't believe how naive I was. It might be worth it as a co-op, but as a fulltime, I don't think it is. I wanted to share my opinion so that some first and second year students can have a broader view of what it's like to actually move to the bay area and have some realistic expectations about living here and what it means for your future after graduation.

The interview process was very pleasant, people there seem great, and the product seems cool, but those are not distinguishing characteristics (in comparison to many other companies). I've requested more phone conversations with engineers so I can have a better perspective of the team I would be working with, but other than that I don't know what else I should be looking for.

For context, I interned at Google last summer, so I thought that I may want to try something new, but I am interviewing/have offers with two other Big 4s right now and LinkedIn. I want to make sure that if I go to a startup, it is somewhere I would grow/learn as much (or more) as an engineer before I decide to take it, especially since the compensation may be slightly lower than typical big company intern salaries. I also have friends who have horror stories about startups that were poorly run, and I would prefer not to spend my summer being in an environment like that. 

For anyone who has worked at a startup, what was your thought process in choosing that company, especially over a big name company? What kind of factors do you consider? What kind of resources do you use to find more information about these companies (other than the obvious Reddit/Google search and Glassdoor)? How do you gauge the growth potential/stability of a startup? Any obvious red flags that I should be aware of? How do you compare different startups? (I have an on-site with another startup called Affirm in SF next week, as well, but, again, not much information about their internship program online.)"
7cxm9c,1,2017-11-14,"I'm stressed about which job I should take. I have to figure it out ASAP, and I figured I could ask you guys for advice!",HeywardYouBlowMe,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cxm9c/im_stressed_about_which_job_i_should_take_i_have/,"A little background about myself: 
23/M, just graduated in May with a dual-major in marketing and business management. 

A few weeks ago, I applied to an entry level marketing analytics position. Fast-forward to last week, I forgot about that company since they hadn't gotten back to me, so I continued to apply to more jobs anyways. 

In regards to the other job, a recruiting company contacted me about an analyst position somewhere else. At first, I dismissed it, but after take some more time to think about it, I figured why not. So I went in for the interview through this recruiting company. 

Now, the first company called me and said that I was not a good fit for their marketing analytics position, but they would offer me a marketing analytics internship on a contract, hourly-pay basis, and if I would do well, they would convert me to full time (similar to how recruiting companies work, where they make you work on contract with hourly pay. Same idea). 

In the meantime, I spoke to one of my mentors from my community, he advised me to email the company that offered me the internship position and to tell them that I have already been offered a different position at a different company, and to let me know as soon as possible. 

I need a way to email back the company that offered me the internship position and see if they can set up an interview by later this week, because my first day at the other position through the recruiting company would be this Monday. 

Pros And Cons For Recruiting Company position:
Pros: Large company, looks great on resume, seems like a good analyst position to gain experience.
Cons: The pay is crap. And of course, with all recruiting companies, they take a small cut of the salary. I tried negotiating the pay, and they budged a little bit, and that was it. Still not much **at all**, but I guess I've got to start somewhere. 

Pros And Cons For Marketing Analytics Internship Position: 
Pros: I don't know for sure, but I'm almost 100% that the pay would be more than the recruiting company. (Both contract, hourly positions) and I'm more familiar with the commute, the position is more in line with what I studied in school, so I'm more familiar with it (I'm aware that not everyone goes on to work in the same field that they studied in college, but still). 

Cons: It's kind of a random company, so it doesn't look as good on my resume, but I'm thinking that bottom line, an analyst position would be doing the same analyst work (computer skills) across the board, so I guess it's a good learning experience as well.

What do you guys think? If I do end up going with the marketing analytics internship, I would have to schedule an interview by Thursday the latest, since as I mentioned before, my first day with the job through the recruiting company would be on Monday.

Thank you!!!

**TL;DR**: 
Company 1: Large company, looks great on resume, seems like a good analyst position to gain experience. But... The pay is crap. And of course, with all recruiting companies, they take a small cut of the salary. 

Company 2: Figuring almost 100% that the pay would be more than Company 1. (Both contract/intern, hourly positions), I'm more familiar with the commute to Company 2, the position is more in line with what I studied in school, so I'm more familiar with it  "

7cyh86,1,2017-11-14,What you need to know about working for MSP's.,TreMatt,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7cyh86/what_you_need_to_know_about_working_for_msps/,"Most of the Managed Service Providers that I know work as outsourced IT departments.  This is the MSP definition that I will be referring to in this rant.  

I wanted to write this because there are probably some folks out there who are working for a managed service providers and absolutely love it.  This isn't for you.

Background: I had zero IT experience three years ago and was graduating college looking for work.  I was hired as an intern dispatcher for the techs at a small MSP.  I finished the internship and was hired as a full employee after 6 months.  I accomplished this by showing up each day, learning as much as I could very quickly, and providing decent customer service.

6 months after my internship the tier one tech quit for a better job.  After some lobbying I slipped into his position and took over as first line help desk.  A year later the tier 2 tech quit for a better job and I took over his position on a ""Temporary"" basis for a slight pay increase.  I was now help desk AND junior sysadmin.  This continued for a year until I was totally burned out.  Working 60-70 hours a week trying to support the tier 3 guy and everything else.  We were two dudes supporting over a thousand endpoints spread out across the state.

I started applying to some jobs in the area and was picked up as an in house system administrator at a company that really valued and invested in IT.  My weeks are 40 hours.  I spend at least a quarter of that time hanging out and chatting with people.  I put in the minimum and my boss is always impressed in what I can get done.  I do all of this for a 30% raise over my last job.

So what did I learn?
MSP's can really grind you down but you will gain a return on investment in experience greater than just the time you work for them.  If you are trying to get into IT work, find a MSP apply for the lowest level to get in.  The turnover is huge in these companies so someone will always leave a seat open above you.

Beyond that what I have seen from other people in this sub about working for MSP's is pretty accurate.  You are a solution mill and you will never make everyone happy.  The MSP model is inherently flawed in that you are providing a service to companies who believe technology is not their core competency.  You will never be truly valued for your abilities because you are just a vendor.  

This leads to my ultimate job advice for all IT professionals.  If you feel overworked and undervalued it's probably because you work for a company that does not believe technology is their core competency.  

If you work for an MSP and feel like you are burning out don't be afraid to start applying other places.  I got my current job by listing specific technologies I had experience with and found out that most companies will be blown away by this.  In-house IT can be a great job if you find the right company. 

So how can you determine how a company value's their technology? Ask them how many users/endpoints they support and how much they have paid for their infrastructure.  I went from supporting 1000 endpoints with the cheapest hardware any company can get away with to 250 endpoints and a multi-million dollar budget just in IT.  You get what you pay for.  I am willing to bet the more a company invests in IT the better your quality of life will be.

Rant over."

I am a junior in computer science and I am super interested in machine learning. I was fortunate enough to have a machine learning internship last summer and I am also doing research work in machine learning. I got an A in my Intro to AI course.

I was wondering if it's possible to get into a machine learning job even without a grad degree? My university offers a grad level machine learning course but I can take it if the professor thinks I am capable enough. Though, this being a grad level course, I'm sure my GPA will take quite the hit. Nevertheless, it is something I'm interested in.

What I'm not interested in, though, is going to grad school. So do you guys think people with only a bachelor's degree can get good machine learning positions?

In my previous internships I did have some programming experience where I had to use python, sql and Java. I didnt have to do anything too complex, most of my work was rather simple. So maybe that isnt very relevant. 

But in my last internship I worked at a fintech firm which was focused on blockchain. Interning there made me realise that I wanted to build my career in the blockchain space. However I realised most companies were looking for technical talent rather than business development skills. It seemed to me that the only way to build a career in this would be to be a software developer. 

Most companies dont really need finance majors but people with a computer science background. So I have started to learn solidity for the past 2 months and learnt to utilise the web3 library to interact with the ethereum blockchain. 

I know that I will be always at a disadvantage compared to people from a Computer Science background. But what can I do at least from now till the next two to three years where I can bridge the knwoledge gap ? I realise that computer science is definetly much harder to grasp than finance.

7d4mky,1,2017-11-15,Trying to work out my plan,tehjrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7d4mky/trying_to_work_out_my_plan/,"Current situation:

I'm 35 years old and just transferred 60 credit hours into Arizona State University for Software Engineering (online) from my local college.  I live on my own in the Atlanta area and work full time.  I've been in the same job for 12 years (technical support) and became interested in programming several years ago.  I'm also part of a small startup (just four friends currently) and am writing software for that.    
&amp;nbsp;

Programming experience:

I would say my programming experience thus far is 'weird'.  I use that word because I wrote a restful API in .NET Core that connects to postgres for it's data and implements JWT for authorization/authentication yet I haven't taken a data structures class yet and have no idea what a hashmap is.  I have some experince with docker (API builds into a container), git (I use master/dev/feature branches), and linux (do all my coding in VSCode and vim).  I've also got some html/css/js experience from writing a tools backend page that consumes the API in VueJS.  Even after all that I still label myself as a beginner.

&amp;nbsp;


My plan:

I had never considered doing an internship before because I assumed they were all very low paid if not all unpaid, had never really looked into it.  I was speaking with a friend who's worked in the tech industry (Google, Square, Lyft) and he told me that internships at larger tech companies pay pretty well.  I did more research and found this to be true, opening the door to doing an internship.  This was only a few weeks ago so i'm in the beginning stages of planning some big life changes.  I want to quit my current job and intern on the west coast at a big tech company sometime.  I'm not really sure when, I take data structures next semester (spring).  I really want to wait until that's done so that I can hit studying for interviews really hard.  I guess my current goal is to come out of school with a degree in SE, a really prominent internship, and some side projects.  I want to give myself the best chance at coming back to Atlanta and landing a good job.  I welcome all feedback and any questions.

&amp;nbsp;

Questions:

Do most people begin applying for jobs DURING the internship?  I'm a little confused as to the logistics of this.  If I come back to Atlanta after my internship I have no place to live and no job.  How does the flow normally go for someone quitting their job to intern and then needing a job after the internship is done?

Are all internships done during the summer?

If fall internships exist, are they usually less busy?  When would I apply for a fall internship?

Am I expected to take classes while doing the internship or do people take that semester off?

If I'm not ready to intern next year, when would I start applying for 2019 internships?

How do I show off the code i'm writing for the small startup when it's all closed source?  I want to show how i'm managing my git workflow, using VSTS for tasks and bugs, and buiding/releasing.  Would just talking about it be enough or would someone need to see?"

I did internships in each all throughout my education so Ive got plenty of good solid experience on my resume. I did a ton of coding while in my undergrad and found that picking up new languages any bosses asked me to came fairly quickly to me. I recently saw a job post for a combo coding/law job that really piqued my interest (but its more of the IT law consulting variety and not an attorney position). I know 3 of the 4 languages they're asking for and have most of the other skills/knowledge they listed but there are definitely a few small gaps. Should I stick with my current path while I teach myself these skills and then try to transition? Or is there a way to word a cover letter to let someone know that you aren't at 100% but you are eager to face the challenge of learning that last 20% and they can bet on you to do it quickly and enthusiastically?

7d5nbb,0,2017-11-15,ROI of an non-elite MBA for becoming Marketing VP?,sconesycid3r,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/7d5nbb/roi_of_an_nonelite_mba_for_becoming_marketing_vp/,"I'm an in-house marketing director in a major US city. I've been at this job for about two months, have been in marketing for about 7 years. I intend to stay in this job for awhile, but quite frankly, wasn't expecting to be at a director level yet at this point in my career and being here now has me thinking about a few years from now when I'm ready to start looking into VP marketing roles.

&amp;nbsp;

So I figured I'd get an MBA with a marketing focus, as my undergrad was journalism. I was hired to write by a large news organization right after graduation but quickly became involved in the marketing team and ended up really loving it, and being really good at it. So I stayed a few years, got a few promotions, and when I left there I ended up going to a marketing firm, was promoted a bunch there, managed some teams with great success, then moved on to this new job I have now. 

&amp;nbsp;

So far, my experience, work ethic, leadership skills and ideas have been enough that working and finding work has always been easy for me, but I'm concerned that the higher up the ladder I try to move the more it's going to matter that I don't actually have any formal marketing or business training, just on-the-job learning, webinars and conferences and the like and a bit of a knack for the industry I guess. I'm worried that I've reached a point where I'm not going to advance any more or won't be able to move on to more lucrative opportunities.  

&amp;nbsp;

But my undergrad GPA was... not great. I was soooo sure I knew what my career path was going to be so I put a lot of effort into the classes I thought were most important/enjoyable, extra curricular leadership roles and internships. I hit a really rough patch in my life and let some of my grades suffer as a result my sophomore year. Did better junior and senior year, but still, subpar GPA overall. But have my life in much better order now, plus all the work experience (and marketing experience for a local non-profit I'm on the board for) that I'm not personally worried that I won't be able to keep up in school, but I know convincing schools of that is going to be damn hard. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that's going to be a huge problem for me as I apply to programs, especially if I apply to any good ones. I plan to stay in this city long-term so I was looking at local programs, not really realizing initially how much the school you go to really matters for this. But now I'm getting very nervous that this might not be worth it for me if I don't go into a top-level school. Especially since I'm already in the career path I want and I'm already making $75k. And I don't want to leave my job, I want to do a part-time program so I'm not necessarily looking to have a job offer right out of school, though I'd definitely be open to opportunities that paid closer to market rate for my role. But mostly my goal with the degree is to have it so that in a few years I can take that next step up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also still in debt from undergrad but finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and the programs I want are all in the $60k-$90k range, so the thought of taking on so much debt again induces a lot of fear. I'm trying to save for a house and all that good adult stuff. I thought about doing a cheaper, online program, but it seems like if I want this process to mean anything at all I need to go all in on a big program. And I can't tell at this point if that's really worth it.

&amp;nbsp;

So any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated! Am I going to render myself irrelevant to the industry if I don't go back to school, or am I going to waste my time and money by getting a degree that's not going to advance my career? 

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr - I'm a marketing director who wants to eventually move on to be a marketing VP, but I have an unrelated bachelor's and a low undergrad GPA. Will an MBA at this point in my career, likely not from an elite school, help me advance, or waste my time/money?**"

So lately I've been feeling disappointed, mostly in myself. 

I'm a junior studying CS and I knew this was my last chance to get a solid internship, but I guess I just missed out on so much opportunity. I didn't even get interviews at any of the top tech companies, but at the same time, I didn't ask for any referrals and I didn't make sure my resume was adequate. I can only blame myself for that.

It might have to do with the expectations I've set for myself, but also because I've always wanted to have a good career. I go to a top10 CS university and many of my friends and peers are getting offers from the big4 and other tech companies. 

The problem is that because I spend so much time with them, I know that I'm just as smart and capable. My GPA is above average and I do well in class, but I'm just not ambitious enough when I need to be. 

I only have a mediocre internship offer from a bank that, from asking on this sub, is not a good experience. They didn't even give me a technical interview before giving me an offer, so I can imagine the level of talent there isn't great.

I don't know what I should do. I've already applied to many of the companies that are still hiring, but I haven't been getting many responses. I might just settle for the offer I have and focus on coursework for now, but I know I might hate myself for it.

Thanks for hearing me out. Any thoughts on what I should do?"

I recently moved to downtown Calgary for an internship. My building did not provide parking, so I applied for a residential parking pass. With this pass I am allowed to park in any time restricted zone, minus any ParkingPlus Zone (zone where you have to pay). 

This last Thursday my car was towed and impounded in the city lot. The reason for being towed was due to the fact that I had 8 unpaid parking tickets. It turns out I had been parking in the ParkingPlus Zone by my house, but I didn't realize it. However, since my car is registered out of province I never received notice of any of these tickets and there were no tickets left on my car.  

If I had known I was parking in the prohibited zone, I would not have continued to park in it. Since I wasn't aware of these tickets, I had no reason to think I was breaking the parking laws.

I appealed these tickets, but my appeal was denied on the grounds that they had the right to ticket me for these tickets, since I was breaking the law. 

They said I can go to provincial parking court to fight the tickets and go through the city claims department to fight my impound fees. 

Do I have a case? Can I fight on the grounds that I was oblivious to any of these tickets and would not have continued to park in the prohibited zone after receiving the first ticket?

Any help is appreciated.

I'm currently finishing a MBA and in order to obtain my diploma I need to complete an internship upon next semester.

In my interview I specifically ask the employers if they think that the internship they offer could lead to a real job at the end. It's particularly important for me since I will be done with college and I will need a job fast after that to pay my debts and all that.

I've been offered a job today, but the company told me without a doubt that they will not be able to offer me a position at the end of the internship for budget reasons. 

I still have a few options and a few interviews set up so I still hope to find some place that really meet my needs. That being said, if I refuse that offer I might end up with no internship next semester which would lead to me not being able to get my diploma.

What I am asking myself right now is: is it possible okay to accept their offer and then call it off if or when I find something more suitable to my needs?

DEADLINE IN 2 DAYS.",dj4eagle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7d7v30/i_have_a_job_offer_in_another_state_and_i_am_very/,"Hello Reddit, 

I am graduating in May 2018 with my degree in Computer Engineering. I have had a Software Engineering offer for a large tech company in CITY A, and have had a fantastic experience working there as an intern. The salary/benefits are great, I love the city, and all of my family is close by.

I was going to accept, but applied for an Engineering Firm in CITY B. The role is completely different, and instead focuses on developing Engineering Leadership skills, with options to pursue skills in Technical Sales, Marketing, Product Support, Systems Engineering, etc. I had a great interview visit to CITY B, and was impressed with the Company. I just received an offer. I would be taking about an $4,000 pay cut, no real sign on bonus, and the higher cost of living in CITY B. 

I have always been hesitant about making a career in Software, even though I really do enjoy doing it, mainly because the future of automation, the sheer competition for tech jobs, etc. I am largely a people person, and can't stand the idea of wasting my life away at a desk, no matter how much I like it. I wan't to be interacting with clients, and my long term career goal is to move into management for a technical company; this job in CITY B appears to provide opportunities much more in line with my goals, and a lot of flexibility in being able to explore my interests. 

The slight pay cut isn't too concerning, but I feel tied back to CITY A. I am my mother's only child, and although she isn't elderly, I am the only person she really has. She doesn't take care of herself at all, has health problems (being managed fine), and can't even emotionally handle me being away at school. Also, my girlfriend of 2 years will be starting a 3 year doctorate program in CITY A. My plan was to marry her after she finished school, but I honestly have doubts that our relationship could survive the distance. She says she would be okay with me leaving, but we have had distance issues and communication mismatches (different expectation levels) when we were 2 hours apart over a summer, let alone 2 states away. If I was moving back, the story would be different, but if I was starting an entire new life in a young city, I think I would be interested in dating other people. I love her, but that is just what I feel, as bad as it is. I love my relationship, life in CITY A, and would be happy at my CITY A software job as far as I can tell, but the idea of being able to move away from home, pursue this job that REALLY interests me, and start my own life is hard to give up. I have done long distance before with an ex, but that was for a year, we were able to visit occasionally and power through it, and the relationship fell apart a year later we were back together; I'd be open to try it though. 

The last thing I want to do is live with the regret of missing an opportunity, and I can't tell if a year from now my S.O and I will still be together anyways. Please give me some ideas, perspectives, and stories to think about!!!"

I say Austin Texas and he says The State of California in general is better.
But what I've found is that the cost of living is much greater in cities where  a software engineering degree is good to have. While the pay is better in California than in Texas, it seems as if the pay you get doesn't keep up with the cost of Living. The categories for this are:
Cost of Living ,
Better Colleges,
Prices of Tuition,
Better Opportunities.

I've researched abit and found that Austin is a better city because the cost of living is cheaper than cities like San Jose, San Francisco, Long Beach, and Los Angeles compared to Austin.
UT Austin is also very high ranking for schools related to Software Engineering and the citiy is popular for its technology.
The prices of Tuition are the about same from UT Austin and Places I would attend like CSU San Bernardino and Long Beach.
And there are many internships and jobs for my field.

Do you guys agree or is there something I'm missing. Please let me know.

7dbvke,10,2017-11-16,Ex Flatmate is not paying the Nebenkosten. What legal Actions can I take?,ahmoutlaw,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/7dbvke/ex_flatmate_is_not_paying_the_nebenkosten_what/,"Hello r/Germany, 

I am a foreigner in Germany who has a problem with his foreigner ex flat mate. I need your advice regarding the legal actions I can take against him.  

I was the Hauptmieter and thus responsible for the flat and everything. My flatmate who stayed with me for 2 years is refusing to pay the extra Nebenkosten for the year 2015/2016. I am extremely upset and want to take legal action against him (reasons below). 

The Details are as follows: 

He lived with me for two years and left the flat in Aug 2016. Just before that in June 2016 we received the Nebenkosten bills. We had to pay 1250 euros more. He payed his due share. Now when he was leaving, I spoke to him personally and then wrote an email asking him explicitly to confirm that

1. He will share the extra bills cost for his period of stay.
2. He will share the amount deducted from the security, in case that happens.
 
He agreed verbally and in written form per email. Then I transferred his complete security deposit back. I was just happy that he is leaving now. 

Now I left that Apartment in July this year and finally received the Nebenkosten details a couple of weeks back. When I contacted him to pay his share (around 500 Euros), he came up with some bizarre reasoning citing Events from 2014 and saying that its unfair that I am asking him to share the costs. I am just extremely pissed off at his fucking cunty behavior. 

The Thing is that we already discussed all the bills and calculation (even per Email) from 2015/2016 and he transferred the extra bills per bank transfer to me. That means I understood everything and payed for it. Everything was spoken, discussed and agreed in writing. And now he is coming up with absolutely groundless points and trying to renegotiate/don’t pay the money.   


The reasons I am extremely upset by his behavior are the following:´

•	This guy was actually a recommendation from a friend of mine. 

•	I actually recommended him for an internship at the company I was working at, helped him throughout with his application and he got hired. 

•	Then he requested me if he can stay in my flat, as my flat mate at that time was leaving, and I accommodated him even not knowing him so well. 

•	He proved to be an absolute disaster when it comes to finances and cost sharing. But I controlled my behavior and didn’t make a big scene for little sums of money. 

•	I regularly host my friends for dinners and parties where this guy always joined but never ever contributed one penny. I also never asked him to share any costs as I thought – and stated to him- that he was a student etc. That’s my standard behavior and its not that I am trying to cash it here. Just highlighting my attitude towards him. 

•	He was almost always transferring a few euros less for the rent and when I confronted him after a while, he gave reasons like “Oh, I forgot” or “I misunderstood” etc. But it just can’t be for a year that you don’t understand the rent and costs of your living. 

•	We had an agreement – verbal and in writing. And now he brought up some bullshit stories from years ago and basically absolutely refusing to pay.  

•	I had to cover the deduction of 300 euro in the security deposit and also the internet (on my name) which had still 6 months to go before contract cancellation. So I have to pay more than 200 euros for that as well. 

He fucking did this to the guy who was solely responsible for his internship, gave him place to stay, accommodated him by all means and have written agreements with him. He is just fucking corrupt and without a bit of honesty.   

So this is the whole story guys. Could you please tell me what rights do I have legally and what can be done against him? I want to take a maximum action. 


Thanks a lot.

7dbvor,6,2017-11-16,How to get life back on track after trauma?,ThrowAway11162017,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dbvor/how_to_get_life_back_on_track_after_trauma/,"Three years ago I had a very serious flare up of Crohn's disease. I had just began my sophomore year of university when my symptoms became serious and the disease severely impacted my semester. I went to the ER at eight or nine times and was frequently kept overnight at the hospital. I was on a variety of medications to try to manage my symptoms but I just grew more and more sick. When I finally went home for winter break, I had grown so ill I needed surgery. Instead of returning for the spring semester, I stayed home for a second surgery and overall recovery.

It's also worth mentioning that near the beginning of my illness, my grandmother passed away. And after I was mostly recovered from my second surgery in early summer, I was in a physical accident that resulted in relatively minor but very painful injuries and a concussion.

Since then, my life has been a mess. I went back to school the following fall, but my grades were poor and I dropped two classes. Every semester since then, my grades have gotten worse and I've been put on academic probation twice (which I've successfully appealed claiming medical and mental health concerns). I've seen four counselors, been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, and talked to my pastor. I just can't seem to get my life back on track. My professors have been gracious but they're clearly frustrated with apparent lack of interest in even trying.

I've changed majors twice, thinking maybe I just wasn't focused on the right things. I even took an internship across the country from my hometown thinking maybe a change of scenery would help. I'm involved in extracurriculars and in my community but I only ever make it to half the things I sign up for.

I've made it through the past three years only because of the graciousness of professors and employers who gave me extra chances until the semester ended or I found a new job. My life is a wreck and I don't know how to fix it.

It feels like something essential in me got broken during that awful year and no amount of medication or bed rest is going to fix it.

I don't even know why I made a throw away account for this but I have such a deep sense of shame about all of this. Whenever I try to talk to someone in person about everything, I end up downplaying things and try to make it sound like things are getting better when they're not.

I'd appreciate any advice you may have. "
7dcw1a,0,2017-11-16,Python Plus What Equals Data Science?,Pythonidaer,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7dcw1a/python_plus_what_equals_data_science/,"TLDR: Python 3 rookie working hard to escape retail sales to find first job in data science.

...

How’s it going, Reddit?

     Here’s a short story. I graduated SHS in 2009. I took my time off to develop skills in the restaurant, sales, and marketing industries before sprinting back to school. I graduated NSCC this year with a Liberal Arts Associates, which included taking a Stats 101 course.

     Here’s a longer story.

     I realized tech was my direction. I like working with teams, but also working remotely in cafe’s, because I care about my mental, physical, and spiritual health. Working in an industry such as data science would allow me to work on meaningful projects, afford housing and further education, and would allow me to exercise, sleep in, or whatever else I’d need to do to stay on my A-game.

     After working as a resumé collector at a job fair focused on cybersecurity, computer engineering and the like, I was granted some time to network. I learned from a recruiter that with 2 internships and a Bachelors in Comp Sci, I should be able to land a job making $60k a year, easily. This makes sense, because I live in Boston, but there’s just one problem: I live in an apartment and work full-time! I don’t have the money to afford a graduate degree!

     Anyways, after graduating in May, I started putting the pieces together. I went to General Assembly and took an intro to data science workshop. I acquired their resources and syllabus for the full-time, ten-week, $16k course on data science.I listened to two podcasts: Becoming a Data Scientist, and CodeNewbie, as I drove across three states for work (vendor selling, training, and merchandising computers). I bought LPTHW, and picked up many but not all the basics of 2. I went on Codecademy, took Python 101 and 201 workshops at GA(ga.co), and earned a certificate on edX.org(Intro to Python for Data Science). 

     After taking the Data Camp/edX course, I realized I should only be learning P3. So I bought the Learn Python 3 The Hard Way book, which comes with videos, and am about to get approved PTO for today, which I’m stoked about because all I want to do is learn until I can get a job that lets me feel happy. 

     With my dual-monitor setup, I’m printing scripts after I write them, analyzing them after running them, on paper, just to make sure I understand what’s going on in each line. My goal is to redesign my daily caloric intake calculator to P3, so I can use numpy and convert lists to arrays, and eventually create diet plans/meal planning/recipes through script, more for using skills I’ve learned in my own way than for any type of business idea. I’ll post it on GitHub once I’m through. Then, when I’ve finished this book, I’ll go through it once last time and break all the code I’ve written, so I can learn more about bugs, Errors, and debugging scripts.

     This week I find out if I’m funded $5k for a data science certificate, but this is dragging on so let me Boolean my point back to the title:

certificate = 0
python_learned = “in process”
python_learned = 0

     If certificate == True:
         print(“pass, and find job”)
     else:
         print(“apply for FAFSA, go to SSU for 3.5 years”)

     If python_learned == True:
         print(“learn SQL, other skills to land 1st tech job”)
     else:
         print(“ask Reddit what skills land entry level job”)

...

     Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’ve heard that startups are a great way to get your toes wet, but I’m not sure what types of skills I’ll need at first. I’ve almost considered going in a direction I didn’t have in mind, which would be learning about how Python leads to building websites, but my concern is that if I learn enough python to appropriately transition to learning something like SQL on my own, I might forget how to do some of the things I am learning, if it takes months or even more than a year to land my first tech job. That’s also why I’m hesitant to learn JavaScript. It’s almost common sense that I stick with one language, until I’m either in a workplace that requires I learn it, am in school and they’re teaching it, or I’m finally in a career that allows me to do the things I want to do, which would likely include learning a new language, since falling behind in tech is really easy nowadays.

     Reddit, what are your thoughts? Other than my soon-acquired Python and past-acquired Stats 101 skills and education, what other hats must I wear before I have a plausible chance of landing my first entry level tech job?

Thanks 😎"

I'm currently having a career crisis right now. I am currently studying computer science and am in my first year as a junior.

The unfortunate part is that I am now almost completely certain that computer science is not my passion. The only reason I am even in this field is I was preselected for a program called MECOP in my senior year of high school. What this means is I am guaranteed two six-month paid internships (~ $20,000 each) with computer science companies in my junior and senior years of college, as long as I am majoring in some sort of STEM field. I had mild interest in computer science in high school so this is what I chose. However, I found out quickly that I did not enjoy programming as much as I thought I did, and the stress from having to keep a high GPA for my internship caused me to do very badly in my classes and develop depression. 

Therapy and pills have helped with depression, but I cannot help but think that the underlying problem is that I am constantly learning about a field that I do not enjoy. Ever since sophomore-junior year, I have been skipping a majority of my classes, and doing the bare minimum to pass with the grades needed to keep my internship - even if that means cheating or copying code to get by. The only reason I am staying in my major is so I can get my internships and help my parents pay for college, and I feel as if I am too far in to quit now.

My social life is almost-nonexistent, and I fear that by keeping this up my depression will only get worse and my future will be gone. 

Dropping out of college would disappoint my parents greatly, but they won't disown me. I'm afraid that this is the only chance I have to get a good career, and if I drop out I won't be able to get any more scholarships if I return, and I have no idea what other major I would pursue if I did drop out. 

So reddit, you are the only people I can turn to for help at this point. What do you think I should do?"

Other possibly relevant details: I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at a small unknown US school. Somewhere around a 3.5 gpa. I have had one previous internship at a big well-known tech company (not big 4). I'm fine with being unpaid, I just want some more work experience.

Are there companies that take part-time interns or is it rare to find these? I've looked around and have seen people talking about Spotify, Mojang, Dice, Ericcson, etc. but they mostly don't advertise any spring or part-time internships. Should I email the company directly? How many hours a week will they be expecting from me? Am I correct in thinking that I would find more success targeting smaller companies (as this internship would not be the norm)?

I'm a junior sysadmin, straight out of school. 

I got a internship at a local company, and i'm loving it, but I've been having some problems for which I could use all the input I can get.

The problem is in my procedures for handling calls, changes, getting results. I've got a lot of motivation, and I really want to do all the jobs I get handed to me, and be proactive and find lots more for myself as well. 

I however find myself unable to do this, and I'm pretty sure that this is because of my procedures, that I don't really have. Add to this that I often forget to document stuff, since I've never had to, and you have a ""small"" improvement point. 

I'm working on creating my own procedures, but i'd love to get feedback from experienced sysadmins. 

What are your procedures, what do you do when you see a new call? What do you do when you need to prepare a change? How do you keep things flowing and moving? What are the general procedures you apply to your daily life? 

Do you have checklists? standardized forms you made for yourself to help yourself? Maybe an order of things you always do whenever you start something? Anything is appreciated!

I'm wondering if there are other examples of such schools. 

Realistically I'm probably trying to get into web development or QA and I'm starting from scratch as an almost 30 year old guy with a family. I can move for a degree but only if it looks like something promising, and unpaid internships are out of the question. I'm much more interested in the practical side of programming than the theoretical, and while I think the theoretical is interesting, I'd rather be taking classes on concepts I'll actually encounter in the workplace.

All of my family think I’m graduating in December, and an hour ago I met with my department supervisor who told me I will not pass this semester. I’ve considered killing myself before, and when I was a teenager I tried to suffocate myself every night for two years with my blankets, but right now it’s more real than it’s ever been. I have two bottles of Zoloft at home, plus two bottles of melatonin, about 8 bottles of NyQuil/DayQuil, plus other ibuprofen and stuff in my first aid bag. I’m sitting in my car in the University parking deck, I know where all those bottles are in my apartment, I just want to go home, down all that medicine, and drift off to sleep and die peacefully. I texted my husband about my semester, asked him not to text me, turned off notifications from him, and texted him that I love him. He will be home around 4:15. I hate thinking about how sad he will be. My university supervisor said I could graduate in a year if I take some remedial classes, but it’s hard to hold on to that. I’m studying to be a teacher, and I’m currently in an internship. I love those kids so much. I want to teach. But now not being able to get my licensure means I won’t be able to teach. The one thing I want to do in life. I know if I make it through the night, I’ll be fine. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow. Talk me off the edge. Make my notifications blow up so that I don’t have the time to drink all that NyQuil and end it. I need someone else to tell me that I have a future. I need help.

I am a recent graduate (May 2017) trying to find an entry level cyber security or networking job. I have applied to 80+ places and have received only one callback. The town I am in isn't really an IT hotspot and entry level jobs are extremely limited. I am able to move ANYWHERE in the US and I feel that I have extremely good interview skills if anyone would give me the chance.

I'm getting extremely discouraged because most ""entry level"" positions require experience that I don't have on paper, but I know I can do. I can't find an internship in my city and I can't move for an internship because I wouldn't be able to afford living on internship wages. 

I'm not too sure what else I can do other than apply every where. My next step is to go door to door to local IT businesses in professional attire and ask for an entry level job/internship.

Any advice?

For the upcoming winter/spring, I can either take a semester off and do a co-op or continue in school while doing a part-time internship. 

The co-op seems to have very good mentorship, and I feel like I would learn a lot on the job. However, it does use a mix of old technologies and newer technologies. There might also be a chance that it might not delay my graduation. 

The internship seems to have less of an emphasis on mentorship, but uses more exciting technologies. Plus, I would be able to continue studying in school alongside it. 

Both deal with web and would have me doing full-stack work, and both are the same in terms of prestige. Are there any suggestions of what route to take and why? Would I learn/benefit more from taking a co-op? Should I take the co-op if it somehow didn’t delay my graduation?"

Or am I just not seeing things through?,justanothercsguy987,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7dfrjm/should_i_quit_my_current_startup_job_or_am_i_just/,"Hey there, I've been with this thought for the past few weeks constantly going around in my head.

I graduated this year from a bachelor in CS, and did my internship at the same startup where I'm currently working at as a full stack programmer.

At first, I found it to be quite interesting, and I did learn quite a bit. While the team was very small (sub 5 people), I found them fun to work with, and the work itself was satisfying enough.

However, with time, I started finding problems that annoyed me little by little.

**1 -** First of all, work conditions. While the office is pretty small, it's cozy and spacious enough. Can't say the same for higiene conditions though.
Pretty much everything's dirty, the bathroom, the furniture being all dusty, sometimes there's even larvae crawling on the walls/ceiling, and then there's the constant flies near trash bins.

**2 -** Code base is somewhat messy too, depending on which part of the code you look at. There's a bit of everything, bad naming conventions, methods that are too big, no longer useful comments that stay forever, etc... When I have to work on the bad parts, I feel like hitting someone while trying to understand it and getting it to do what I want.
Still, I've seen far worse spaghetti code examples online.

**3 -** And this leads me to the other issue.. The code mess problem comes from our boss liking to do everything as fast as possible, with little care for code/file structure (and the other employees go with this too). It kills me even further when I'm enjoying making something from scratch, then a few days/weeks later come back to my code, and it's a mess that not even I understand. There's almost no long term planning/thinking, no Agile or anything like that. Also, while I'm working, my boss's often checking on me and asking me ""how's it going"", while I'm still trying to read/understand code or structure what I'm doing. That's pretty annoying and puts me under constant pressure to hammer code as fast as possible, I really hate it.

**4 -** Speaking about our boss, for quite a few months I liked him, even enjoyed talking with him about different things. Problem is, as I slowly opened up, I think he's been getting more and more toxic. I feel that he takes every chance he gets to slightly mock me in front of the other guys, either because I'm not the ""licking boots"" kind of guy (either with him or other people, I try to treat everyone equally), or because I don't live my life in a way that he prefers, etc... Either he's indeed being toxic, or I'm just too sensible and he's just joking with me. 

**5 -** Salary wise, I'm not very well either. I'm pretty sure I could be getting double or near double what I'm currently making (which isn't much) on any other company around here.

**6 -** Finally, I can't say that I think they'll actually succeed with their project. And thematically it's pretty boring to me too. I love coding either on it or anything else, but I couldn't care less about yet another tool made for helping other companies make more profit. There's plenty of software like the one we're developing too, so I can't see how mixing features from all of these kinds of software can help it be distinguished (and as far as I know, there's no marketing planned).

So, help me out guys, am I making the right choice if I leave? I've never worked outside of this company or on personal projects, so I don't know how much better or worse the world is out there..."

7dgd5z,5,2017-11-16,[22] Diving into marketing but what really is marketing? Need advice for a path/insights/opinion.,10minOFthinkingAnick,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7dgd5z/22_diving_into_marketing_but_what_really_is/,"Hello marketing community,

Currently I am a 22 years of age and a  3rd year student. I am studying at a shitty college (some of the lecturers are pretty good, they also lecture at other colleges/universities but they turn the level down as students at my college aren’t even mediocre though sometimes we get that 1 person in the whole year who is a great, recently we had a guy who later on went on working for Google, though he won some competitions, finished a great university later and made a good run with his career. So I hope that I am making the right steps in order for me to become an expert in marketing, sadly I dont even know what marketing really is, I will share my frustration and thoughts in the end of the post.

During my 1 and 2 years first half I worked at some hum drum jobs like McDonalds as my priorities were: cash + flexible schedule but it changed as I got more aware of the path I am going into – shitty college, no relevant experience = highest chance of becoming a dead waste in the job market which is already extremely competitive (probably everywhere). 

During the second year I had a lecture called “marketing” which was taught by a young guy in his begining of 30’s I would say who was a Economics and Philosophy PhD student at a local university. During it we learned the basics of marketing: 4P, SWOT, PEST and other small things which he knew – smell marketing, music marketing and stuff like that (though it were just some inside info he knew not a huge speech about these things). 

During the 2 year of studies I started the ""creation"" of my CV. I knew I have to fill in the blanks and start with something. My plan was to get 2 years of experience in a 1,5 year period (that could only be done with a job and an internship at the same time during summer or during studies when a study internship must be done – its for the bachelor thesis + experience thing).  I thought that the best type of experience would be at large companies because future employers would probably assume that I am already time tested and took the other “big boy” tests, also the work there is more organized and structured and if I would go abroad I think employers there would look at me in a more positive way (just an assumption).  Also I gathered a list of courses (Coursera, edX, Google, Facebook and lots of other valuable stuff I could find, made an Excel thing and currently am trying to finish all of them, get the certificates and boost my CV/linkedin even more).

My current work experience (from my last to the current position)

Sales department assistant (2016-11-08 – 2017-09-18) – Worked at a company which is a part of a company which is responsible for providing postal services in my country (a government sponsored entity). Tasks I did: market analysis (looking into competitors service offerings – DPD, Omniva, DHL and UPS aren’t that big here so my company and some others had the biggest market piece), selling services to small businesses, searching for potential new clients, administrating paper work (agreements and other documents).

Marketing department intern (2017-07-03 – 2017-09-01) – worked at a major retail operator, it is currently getting even a stronger position in the market by trying to merge with a local retail operator. Tasks I did: Creating/Coordinating weekly leaflets, competitor leaflet and social media communication analysis, filling in briefs for graphic design agencies.

Marketing department intern (2017-09-03 - 2017-10-27) - worked at one of the largest, most modern and economically strongest business mergers in my country. Mainly they operate in agriculture and poultry. Tasks I did: segmentation of several EU countries by HoReCa and others aspects (location counts, menu and others), creation of presentation as a tool for a first contact with potential B2B clients.

Marketing department assistant (2017-09-18 - Currently) - working at a local leading real estate developer (commercial, residential and other projects). This is a kind of a internship program for 2-4 year university students, I am probably the first person from college and 90% of the interns at this program are studying real estate. Tasks I do: competitor residential projects analysis, updating various residential project websites (WordPress, Joomla! and other CMS), reports (GoogleAds, Facebook), brainstorming for ideas when needed and others tasks which are sometimes not related to marketing like: presentation preparation.

Also during my second year I competed in an event in which 620 students were gathered, only 120 were taken to the final ""showdown"" (18 higher education institutions, of course this is not the top level thing, its an event for shitty/ok/good colleges), each team consists of 3-6 students who represent thei HEI. During the event each team must go through tasks which are presented by well known companies like Western Union and in the end of the event these companies choose who won their prizes and did the task with an ""A+"". This year me and my team won the prize for innovation task which was presented by a well known Europian bank. We got a few books and an invitation for 2018 innovation center opening and business lunch do discuss various topics, but before that I have the final study internship of 1,5 months, so I contacted them already asking if I could get into the marketing department and try to help them and get some more experience, currently waiting for their answer.

So...

I will definetly have the 2 years of ""relevant"" experience - thats the best experience I have managed to get, the internships at my country just arent that great (also they are maximum 2 months long, rarely companies have these internship programs), usually its tasks that nobody wants to do or customer relationships things, so I am very grateful for at least the glimpse and the scratching of the marketing industry surface I managed to get. I will finish my college with 2 years experience, certificates in digital marketing, marketing (neuromarketing and othet stuff I found), I will get more paper work (also a kind of certificates of attendance I would say) - I managed to sign up for free and open masters lectures at a local university which is a top notch thing here (that gives me value and also shows that I am active after work/studies, some lectures arent related to marketing but 4 out of 5 were for sure), also the ""award"" thing that me and my team won during that local event. I am trying my best to build my CV/linkedin and of course most importantly knowledge but I really dont know were I should go after studies. I felt like all the marketing managers were coordinating stuff and filling lots of briefs for different agencies - communication agencies (Ogilvy, Hill Knowlton Strategies), graphic design agencies, SEO agencies, AdWords agencies, iProspect and others. Should I find a specialization and go for it? like advertisement or how does this marketing career path work? When I checked the linkedin of current local Hill Knowlton Strategies CEO linkedin I found that she worked at 2 companies which are corporations but not ad agencies, though I feel like if I will enter an ad agency they will mock me as they are the real creators and I am judt a coordinator of their work, what I want is to make my brain work, I want to generate ideas and have a career path but I dont know how the marketing careers are ""created"". So currently I am doing everything that is marketing but the lack of real solid and specialized path is frustrating me.

Also I applyed for Erasmus+ grant, I would like to get that financial help of a grant and spend an internship abroad as I think marketing there is a totally different thing than here + more experience and international experience is always a good thing.

Can you guys give me recommendations/advice? Maybe you can share your insights about marketing industry and is it easier to start corporate and move to ad agencies or how is it, as I dont even understand what is a standart day at Ogilvy or iProspect or any other company related to marketing. I hope I mentioned everything."

I just ended a phone call regarding my offer from one of the big hdd companies in California and I need some help on what I should do.

The offer included 3k signing, 68k salary, benefits, 401k, etc. 
Location: Irvine
Position: Software Engineer
Team: Internal Tools Web Team

I'm not too sure but 68k feels low for a software developer at Irvine. But considering it's a hardware company and the position is for a web team makes me think it's acceptable. One great thing about the offer is that I am familiar with the team, and I love the team's atmosphere.

Some background: I've been a part-time intern at this company the last 5 months while attending school so I'm very comfortable with the team, and know how to do the work. 

Do you guys think this is an acceptable offer that I should strongly consider? How limiting would my career be if I worked at a hard drive company instead of a software company? Should I try to negotiate the salary? Is 68k too low for a software engineer/web developer at Irvine?

Sorry for the list of questions. Thanks."
7dgu0m,2,2017-11-16,Keeping sharp while looking for work,gammaknifu,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7dgu0m/keeping_sharp_while_looking_for_work/,"I'm wondering what suggestions people have for keeping their skills sharp, and/or for picking up new ones as they search for work in this field (especially since there's so much, with new things to read about almost daily); with perhaps a little more focus on the time between graduation and first job. 

The obvious and general response here would be to search desired job listings, and brush-up/learn the skills required accordingly. Though this isn't always so easy, and the variance of skills/knowledge can be high (excluding the very obvious ones). There is also the issue of domain knowledge, of which one may not have any at all, let alone specific to the job applied to. Picking up on this can seem tough from the outside, especially to be up to date on current practices.

Perhaps someone can suggest some useful books/blogs/etc which would help those of us coming from a purely stats/analysis type of background to get used to certain domain spaces and the techniques there. Industries like Finance/Econ, Bio/Medical, Ad/Marketing, etc., seem to use familiar methods, but sometimes have rather unfamiliar nomenclature for them.

A bit about my background (if anyone would have some direct suggestions for me I'd be very appreciative): Masters in Stats, Bachelors in Math, have had some basic analytics work using google analytics, a short (1 semester) internship for a pharma company as a statistical consultant, quite good with R, intermediate with Python/SQL/SAS, familiar with most modern learning techniques.  I've tried to keep sharp by reading stats/ML books, learning/refreshing topics on youtube, testing out some tools in Kaggle comps. Despite this, I'm still quite nervous come every interview (there haven't been many).

Sorry to be so long winded, thanks in advance.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail systems programming (what I'm taking right now). I'm just so angry at myself because I absolutely love the theory, I think it's really cool, but for some reason I just can't get a good grasp on it. I failed the midterm after studying days in advance for it, I'm getting C's on assignments I was positive were going to get A's.

I'm also wondering how much the degree is going to help me get a job. I have a decent portfolio at this point already (iPhone and android apps, internship, web development), and am creating a full stack web application for a small business part time (using angular and django). But I also don't know how much of that matters if I don't have a degree. I've seen people on here that get jobs without degrees, but everyone I talk to tells me to stay in school, and that the degree is by far the most important. But if I keep failing my classes than what's the point? I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel if I love software this much, I shouldn't be failing it. It makes me rethink it all sometimes."

I think the reason I don't get any interviews is because I'm older (30 years old) and I haven't worked for the past 7 years or done any internships (interns aren't really a thing in my country though). I was hoping I'd get a job, any job, to start off with too mitigate the gap in my employment history and then hopefully move unto more interesting work. That (obviously) hasn't happened.

I got high marks in school which I list on my otherwise barren CV, because I have little else (I also list the jobs I worked 7+ years ago).

After months of no interviews I recently updated my CV to include an explanation for the lack of previous occupations (I don't go into details I just say I got very sick and couldn't work for a long time and so I started university in the meantime). I don't know if that's a good idea or not but maybe it looks better.

My family members have tried to help me and have generally been great but computer science/tech industry stuff isn't really their forte. I don't socialize much outside my family. When I got sick it left me as an invalid for a couple of years and I got really depressed and isolated myself completely, eventually people just (understandably) moved on. When I finally got off my ass and went back to school I was still dealing with a lot of problems and felt really uncomfortable taking classes with, mostly, much younger people so I didn't really make any connections there. Therefore my personal network outside of family members is pretty much non-existent. I'm not fundamentally awkward socially or a bad communicator, or at least I don't think I am, but it is what it is.

I realize that I'm in a tough situation and I don't have a lot of redeeming factors. But this is what I have to work with. I don't know what to do next though. I currently live with my parents and they're very supportive and are actually encouraging me to get a Masters degree. I already got what I think is a good education from the national university, which everyone here attends, and I did well so I don't know how further education is going to help me get a job. I'm open to any suggestions though. I just want to get my life back on track.

I am on an internship position on a big company, and I was assigned a small project regarding a internal web app. The language of choice was C# with ASP.NET. I have a few weeks to finish at least a small part of it, but the thing is I have zero knowledge regarding C# or .NET. 

The project is about an web app that will ask for credentials, then let you login to some internal software that manages other internal projects files. I need to do at least the login page and be able to access the other software (the front end).

As a background, I am a beginner in Simulink and medium in C. They are aware of the fact that I don't know C#. I know its almost impossible, but I don't wanna quit or disappoint. Maybe they wanna see how I react under pressure or something, I'm not sure.

So I just need a little help from you guys.. 

1. Where should I dive in first: C# or ASP.NET?
2. What should I learn in order to develop at least the front end of this application.?
3. Where can I learn it from? Any tutorials where I can pick exactly what I need in order to develop this app?

Hopefully this lovely community can help. To give you some back story, I went into a local university majoring in Biology and after not enjoying the class and getting a bad grade on it, I decided to sit down and rethink my future. I met with professors of MIS and CS and decided to take an intro programming class that taught Visual Basic. I loved that class and knew that's what I wanted to major in so I switched. Three semesters later, I am finishing up this semester with pretty good grades learning discrete structures and towards the end of C++ (I would consider myself proficient). Next semester, I am taking Data Structures and Multi user operating systems that deal with Linux. 
Other than that, I have taken Linear Algebra and Calc 1 and 2. I am a Junior but technically a sophomore in the CS degree. 

Now onto the real questions, I have a resume, but I think I need to make a CS related resume to apply. I have work experience but none are CS or technology related. What do I put on my resume for the recruiters to notice or am I out of luck? 

I don't know if GPA is that important but after I got a low grade in Bio, I had to grind my way back up past 3. 
Current GPA: 3.1


TL;DR: Sophomore standing in CS degree. Looking for summer to apply for summer internships but need help building a cs related resume. GPA: 3.1, classes I have taken: C++, Discrete Structures, Data Structures, multi user operating systems, linear algebra, calc 1 and 2."

Put all your code on GitHub. Since(if) you are a CS student, it'll be done in your room itself, or library. Projects for other trades will incur a lot of money, focus on doing the project up to the fabrication phase. Document everything and date it. Make individual files. 4 years later you need to be able to show something.

*Objections raised about this NEXT point by people more learned than me, read what they have to say in the comments. 

(2) ~~One research paper every year. MUST.~~ Try to align your paper and project to complement each other. Lower the burden.  

(3) Go through the CS(or any other trade) course of MIT(or any other standardised fully available online course). Study it and discuss online, if possible. Use it for your projects and research papers. This way you'll inculcate those learnings. 

(4) Apply for internships online at STARTUPS. Your online code repository will help here. Stay away from IT industry. Not good for 'learning on the job.' 

(5) Make resume RIGHT NOW. Doesn't need to be good, skip all the MS Word shite. On the contrary, it'll be empty. Make another resume—an ideal one—something that you hope to achieve. Put them beside each other on the wall. EVERY decision you make over the next 3/4 years should be to strive this. 


You do this. Forget friends, tell them - NO, I NEED TO GET THIS DONE FIRST. Just dive in. Take inspiration from this guy's hard work.

I feel like I'm stuck in a sunk-cost fallacy because I feel like if I make a major transition, I'll struggle to pay my mortgage because of low pay and I'm behind the game for those who got in before me and I may never catch up. 

I enjoy programming and IT, but I don't think my personality is really ever going to be utilized in there, except for maybe in management, but even then, I want to feel like I am reaching out to others, and I don't know who much I can do that in the tech industry.

I've been advised many times to go into radio and politics/lobbying by people in and out of those industries who know me, but I'm afraid they either aren't too serious or I may not do well. I'm in a stable job right now, but it's incredibly mundane and frustrating because I don't have the power to change anything for the better or reach out and improve what I see as a society in trouble.

Anyway, I'm not sure what direction to go in, I'm in a stable but fairly miserable position now, but I don't know where I could be utilized that isn't an internship where I can break into a career field where I can have a much higher level of job satisfaction. What do you all think?"

First time poster, long time lurker. 

I have my first industry interview coming up and I somehow managed to pull off a hail mary. I'm 30, recently quit my job in management to go back to school for CS.

I'm a first year Student who has been self-learning for the past 2 years. I've been developing a JavaScript app for going on a year and a half in my spare time, it's fairly complex and has required several rebuilds and refactorings. It uses node, express and socket, the project has taught me a ton about coding, and thinking like a developer. In addition to that I've completed a large amount of the code school curriculum, learned a bit of VBA for Excel scripts that were deployed at work and toyed with Python. 
In school I've built a couple Java projects, but found most of the work to be easy and require minimal effort, and my professors and TA's have noted i'm ahead of the curve. 

Prior to moving away for school I researched businesses in the area where I could apply for part time work because I need some type of an income and I can definitely manage the workload. I found a company that is in the same domain I previously worked in, but also hires developers. I sent out a resume in the hopes that they'd be interested in bringing me into a lower level position and hopefully transition that into a summer software internship after I completed my first year. 

They contacted me pretty quickly and after a brief exchange, set up an interview for a position within their software team where I would be working with a language I've never done more then read about. I've already started codeschool tutorials, and I plan on trying to knock out some small projects over the weekend. They sent me somethings we're going to likely talk about during the interview. 

What can I do to show that despite my early stage of schooling and my time limitations during the school year I will be able to pivot my domain knowledge, ability to self learn (I worked my way into management at my previous job by learning things on the fly and developing skills to move into the next open position) and passion for development into being a productive intern able to contribute to the team, as well as to the company's success?

Mostly deciding between (a) and (b) since compensation are significantly higher than (c). (b) is a relatively new unicorn, about a year or so. Also (a) is 12 weeks, (b) is 10.

Salary/stipend and living expenses are basically the same at (a) and (b). 

Has anyone had similar experience in this position between a largerish more well known company and a smaller company that (maybe) might do more interesting work? Will be doing something back-end related on a team at the big N and no idea for the team on the unicorn (not a lot of information), likely data infrastructure/pipeline stuff. Deadline is coming up so I don't have a lot of time to investigate, especially with exams too. Python is a constant between them (meh mostly). Talent/engineering from the unicorn seems pretty strong anyway, looking at linkedin's... they recruit a lot from ivies etc though obviously both teams are great.

Another consideration is fulltime offers and re-recruiting. I will probably rerecruit next cycle for intern/fulltime so I was thinking the big N might help more in terms of recognition? In addition, I feel the internship experience and mentorship is more consistent and better at a more established company. More events with a largest intern class etc, bootcamp. 

Fulltime compensation in terms of salary from the unicorn seems at least as good as the big N (from h1bdata.info) how risky are RSUs and stock options from late stage startups? 

Deferring one to the fall or something is also not an option since I have to take this one liberal arts course for graduation thats only offered in the Fall, and need to graduate on-time or early-admit for MEng. 

Any points I should consider more or thoughts?

Also, how do companies generally respond when you turn them down and then apply again next cycle? Fast tracked?"

I took a drug test to get an internship last June and passed it. The company hires interns and temps through the temp agency Aerotek.

I got asked to come back for a couple weeks over Christmas break, so I stopped getting high on the 1st of Nov. just in case I'll have to re-take a urine test.

The problem is, as someone with chest pain from anxiety and stress, it's been tough. I don't want to make it seem like I'm just a pot-head (like my friends seem to think), but that I get high to help wind down after stressful days.
And it's been one off those weeks where getting high would be quite nice. Just found out I have Coeliac disease so I'm worried about what that might entail. Also, getting my first surgery ever on my scrotum in a couple weeks. I've had a lot of tests/assignments the last couple weeks as well. And my close uncle is getting brain surgery this weekend too. 

Do you guys think I will be asked to get a drug test? At first I thought I'll definitely have to take one, but I was told that I won't have to give the company my bank information again. Also, it's the same calendar year so I think I might not have to re-take it, considering it's been less than 4 months since I stopped working for them from the summer.


Thanks guys.

Currently I am trying to obtain a grant by my local government to finish up a startup project. I went to the government building, spoke with the grant committee head, let's call her Carol,  showed Carol my project, and everything was spoken about like I was going to get funding for my project. 

Flash to the next week, I make an appointment with Carol and she moves me to another person, We'll call him Bill, who is condescending about anything that is app development: ""We've had people try and obtain this grant for app **ideas** before."" I show him my project, tell him that I'm 85% done and explain to him that I'm past the idea stage and need the money. His demeanor absolutely changed after he saw the project as well. 

&lt;side-rant&gt; All developers hate those people who are skill-less and think they will be the next Steve Jobs with their idea. They usually have no money, and offer a random developer they know a small equity stake in their world changing idea to do all of the work while all they want to do is sit back and relax &lt;/side-rant&gt;

During the meeting with Bill I explain to him that I have done business plans before and had done market research a few times as a marketing manager/ intern. I try and explain to him that things like primary market research and financial projections can't be made for tech startups due to their being too many variables in how the company operates, and that if I were to do them they would be fraudulent fiction. Bill doesn't get it and sends me a framework for how to craft a business plan.

I email Carol back, not to go around Bill, but because it was Bill's last week there for some reason. In the email I quickly break down problems with doing primary market research and financial projections as if I were I writing about an issue on github, or creating a stack exchange post.

Carol replies in a whole bunch of businessy jargon saying that I need to be taught how to speak in a business setting and essentially I'm being a condescending asshole. 

I show my girlfriend, an english major, and she basically agrees that I was coming off as condescending. My girl friend agrees to help me write an email back to Carol and over 3 hours my girlfriend starts understanding that due to the direct nature of the problems I'm having there really isn't much I could do to address these problems without using indirect language that gets nothing done. We finish drafting the email and I pass it to my dad, who has an MBA from a top business school and he spends another hour going over it changing things. 

Now I feel that after my girlfriend and dad went over this email so many times that I'm doing things in an indirect way that will accomplish absolutely nothing. 

I don't know how to address these issues without coming off as an asshole. I feel like the tech support guy that has to get yelled at by a customer for asking if they turned their computer on and off to fix it.

How is it that you guys tend to deal with these situations? I went from what seemed to be guaranteed to get this government grant to unintentionally an offensive asshole.

I'm a 3rd year CS student who was lucky enough to get a few good offers for a summer 2018 internship. I'm wondering which one to take, and how I should go about making this decision. My longer-term goals (which aren't fully flushed out yet) include possibly getting an MS degree and then hopefully working in a full time SWE/ML role, probably at a mid-sized startup. That being said, here are the offers I am considering:

Nextdoor + KPCB: Seems cool and is very consumer/product oriented and I will get the chance to do some ML work. KPCB fellowship is cool, don't think I should go to a company just for the fellowship though.

Plaid: High growth, small, ML work, not very well known but definitely extremely solid engineering team. They tried to recruit me really hard so I would feel terrible if I said no.

Affirm: High growth, bit larger, ML work, again fintech, somewhat well known. Really strong eng team here too.

Blend: I worked here last summer and really enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going back. I enjoyed the work and my team a lot. 

Comp wise, they all look similar except for one company's offer which is ~9-10k more for the entire summer. I'm trying my best to optimize for the long term and luckily do not have significant expenses, so I don't think considering comp for an internship is something that's very important for me.

7dpnqa,0,2017-11-17,A friend in the same circumstances was feeling discouraged about getting into the industry... I sent him this email...,CivEmperor,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7dpnqa/a_friend_in_the_same_circumstances_was_feeling/,"Context:
&amp;nbsp;
A friend of mine just finished a one year technical program in programming and he was really nervous. He had worked in a hospital for 20 years as an orderly and was looking for a new career to jump into. Programming is what he chose. He contacted me about seeing my CVs because I had been recently hired (4 months at the company now) for a job. I had worked in IT infrastructure for a long time and I jumped into programming after completing a technical degree of 3 years. That 3 years included a work coop of 3 months as well. (referred to here as a 'stage', it's sort of the french word in Canada we use for coop or internship). I knew he was nervous so I decided to share my experience and I realized that maybe other newbies out there might want to hear what I went through, below was my email to him. Name have been removed, for obvious reasons. He, like myself, is in his late 30's and making this change to a new career. After sending him this email, I decided to share it here, because... Maybe it can help some coders out there struggling. To know they aren't alone. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Hey _____ , I'm emailing you quick while I remember, ____ gave me your email, to send you my resume. I'm at work atm but I just wanted to keep you in the loop. :) I haven't forgotten, just been busy at work... Anyways, I'll send you my resumes tonight so you can have a look see.

Also, I want to take this opportunity to share my experience of being a new programmer with you. ________ mentioned you were a little nervous and I completely understand. During my stage, I literally had panic attacks every morning. I remember one evening it was bad, I had to have a few shots of whiskey to settle my nerves. It was brutal and I was really scared. I felt like I didn't know anything. That I wasn't competent and I couldn't possibly succeed doing this. That I couldn't compete with these kids of 20 years old knocking out code so fast! 

There were literally days I sat down and looked at the screen and was like ""I don't understand a single thing in front of me."" Because the one thing school doesn't prepare you for, is the SIZE and complexity of the systems and they simply can't. But, most environments, people get that. They get there's a learning curve and it can be steep depending on the system. But you gotta embrace the grind. You plug away at it and step through each process... also sometimes you have to ""black box"" your understanding of things. Also, if you literally don't understand a single thing, just ask for help. Never just sit and muddle through random code. They will not like that. They prefer you not know and get help, rather than sit there and try grind away at something you don't understand at all.

I've been here for 4 months and I love my job and my work. No panic attacks and no fear. It's this amazing collaborative experience and it's literally like no other job I've ever done and it's amazing. You're going to love it. :)

Also, I've heard rumors we're hiring... so after I send you my CVs, try to get yours done asap. My boss is a good guy. He's fair and understanding. He's just looking for people who love coding and the working with code. *crossing fingers* I hope to see you soon!"

7dqe2x,2,2017-11-17,IBM Research Summer Intern vs SWE internship at smaller company,CSthrowaway777888,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7dqe2x/ibm_research_summer_intern_vs_swe_internship_at/,"Hi I'm a junior undergraduate CS student that got offered a position at an IBM Watson building. Basically, it's a 12 week program where we develop a proof of concept for new technologies (no code to dev servers). I think doing this internship would stick a big name on my resume, which might help me get a better full time offer or at least the potential to get a better full time offer(via more interviews) when the time comes.

The other company is a small to medium size company that has a more ""startup"" vibe, and everyone I've talked to who's worked there loved it there. Unfortunately, hardly anyone knows who this company is and it won't look as ""impressive"" on a resume. But, I do think I would enjoy my summer at this company more simply because of the environment.

Salary and living expense are pretty much the exact same so it's not really a factor for me. So I guess my question is what should I do? Or what is more important for an internship if I am wanting to consider the future, having a big name on my resume to make the chances of netting an interview easier or to enjoy the experience more?

EDIT: I just want to clarify that I would probably enjoy the IBM internship too, but most likely not as much as I would enjoy the smaller company.

I’ve only been coding for a few years and I recently started an internship in IT.   Previously I was very successful with sports and music.  I can tell you very specifically what makes me determine whether a musician or athlete has skill.  

Programming is unique because there are so many specialties, tools, and styles that it’s hard for me to determine someone’s ability.  What is that thing you notice other programmers do that tells you they are proficient?  Is it the process and how quickly they code, or is your observation of their skill only based on results like clean code?

I believe that as we progress at a skill, a big thing that differentiates is knowing the difference between what is a “good” or “bad” habits.  I don’t think this is nonsense, because I want to accel at my new chosen craft.  I want to find the best programmers at my work and copy what has made them successful.

(They aren't judged on the amount of tickets closed or time to resolve so they don't mind if we take tickets.)  Also, long time lurker, first time poster.

Back in mid August; I grabbed a ticket that had to do with securing and backing up data from someone who had just left our company. (They left on very good turns and is still good friends with my higher ups. ) So the policy we have is that their manager and Dept. Head get an archive copy of their emails in a PST file. They also get a copy of the Documents folder and anything we (IT) might see that is relevant to the company and that department projects. (Some users like to work fully from their desktop folder...)

 Before the user left, they copied all their personal data that they wanted to copy onto a flash drive. Or so they thought. Anyway, I finish up transfer all the data around, shut the laptop down and lock the office on my way out. 

Flash forward to beginning of October. Ex-User calls one of my managers and asks about a certain power point they were working on while employed here that they need for a very important upcoming meeting. In addition they don't have any of their personal data that they copied over. So, the manager asks if I can go do this person a favor since I was the one to handle their leaving.

 I gather information about what this power point should have in it and I head back to the locked office. Open the office, boot the laptop back up and scan the drive for any power point files. Then I also check for any of the keywords that should be in the file. Nothing. I even check all the backup files dating three months prior to them leaving,, nothing. Can't find this power point,  but the user insists it exists.  I get them calmed down about the power point and see about finding their other data. 

We come to find that because our Security blocks unknown USB drives,  the user took all their personal data from the encrypted laptop drive and put it onto an unencrypted backup drive. Big whoops. (The program we use for back ups encrypts the files themselves so we don't have to have the whole drive encrypted.) I get the user an authorized flash drive and copy their data onto it for them to take home. I also moved all their data back onto the encrypted drive. 

Apologized for not being able to find the power point and secured the equipment again. Flash forward a week or so and I get called into my one managers office, he asks me about the ticket and data recovery and if I remember it. He goes on to explain that the ex-user called him and told him that the file never actually existed... -_- 

I wasted 3 hours that day search through files and folders and archives of back ups.

TL;DR. Ex-user who is very good friends with my bosses thought they left an important file on their old PC. I spend 3 hours of my work day hunting for the file. Turns out it never existed.

Now, this is off topic, but the position had a requirement where It said that you must have English skills with 70% minimal fluency to be selected.

And since I really wanna look good in this temporal job, I wanna prepare myself so I can make a good impression and (hopefully) be hired. 

I went through the FAQ and saw some tools that might help me getting better at the whole script writing thing - I've never written one - and I'm very interested in learning how to love my studies and programming. How was your experience as a rookie in this whole programming thing? Or in your IT career in general? Do people have high expectations for a broke college student?

Some info:
Oath is in California and the others are in the southeast
Honeywell is paying ~20% more than Home Depot plus hosing (don't know about Oath yet)
The Home Depot offer required 2 technical interviews (not too difficult though), and the Honeywell offer was just 1 nontechnical interview. Oath was 1 technical and 1 nontechnical interview. 
The Home Depot internship seems more free in that I would kinda pick my own project and work on it with a partner. The oath one would focus on building libraries and frameworks for mobile apps that its brands use. Honeywell seems more backend, .NET based. They all seem to have a collaborative, open office atmosphere though.

My thoughts:
My goal is to get a big N internship eventually. Which of these would you pick, and which one has the most name recognition in the tech world? Also, one of my concerns is that the Home Depot interview required more technical interviews which makes me think they might be looking to get more out of me than the others possibly?

However, I can’t help but get a feeling that I’m destined to screw up because I’m not good enough.

My grandma passed weeks ago, and my dad got fired from his 13 year fulltime job for helping my mom deal with it (he called out days from work to help with funerals and burial arrangements)
My brother had to go into emergency surgery in the middle of the burial service because his intestines somehow got tangled. He's been in the hospital for a month. The rent in our apartment building skyrocketed because of a new policy. My grandpas homeless and has to share the room with me now and has no job. 

Me and my mom are now the sole breadwinners. I work 2 jobs and go to college.  I cut out hours from my part time job in order to get more days at my internship because they pay cash upfront but the problem is for the past few weeks the internship has been cancelling me out of days in the week and it always changes and the days interfere with my school and my other job. 

I intern at a vocational school/design firm doing the brunt of business card, flyer, signage designs, as well as proctoring Pearson tests. The first time I came to this internship, the boss kept telling me that my first month I will take a photoshop certification test and they will pay me as a full time employee $25 an hour 5 days a week. That was 4 months ago. Every time I bring it up my boss brushes it aside. The problem is, I wasn't put on a contract, nothing was in writing. I got this internship because my mother was his client and he hired me as a favor to her. I appreciated the opportunity but I cant keep working here for 50 bucks a week doing $25/hr work. Realistically I should be walking home with $175 bucks every week. 

I also feel justified for getting a raise because I take care of a lot of his clients while I'm off of work. My free time at home is getting calls from 3 or 4 clients who complain about the boss being slow with the designs so I take care of them for him and it prevents them from going to someone else. I work on Saturdays yet I find myself working everyday of the week because of them. He came to me last week and said I have to stay longer (5 more hours) in order to teach basic photoshop ($100/hr with certification) to clients. I now work 12 hours now doing overall $675 worth of work for only $50 if I was a full time employee. I get paid under the table, in cash which is why I have stood here because its more convenient for me.

The point is, I can't keep this internship if I'm going to help support my family. If I only bring 50 bucks to the table for $1200 monthly rent, and 80 bucks for bills (I cut out hours from my 2nd job for my internship that wants me to be more open in the week and they keep changing their minds last minute if they need me, so I work once a week at my 2nd job) 
I would quit but I just want to get my certification and leave. If I get $100-$150 once a week I can at least keep 25 bucks for food and travel for the week and contribute more. Im considering getting a third job if I cant get a raise just so I can use the internship money for myself and the rest of the money I earn goes to the family.

TLDR
Lots of worst case scenarios have happened and my extremely underpaid internship is full of empty promises and its interfering with school and my second job therefore I need more money to support my family."

I was able to do a ton of research, learn a ton about programming (Mostly Java), and work with guys that new exactly what they were doing. It was awesome, and I was/am grateful to have been a part of it. Long story short - It's a start up. We need money, still don't have it, and we're quickly running out of money. The reason I say ""We"" and ""Am"" is because I'm not technically *fired*, as there's still a chance they could pull the money from somewhere. Since those chances are slim, and I've already been told I am unable to rack up any additional hours unless something changes, I've decided to make this post anyway under the assumption I've already 100% lost this job. 

That being said though, I guess I'm curious if anybody has any suggestions for where I can continue from here. I am not opposed to anything, and would love to hear any and all suggestions. Some facts about me in regards to my skills in and around this field:

* I know Python, Java(Apex), and am learning R.
* I'm also good with Hardware, Desktops, laptops, Rpi, Redboards, etc.
* I love the problem solving that comes with this field, and am currently hoping to pursue Machine learning, AI.
* I really don't care about how well a position/job pays. As long as I can afford a roof over my head, and some groceries every month, I can make it work. I'm mostly concerned with filling an enjoyable, fulfilling role. 
* At this point, I am without certs, and have no schooling beyond High School. (I *love* learning, but I'm terrible at it in an institutionalized setting) I'd love to get certs, and I'm not opposed to trying school, but I worry I would waste time and money just to fail.

I feel as though I'm in an interesting, and honestly kind of worrying situation. I would love to continue right from where I am now, and just keep learning and growing in these fields (In a perfect world), but I'm open to anything that would keep me around computers and programming. So aside from calling up my boy Elon and seeing if he has any positions open /s, is there anything else anyone can think of that fits this situation in one way or another? 
Thank you again for taking the time to read all this. 

**TL;DR**:
Lost job that was allowing me to learn and grow at my own pace and getting paid to do so, Would love to continue in this direction, but am feeling overwhelmed and not 100% sure how to proceed. See bullet points for some of my Strengths/Weaknesses. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Note: See a typo, rule violation, or just think I did a poor job on my first Reddit post? let me know, I'll make it right."

7dvf9x,2,2017-11-18,Help me Pick an internship - I'm torn,LowStranger,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7dvf9x/help_me_pick_an_internship_im_torn/,"Hey Guys,

I have 2 internship offers that are pretty different, and I'm looking to get some opinions to help me choose because I'm completely torn. Maybe some of you have been in a similar boat.  I'll start with describing the two offers and then share a few of my thoughts.

Internship at one of HP's research labs on an ASIC chip design team - This is for a job on a small team of about 15 people and I would be a digital design intern on this team. Getting to do chip design for some of HP's cooler printing technologies. Things like 3D and Large scale high performance printers, not too much with consumer printers. It's down to the transistor level design along with doing some Verilog programming for the controllers in the chips. Working close with the analog designers also on the team to be able to do design, testing, and verification of any project our team has. This internship is in Oregon.


Internship with Local Hardware Security Company - This company is a small 10-15 person company that does hardware security for FPGAs and Embedded systems.   I would get to do a good bit of VHDL and C programming in the security space. This company does work for Intel, Xilix, Microsim, defense companies, etc.  This company is really laid back, does outstanding work in their niche area and is literally a 7 minute walk from my house in FL.


Both companies have been really great to me, showing that they would really like to have me on the team.  Before the semester started I was hoping to find an internship that would let me work a lot with FPGAs since that is my strong suit and ideally be on the west coast if possible. In terms of the type of work, the small local company is a much better match for me based on what I am already good at and know that I love to do. One of the reasons they want me to work there is because I do a research project for FPGA hardware security that I already know I love. So I know I would 100% really like working here and it would get me a lot better at stuff I already have some experience in.  The position with HP is offering work that I don't really have much experience in at all, chip design down to the transistor level. And it no doubt would give me a ton of experience with some topics I'm a lot weaker in but want to learn about. Transistor circuits, analog to digial, etc. For an EE I'm pretty stupid when it comes to analog stuff, transistor circuitry and things like that so I think it would be really good for me to learn these topics. I've been doing a lot of work with Digital Logic, FPGAs, and Embedded system so those are my strong suits, but I kind of want to get better at some other areas as well. I think I would like the chip design work HP is offering me to do and it will make me a more well-rounded engineer that I am trying to become but if I end up not liking it that much I'm going to be kicking myself in the butt for turning down a company that was pretty much offering  do something I already know I love. There have been topics I thought I would like in EE before that I ended up hating, so that has me hesitating on passing on something I know I like for something I think I'll like.

In summary, HP is going to provide me a really good learning experience and opportunity that doesn't come by often. It will allow me to work in a new area and become more well-rounded. But i can only predict I will like the work since I've never really done it before. It will also give me the chance to travel to the west coast.  The local company is going to provide me with work I already know I love and make me better at it, but It will be making me better in a niche area I already have some experience in instead of making me more well-rounded in terms of electrical engineering.  Also being able to walk to work and live where I already do would be just as great as being able to travel to the west coast.

I'm so torn on which direction to take for my summer internship. What do you guys think?"
7dvfw1,2,2017-11-18,Should I drop out of Uni if I get a job?,10able,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dvfw1/should_i_drop_out_of_uni_if_i_get_a_job/,"I'm nearly done with my third semester at University and thinking about it, it really seems like a huge waste of time. I'm studying engineering but I feel like I'm not learning anything. Or at least, I'm not learning anything I have to go to Uni for. It feels more like they just tell me what to learn, lecture in a super shitty way that I don't understand, then judge how well I learned it. Almost everything I'm taught I can learn by reading online lecture notes from other Universities that teach the same thing. I don't do bad in my classes.

And on top of that, I'm a skilled programmer and I've worked for companies that require programmers in the past, and while I obviously wasn't on the level of a programmer who has been working for years, I knew way more than the equivalent interns who were there with me. In other words I'm fully capable of working at an entry level programming job.

I just don't see the reason to stay at Uni. It's a burden money wise and effort was and I'm really not happy. I've started looking for jobs (programming jobs, I already have a menial job) and if I find one I see very little reason not to drop out or at least suspend my enrollment and go work. I feel like I'd be way more productive working on *real* projects, and meeting people in the workplace than the Uni environment, which is half drunk kids and half super serious students, I can't really relate to either group fully.

I know you can't fully know my situation but what I'm saying seems rational, right?"

It would mean the world to me to get some advice on structuring my resume!

I'm really sorry this is so long, I have difficulty following typical templates since it usually comes out as 3 pgs...
Any advice at all on focus or templates for this would be greatly appreciated

Honest history:

 * Summer 2013 - Web dev intern at startup #A in KC, MO
 * Summer 2014 - Web dev contract at startup #A in KC, MO
 * August 2014 - Began CSC degree at large mid-western university (not known for comp sci) few hours from KCMO
 * During school - won award for Startup Weekend, sat on several school organization boards and committees 
 * Summer 2015 - Web dev intern worked at V M L (largest marketing firm in KCMO); configured build system for Spr int.com
 * During school
   * two-month contract position as a developer of a Slackbot (worked independently of company business) at small web development company;
   * Organized a small non-profit of 4 friends to help passionate programmers find resources (met weekly) and I learned a lot about team management and promoting comradery (Never had a cash flow/EIN)
   * Awarded for committee involvement organizing ""fun and innovative"" campus events for my residence hall
 * Summer 2016 - Web dev contract at V M L; greenfield dev on dev team of 40+ building Angular 2 components, organizing stories with McKinsey and Company (2nd largest management consulting firm in the world), built component gallery system (self initiated idea) for devs to be able to share frontend UI components; worked with V M L DevOps team to explore Drone CI (to potentially replace Jenkins) for Docker-based continuous integration (also self-initiated and led, most of this work and learning Docker was after hours) (I also worked with Github API here).
 * During school
   * Organized another company to develop a social meet up app (was featured in school paper/online)
      * Recruited and lead six students (volunteering for the experience and interest in mission) through developing marketing campaigns, organizing events (company worked directly with university for two events), and leading the development of several web apps in Elixir/Phoenix and Angular 2 for the mobile app.
      * Mentored graphic designer in experience design through careful critique of wire frames and guided exercises
 * Summer 2017 until October - ""Software Engineer"" at KCMO startup writing Clojure and Java on backend for a React Native frontend
   * While here, I owned the development of an entire service offering from the business logic/ui templates/pmt processing
* December 2017 - I get my diploma a semester early! Yay. I took an average of 19 credits a semester and passed out of several courses in our CSC program in order to get everything done so quickly. My last classes have been online, which is how I worked at the last startup until October (which ended due to a bad fit and constrained resources).

*ALL the while*, over the course of the last five years I have created over 100 _source_ (not forks) repositories on Github for large and small projects that I have done out of interest in learning new stacks. My code is well structured but not well commented, since I have only a couple projects that I actually collaborated on to make. 
Note: the majority of my work is in TypeScript, and I hope that pushing TypeScript is not misunderstood as different than ES7/EcmaScript

The pay is bad and the job is mentally draining me so right now I'm trying to get a different job but have no experience so I thought about going for a job where I can study on my own. I'm thinking about getting a A++ certification for information technology field to start from bottom and move up as the pay is horrible in my current job and I've been somehow interested in computer from the past. But ultimately, I wish to work as a 3d animator but it's going to be a long road in this field before I can even get a job so I plan to study hard.

So here's the situation;

Although I wish to be 3d animator, I don't think I can last any longer due to mentally killing and low pay job I have right now, so I need to study IT + get certification to get an IT job to support myself and study animation at the same time.

Has anyone ever dealt with a situation of studying for 2 different fields at the same time? "

Over the last month I've been cheated on by my boyfriend, I cut my dad out of my life, and my sister has been in and out of the hospital and doctors offices with stage 4 kidney disease and mental health issues. She doesn't need dialysis now but will in the somewhat near future. Taking care of her has been a family effort.

All of this is super overwhelming. I have some mental health issues myself, including depression and anxiety. Lately I've been so anxious that I have been sick to my stomach and depressed as well. I'm doing my best to keep surviving but with all of that I'm behind in my classes. So badly that I'm going to fail one of my classes as of tomorrow. 

I decided to talk to my advisor about it. I was talking to her and I didn't want to tell her about all my life drama and that I have mental health issues and that I can't handle this shit... So I lied. I told her that my sister is starting dialysis and I take her to a lot of appointments so I'm behind. I made her illness sound more severe and demanding because I didn't want to people to judge my lack of stability and question my sanity forever.

She ended up giving me a few extra weeks to finish my classwork.

I feel so bad for lying about it. I needed an out so I didn't have to reveal my emotional issues but still get a much needed extension but I think I crossed a line. The worst part is that my cohort found out so now everybody feels bad for me. 

What should I do?

I feel masters logically makes more since I already have the B.S. but I feel with my position it'll be hard to get into any respectable program becuase of gpa plus a non comp sci major



The bachelors route is possible as well. Feel at the Bachelors level I could get into a more respectable program as well as getting a more foundational education. Especially since I have looking for work purposes not for science/research.

**Background**
*Work experience:* 

* Deck Watch/Electronics Officer - Served 2 years aboard a ship as a deck watch officer and the electronics officer. As DWO I was responsible for the safe navigation of a ship with 100+ crew members, execution of search and rescue, drug interdiction, and migrant interdiction operations, and served as the direct representative of the Captain. As the electronics officer I supervised 11 technicians and was responsible for the maintenance, casualty repair, and installation of electronic navigation, communications, information technology, and fire control systems aboard the vessel.  

* Field Intelligence Officer (by summer 2019 this will be 3 years).  Served 3 years executing all phases of the intelligence cycle.  Collected and reported, liaised, and briefed maritime intelligence within an interagency construct to safe guard largest port on East Coast of U.S.  against global &amp; domestic terrorism, cyber threats, criminal activity.  Strong public speaking, interpersonal, rapport building, and analytical product generation skills. 

*Extra curriculars:*

* Runs with various running groups 3-4 times a week, beginning to serve as an organizer within one of the groups

* Partner dancing, swing/latin mostly

*Undergrad school/major:* U.S. Coast Guard Academy/Electrical Engineering

*Other education/coursework:* N/A

*Race/nationality:* Asian/Native American (born in US)

*Sex:* M

**Stats**
*GMAT Score (include breakdown!):* N/A currently (Wanting to see where I'll have to score in order to have a shot at this)

*Undergrad GPA:* 2.63 (pretty bad I know. I was originally a political science major but switched to electrical engineering as I thought a STEM degree would be more useful than poli sci.  Service Academies are pretty rigorous so I'm hoping that this will be considered by an adcom).

**MBA Info**
*Goal of MBA:* 

*Industries:*Consulting, social enterprise, tech, IB/finance.  

*Aptitudes:* I enjoy creative problem solving, am extroverted/social, and providing decision advantage in an advisory capacity. Based off my aptitudes and interests, it seems that the first two of my options may be the best direction for me, but I recognize that having a BS in electrical engineering and the ability to communicate is sought after.

*Overarching goal:* Ideally, I would like an interactive, financially rewarding career in which I can use my soft skills and divergent thinking to resolve issues and innovate for a better world.

*Target schools:* Stanford GSB, Columbia, Anderson, Haas, Stern, Booth, McComb, Darden.  I would put Harvard/Yale/Wharton but those seem to be extremely big reach schools with my GPA

**Additional Information:**

*Post 9/11 GI Bill* 

* I have the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which will pay for all tuition/fees at a public school, and significantly reduce the cost of attending a private school depending on said school's Yellow Ribbon Program.  Due to Congress forgetting about USCGA, I am entitled to this generous benefit (normally you have to serve 36 months after the service academy commitment before you accrue time towards it. USCGA grads who graduated in 2014 or earlier earn it when they hit 3 years of service).

*School Location* 

* I'm stationed in NYC, which is why Stern &amp; Columbia are in my target schools list. The Veteran's Network in NYC seems to be extremely strong, and the proximity to the financial services/consulting industries is attractive as well as the fact that I ""know"" this city.  I'd hope to go on terminal in the summer of 2019, work an internship with a bank/consulting firm, and then enter business school.  I'm attracted to California b-schools due to social enterprise and ties to tech industries.

Thanks so much, and please let me know what you recommend for the GMAT. I recognize that I'm working at a disadvantage here with my lower GPA, but hoping that preparation, my interview skills, and veterans status with access to the Post 9/11 GI Bill will help me win admission to a great school."

7e2uk7,1,2017-11-19,Advice for an Msc master internship decision,FnafMissingLink,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7e2uk7/advice_for_an_msc_master_internship_decision/,"Hi everyone,


I'm currently a Biology Msc within a cellular and development specializaton. This is also something that I want to pursue for a later carreer as the field is quite interdisciplinair and close to my preference for (eco)toxicological research.


During my Bsc I had the best internship I could've wished for, which focussed on assessment of particle effects in larval zebrafish. I also came to love zebrafish larvae a model organisms and would've loved to pursue research on them. However, even though it was a great collaboration that fitted me perfectly, I wasn't allowed to pursue this research for my Msc internship, as students have to broaden their perspective.


So for my Msc internship after lots of oriëntation and introductory talks, I found myself torn between 2 internship opportunities, both who adressed  possible interest in having me. I'm quite at a loss of what would be the best choice for me on account of my personal feelings, and my future career. I'll go a bit into detail on both of them.


The first one is actually from a physics deperartment who looks to built a microscope that is able to detect particles within zebrafish larvae. They were in need of a biology student that would dedicate himself to injection of zebrafish larvae (a skill that I've always wanted to learn). For this study they do collaborate with the chemistry department as the chemistry deparment has a research to the blood brain barrier that would benefit from tracking these particles in vivo (a really interesting resrearch!), and that faculty would give me an intensive training on zebrafish larvae injection. However, the huge downside to this is that it would be literally all I would be doing. I would be able to pick up on some of the details on the research of the chemistry department, but I would mainly be used to inject zebrafish larvae so the physics department could test their equipment. The physics faculty kind of threw me a bone saying that perhaps I could help with other parts of the study later on. However that was only when I notified I had to able to write a thesis on the study and thus also have to have some contribution to the development of the study. They did not specify what I could be doing. They did also admit that their main interest in me was because injecting zebrafish larvae isn't really a job for most physics phd'ers, and thus they specifically had need of someone for it. They also seemed quite strict on having me at their workplace all the time (although I don't have to inject all day) which felt quite uneasy as there are also courses I want / have to follow in-between. Although the skill is valuable, I'm thus not quite sure if this would help me develop for actual research, and my main worry is that I might be a bit abused.


The second study was from the biology faculty. It was a research that used micro-ct, tomography and hybridization techniques to uncover developmental pathways of a fish larvae with a parasitic lifestyle (no zebrafish). The supervisor seemed quite nice (although she was quite hard to understand due to a heavy chinese accent). However, my exact role in the study was quite vague (even after the introductory talk) and it also seemed she was quite hasty with her research, as she would depart just a month after I would end my internship. The techniques seemed okay, as I would learn something new. Although as I've said, she was quite vague on what I would be using them for, as it seemed she already did some of the things herself, and was mainly focussed on someone for the micro-ct part, which I found a bit less important. However, The research itself was quite interesting, and I felt I had a bit more contribution to the development of it! She did seem quite nice, so I guess she wouldn't be that harsh on me following courses as well, but she also hinted that their research group tends to have their breaks together and people would notice if someone didn't show up quite often. So with this study I think I would also learn some techniques (that are a bit less valuable), but it was quite vague what would be my purpose in the study apart from doing micro-ct (which at first glance doesn't seem as valuable, but perhaps I might be wrong).

tl;dr 

So now I'm quite torn up between both positions as both are interesting, but also have their downsides. The first one felt as if they would be abusing me, although learning zebrafish larvae injection really fits me. The second one seemed quite vague, but I think I would be able to have a bit more contribution. I know I won't have the perfect internship I had during my last year, but it doesn't make it easier to pick. The internship will last for half a year, and during my next year I'll also be able to do an internship.


Thus my goal with this 'rant' was mainly to ask for advice on this decision, especially regarding my future career. I really  do want to continue in (eco)toxicological research and work with zebrafish as a model organism. However I'm also open to other developmental research, as perhaps my perspective isn't fully formed yet since it's based on one good internship.


I'm looking forward to your opinion, even if it's a small one! If any of you have questions about me or anything I've mentioned, feel free to ask them! I do want to thank you guys in advance. Of course if my choice ended up being the wrong one, it will be just for half a year, so there no real worries. However, it doesn't make it easier to choose.

7e3pop,3,2017-11-19,I'm soon to graduate with a B.S. in CS and unsure how to make my first steps into a career.,bounceyboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7e3pop/im_soon_to_graduate_with_a_bs_in_cs_and_unsure/,"Hi everyone! I've been a lurker here for about a year, but honestly the majority of what people say goes over my head and I'm hoping asking more specifically about my situation will help.

I'm about to graduate from Rutgers with a B.S. in CS. I'm behind because of a major change and some failed classes, so I'll be graduating after a Summer class, meaning my official graduation date is in October 2018. My GPA is terrible and I've had no internships or any work in the field (except for a couple years working for the Rutgers computer labs, but that wasn't programming at all.)

I have a pretty interesting resume I believe, I've been a decently successful Twitch streamer for the past couple years, which is why I haven't pursued a coding job, and I have very good interview/personal skills. That said, because of my lack of experience and technical knowledge I worry that when I graduate I'll have a very difficult time finding a real coding job. I am good at programming and related stuff however, so I believe that I could be successful in technical interviews by the time I graduate.

Another issue for me is that I'm super behind the curve for most seniors. Rutgers has a requirement of 7 CS electives that usually students do spread throughout their last 4 semesters, but I'm taking 3 this semester and 4 next semester. This will leave me with little time I think, as well as me not having the knowledge that I believe most employers are looking for when hiring seniors. For reference, I've learned up to Computer architecture and a lot about formal logic/CS theory. I'm currently in a software class, a systems programming class, and a programming languages (theory) class. Most of my classes use and used C, I have a little experience with assembly, and my software class uses Java.

My question is this: How can I optimally prepare for graduation at this point? I'm certain that I want a career in CS, and I'm worried that since I haven't applied myself really until my senior year it's going to be difficult. I'm considering working through leetcode, doing my own programming projects to put on github, and applying to jobs. I don't have unlimited time though, and I'm wondering which of these would be the most efficient use of that time, or if there's something else entirely you all would suggest.

Thanks for reading, sorry I know it's a lot, just seems like very few people in a similar situation to me post here.

tl;dr - I'm a senior with my most important classes this year and I have no experience outside of schooling. How can I optimally make use of my remaining time in school to allow me to find a job when I graduate?"

I graduated from university with a B.S. in biotechnology (biochemistry with a little bit of programming), with 26k student loans and worked for a year at a company making 40k$ pretax. However, it requires very odd shifts (ranging from morning, evenings, and nights) and has very little prospects of moving up. Due to family situation, I had to quit and move back home. I saved up 6k$ in the meantime. I've been looking for jobs but its very limited with not much to look forward to. Lots of science entry level jobs for my experience pays little (12-17$ish) and also has odd shifts. I really can't see myself continuing with this career path for the next 40 years so I was thinking of returning back to school to pursue a 2nd bachelors for computer science. I am doing this because I find the subject very interesting and I tried to self study/learn from boot camps but my friend told me that I won't be getting the proper knowledge needed besides ""code monkey"" related work. Since I already finished up 1 degree, it would cost me 6k$ (financial aid) to get the other one and I would plan on working part time to pay my living expense. I figured with better knowledge and strong determination since my first time in college I was fairly immature and didn't take advantage of my resources, I could try to land an internship and grow my resume from there. Is this the right idea? I see a lot of people saying that returning to college isn't worth it but I think the proper guidance for learning programming correctly could really help me out. Also, the usual starting salaries around my area is 60k which is 50% higher than what I was earning and if I really am able to get better opportunities the salaries would be higher of course. Any advice is appreciated and I will try to comment to give more advice!"
7e3y57,1,2017-11-19,Looking for advice on my routine,hanneshotmail,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/7e3y57/looking_for_advice_on_my_routine/,"
About me:
I am 27 and graduated from a master in finance in Denmark. During my last semester (September 2016 - February 2017) I got an internship at a fortune 500 firm. During my internship my manager loved me and made sure I stayed at the company.

The trigger
After finishing the internship I decided to stay at the company in a different division (February - November 2017). Nevertheless the new manager and I could not work together and he ended up firing me. 

The reason he told me was not because I didn't deliver good results it was literally because we could not work together. 

For me I have no hard feelings about it , as my mangers boss has written me a great letter of recommendation, co-workers I have been working closely together with are providing me with references  and I have been looking for new jobs prior to the firing. 

My feelings 

After I graduated I haven't been very satisfied with basically everything which resulted that I had negative feelings. 

From the outside it seems that I have a great life. 
My degree is a above average and I easily found a job. I have a great girlfriend and couldn't wish for better emotional support from her. 

However from February to November everything became worse when I started to work for my new boss. He has not been manager that enabled his employees he was more a leader that pushed his employees in a more destructive manner. This made my emotional state worse. I had a slight upside when I decided to look for a new job however the weather during Autumn makes you get a winter depression, so all in all I felt miserable from September to October. After my manager fired me I felt even worse and my world was collapsing.

Nonetheless I started with a new daily routine after he fired me because I was afraid of falling into a deep emotional hole. 

Mirror game:
In the morning I start to tell myself that I love myself and that I am going to have a great day.

Suggestion game:
I take a page and write repeatedly several sentences.
Eg I love myself. 
That I have a great job.
I succeed in my daily doings.

Meditation game:
Each day I close my eyes and imagine a great day where I work successfully somewhere. Enjoy the time with friends and my girl friend. 

The result: 
Today I feel balanced. I feel neutral and I feel slightly optimistic. I don't feel 100% good at the moment, due to the fact that I got fired but I feel somewhat in control. 

Questions:
This is the first time I have done this, did anyone experience anything similar?
What can I improve in regards to my routine?
Are there any negative side effects?

I took their advice, I do significantly less studying, and my grades suffer slightly, but im overall much more relaxed and happy. I still do all my homework (lab reports, etc). My mental and physical health improved after chilling out.

7e62qv,3,2017-11-19,A Statement of Purpose for a Biostatistics M.S. Please critique!,Douglas_McFloofer,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7e62qv/a_statement_of_purpose_for_a_biostatistics_ms/,"I desire a graduate degree in biostatistics in order to solve problems in the dynamic and growing health care industry. The road I traveled as an undergraduate at the University of XXX included both academic research and an industrial internship in medical device security and quality; that experience provides me the foundation for successful graduate study. The University of XXX’s excellent biostatistics curriculum provides a fundamental education in statistical methods such modeling, regression, and longitudinal analysis while allowing me to customize my education with the cadre of electives available. Upon receiving my M.S., I intend to work in the health care industry designing experiments and clinical trials to validate medical devices and techniques.


Statistics’ use in validating scientific research and predictive modelling interest me most significantly. My career up to this point has largely focused on using statistics to validate studies on industrial equipment and to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. Having studied engineering as an undergraduate, I’ve applied statistics to improve manufacturing processes in the automotive and medical device industries. Working in highly regulated industries such as those has given me an appreciation for the need to statistically validate the quality of our product at every stage of the manufacturing process. With a graduate degree in biostatistics, I can take the leap from designing manufacturing processes to designing scientific and medical studies.


The PI in my first research internship inspired me to supplement my engineering education with a statistics minor. I was responsible for working with files from an FDA medical device database to create a graph grouping thousands of devices by function and similarity. I learned the fundamentals of UNIX shell scripting to accomplish this goal; working with medical device databases from the beginning of my undergraduate career portended my passion for both statistics and the medical device industry.


One statistical technique I’ve used throughout my career is the gage repeatability and reproducibility study (gage R&amp;R). The purpose of a gage R&amp;R study is to validate that a measurement device (gage) is capable of producing consistent results when different operators measure the same part. This study involves taking a sample of manufactured parts, then having three operators measure the same parts three times each. This study is blinded so that operators do not know which parts are measured at any given time. Once data is collected, the statistician uses ANOVA to determine the percent of total variation between measurements that can be attributed to the operators, the parts, and the gage. We perform this study to demonstrate to our customer that our gages do not significantly contribute to any measurement variation in our product.


Most interestingly, this technique was applied identically in both my internship at a biotech firm and my current job at an automotive supply firm. In both jobs, our customers required all of our measurement devices be validated by gage R&amp;R by demonstrating that our gages contributed to less than ten percent of the total process variation. Whether the device was a high-powered spectrometer or an ordinary tape measure, our company was responsible for convincing our customer that we can verify the quality of our product. In my current role I am responsible for managing the machine operators’ data collection then presenting an argument to our customer that our gages are as accurate as we guarantee. During the two years in XXX’s biostatistics M.S. program, I can combine this leadership experience with advanced classes on experimental design to kick off a career in clinical research.


Examples like the above are a microcosm of why I’m passionate about statistics as a career. As John Tukey once said, “the best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.” Not only can one work in virtually any industry or research organization with a statistics degree, but one can work in virtually any sector of an organization. While I desire to work in the health care industry designing and validating clinical trials, I appreciate the flexibility associated with a biostatistics degree and the litany of electives offered at Michigan with which I can expand my knowledge of the field. I intend to select classes such as biostatistical computing and computational methods in statistics because the ability to manipulate and extract information from data sets is paramount for a modern statistician.


Finally, I appreciate that XXX’s M.S. program prepares its students for doctoral study, even offering a curriculum for students who wish to pursue a doctorate after the masters. I desire to work in clinical research, and a doctorate unlocks the doors to a future of leading scientific studies and the privilege of conducting original research. Although I do not yet know if my academic journey ends with a masters or a doctorate, I appreciate that the M.S. program can put me on the fast track to further study.

7e6ygb,217,2017-11-20,Tips for College Freshmen,mabdel511,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7e6ygb/tips_for_college_freshmen/,"I wrote this as a comment in someone's post but decided to make it my own. Basic but great tips for College Freshmen, or College students in general.

1. Don't take classes lightly just because you're a freshman, study and go to class. Don't listen to those who are always acting cool and bragging because they skipped class.

2. If your professor assigns homework, and it isn't graded, do all that homework and make sure you do it all right. Those questions will 9/10 times appear on your exams and/or quizzes.

3. Take breaks when studying, not 80 hour breaks, but reasonable breaks for long study hours.

4. Don't, Don't DONT DONT DONT DONT DONT Procrastinate, they say money is the root of all evil, in college, procrastination is the root of all evil. If you have an exam in 2 weeks, plan for it, study slow, take your time, 3 days before review, day before review, and then take the exam. Don't wait till its 8pm on Sunday while you're watching Friends on Netflix and still considering studying for your 8:30am class. Don't do this, trust me, trust me, trust me, it hurts and it hurts alot when you knew you had the chance but wasted it.

5. If your stuck, ask for help.

6. Make study groups, join study groups, start a study group.

7. Don't sleep on trying to get internships early and getting your game on, you will look way way way better than all the current freshmen with you. Just try, you won't lose anything. Go to career fairs, network with people there, even if you don't want an internship right now try to get some companies interested in you, show that you're serious and of value.

8. Don't be the that person who goes all 4 years not socializing or talking to anyone, it hurts. Join clubs ( I didnt join clubs even though I wanted to so badly, I'm an idiot for not doing so, I completely regret it, well I still can tbh lol ) You'll make friends, gain experience while having fun, be involved, and enjoying your time. Note that clubs are not your only option, talk to random people on campus, people in class, go to school events, have lunch with a stranger (who knows he might be into all the weird any crazy stuff you're into), if you can, try to join a sport, go to school games, etc. 
My freshman year I was sick of keeping myself in my comfort zone and literally walked around campus talking to completely random people I have never met or talked to before in my life. I would ask someone where the library was just to start up a conversation, when it was in clear sight in front of both of us, lol.

9. Get some part-time job, it'll teach you responsibility, I'm still in college and I started working more this year and it is indirectly helping me plan and implement things, and manage my time. Preferably a job or volunteering related to your major, paid or unpaid the experience and responsibility is way more valuable than the money.

10. Stay physically healthy, go to the gym, workout, run, exercise,sweat, swim, this will keep your body and mind healthy. 2 birds with 1 stone, don't miss.

10. Have fun, its college, if you don't feel like going to parties you don't have to. I never went to a college party, currently a Junior, and don't really intend on doing so. Theres so much more you can do, plan a guys or girls night, movie night, go skiing, game night, go out to NYC, see if any cool events are going on on campus, play ball at the gym, swim, go bike riding, explore campus (this is actually fun to do alone, you'd be surprised with what you can find) 

Overall Story: Don't waste College, have fun, enjoy your time, use it wisely (USE YOUR TIME WISELY, WISE-LY, W I S E L Y)

**People are talking in the comments and saying how I shouldn't give advice because I don't go to college parties and that I'm not implementing these because i don't go to college parties. It was my decision whether or not to go to parties, I have friends who go to parties and have no problem with them. I was friends with the DJ at the parties and still didn't go. I was childhood friends and still currently am friends with one of the frat leads, but I still didn't go to party. I simply don't want to go to one and prefer having fun in different ways. Having ""fun"" doesn't only mean going to a party, there's much more you can do. If you feel like going to a party, go ahead, if that's what you like and enjoy, then do it. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with that too.**

During the undergraduate course, I came across the fascinating example of a simple digital computer in our digital electronics subject. Wanting to learn more, I applied at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre as a research intern. The internship gave me a hands on lesson on C and device drivers. Galvanised, the next summer I applied in Indian Institute of technology (IIT) Kanpur and worked on a parallel architecture for natural language processing application on FPGAs using VHDL. I decided I wanted to make a career in computer engineering and joined University of Florida for a masters program in the same field. I could vividly see how coding is essential for solving seemingly impossible real world problems. System software was the right amalgamation of my interests then, working with architectures and software at the same time. 

After graduation, I got a job at Intel for developing some of the fastest storage devices. In my 3 years at Intel as a firmware developer, I gained deep insights of ARM architecture, writing production code in C and python. In conjunction, I took part in Spacex Hyperloop challenge and was a firmware developer in avionics at rLoop, an open source team. We won the 2017 design innovation award.

Being a regular attendee in seminars in Silicon Valley I was introduced to the far reaches of Machine learning from medical imaging in cancer to understanding our genome. Fascinated, I took an algorithm course on Coursera to start the CS journey and enjoyed it thoroughly. This has been my motivation for applying to the OMS CS program, to move to a research based career in algorithms and machine learning and at the same time continue to deepen my knowledge of software and product design."

I am a Strategic communication major in my first semester of junior (third) year. This semester, I am taking Calculus I and Python to prepare for the CS minor in the remaining three semesters. Long story short, last semester, I decided to pick up CS. I have had three decent internships in communication. My ultimate since the start of college goal is getting a paid internship in Media and work in a firm. That goal has changed because my personality does not fit with that flaky media relations world. Now, I am gearing towards technology or academia.  The possible careers of interest that combine communication and CS are data journalist, data analyst, or professor ( talk about that later in the question ). The thing is, I almost finish my degree at a university rank 115 nationally located not near a tech hub. To complete a double major, I will graduate in 6 years, which is a no for me. My current university has a mediocre Computer Science Department. And I am sick of staying at the same place and ofc, finance.


So here are my questions for you:

1. So another option is going to grad school in Communication field where programming skill is useful in research and become a professor. It fits my personality more than a media person is, even though grad students are sadly poor and affected profoundly by the recent 300 % tax raise. If I pick a good grad school program for communication, I need good and real research experience. A bummer: internship and research program application conflict in deadline in Spring 2018. 

1. Should I continue applying for internship summer 2018 in Communication like I am doing now? 

2.  Given the ability constraint I demonstrate in my Python class and slow learning nature,  it's difficult to compete with other skilled programmers. I have this book called ""Python for everyone"" by Hortsman with lots of great exercises each chapter.  I don't succeed in running them. #discouraged. Do you guys have any tips practicing CS exercises? (Tips other than ""Persistence"")

Small department.,the_wandering,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/7ea8ra/coworker_talks_badly_about_our_boss_small/,"I just started this job in January. Before then I did an internship there and based on that my boss gave me the job. 


I never had any dealings with coworker: A. She remained tight lipped and never spoke to me during the internship. Now since I've been hired, A has been giving me bad vibes. She says things which I believe are lies.. like she was the reason I got hired etc. I went to school for our profession, she did not. She trained on the job. I needed a little bit of instruction and I was good to go. If I ever ask our boss a question in front of her she runs out to answer it. And boss lets her.

Heres the thing. She complains constantly. And I feel as if *she* wants to manage me.. especially bc shes trying to arrange it so I sit directly in front of her. I would be sitting with my back to her. She already makes me uncomfortable so I havent agreed or requested to be moved.

I try to stay on her good side by dropping by ever so often to chat (mostly about her). The last time we chatted she pulled out her certification exam score report and bragged on how well she did on the exam (we both took). I was only a few points under her but didn't say so.

Shes held this position for 5 years. Recently she let me in on the fact that shes looking for another job and all but hates our boss. The negative talk is getting to me as it is really harsh at times.

This is a new job for me and I want to stay out of the negativity. But I feel like my coworker is ramping up. She actually recently obtained my number and called me at 8am to tell me I needed to sign a form. 

Im doing my best to ignore her. Has anyone else ever dealt with an unsavory coworker?"

This is my first post by the way, I mean literally my first post ever.

I don't know what course to take. It might sound dumb but, at the end of the day, all I want to be is financially successful.

I've been thinking of taking an IT course (Information Technology)or computer science or CS, but it's the fact that theses courses might be crowded and looking for internships are gonna be a competition to find. I'm very clueless on what to do during college and when to start applying for internships, any advice on how to start my college life will do. I thought of taking aeronautical engineering but the board exams scare me ( I know it sounds pitiful, hahaha) the same goes with my idea of taking a Pharm. D course ( Being a pharmacist is my second choice after computer science).  

I just don't want to waste any time in college and make the most of it for a (sure?) future that will be financially stable and where I don't have to worry about being unemployed when i reach my 30's

It's haunting me so any advice is greatly appreciated, Thanks :)"

7eatel,31,2017-11-20,Chances of entering the CS work force as a disabled adult?,crippledcoder94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7eatel/chances_of_entering_the_cs_work_force_as_a/,"Hey guys,

I've been reading this sub to try and get some advice but I don't think any threads have a pinpoint on my exact situation. The basic rundown: I have a form of Muscular Dystrophy (SMA type 2) and am a December 2016 graduate in CS from a state school in my hometown. When I graduated I immediately cracked down and started looking for jobs or internships, anything I could find. However, life kinda threw a curve ball and a drug came out that was the first of its kind to treat my condition. Because of this I had to put my job search on the back burner to deal with doctors appointments, insurance and all the treatment schedules, etc. Afterwards I didn't really resume my job search till September-ish when I was fully recovered from all the treatments (lumbar punctures yay). I got a couple of interviews but none ever went to the second stage. At this point I'm wondering if its even possible to break into the workforce as a disabled adult. When I go into interviews its always a little weird even if I tell the company I am disabled and need accommodations (shoutout to the one company who had my interview in a building with no elevators). Its also kind of awkward since I have to have my mom or brother drive me to interviews since I cant drive. If I were to get a job with a schedule I could get a driving assistant through the state but as of now there is no point to having one. Even the application process is off putting. Most jobs require a ""High paced, independent worker"" which is pretty much the exact opposite of me. I can type about 60 wpm but not for long periods of time and I have to take a lot of breaks to stretch my hands and back. Ideally, a remote job would be best for me but I know that entry level remote jobs are very unrealistic. In general its just very hard. My parents have been very supportive and told me to stop stressing so much on finding work. Most people in my situation don't even go to college but I feel like a drain on society just sitting here not giving anything back. Do I have a realistic shot at ever obtaining a job? My plan was to work as long as possible before I eventually had to stop due to my condition progressing but now with these new drugs coming out its allowed for my condition to slow considerably or even stop which allows for me to have a long career. I have so many questions on the process. Some people say I should not self identify as disabled on applications and some people say I always should. There just doesn't seem to be a lot of advice out there in terms of applying to the tech sector as a disabled individual. If anyone could offer their advice I'd greatly appreciate it.

7ebgsv,2,2017-11-20,Offer Letter not matching interview,karan686,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ebgsv/offer_letter_not_matching_interview/,"Hello reddit,

I am an international student currently a senior and have been offered an internship position at a pretty big company. The only thing is, as an international there are a few limits and restrictions such as only 20 hour work weeks in the spring and fall and the fact that the job search once I graduate is using the OPT which many of you are familiar with. I have three issues:

1. The job offer I just received from the hiring agency says it's 40 hours but when I interviewed we discussed 20 hour work weeks.
2. The CPT(permit for internships for international) can only last 364 days of less and my job offer lasts exactly tat. But I graduate in May 2018 and have to look into an OPT so I'm not sure how that one year can affect that.
3. I'm a computer science major and the interviewer told me I'd be doing  a lot of things with engineers for design and programmers for the code. Which is perfect, but the job description they sent me is of a BT Drafter / Design and I'm not sure what to expect of that if it really will help me as a programmer. 

Please I really need some guidance here.  "
7ebhs0,4,2017-11-20,"I’m very good at my job but because it’s considered to be “bottom of the totem pole” at my workplace, I get treated as such. It’s ruining my mental health and causing unbearable social anxiety.",missmatchedsocks88,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7ebhs0/im_very_good_at_my_job_but_because_its_considered/,"I take 30 mg of lexapro for my depression of anxiety each day and had previously been taking 20. My stress and anxiety have been so bad that my doc had to up my dose. I have never really suffered from social anxiety until recently and it is nearly crippling. I wake up most days and just want to cry because I have to go to work and deal with, well, bullying. As a 30 year old woman, I’m dealing with bullying and I never really had to as a kid. There were a few meanies but not to the extent of what I’m dealing with now. 

I work as a cashier at a pharmacy. I’m currently trying to get certified as a pharmacy tech because state laws where I’m from don’t require schooling to complete certification, they just require employment at a pharmacy and an 80% on the tech exam. I just started my “journey” if you will to certification. This is just one of many things I’m ridiculed for at work. 

•I’m not entrusted to accept payments towards patient accounts or to go get change on my own, even though it is in the cashier’s job description. I finally confronted the tech that wouldn’t allow me to do this and, after 8 months of working there, she is allowing me to do it. 
•I am constantly corrected and nitpicked over every patient interaction I have. One of the techs, “R”, will watch me from the corner of her eye all day and if I say something in conversation other than “Date of birth? Have any questions?” she will correct me. Sometimes I’m the only true human interaction that the patients get. Sometimes they like being joked with and talked to like a person, especially in a hospital setting. My boss loves my interactions with patients and they love it too. I never cross lines asking them what they are in for or anything too personal. I’ve worked in sales and retail before and am an extrovert. I know how to talk to people. Patients know me and they love that I know who they are and have a smile for them when they come in. I don’t understand what is wrong with being friendly and genuine to people. 
•When I ask for help or insight while studying for my exam (my boss allows me to do so in my downtime at work) R makes me feel like the biggest idiot in the world. She talks to me like I’m a child and straight up said “You will never be able to get this on your own. Just take the course.” I already have a bachelor’s degree but in something I realized I didn’t want to do half way through my last semester. I know how to study and I have a pretty sharp memory. It really pissed me off that she would say this. 
•R and one of the pharmacists, D, are *very* passive aggressive. If you do one thing wrong, they will act short and rude to you for the rest of the day, no matter how small the mistake. Example:
      -We were planning a joke on one of the other pharmacists by replacing a full box of flu shots with empty ones to see her reaction. I asked her if she had any flu shots today and both R and D pulled me in the back room and reprimanded me for “ruining the joke”. I didn’t ruin the joke. The other pharmacist hasn’t even opened the box or even made an indication that she knew what I was talking about. All I did was ask if she had done any shots. That was it. R hasn’t said one word to me since she chewed me out and D is making me feel about 2 feet tall every time I have to talk to her. 
•Rules change. One day it’ll be ok for me to study and ask questions, then the next day the girls are mad at me because I’m studying and “not doing my job” aka standing at the cash register waiting for a patient to pick up their meds. Sometimes an hour or two will go by with no patients and I can only dust and stock so much before I run out of stuff to do. Again, my boss gave me the go-ahead to study so I’m not breaking any rules. 
•I’m not allowed to take an afternoon break. The other girls do and can but if I try to, I’m called back to my post every time a patient comes in. I’m legally allowed to take two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. It was in my contract. This also applies to bathroom breaks. I go to the restroom for two minutes (do my business and wash my hands) and they’re screaming for me to come back up front. That’s right: some days even going pee is unacceptable. 
•They talk about me when I leave the room. I’ve walked in on it several times. Sometimes they won’t even wait for me to be out of the room. If I make a mistake, they whisper about me while I’m in earshot. I feel like minor mistakes are treated as major, unforgivable mistakes. 
•I’m treated like their bitch. I’m ordered around all the time. “Put the drugs away” and I’ll go to put them away and get yelled at for not watching the counter. “Refill the vials” so I do and they are mad that I didn’t leave one or two at the pharmacy station in case they need it during the whole 30 seconds I’m gone to refill them. 
•I get blamed for every little mistake. The computer system crashed a few weeks back and it was my fault for not calling the company to fix it. The thing is: it has never been my responsibility to do this. Every time we had problems with the system, a pharmacist or the tech person (who wasn’t there that day) would call and get it fixed. I’m not a computer person and not once have I ever been in charge of fixing the computers. I was frozen out by the girls for two days following the crash. We also had an intern that week. She was putting drugs away in the wrong spot. Guess who got corrected and blamed for that? That’s right: ME. 

I honestly just don’t know how to socialize with people anymore. I have been corrected and reprimanded so many times by my coworkers that I’m terrified of conversing in any other way other than the robotic questions and conversation I have to make now. My patients have caught on and I’m constantly asked if I’m ok to which I respond, “I’m fine. Credit or debit?” It physically and emotionally pains me to have to be so reserved. I feel like I’m not allowed to be myself. My friendliness and people skills were something I was very proud of. Now I feel like an annoyance and terrified of interaction, not only with patients but in my personal life as well. I am treated like such a failure and a loser and an annoyance by people that are supposed to be helping me. I want to finish my tech certification but I also do t want to deal with the amount of mental turmoil and social anxiety that has been brought on by daily torture. I’ve never, ever been afraid to talk to people and never felt so socially anxious and depressed in my life. I don’t know what to do about it. It’s getting to the point where I’m withdrawing and not socializing anymore because I’m starting to wonder if I’ve just been annoying all along. 

TL;DR: I’ve been a social butterfly my whole life and have always felt like I did good work at my jobs. My coworkers’ constant reprimands and corrections towards my job and socializing with my patients is causing overwhelming social anxiety. I basically feel like I can’t be myself and have to pull my personality way back. It’s ruining my self esteem. 

I’ve spoken to my boss many times and she doesn’t know what to do either. Shes very passive and doesn’t want the confrontation. She’s talked to R about her behavior Towards me many times and each time, it just gets worse. I hate that when I make a small human mistake, that I get frozen out for the rest of the day. "
7ec0fo,8,2017-11-20,Tips for how to get noticed and not lose faith in the job hunt?,JobHuntGotMeDown,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ec0fo/tips_for_how_to_get_noticed_and_not_lose_faith_in/,"I know, I know, there are tons of posts like this. Forgive me, I need to vent and I really need some advice or encouragement. 

I graduated in Dec 2016 (in three and a half years) from a state school (in top 20 for CS). I double majored in comp sci and math and graduated with honors. I have three years of internship experience (literal years, I worked while getting my degree) from reputable places where I did things that mattered. I was offered a full time gig at my last internship, but turned it down because I thought I wanted to go to grad school at the time. I went through the new grad process with Google and made it on site. I think I'm a pretty good developer, but I'm definitely at the new grad stage of my career.

I've been applying to places for 9 months and have gotten 3 interviews. I've had people review my resume here and by developers I know and they say it looks good. Admittedly I've gone through a few rewrites but I've sent out about 50 applications with my most recent resume (maybe 200 total). [Here's a link to my resume if you want to take a look](https://imgur.com/a/MNQwI) Most places don't even get back to me with a no. I've been applying to positions in Chicago, SF, and Seattle to no avail. I write tailored cover letters for each position. 

I've tapped my small personal network and even reached out to distant classmates whom I've never spoken to hoping to get a referral where they work, but most people don't know me well enough to feel comfortable doing that. 

Is there anything I can do to stand out? Should I go into offices? Should I stalk recruiters on linked in? Is there something wrong with my resume I'm missing? Please I'm desperate here. "
7ecclx,1,2017-11-20,Changing jobs too frequently?,coffee_401,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ecclx/changing_jobs_too_frequently/,"The situation: For the last year and a half, I've been working at a small consulting firm. It is my first job out of college, so the only job on my resume that lasted longer was a two year long internship. I don't really like consulting, and have been putting in applications here and there in fields I am more interested in.  The other day I got a promising first-round interview, which led me to ask this question.

The problem: In fall of 2019, my SO is planning to start grad school. Depending on where she gets in, it is likely that will require us to move to a new city.  Assuming I get the job I interviewed for, that means there's a good chance I'd have to find a new job again less than two years from now.  Am I right to worry that switching jobs today will make my resume look much worse when that happens?  Is that enough of a concern that I should turn down the position I interviewed for if I am offered it?"

7ecp6t,2,2017-11-20,How to learn database design / general IT projects in practice,jopoAT,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7ecp6t/how_to_learn_database_design_general_it_projects/,"Well, might be that i am totally off the path in this sub (hints for better surrenders welcome :) ) ...
My ""problem"" is, that i landed a job which is rather mixed and/or not well defined in a small company, and i feel sort of lost with not knowing where to start or how best practices would look like. Sometimes I feel like i am an intern only, despite i should behave like being a professional employee with project experiences. The guy above me in hierarchy got decades of work experience but he is not really a technician, so often we have like ""exchanged roles"". I got an unlimited work contract, but it is my first fulltime job after studies.

Some more background info:
I did not study informatics at all, but i am involved with IT/coding/networking/admin/database stuff since more than a decade during school and as a hobby, but i never did bigger projects or got to work within a company ""framework"" (framework in terms of guidelines, prepared build environment, project managers, IT infrastructure and so on)

So what i am definitively good at (and already proved multiple times with the company) is finding the level of a problem and providing possible solutions and alternatives... So if something is broken i need a minute only to distinguish if its on the database side, or a DNS entry was wrongly configured, or if we do have an outage of our internet connection...

So one of the main problems where it starts that i get lost, is that i work sort of my own, have all the possibilities from the opensource scene in any domain that would be possible, have a lot of not good documented legacy systems and no real infrastructure (we are working like 15 years ago, excel sheets on fileshares, reply-to-death mailconversations) and new upcoming projects.

Its not that the company would not want to spend money for new staff so we could build up a team. But currently, as it is a remote location, there is just nobody available on the market who would fit.
So of course I want to do my best, build up some practical knowledge and have this inner goal to make everything as well documented as possible so a possible future employe with lots of work experience would then have an rather easy start to get the big picture during onboarding.

Currently i have to model a database for a new project, where we work together with another company. So it looks like the managers do have only a vague vision of the final product they want to have and im not only in the role of the database modeler but also in the role of the ""requirements engineer""...

So how can i imagine modelling a database for a project in a big company? Is it then just ""stupid"" working for the database engineer?  Like That the requirements are split into modules and every team member models (normalizes, defines primary keys, columns, constraints etc) a part of it and via version control everything is put together in the end? How is/should the communication between management, project manager and the actual database engineers be established? And who decides, what kind of application logic should be handled on the database level (RDBMS provide really sophisticated methods which are decades old established code) or in the application (where it often happens in the modern WebDev times that the ""wheel is reinvented"")...
Or am i just kind of too fresh after studies and its as chaotic behind the scenes everywhere and all i am ranting about is just the way having a job is about, and i need to get used to that? :)"

I'm a current junior at a fairly well known University but not a tech school. I never coded before I came to college and throughout my classes we've learned pretty much the basic concepts but haven't really had much experience with different fields of programming, just the basics of Architecture / OOP / Algorithms and stuff. I applied to Microsoft and didn't end up getting a second round interview and I'm sort of torn on where to look now. A lot of the other internships I'm looking at are asking for experience  which is just can't get in my classes and I don't know where to start. 

I would love to work in a game development studio but have almost none of the experience those undergraduate internships are calling for and it stresses me out a good bit.

How did you all figure out which place / type of job was right for you and do you have any advice for a newbie like me?

EDIT: I understand Java, Python, OOP well, and C++ very basically and thats really it."

I am here because the normal advice board that I use has not been very helpful.


So here is the situation. I am 19, currently living with my mom in Boulder county Colorado. I have a highschool diploma and a few certificates from Front Range Community College. My mom is currently in the process of moving to an apartment, and in her own words she is ""not bringing [me] with [her]."" 

So I am not sure what to do. I am highly autistic and anxious, so it is difficult for me to communicate with other people in person, which is a huge problem for getting a job. My only skills are with computers, like a lot of autistic people. I am a decent programmer, but most of my knowledge is in server configuration and data management. I know GNU/Linux inside and out, I know ESXi, Xen, Proxmox. I know Cisco switches and routers, I know PfSense. I know Tahoe-LAFS and Ceph. I know SAMBA and Windows AD/DC, that sort of stuff. The issues are, I don't have much ""real world"" experience. I have had two internships, one which lasted one summer and one which was two summers, both tech related, but I got both through connections who where already aware of and accommodating of my condition.

So what do I do? I am going to be homeless in less than 3 months. If I sold all of my possessions, I could maybe afford first and last months rent. I have no idea how to apply for a job or do an interview. I don't think I could even get a job in IT because of how bad I am with people. And every time I try to think about that sort of stuff I have a panic attack and shut down. I have the feeling that I should move somewhere cheaper (midwest?) and get a wageslave job stocking shelves, but I don't have the resources or mental fortitude to do that either. I am really struggling here and I have no idea what to do.

I am sorry for being this way, and posting this here, but I am at the end of my rope, and I have no idea how I am going to get through this."

A little about myself. I have always dreamt of studying at the University of Oxford's MPhil in International Relations &amp; Politics. My plan was to finish this program and then go onto a PhD and enjoy a lovely career in academia. I have worked every summer on attaining prestigious internships in the U.S. and Canada to work in government institutions, non-profits, and embassies as a policy analyst/research associate. I have also accumulated a solid 0 to 1 friends (I don't know if he considers me a friend to be honest) during my time at University. This was done so that I could put an intense focus on school and applying and receiving all of those cool internships. I was hungry and, since the age of 18, this dream of attending Oxford was the only thing I wanted in my life. After waiting for a solid 2 months, I received acceptance into my dream program as well as information about bursaries/scholarships I had potential to receive. Things were going incredible. My family was overjoyed. I also let off some steam from school and have been hanging around more people this month (in the hope I can make some friends). Everything was on the up as I was living in this incredible daze of happiness.... 

Then, about two weeks ago, I decided to have a look at my university winter schedule. I decided that my social science statistics course was a bit too early for my liking. I had noticed that there were two social science statistics classes that semester and the other class was much later in the day. I thought that this would be a cool change from taking early classes my entire life and sleeping in for once. The long mornings of spending hours on essays, case briefs, and analyzing notes were over in my undergraduate degree I thought. So I decided to switch the Stats-A course for the Stats-B course. In order to add the Stats-B course, I had to drop the Stats-A course. I do this with no issue, BUT I forget to look at the reserved list for both Stats-A and Stats-B. So when I tried to submit the change it said a big ERROR. All of the seats had already been reserved and the waiting list was completely full. I was now dropped from both the Stats-A and Stats-B course. At first, I laughed. I thought that this would be an easy fix and the department would provide me with an override to take the course. I am a senior, right? I have a high gpa, right? They know me, why would they not provide the override? 

Well it turns out that the ENTIRE waiting list was an accumulation of 3rd, 4th and 5th year students waiting to be entered into this course. It should also be noted that this was a 2nd year course and a required elective (hence why it was so full). The department could not provide an override for me as it would put a bias on me as a student over others. FUCK. 

So then I go to the department. I get the same cold-blooded response. I then go to the dean. I get the same cold-blooded response. Lastly, I go to the head of admissions. The same freaking response. At this juncture I should probably also mention that nobody has a personal vendetta against me. Yes, I did explain to them that I received acceptance into graduate school programs. At the end of the day they did not care. Not one single tiny iota of a fuck. 

I then got in contact with the Department at Oxford. They gave a similar response in the vein that if I did not receive my undergraduate degree, regardless of the circumstances, I would be omitted from the program and all scholarships and bursaries I had applied too. 

Anyways, this is my life right now. This process has made me realize that I am just some number within academia and a pawn to get money out of. Thanks uni :) 

TLDR: Accepted to Oxford, but cannot go because I mistakenly dropped out of a required course that had no possible way of re-entry. 

Edit: Thank you for all of the advice everyone! I sincerely appreciate it. 

Edit: I should also note that I go to a small university in Canada. I would have been the first student from my university's department to have gone to Oxford. 

Edit: I am on a full-scholarship that lasts only 4 years. The stats class is only taught once per year. As a result, I will have to pay it myself (if I have funds available). "

Please keep in mind my ACT request when answering.

Clarification: I'm not applying until next year, hopefully through the Questbridge program.

**Demographics:** White, Female, family of three, 20k/year net income. First generation college student. *Currently a Junior*
Intended Major: Cognitive or Political Science

**Academics:** I took high school algebra in 8th grade and got a B, which lowered my GPA off the bat. I started taking College Courses through my local university during my Freshman year. Received 3 A's and 1 B on a 4.5 and 3.5 scale respectively. On track to earn A's in an additional college course (through another university) and two honors courses, also on a 4.5 scale. 
This is by far the most rigorous courseload my school offers.

Weighted GPA: 3.941

Rank: 6/90

ACT: 26 (as a sophomore) 32E, 26R, 23E, 23S, 7W. I know that is the worst aspect of my application and am taking monumental efforts to get a higher score. *I would appreciate it if you could chance me with a hypothetical 32 as that is what I realistically expect to be scoring soon in the future. Also how would the chances change with a 34?*

**Extracurriculars:**

Football (Before you ask, yes, the all male team. I am the first girl in my school's history. I am a defensive Lineman.)

Track and Field (I throw shotput and discus. I received a varsity letter my freshman year. I compete three seasons out of the year: Winter and Spring for my school and in the summer for Junior Olympics through USATF. My Freshman year I was one place away from nationals in two leagues, both AAU and USATF. I also received all-academic county team my sophomore year.)

Choir (Vice President of Concert Choir, which has won OMEA district superior ratings the past two years, and am also in show choir. I have participated in Chamber Choir as well. I personally have earned a superior solo rating in addition to an ensemble superior rating in OMEA solo and ensemble competition. I can say I will likely be President next year.)

Drama/Theater (I am a member of the Internation Thespian Society. I have done two shows in which I have been both cast and stage crew. I can safely say I will either be President or Vice President next year)

Scholastic/Academics Team (Not much to say, we are a small and selective group who goes around the county to compete.)

Yearbook Staff (I am the head photographer for our school's yearbook. I am responsible for taking a majority of photos while organizing people to take photos when I cannot. I am also an editor and will be head editor as well next year.)

Youth Philanthropic Board (Give out grants to nonprofits in the community. It's group by nomination only.)

Student Council (Again, not much. It's a standard thing.)

County Youth Leadership Board (One of two school representatives. We go around the county observing community issues and make plans to help county government fix them.)

I am pretty confident that I will also be a member of National Honors Society.

**Awards/Recognition**

2018 USSYP Finalist (United States Youth Senate Program. Prestigious and difficult application/testing process that results in $10k and a week with the US Senate, showing your state's representative. I am one fo thirty, for my state, who are waiting to find out which two have won in December.)

2017 HOBY Alumni (Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Conference)

Appointment into my university's chapter of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (I did not accept the nomination because I was a young and dumb sophomore. Also I am not sure if this is worth noting.)

Head of English Department Recommendation to my university's Dean (I did an extremely in depth analysis of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" for one of my college English classes)

**Work/Volunteer**

I have worked acting food service for two summers at my local medieval faire. I also undertook an internship at an intercity apartment community this past summer (Shadowed property manager, saw what intercity life is like.)

I currently have about 30 volunteer hours helping officiate track and field meets for middle schoolers. I'll have about 50 volunteer hours at the end of the year for Peer Mentorship in English.

**Schools:** My dream school is Yale. I even took a nine-hour drive there last year.

**Questions:** Other than my current ACT score, what do you think I can improve on or do going forward? What do you suggest I write about it scholarship or common app essays?

**TL;DR:** Just skim down the *left side*, everything in parenthesis are explanations and awards. Please keep in mind my ACT request when answering.

Edit: spelling, also my English professor will be really solid for my LOR. (I've had him all through highschool and he has seen my development both as a writer and student grow immensely.)

7efn5y,22,2017-11-21,"Want to go back to school for BS in CS, but is it the best option?",poopyskwats,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7efn5y/want_to_go_back_to_school_for_bs_in_cs_but_is_it/,"Hey everyone, I am 26 years old and realizing late in life that I really want to be working with technology. (first generation immigrant family so i didn't have all the pieces to make a career decision BEFORE going to college)

I have a bachelor's in marketing. Not to knock on marketing, because i love and appreciate business, especially marketing. But I know marketing isn't the end of the road for me, because i love the challenge and reward of programming, and I want to pursue something in the CS field (maybe data science, machine learning, info security, or computer graphics).

After getting a marketing degree, i realized that what i'm really into is working with code and computers. So i enrolled and completed a coding bootcamp. I learned web development and how to program practically. (FYI the bootcamp was one of the greatest decisions in my life, it turned my life around and gave me a lot of programming knowledge. I would recommend a GOOD bootcamp to anybody).

Currently, I am working at an internship. But again, deep down i feel like i need to pursue something more in CS. I feel like I'm missing something

I've been thinking about going back to school for a post-bacc (a second bachelor's) in CS. This is because:

- I know some programming, going back for the actual theory, calculations and practice will be more fruitful with the experience i gained at the bootcamp and at my current internship

- More (relative) job security, because the industry is a little shaky right now regarding bootcampers, and because I fear not having a degree would cap my career at some point, and not enable me to expand and mature my interests in CS (not sure if i want to be doing web development forever!)

- Employers can't use the lack of degree to pay me less for the same work

- I want to get the CS foundation not offered at a bootcamp

- I may want to pursue a master's afterwards

- I want to be an overall better prepared developer

-----
Currently, I feel like I'm at a fork in the road. My options are:

- Keep working for a couple of years, and save up to go back to school for CS. Con -- graduate a little later in life, and possibly lose opportunities to younger competition, lose time i could be working and getting some experience, gain debt. 

- Go back to school next year for foundational knowledge and get the degree sooner, and give up the opportunity to learn more at my current internship. Con -- back in debt, back to school for a few years and not making money/strides in my career, losing the chance to dive deeper at my current job. (it's a startup so lots to do and lots to learn)

- keep working and not go back to school at all, not get any debt but risk losing potentially higher positions later, always feeling like i have gaps in my knowledge, always the question of why I didn't go for it

- go for a master's degree in CS. con -- feel like i'm missing out on the foundation, and some things (maybe alot of things) might go over my head


Does age really matter in the industry when trying to get a good job? Is it vital that I get the degree as fast as possible? I've been researching this for a while and the answers range all over the spectrum, now i'm hoping to ask you guys and girls with experience directly. Please help!

Thanks in advanced! :)

7eh4er,3,2017-11-21,[UK] BSc with prospect worries,CompSciUGThrowaway,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/7eh4er/uk_bsc_with_prospect_worries/,"Hey guys, I'm current doing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Hull (UK) and am in my first year. I'd initially applied to Liverpool, Manchester and Lancaster as I studied Maths, Physics and History at A-Level but missed out on my grades and got a place at the Hull instead.

I was excited to study at Hull, but am now a bit concerned by the course only covering C# as a language (with a potential for Java for Android dev only as a 2nd year module - whereas other Universities studied C++ and Java in year 1, or Prolog if you take the AI module), this worries me as I'm concerned it's a bit outdated, and as I've looked for internships (around Manchester/Liverpool as it's closer to home) all have Java, NodeJS or C++ as prerequisities and none of these I am going to be taught.

In terms of my first semester I'm studying Computer Systems (fundamentals of computing, adders, PC/Mac/PS3 architecture), Quantitive Methods for Computing (maths essentially; A-Level recap, vectors, matrices, set theory) and Programming 1 (basics for C# like and how to use Visual Studio).
The course is solely Windows based, with no Mac/Linux presence at all (different to other Uni's where Linux was dual-booted or at least encouraged outside of classes).

I'm a bit worried that not learning the modern languages within the course will affect my ability to get internships in industry in the summers. I intend to go on to do a masters at a Russell Group University after my undergrad degree. 

Will my chances of getting a placement and jobs in the future be severely influenced by this or will I be alright to continue my degree, or should I seriously consider a transfer to another University (is this possible within computer science), if they'll accept me at the end of first year with my exam scores?

Thank you."
7ehec0,376,2017-11-21,3 years ago we started a digital agency and you roasted us. It inspired us to work even harder. Case study inside.,DonDrapeur,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7ehec0/3_years_ago_we_started_a_digital_agency_and_you/,"**Oliver from Kreatix here.** 

Back when we started our little agency in Belgium, we posted various case studies on Reddit. You guys were harsh. We received a lot of feedback, some were nicer than others. But we appreciated it. You can't learn if everybody tells you you're doing a great job. 

We've been receiving mails and DM's on a monthly basis of people saying our post inspired them to start their own agency. https://imgur.com/a/C0Nl3


**It's high time we did a follow up.** 

Business has been going great for us. Through trial and error we have determined what to do - or rather not to do. Now, we work with over 150 companies, and occasionally reel in larger clients. 

We moved into our own office in 2016. After working for 1,5 years in the cloud - in our garden or in the kitchen - it was time to step our game. We lease a small space in a corporate building for around €1000/each month. It's expensive, but it offers a central reception, utilities and free parking lots. https://imgur.com/a/vHowm

This affected our business considerably. Our clients began taking us more seriously and our productivity spiked.

It's still only William and me (Oliver), but we rotate interns. They're highly motivated and they love working here - or at least, that’s what they tell me - as they’re offered a chance to see different side of the business. We include them in every process and value them for their advice and opinion. They join our meetings, they receive client feedback and they are responsible for their own little projects. Interns are an amazing addition to our workflow. It's a win-win. If the project demands some custom work that’s out of our reach, we hire a freelancer. Way better for overhead. https://imgur.com/a/H7qpj


**We've expanded our services.** We're still doing websites and webshops with Wordpress/WooCommerce and themes. We mostly use them as frameworks now. We're also offering a full scala of digital marketing, PPC, email and more. About 10% of our time goes into graphic design. Lately we've picked up something new and that's LinkedIn consulting. It's probably the best converting social media there is for B2B. I've gone viral a bunch of times just by telling a story. About 80% of our meetings in the next few weeks are thanks to LinkedIn. It's been madness. I get about 900.000 - 1.000.000 reach every month. Some of my posts had 4000 likes. And I only post in Dutch, it's hard mode. 

Local CEOs and marketing managers are picking up on this trend and we're consulting them on how to perform on LinkedIn. It's been amazing. We love building products like websites and webshops, but the satisfaction from seeing your clients go viral is awesome. https://imgur.com/a/uwha6


**How are we making this work?** We're honest. We welcome clients who are dissatisfied with old school agencies. They hate the secretive attitude. Invoices with no clear explanation. They call them for support and they immediately receive a bill afterwards. Deviations from project fees, no clear timeline for when the project will be delivered. We're trying to be as transparent as possible and it's working. We explain why we charge this or that amount, we offer coming over personally and fixing an issue. We give a timeline estimate. We're not saying we're better than other agencies. They have way more experience than us. We just believe we can make a difference in service, and the market seems to agree. 


**How do you start an agency?** Pretty simple. You get your hands dirty by either doing free work (don’t hate on this, if you’re starting out and your portfolio is empty, this is the way to go) or, if you want to offer multiple services, find people who want to join your team and maybe work commission-based. Make sure you nail your marketing. Be honest, underpromise and overdeliver. Follow up, call your client when it’s their birthday. You have to be their partner. Make sure you don’t fake this. You HAVE to be their partner, you can’t fake being their partner. You need to make sure you treat their business like it’s yours. Go the extra mile. You don’t even have to start an agency. You could do this on your own, then expand later on. I’d rather see you do something, than being stuck in the ‘wantrepreneur-lifestyle’. 

I’m often asked for public speaking gigs. I love going to schools and inspiring the people in the room. Entrepreneurship is harsh, but fun. I want to show them that. 

I also started a local club called ‘Jong Ondernemerschap’. That’s ‘Young Entrepreneurship’ in English. Our Facebook-group has more than 600 members and we have already held a meetup where people could pitch their project. https://imgur.com/a/HJukL


**We started our adventure as total noobs**, acting way more experienced and successful than we actually were. We’re happy we did that. It allowed us to get so much feedback and make so many mistakes in order to prevent them in the future. 

We’re glad you guys roasted us pretty thoroughly. We learned a lot. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I’ll disclose as much as possible. 

There’s no ask, there’s no link. Our site is in Dutch anyway. I just wanted to share a follow up to our story, because it was total crap, and even then it inspired a lot of people. 


**Thanks for giving us this opportunity.** If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email: oliver@kreatix.be

7ehjn8,1,2017-11-21,Help convince me I don't need to be perfect to find success.,missedtheboataway,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7ehjn8/help_convince_me_i_dont_need_to_be_perfect_to/,"Sorry in advance for the long post. If you don't feel like reading it all skip to tl;dr at the bottom.

I am currently a senior at George Washington University majoring in International Affairs. It's an undergrad program in the top 10 in the world, and I am on pace to graduate with a GPA somewhere in the 3.75-3.8 range. 

The problem is that's not good enough. I have no chance of getting a job here in DC after I graduate unless I make it through some highly selective alternative to traditional employment, such as getting a Boren scholarship or volunteering in the Peace Corps. I don't believe I'm a competitive applicant for those programs for the same reason I'm not competitive for jobs: I lack work experience. I've interned the past two summers and did a work study one semester, along with working a non-intellectual summer job for a few years. This pales in comparison to other students at my school, even those who aren't the most ambitious, and in international affairs work experience is everything.

Unfortunately, I simply am not capable of interning during the semester and doing well at my schoolwork. I know now the reason I haven't been able to keep up throughout the years was undiagnosed ADHD. I also know that once I was diagnosed and put on medication this semester, no one prepared me for a side effect of spending way, way more time writing papers (think 10 hours a page even with an outline) - apparently this can happen if you're already detail-oriented and prone to perfectionism.

Intellectually, I know I shouldn't blame myself for not being able to maintain a busy schedule when I have a disability that directly affects time management. 

Intellectually, I know my self-worth shouldn't be based on grades. It shouldn't affect me to know people who graduated with 3.8s while working and interning, but it does. It makes me feel absolutely worthless. I've never seen myself as a genius but I figured I was smart enough that if I struggled in a subject I'm good at, most people who are not geniuses would also struggle. Clearly this isn't the case if people can get GPAs equivalent to mine or better while doing 100 other activities. Being hard-working and intelligent are right below being a good person in terms of my identity and self-worth, and I'm being so outplayed by such a large group of people that it doesn't feel accurate to call myself either of those things any more. This problem relates to being a good person too. I didn't come into this field looking to be the Secretary of State or make a ton of money. I just wanted to study conflict and development and hopefully use that knowledge to make the world a slightly better place. Unfortunately tons of other students want that too, and thousands of them are better than me in every way an employer can measure. I've lost (or more accurately, am being crushed by the knowledge I never had) the chance to make even a small difference in the world in a field I'm passionate about, and I can't even be mad or jealous because plenty of my fellow students are perfectly nice and compassionate. I don't believe life overall is a zero-sum game, but at this stage of my life getting an entry-level job is. I don't have the goods, other people do, so I've lost.

Intellectually, I know people don't need a 3.8 GPA to stand a chance of getting anywhere after graduation. But I feel I, personally, have absolutely no room for error. One bad sentence in one paper bumps me from an A to an A- in one class? There goes summa cum laude, which would prove I'm an exceptional student to grad schools thinking about whether to take me a few years from now (even the grad schools want a couple years of relevant work experience) or employers thinking about whether to give me a shot at an interview despite my lack of experience. My GPA is literally all I have to make me competitive, and even a 3.8 (not my current GPA and very unlikely to happen at this point) wouldn't put me over the people who have a 3.8+ and better work experience. Anything under 3.8? Even worse. 

At this point I think my only option (barring Peace Corps etc) will be to move outside of DC and take a job in something unrelated to my field. It kills me to think about because I feel not only is that tantamount to failure, I'm never going to be able to make up the difference between me and the people above me. The fact that my fate could have been sealed in some way for getting a B in a class I took at 18 or for not pushing myself through an internship even if it meant sacrificing everything else (health, any social life at all, etc) kills me too. Now all I can do to try to make up for it is be as perfect as possible...which is incredibly, incredibly difficult at this stage in the game and is eating me alive.

**tl;dr: My above-average GPA is not exceptional enough to get me anywhere, and I don't have the work/internship experience necessary to succeed in a field where unpaid internships for people with Master's degrees are a dime a dozen. Please help me understand how to cope with the enormous pressure I feel to do well at academics - the one thing I know how to do - and help me see my life won't be over when I can't get a job after graduation.**

[P.S. To anyone else reading this who may be considering this path: This is what it's like. I wished I had known before I got into it, even though there is nothing else I'd rather study.]"
7ehpqg,3,2017-11-21,New grad salary after stock/bonuses/etc?,bornagainprophet,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/7ehpqg/new_grad_salary_after_stockbonusesetc/,"Before you say ""check Glassdoor"", Glassdoor doesn't take into account any bonuses - it only lists the base salaries.

For example, Google does about 120k/year for new grads but provides 240k in stocks etc over a period of 4 years. 

Facebook also reaches around 170k yearly compensation after stocks etc (and signing bonuses of 60k-120k (up to 120k for returning interns) on top of that).

This is all in SF (high COL). Clearly higher than Glassdoor - because Glassdoor only takes into account *base* salaries (for most of the listings).

Now I know I can't expect IBM to compete with the likes of Google and FB. But **after bonuses**, what can I expect, or what should I negotiate towards?"
7ei7br,2,2017-11-21,Time to move on or time to get down to business?,Versace_Shades,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ei7br/time_to_move_on_or_time_to_get_down_to_business/,"Hi all,  

I graduated with a BS in Finance in 2015 and have been working in the industry since. I started as an intern for a local branch in which I worked full time for two summers while I was home. After graduation, I was hired as an ‘analyst’ by the company for $30,000, in which I was simply running performance reports and managing Excel spreadsheets.  

The company went through a rough patch from early 2015-2016, and I was essentially thrown into a trader position. I now head the trading department (I am the trading department) in which I am responsible for the rebalancing and trading of about $50M in AUM, and there’s opportunity for big growth so it might not be long before I’m responsible for well over $100M and have to hire someone to help me. I am still considered the ‘analyst’ too, so I work about 2-3 different roles at this company now.  

I’ve been extremely loyal to this company, and my boss has been loyal to me. I’ve made mistakes, but found them and corrected them. I’ve taken on new responsibilities, I work hard, I’ve created protocols and procedures, I’ve managed client gatherings and firm parties, I wear multiple hats, I don’t gossip, I help my boss outside of work with various projects, etc. It’s a small company. Tight knit, relatively drama free, and we stay very busy. I work 8-5 M-F, so it offers a work-life balance unlike a lot of my peers have. Best of all, I work literally 5 minutes from home. I can go home for lunch every single day.  

All that said, it wasn’t until a month ago that I was offered my first raise - 20%. Now, this would be nice if I got this kind of raise every year, but it’s my first raise in two and a half years, so less than 10% per year. I know I can be making more money, and I’m coming up on my 25th birthday so I know I have to be making more money. However I would potentially have to give up a pretty lax lifestyle as well. I would potentially have to give up a non-hostile work environment to make more money. I would potentially have to move to another city/state (I’m in upstate NY) to make more money. I’m ok with all of this, but I’m looking for insight as to whether it’s worth it. Or whether I should stick it out where I’m at, hoping for a solid financial future for the company which should in turn result in a better financial future for me. Or should I do what’s uncomfortable and leave my job that needs me, for a job that probably doesn’t, simply for more pay? I would leave this company without a trader, putting them in the position to have to hire a new trader that would not only have to be trained on the platforms, but learn how I’ve set up the platforms to begin with (essentially putting the ‘trading department’ on hold). I feel like I’d be burning bridges by leaving, but at the same time we need to do what’s best for ourselves as human beings, so I might be ready to take that next step too. I partially blame myself for the position I’m in as I have not done a good enough job negotiating my compensation. I’ve gotten comfortable, as my dad likes to say. Add that to a year long financial rough patch at the company and I’m not putting the blame on anyone except myself. We’re finally seeing greener pastures here and maybe getting a raise was a sign of that, but at the same time I don’t know when the next one will be.

7ej0bv,1,2017-11-21,"I am in my early 30s, and im afraid of doing anything outside of comfort zone, a job opportunity is presenting itself, and I am terrified of it.",Itseffingcold,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ej0bv/i_am_in_my_early_30s_and_im_afraid_of_doing/,"Simply put, I am terrified of any opportunities or changes that get made to my life. 

I am stuck in stagnation, and I find myself only mildly happy with my life and how things have turned out for me. Simply put; I find myself always ""okay"" with how things turn out for me.

What is prompting this; well, I have landed an internship with my own company, I actually have done this once before and was less stressed out about it a few years ago, because I didn't anticipate any expectation of commitment, it simply became an opportunity to work somewhere else and do something different for a short duration of time. By the time it was over I was excited to be coming home and going back to my old life. 

Apparently this experience, my work ethic and attention to detail was very noticed, and about a year later a new program emerged, and by the encouragement of my management team I applied again, just for fun.

The program I applied for I got passed on, simply because they were looking for someone different during the next round (seemed silly to bring the same guy back for the same thing). I was stressed by the whole interview process, but relieved after it was over thinking ""welp, I tried."" 

Fast forward a few weeks, and another department seemed to find my resume and was intrigued by it, I received a surprise email and was asked for a short interview. I figured ""why not? I get to learn something new, which is something I always enjoy."" During the interview our conversation felt natural and actually quite casual, they asked some questions about my resume and previous experience during another internship, the whole thing lasted a little under 30 minutes, and I walked away thinking nothing of it. 

A few days go by, my management team sits me down and tells me that I was selected, and I was met with immediate mixed emotions that I am having a severely difficult time decoding. Anxiety levels skyrocketed, but I kept reminding myself ""great opportunity, good resume builder, juice is worth the squeeze, etc..."" My supervisor then informed me that this program is heavily looking for people who want permanent employment, and they are wondering if that is what I am seeking, the catch is; its on the other side of the country. It would mean I would have to sell my home, move my girlfriend (whom is on board with this) and dog to the other side of the country. 

Not only is it a gigantic hill to climb, but I find myself being afraid of leaving what I am already comfortable with, I have a home I like, I have cars I enjoy (and tinker with) and a style of life/finance that I know I can afford, plus all of my friendships and family members live relatively close by. 

So, the fear came back up, I loved the idea of it being a no commitment, half of a year opportunity to learn, and if I felt comfortable or happy with the job/living situation, I could make the decision, pursue a permanent position, and if they liked me, than it would simply happen.

Simply put; I make one argument for comfort, I know my job like the back of my hand, im good at it but im in a dead end position with no real opportunity for growth or movement where I currently live, and I know I am worth more than I currently make (not that I am struggling financially, I get by find and can afford *some* luxuries) 

On the other side of the fence; opportunity always is met with some kind of risk, and I can't ever gain anything without risking something. I struggle with the idea of living on my own for half of a year, away from loved ones and I am afraid that I simply wont be able to do the work that is expected of me once I start this internship. 

Am I thinking too far ahead? Should I not be worrying about what hasn't happened yet? Is it unreasonable for me to be thinking so far into the future when I haven't even started the job? Would it be bullish of me to start the internship knowing full well that I have no intention of taking permanent employment? (as it seems like there is some expectation of interest). To top it all off, I still have thanksgiving and Christmas to be worried about before any of this happens, so I am starting to feel very overwhelmed. Maybe being overwhelmed is simply clouding my best judgement and putting my mind into a survival mode? It seems like all of my other emotions are clouding something I should be excited about.

Sorry for the long winded posting, there has been a ton on my mind, and I just cant seem to find inner peace because of all of it, its starting to feel like I spend my days simply just trying to get through it. "

Secondly, with regards to negotiation -- the BB offer is slightly higher (&lt;5k) in terms of 1st year compensation, but that difference grows to ~15k when ignoring signing bonus, not to mention the difference in time value of money as the start up offer has significant equity portion which doesn't begin to vest for a year.

For a little more context, I served as a data engineering Intern at a big company in Cupertino. I had to leave about 3 weeks early due to a death in the family, but overall really enjoyed my team and had an awesome time while there, and I think my team really enjoyed me as well.

I got back in contact with the recruiter after my internship at my school's career fair and talked to her about wanting to come back. She said that the company would love to have me back, so I emailed her. She asked me if I was planning on going to get my Master's degree, to which I told her no, and there has been no contact since then.

I've since received offers from other companies, but am generally unhappy about the vision of the companies as well as their compensation.

However, it's too late for me to 1. get a double major or 2. switch my majors (again). I'm going to ask for a 9th semester so that I can take some more computer science classes and get internships. However, after that, I'm not sure what to do. My university offers a 5th year Masters in Biotechnology, which is really enticing! I would get an Ivy League Masters in Biotech in 1 year, and if I wanted to, an extra semester for co-op. It's easier for students who are at the university to get in the Masters program than for non students applying. It also allows me to take classes that are interesting, like stem cell engineering. It sounds like a sweet deal. However, I'm unsure about job prospects and getting paid well. On the other hand, if I don't go to the 5th year Masters program, I could find a job related to tech and then get in to a Masters program in Computer science. However, I have already signed a lease to stay at my university's city for another year, because I had assumed I was going to stick with the biotechnology choice. Now, I am unsure what I should do.

But well, I don't think any company would hire a sophomore intern who failed calculus two times, so I took those internships out of my list of possibilities at least for 2018. My main question is: if I failed calculus this semester and got an A on it next semester, would companies still look with some resentment to me?

2. I've been told that this position won't actually start until February. Hypothetically, if they were to make me an offer and I accepted, would I still be allowed to keep job hunting in the meantime? (I've never been employed, so I'm not really sure how these things work.)

I have no one to talk to, I'm failing a math class, and there's no way in hell I'll be able to get into STEM, this is the second fucking math class failed. How did I go from being the smartest person in AP calc, to failing college algebra and calc 1?!?

About my friends : when I mentioned to them I don't like how they're treating me they said ""shut up and stop playing the victim card"" ""you're overreacting"" ""we just hung out with you, why would we hate you?"" 
Keep in mind the ONLY thing I asked for was to be added back to a groupchat and they refused to saying ""you did this to yourself, you deserve it"". As a joke my friends and I would kick each other out of GCs when we said something stupid but we'd be added right back, I was kicked out for a month before being added back by asking and then my friend thought it would be funny to kick me out again. Then I messaged one of them saying ""haha who kicked me out?"" and they said who and added me back, but guess what? I got kicked out again. So I left all the group chats I had with them because I was pissed. Probably bad on my part but this was after being kicked out 3/4 times so I just said ""fuck it/them""



Then my friend told my roommate ""X never falls in the groupchat"" so I messaged one of my friends saying this and they said ""lol we don't even use that groupchat""
Okay BS. When I asked to be added back he told me ""just make a new one"" ???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!???!? You obviously use the groupchat. When my friend told my roommate I don't talk in it and another friend said ""oh we don't even talk about you in the groupchat"" when I said how I don't like 3 people in our friend circle because they seem fake. Maybe I want to be a victim so bad but it seems fishy to just bring that up when I didn't say ""I think they talk about me behind my back"" I just said they seem fake...

So then I was randomly added to a different one and again asked ""hey, can you add me back?"" and they said ""no, be happy you're in this one"" and I said ""but why not? I feel like you guys don't like me, is it that hard to add me back?"" and then they told me I'm playing the victim. 


Lmao also keep in mind these are the same people who always make jokes about ""let's just leave her home"" while I'm in the car with them, or saying ""I wish you didn't come"" or calling me names (ho, slut, thot, comparing me to ugly celebrities, ect) and if I ever say I don't like it they tell me I'm overreacting and I should ""be happy we at least did x with you"""

Okay, so currently I'm doing an internship at a maritime engineering company and my assignment is to make a model to calculate the maximum loads at every single point for the pontoons they use.


Here's the problem, to calculate the maximum load on the colums in the ship I'm calculating Euler's buckling stress by using:

Fa=(𝜋^2∗𝐸 )/〖𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥〗^2 


with Smax being the maximum slenderness regarding the moment of inertia over both axis.


Yet this isn't the formule used by the example excel spreadsheet I got handed. 

The one that is used there is either this: 

𝐹𝑎=([1−(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅^2 )/(2∗〖𝐶𝑐〗^2 )]∗𝑌)/(3/5+(3(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅))/(8∗𝐶𝑐)−(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅)^3/(8∗𝐶𝑐^3 ))


for Slenderness &lt; Cc


or this: 

𝐹𝑎=(12𝜋^2∗𝐸)/(23(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅)^2 )


for Slenderness &gt; Cc


Since I'm in my final year of a bachelor in mechanical engineering and this is part of a Masters course this is over my head . I did some digging and I get how slenderness works and how it relates to the colum constant but my question is, what is the theory behind these 2 equations and why should I use them over the standard Euler Buckling Equation?


I sincerely hope someone has the answer for me!

(edit, I tagged this post a Civil Engineering problem since I presume that's what fits best for structural problems)

It is a big company and I thought that it would be the best that I could do. However, that same night, I got contacted by company B for an interview. I was very surprised by this as I never would have thought of being offered an interview there. Company B would be a dream come true for many people, including myself, so of course I accepted the interview. Two days later, I got contacted by company C, which is at the very top. I couldn't believe it! Of course, I told the recruiter that I wanted to begin the process as well.

The only reason I haven't gotten a written letter from company A yet is some work authorization stuff that they are going over. They are not sponsoring me or anything, but they are still putting some additional effort into me by working with their immigration department. They are sort of just looking into what it would involve and will send me an offer letter once that's sorted out. According to them, it is not something that I should worry about. Also, they have expressed how they are really looking to have me there next summer.

If I happen to bomb the interviews for B and C, then it's no problem, as I am sure that I will be happy at company A. But if I get an offer with either of them, I will be in a very difficult situation. Interning at either B or C would open an immense amount of doors and make my dreams come true. However, I do not want to be unprofessional by rejecting A after all the effort that they have put into me.

I asked one of my professors if it was okay for me to do this, as I am still going through the background check of company A and have not been given a written offer yet. He said to stick to A but still interview with B and C to at least get the interviewing experience and get my resume in their records for the future. Is this good advice? Or should I accept either B or C if given an offer? How would I break the news to A then? Also, if I am still interviewing with B or C by the time that A gives me a written offer, what should I tell them?

So before I start, I would like to give some background information about me. I'm currently 24 years old this year, and I'm studying a private degree in Information System &amp; Computing in the first year. I come from Singapore, so we basically have to serve mandatory National Service for 2 years.

So after National Service, I worked for 2 years as a Software Engineer at multiple startups until this September where I quit to start studying for a degree. The thing is that, I never really cared for a degree. The only reason I wanted it is that it served as a back up plan for any mishaps, and it opens a ton of doors such as moving out of the country, or even as a sense of recognition of discipline (That's what I think?)

So, I have always wanted to be a 'Startup' guy, hence the reason why I have only been working in Startups. I would love to work in Google or Facebook though, but that's a dream. (I'm applying for a Data Engineer internship in Facebook!) 

So anyway, 2 weeks after I start school on September, I got a recommendation for a Frontend Developer job at a Startup. Well, at this time, I pretty much blew all my savings on the hefty school fees, and a new maxed-out Macbook Pro. (Note that I'm not a big spender, but I respect Technology and I believe that a Chef should always buy the sharpest knife. You get what I mean?). So, I went for the interview without expectation, as who would want to hire a full-time student anyway? But apparently, the CEO and the development teams seems to like me. They offered me a slightly better pay than my previous job (I can't complain here as I'm studying full-time).  

I took the job totally believing I can handle both the full-time job and study. It has been almost two months now, and I believe I have been managing it decently, but not perfectly. But the problem with me is that I'm an unrealistic optimistic person. 

As I took up the full-time job, I joined the DragonBoat Club as well. Boy, they have a really tough commitment schedule, literally Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Some weeks even 5-6 days, one training session can take up till 3-5 hours.

I have recently dropped the Club because I just wanted to give it a try, and it was taking a toll on me. So now, I have always wanted to build my own Startup since I was a teenager. For the past few weeks, I have been spending some time (even neglecting some school work or work), to work on my own Startup idea. Since I'm only one man, I'm doing everything, from the research, to the design, to the development. 

I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and run my own business, (and move to New York :D). I would like to drop my full-time job, and focus on School and my Startup idea instead. The risk is that I will lose my income, and I don't really have much in the bank left anymore. My family members are very independent so we don't really ask for financial help from each other, nor have I took any parents from my parents since I can last remember.

Do you guys think that I should quit? I'm really hesitating due to my financial state, and I have to get ready another 10-12k by next September for year 2's school fees.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I signed on with the company I interned with because it was the best financial decision for me given other local offers, but I've since realized that

* I don't want to live in milwaukee, or the midwest. I'd really like to live as close as possible to the pacific north west, or the rockies. Denver / Seattle etc..
* I want to at least try out other popular tech in a professional environment. I have plenty of project experience with Rails, Java, Python (data science and django) and unix, but no verifiable professional experience.
learning and using other technologies is important to being a well rounded engineer and truly being able to discern the right solution for any given problem.
* money maximization is not a justifiable reason to sacrifice having new experiences.
* I'd really like to end up working at a non-profit or something at least environmentally focused.

The problem I'm facing is that it seems like most open job positions listed on indeed, or even peeking through the monthly hacker news ""who's hiring"" posts ask for at least a few years with tech I have no professional background in but would love to (Java, Python, PHP, Rails). How do I even get through the mass resume scan process if my background in rails is a year long school project and a github project I slapped together in an afternoon?
Should I try to start smaller first by finding something closer to me to build resume years of experience numbers, or would it be better to get into a different location with a .NET job until I can network and find something closer to what I'm looking for?

My biggest fear is getting pigeonholed to the point where I can't achieve one or any of my bullet-ed goals or experiences I'd like to have above.

I'm in my 4th year of engineering about to finish my 4B this Winter, but I've been having second thoughts. I've never really enjoyed engineering but stuck through it because it looked stable to me, hoping I'd eventually find a job or industry that I liked. Now that it's coming to an end, I'm still unhappy with engineering and I've started to worry. I've been looking into a different area of study over the past several months and became really interested, so I'd like to take a break and delay my 4B by doing a non-degree term to try different courses while I attempt to apply for student internships. My main concern was being ineligible for student internships after I finish my 4B, which is why I'm making the choice to delay my graduation.

I'd still like to finish my engineering degree however since I'm only 4 months away from it. Also, my 4th year design proj is still in progress so I'd like to finish it this Winter instead of next year by myself or with new people.


My question is for anyone that has done non-degree terms before or know people that have done them. I understand non-degree terms are usually for people that failed a term or people that want to transfer to a different dept. Is it possible to do them when you don't have much of an intent to transfer? Also, can I continue my 4th yr design proj while doing a non-degree term?


Academic advisors would obviously know best and I have already emailed a few, but I'm still waiting for a reply, and I would like to hear about anyone's experience with this while I patiently roll in anxiety.

7esmmj,1,2017-11-22,Thoughts on difficult decision,nasacsthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7esmmj/thoughts_on_difficult_decision/,"Hey all,

I'm currently a junior and go to a mid-tier state school and have recently been offered a pathways internship position with NASA.

I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with this program but completion of it (~640 hours of work) guarantees you a full-time position with NASA after you graduate.

The issue is that they're wanting me to start in January, and in order to meet the pathways requirements I would have to take that semester off to work, go back to school the next semester, and so on and so forth until I graduate. Doing so would push my graduation date back by at least another year.

In addition to that, I interned at a fairly large company in the Bay Area last summer and they have since given me a return offer to go back (pays ~15 dollars more hourly than NASA). 

I'm also currently working as an intern with a large defense contractor, while taking classes, and will be finishing up with them in May before I would start at the Bay area internship. 

If I were to take this pathways position I would have to burn a bridge with the defense contractor (promised two semesters of work), which I feel like would be a very bad idea. Also, the Bay area company wants a response back in ten days (just received both offers yesterday).

It's always been my dream to work in space systems and it's weird because despite always dreaming of an opportunity like this, now that it's here I'm feeling like this isn't the right move for me at this time. My parents are also against me deviating from my graduation track and it just feels like there's more incentive to decline rather than accept.

I realize how incredibly competitive these positions are and I'm just worried that I'll be missing my only opportunity to work with NASA if I decline this.

But on the other hand, I feel like if I accept this position then I'm really putting all of my eggs into one basket and am sacrificing a lot for the opportunity.

Ultimately, I'll be making the final decision about this but I really just wanted to receive some input from you guys.

Thanks in advance."

I go to a top 10 university with a top 25 CS department. I'm in my junior year as an undergrad CS major/Finance minor. I've been undergoing the recruiting process and have been apply/searching for internships since August. I've been fortunate enough to get responses to my applications and have completed several hackerranks and interviews (on-campus recruiting has helped immensely). 

I've been  granted interviews with a few big name companies, but I keep getting rejections in the end. Some of them were even expedited to final round because of OCR and I still haven’t been closing the deal. I'm not completely sure why because I can explain my resume/projects well and complete technical questions easily while explaining my thought process. A company even put me in limbo until they know how many people accept their first round of offers (essentially I'm the second choice/backup option).

Approximately 2.5 months after interviewing on campus, I have finally received a single offer from a Fortune 15 company (2 letter name) for their technology leadership internship program. The offer is for a division I’m not super interested in but the company probably has a lot of things going on, so I would hopefully find a few teams doing something I like (though from what I’ve read on this sub, there might be a possibility I might not be doing dev work). The offer is fairly average ($30/hr, 1.5x for OT, $150/week housing stipend), but in a less than ideal location in the Midwest (WI). At least the COL is low, so I would be likely be living pretty comfortably though the housing stipend isn’t great. The offer was given a deadline of 2 weeks and requires a minimum GPA of 3.00 + passing a drug test (30 days before internship = sober spring semester).  I’m pretty close to the GPA cutoff tbh and I’m have to get through this semester without dipping below.  If I were to get an offer for full time, it would likely be for a rotational program the company offers, which is something I am not entirely interested in because I might not be doing Software Engineering. I would likely be hunting for full-time roles next year targeting mid-size/growing startups in the bay area.

I’m very conflicted in taking this offer. I’m currently in the early stages of the interview process with the premier internship program at a three letter, older tech company and the rainforest company. The three letter company said it takes 6-8 weeks from first phone interview (scheduled for after thanksgiving) and the first rainforest OA was just recently sent to me (I’m guessing &gt;2 weeks from OA to offer).

It feels like I’m in a bird in the hand situation. I feel very conflicted between accepting the only offer I have after a few months or continuing to interview at more companies (the two above + startups in the Spring). I really want to be in a major city on either coast after graduation. Having this company on my resume would likely be a good move in terms of career development (Strong name recognition, probably means more than a no-name startup), so should I just suck it up for a summer and take it or should I pursue other opportunities? It’s kind of demoralizing when my classmates/friends are finishing up recruiting and getting offers from the Big 4 + some companies I interviewed with on-campus for Bay Area/Seattle/DC/NYC, but I'm fortunate enough to have something I guess. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone!"

* Co-president/competition lead of school's Junior World Affairs Council - sort of a social studies program that culminates in a national trivia competition.

* Presentation lead at school's robotics team. As the team advanced to state competitions, I would create websites and PowerPoints and coach a dedicated group of presenters. The judges, even at state, would often describe the sites as some of the best they had ever seen.

* Dedicated musician with an [acoustic solo project](http://nazaruk.bandcamp.com) and a [garage rock band.](http://instagram.com/theboojisband) I play guitar, bass, and piano, and I sing/write most of the lyrics for the band as well. I have become acquainted with several musicians, promoters, and producers in the Dallas scene, and my band is set to record and release a full-length LP next year.

* Summer internship with Ambit Energy. I applied to a rigorous internship program offered by the City of Dallas and had to go through several interviews and offers before eventually picking an IT position there. I self-taught myself SQL, a language I had no prior experience in, in a week and even earned a novice certification in it. From June to August this year, I used it to help an experienced DBA team migrate data to updated servers.

* Work at my parents' small lighting/retailing business. My work is unpaid, but I have gained enough experience from performing financial tasks for my mother (who was once an auditor at Ernst &amp; Young) to develop a relatively solid base in finance and microeconomics.

* Editor and regular contributor at school's newspaper.

* Regular volunteer at various cultural initiatives/establishments in my city, from art museums to independent K-12 teaching programs. I'm also active with the entrepreneurial culture of Dallas, having participated in several business meetups and ""hackathons"" in the city.

* Quite active with sports: been into boxing and muay thai since the age of 9, as well as dirt-biking since 8 or so. I also took up weightlifting just recently and hope to pursue it in college in addition to tennis.

**Essays:**

* Common App: 9/10. I wrote this essay about a relative who was poisoned by the Russian Mafia after attempting to start a fair banking system in Armenia, yet somehow survived with substantial damage to his condition. I talked about how realizing his condition made me understand that justice does not come as a definite equal but rather varies by individual. In retrospect, it's a very well written, intelligent essay, but I could have made it flow just a tad more.

* Supplement 1: 10/10. My personal favorite, this one had a powerful hook and a snarky yet clever discussion of the ""contradictions"" that make up my life. I submitted it to several of my top choices.

* Supplement 2: 8/10. Just a recount of the funny story of how my band came to be. I submitted this one as part of several ""activity""-related prompts.

**Recommendations:**

* 10/10 English teacher

* 8-9/10 Pre-AP/AP computer science teacher

* 10/10 Boss at summer internship

* 8-9/10 Counselor

**Extra info:**

I am particularly looking at schools in the Boston area and in the West Coast, for I feel that those two regions are the best for entrepreneurship and development in the country. I've moved around my whole life, so I wouldn't be too comfortable staying in Texas; even after college and grad school, I'd like to move somewhere totally different for a fresh start. Essentially, I'm looking for the university that would give me the freedom to experiment with a wealth of resources (most typically in the form of a powerful liberal arts education) and thus develop the ""world entrepreneur"" in me."

Google EngRes seems like it would be a better long-term investment. It seems like it would be easier to change companies with the Google name.

Compensation-wise, Bloomberg pays substantially more, and it's all in cash (no stock / golden handcuffs, which I like). Google Engineering Residency is practically the same as intern pay. Google EngRes has a near 100% full-time conversion rate after 1 year. I have a feeling my compensation is going to be lower than the average new grad after conversion though, since I'll have no leverage whatsoever.

Google seems to be the better company overall in terms of engineering quality and work-life balance, but I can't help shake the feeling that I'd be undervalued at Google, but maybe I'm just being silly. I applied for the EngRes program directly, but in retrospect wish I had applied for regular new grad since I think I would have had a good shot at it.

I hear bad stories with legacy code in Bloomberg, but I think I could manage to land a team that uses modern tech. Most teams I've talked to sound like they're on the cutting edge. I think the work generally sounds super interesting, being at the intersection of tech/finance/law.

Both locations would be in NYC.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

- was abused by my mom who had a form of narcissism where she would pretend her kids were disabled or abusive to get attention for herself
- was also bullied
- was rescued by CPS and lived with my dad and my brother who fought with each other. My dad was verbally and emotionally abusive. My brother was too, sometimes physical.
- my brother moved out. Now my one sister has ocd and can't be near anything that triggers her, which includes her family.
- my other sister is showing traits of narcissism and everyone can see it and she takes it out on me
- I have depression, OCD, anxiety, and along with my OCD I'm very paranoid, and very introverted 
- I have no financial support other than my dad so I don't know how I'll move away
- sister who is narcissistic bought house that I was abused in. Put all of my stuff into storage. Lost it all. She doesn't know where any of my art or even legal documents are.
- she invited my dad and I over to decorate her house for thanksgiving. In recent events my sister had ruined them and bullied me along with others. I actually took a multi hour bus ride home just to get away from her abusive behavior. 
- I told my dad I don't want to go. My dad says he doesn't want tot all about thanksgiving anymore and says I have a ""fulfilled prophecy complex"" where I expect things to happen so they do. I just know shit is going to happen because it happens. Every. Fucking. Time. He says he wants the family to get together. She didn't even invite our brother. It's all or nothing for him but it wasn't even all in the first place.
- the holidays make me want to kill myself. I hate Christmas. I hate thanksgiving. Everyone's so happy and blissfully ignorant, and while even though I know others have it worse, I just want to hang myself. I'll get really intense visions of me hanging on a noose, or me bleeding out in a bathtub. It's all I think about. My dad knows I'm depressed. Calls me ""negative"" and ""over dramatic"" and ""hyper sensitive."" I want to die so badly. I want to die. I don't focus ONLY on the negatives, I'm just honest. He just pretends there are no negatives. And he seems to forget I'm depressed, he even pays for me to go to therapy.

Some more problems:
- my uncle recently threw me under the bus when I asked him for help. He told me he'd convince my dad to get me a car so I could escape the house whenever my dad would get a abusive. Accidentally texts me saying that I'm being a brat, saying that my dad is right, and although I'm being annoying I need a car. I told him to fuck off and that I didn't want the car anymore. My uncle got mad and said he did it for me, when I now know he was protecting himself. All he did was enable my dad, and make me look worse. And my dad found out and still thinks genuinely about what my uncle said, who knows, maybe he meant it.

- my friends in college have already moved away, found apartments, found internships, and I know we are only freshmen, but I'm so behind. I'm so behind and no one knows that I cut myself. What and I going to do? Have my dad walk me into the hospital? Call CPS when I'm legally an adult? Move out when I am going to school full time? What am I going to do? What am I going to do?

I'm so fucked. I'm so so fucked. I don't want to die. I'm just extremely fucked right now. I'm so sincerely, genuinely, fucked. I want to tell the world. I want to help others going through this, but as long as I am financially dependent on my dad, I must be silent, and it's killing me."

This is something that really frustrates me because I tech is my passion, and I know there a lot I need to learn from hands on experience.


To put things is prospective let me add some context.

#)I graduated with a 2 year diploma from an institution outside of the United States.
#)I am currently seeking employment in the United States.
#)I have a 3 month internship at new organization working with their in house applications as well as their Android and iOS applications.


My skill set:
#) I can developer asp.net applications
#) I am very proficient in Java (I am currently developing my own android applications).
#) I have studies Systems Analysis
#) I am also good with database design and implementation using SQL (I am good with CoreData but I have not had much experience with it.)


My problem is that I can't even seem to get a low paying job just to get experience under my belt, and internships are mainly for students who are currently enrolled which I am not due to financial reasons. Basically what it comes down to for me is I need a job to get experience, I need the experience to get the job.

7exd16,2,2017-11-23,Dealing with daily life is becoming more difficult and depressing. i need urgent help.,throwawaysuicidaltho,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7exd16/dealing_with_daily_life_is_becoming_more/,"good afternoon everyone, this is my first post here, ever. i am having suicidal thoughts (not to the point of planning to act on them, but to the point they are making my life hopeless and depressing), this is gonna be a slightly long post, but please bare with me, i am in dire need of help.

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me  a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits.
-Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget.
-Body odor which no matter what i do still remains.
-i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this.
-i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting.
-i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes.
-i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with.
-a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

I'm 20 years old, I recently moved after two years of school to another state. I did not enroll for this past semester Fall 2017 since I was getting my stuff together. Now, I'm going back and enrolling for the Spring 2018 semester. This won't affect graduation date since I'm ahead in credits. 

I applied for an internship and it looks like I'm about to get it. I'm in the final stage and the interviewer joked that most interns are coming out of fast food (I have almost three years of IT enterprise experience). 

The problem is I'm not yet enrolled and the internship is supposed to start before I'll be enrolled. What I hate is that the first interviewer stressed a few times that this is for currently enrolled students and I lied saying I was currently enrolled.

How common is it for employer's to ask for enrollment verification for internships? It is a paid. 


Thank you so much. I'm kind of afraid of them finding out but I guess the worst case scenario is they find out and I don't get the position. Not the end of the world.

I wasn't really great at anything and I often would get depressed about not having a real purpose in life. 

I knew I liked business and knew entrepreneurship was the only thing I could ever see myself doing, but just felt like it was something I could never actually do. Sophomore year of college I had the opportunity to take an internship that was very different from the others. It was a painting company that was ran entirely by students while they would be taught on how to run the business through training and a mentor. It sounded like the perfect opportunity for me and I was fascinated by what this internship offered. It was also very intimidating/scary for me because i really had no confidence in myself. 

I talked to people who went through the program before me for a couple hours and got a date for an interview. It came and I was shocked when the vice president of the company hired me on the spot. I was very happy but also confused as to what he had seen in me. I was still nervous as hell too. Training came and they sent us out to a hotel. For 12 hours 3 days in a row we were hammered with information and expectations on how to run our business. It was already exhausting but I had already fallen in love with the high energy positive attitudes these people had right off the bat. The whole atmosphere was like something I had never experienced in a classroom at business school. And then they throw us into the fire pretty literally. I was suddenly in charge of an entire county for this company and I did not know what in the fuck I was doing. They had mentors for all of us rookies that we would call many times.. often 2 to 3 times a day. Anyways they laid out the systems for us on how to generate leads, do estimates, book jobs, hire painters, produce the jobs, etc etc. Every aspect of the business was in our hands. Long story short I finished the summer selling and producing $92,000 worth of jobs completely on my own. Holy shit was this summer by far the craziest and by far best time of my life. By the end of it I had a level of confidence in myself i never thought i was capable of having. I worked non stop especially in may/june where 80 hr weeks would become a normal week. The biggest thing that i noticed though was that during the first few months spent marketing and first month of summer i had put in tons of hours of work without a single pay check.. yet i didn't even care. I literally forgot i even got money from doing this. I became so focused on improving myself in so many ways and trying to learn the business. I loved it. I fell in love with the whole process because every night i went to bed knowing i had improved myself in some way and that i had overcome another challenge. I now understood the high constantly working energy that they had at training. I had acquired it too. I saw that facing your fears every single day to improve yourself was the most motivating thing in the world. There was always a new challenge to overcome. Its all about your mindset.

Now I see clearly how and why very successful people become who they are. Your mindset is by far the most valuable part of anything you become. With the right mindset, you literally can do anything. I made $15,000 over the summer and got a free trip to mexico. I actually was running the top producing painting company in my whole county. School is completely fucked they need to redesign it from the ground up. There are probably so many others that will never see their full potential because of the restricting mindset our schools have created. Anyways I hope this story inspires others. I want to help others out there that were like me so don't hesitate to ask for help."

I was wondering if anyone can lend some advice on my not so ideal situation. I’m graduating in a couple weeks here. 

My girlfriend is applying to med schools right now (all over the country) and the plan is to relocate to wherever (if) she gets accepted to. If she gets accepted then I could start applying in the area, but we’re giving until about February before she moves on to another plan. 

This means I’m very hesitant to apply for on-site jobs seeing as I would have to tell them there’s a chance I’m relocating in half a year. I don’t want to get settled in to a company to and have to leave shortly after. I’ve been applying to any remote jobs out there as that seems like my best bet right now. I’ve got an offer from a startup company BUT they are only offering an internship for the time being due to waiting to see if they pass the next funding round - they can’t afford to hire me full time yet. The company is exciting to me, but I also need to think about living/paying off my loans. Also, I’ve already worked a really good internship through my school - hopping from internship to internship doesn’t seem ideal. I know I’m prepared to start contributing as a full time employee. 

I’m going to keep applying for remote jobs I come across but I think I’d gain a lot more from a full time onsite job unfortunately. Also, I don’t see a lot of companies being keen to having a fresh grad start remotely. I’m really struggling to decide if I should accept this other internship if no full time remote opportunities arise or risk waiting for my girlfriend to get accepted and have a potential gap in employment. I really just want to start working as I’m very passionate about my field and getting towards graduation is getting me excited to start my career.

I know this is probably hard to give advice on, but I’d appreciate anything that could help give me some more certainty.

All I know is I don't want to work under someone and I know stuff about programming and project management, even though I am alone in my projects. And while I don't know much, I am willing to learn.

But I just don't know the path I should follow, I know there is not ""one path to rule them all"" or anything, even for programming.

To help with suggestions, I like Python, C#, I like programming mathematical applications, I study Applied Mathematics and I am thinking of researching Ethereum and similar technologies, cryptocurrency etc.

So what type of a path do you suggest to start to have my own career by being an entrepreneur?"

I want to intern this summer in NYC for personal reasons and have experience in python, C++, javascript (Bootstrap and AngularJS). Is it reasonable for me to try to find an internship in NYC?

I plan to take a java course, security of IoT, and an embedded systems course (VHDL and FPGAs) in the spring. 

I also plan to get an SE internship at a large defense company next summer and extend my graduation date to next December. 

Meanwhile, I'm working through big java. From there I'm going to read a data structures book based on java, and one of the popular algorithms books. Eventually I'll read CTCI and try my hand at leetcode and all that good stuff.

Long post.,throwawaysuicidaltho,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7f2n9w/dealing_with_daily_life_is_becoming_more/,"good afternoon everyone, this is my first post here, and its a long one. i am having suicidal thoughts (not to the point of planning to act on them, but to the point they are making my life hopeless and depressing), this is gonna be a slightly long post, but please bare with me, i am in dire need of help.

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits. -Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget. -Body odor which no matter what i do still remains. -i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this. -i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting. -i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes. -i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with. -a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

I hope here's the right spot to ask these kinds of questions, if not, please point me into the right direction
I'm not gonna describe the situation in detail since I don't want anyone to be able to find out my identity, but to sum it up: my boyfriend and I graduated from high school this year. Since we're from different countries with different languages, it was decided that we'd go to uni in an english speaking country. A few months ago he decided that he wanted to take a gap year off. Since it would've been rather complicated to switch universities between countries, I didn't really have a choice but to take off a year as well, which I do not like at all. I had to make plans for this year last minute and it was a really hard time for me, however, I was able to land a half-year paid internship at a nice company in the field that I want to work in later. My boyfriend moved in with me and my parents and that's where the problems started. He doesn't speak the local language, neither does he want to learn it. My parents made him go take language lessons, which he reluctantly did, but he put 0 effort in it and after 3 months he's still not any better. From the start he said that my parents didn't like him and that they were gonna throw him out. But that is not true. Here's the thing: he is not willing to do anything at all. I pushed him to message places where he may get a job because we also need to earn money for university. I do not want to HAVE to earn money while going to university since I know myself and I know that I may not be able to handle the stress, which is why I have already saved quite a lot. He does not understand that. In his mind, we can just work a 10h/week job and get by this way (with parents support) and, initially, he was not willing to ease my fear by trying harder to get a job. I know it's hard for someone who doesn't speak the language to find a job, but whenever he""tried"" to message people, I could just see how much he did not want to do that. He always told me how he is taking a gap year and did not have or plan on doing anything. He is working an online ""job"" now doing surveys etc. where he earns around a thousand a month. My parents aren't really happy about that either. He barely leaves the room and they feel that he is holding me back academically, because he is also very slow and lazy when it comes to university applications. I'm already so afraid that my job prospects are ruined because of this year, so for him it must be much worse. I'm always thinking about how he could possibly justify this year in his CV but I always end up thinking that his life is already ruined. I don't understand how he can do this, that's why I wanted to get in a second opinion. Did he already ruin his life or am I projecting my fears onto him?"

As you probably might have guessed. I am an Indian in USA with a master's degree in computer science seeking an H1B visa. Before you click the 'X' button on the tab, let me assure you, I am not one of those infy/cognizant type consultants. I genuinely enjoy what I do and I went to a decently ranked college for my master's degree. Not IVY league but 3 ~ 4 years ago, it was a top 20 school for computer science. I had two full time offers. Of which I picked one. I make close to 150k(bonus + base) and I am working for a really well-known company. 

Now there were 60 Indians in my class and everyone who had an offer before the lottery, got an H1B, except for me. I know its a lottery but my irrational mind sees two reasons why something like could've happened.

1) I was rejected after 3 rounds of interviews two years ago for an internship, by the same company I joined. In the final round, this year, I told my interviewer a joke. He started laughing and I told him I really badly wanted this job and he gave me the job. Maybe I was given the job to prevent bad PR? Maybe they never filled my H1B and just wanted to keep me around for a year or two? Do companies do that? Like lie about filling H1B?

2) By master's degree standard, I have a low GPA - 3.33.  If you get a GPA below 3 for two consecutive semesters, your visa will be revoked. To be fair, the program was insanely tough. A couple of courses I took involved reading like 40 research papers and there was quizes/exams on them. One of the course I took, natural language processing made us implement a shift-reduce parser whose ""actions"" were learnt by a perceptron. We had to read a paper on this, understand what we were doing and write code in python. I did all the programming assignments without any problem. But the math in these courses really killed me(""We don't want to invert the hessian matrix, in this case, because of the huge cost involved, so we went with this approach"". ""If we had N training samples, by this weird probability trick, this algorithm has a lower bound of epsilon on the training error"". ""Hence you can see, Fourier transform is the same as Laplace transform"" ). My American friends say that the master's program was very easy, but when you have to work for 15 hours every week in a burger shop to make the rent and study for these exams too... This just doesn't work. There are people who made it work. But sadly, I am not one of them. I tried my best, it just didn't work out for me.

Honestly, I want some certainty in life. I will probably work for a decade or so and go back to India. I am losing sleep over the H1B lottery thing. I have been considering going to Canada to evade this ""prosecution"" of sorts. Every day there is a news article regarding how the H1B process is going to change. It's taking close to a month to have your Visa stamped on your passport. I really want to buy a computer this year(One of my dreams in life is to buy a computer with an unlimited budget. I had a computer since 3rd grade, and most of the computers I had very shitty). I am really very tempted to order parts for 1800$ but I refraining to. Cause if I am forced to leave the country, I would have to toil for 6 months at least to earn that much in India. I am not even able to focus on my work, because of this uncertainty.

How much of a pay cut am I looking at, assuming I manage to get into Microsoft/Amazon next year in their Toronto branch or something? I will work my ass off. If I don't make it this year. I will try next year and a year after that before my visa expires. I will tell my interviewer a joke again and see if it works :D If it doesn't I will have to go back lol. I will probably try from India too.

Can I return to USA if I get like a citizenship there? I heard people make up to 300k with 10 years of experience in well know the company. Do you think that is possible in Canada?

My whiteboarding is much better than my online skill, simply because I've found interviewers to be generous with would-be compiler errors and just look at your overall logic. I've also found that in-person interviewers will take whatever language whereas online screens are often in my weaker ones.

Can someone like me even make in industry, or am I just deluded? At one point I thought I could because I don't mind staying at work an extra hour or two to make up for my lack of speed, but it looks like I can't even get hired. Is there any field in which ""slow"" coders are more welcome?

7f8500,35,2017-11-24,Something I've noticed about applying to top colleges.,grimreaper27,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7f8500/something_ive_noticed_about_applying_to_top/,"#### What I noticed
Just a general impression I've gotten as I've researched and applied to colleges. For the top, really selective colleges (Ivies, Stanford, MIT etc.) having incredible awards/ECs can definitely make up for meh grades, and can often improve your chances significantly. 

However, if you don't have such impressive ECs or awards, and just happen to do well in exams and school with decent ECs only because you started late (*cough* junior year *cough*) and never took part in competitions because you never understood its importance... 

Well you're not shit outta luck yet, it just becomes a lot more uncertain and crapshoot-y, and a lot more dependent on essays, how you think, what kind of person are you. 

#### Guide

So if you have motivated, driven kids you know, the best piece of advice I can think of for them is:

1) In freshman/middle school, figure out what you love as early as possible by trying out new things. Focus on one to two things at a time only. Give it up without getting invested if it doesn't really appeal to you. 

2) Once you figure out what you love, start learning as much as you can. Coursera, Udacity, textbooks whatever. Get as deep as you can within that area. Focus most of your free time on this, and since you'd love it, you will have fun. Get standardized testing out of the way around now. 

3) You should be in late sophomore/early junior by now. Here on out take part in as many competitions - or its equivalent - as you can. Try to aim big and *prove* your knowledge essentially. 

4) Come senior year, write great essays. Start in the summer and plan your time. You should be in a perfect position to apply for college around now.

All this while maintain *decent* grades like GPA &gt; 3.7 uw and use smarter techniques like many AP classes to boost weighted GPA, and essentially study smart. 


#### Conclusions

So breakdown:

GPA &gt; 3.7 uw and 4.2 w

ACT/SAT &gt; 34/1530

ECs/Awards: excellent

Essays: excellent

LORs: good 

Interview (lots to talk about, this much EC involvement would also tend to give you incredible experiences and make you a much more interesting person): great

That, imo, is the best 'formula' you can get, if you're aiming for top colleges and are a driven, motivated student. 

This is from a combination of mine and my friends experiences. I wish I had started earlier and managed to follow this. I didn't put much effort until junior year and that's when I really got good grades but I didn't have time to do much else. My friends on the other hand... Some have been preparing for years b/c siblings or parents (and pretty much doing the above) and their applications are honestly incredible and the best I've heard of. National awards, years worth of research with a published paper in a reputed, top journal, great essays, top grades (not valedictorian but that's the point, you don't need to be the absolute top, you just need to be *good*). These are the kids who have a shot at Harvard and the like, and a decent shot at that. 

Now obviously, not everyone wants to or can do this and that's perfectly okay. This is just something I've noticed and some advice I've formed outta that. I give this advice to my friend's younger siblings and what not. 

I'd like to know what everyone else thinks of this. Hope you enjoyed this.

TL;DR: To get into a top college, best method is *good* grades and test scores, exceptional ECs/Awards, great essays (exceptional not required) and to start early.

EDIT: Many people have said that preparing for college isn't really a great childhood, and I agree. But the point of this isn't getting into college. That's just a byproduct. What you figure out with this is what you love doing, what gets you outta bed in the morning, what you're passionate about. Learning more about all that and diving into what the world has to offer in that field... To me that's something wonderful and really fun. 

For example, I love CS and AI and ML. I realized this in my junior year summer, where I had an internship with a startup. I currently regret not taking the time from other summers doing research in a university program, taking cool CS classes at uni, or working on open-source projects. I regret not going to conferences and hackathons. I regret not attempting competitions to see how much I had to learn and what I could do with it. I wish I had worked on cool projects *before*, like that app I really want to do but I'm super busy at the moment. Freshman and sophomore years are years without the stress of college and applications and the future. I wish I had the time I lost, and I think what this 'guide' helps you do is make the most of what time you have. 

Also guys look:

&gt; would also tend to give you incredible experiences and make you a much more interesting person

&gt; most of your free time on this, and since you'd love it, you will have fun. 

&gt;  figure out what you love as early as possible by trying out new things.

What's not to love about those things? 

EDIT 2: Jeez, this is controversial."

I am trying to decide between transferring to Georgia Tech, Georgia Southern, and Kennesaw State University. I've almost completed the first two years of classes required for transfer while still in high school (I'm a senior). I really want to go to GT, and I'm pretty sure I'm a good candidate for them (I'm at a 3.37 cumulative GPA but my math and science GPA is around a 3.7), but they're pretty selective.

On the other hand, KSU and GSU are both ABET-accredited like GT, but obviously don't have the same brand reputation as GT. GSU has the advantage of being super close to where I live (southeast GA) and both of those schools are pretty affordable.

Which school should I go for, and will it ultimately matter in my future career?

At the time I accepted it and fully believed that I'd be returning, as I enjoyed my team and they offered me more than most new grads. My manager also got special approval for me to continue my internship remotely part-time, so I was thrilled. 

I applied to a few prestigious companies (mostly big Ns and unicorns) just for fun and surprisingly ended up with a lot of job offers, each of them offering far more than what this company is offering (which is still nothing to scoff at). I've pretty much made up my mind and plan on reneging, but I'm terrified of the conversation with my manager since she had to jump through so many hoops for me, so I've been procrastinating. I also want to keep my part-time job as long as possible, since it pays very well (and I can work in my PJs).

So, my questions are:

- How can I renege in the most polite and appreciative way? (I have a good relationship with my manager, and don't want her to hate me even though I don't plan on working there in the future)

- Can I tell her where I'm going, or is it possible that she will rat me out to them?

- What is the latest reasonable time to renege (so they can find someone to replace me), since I want to keep my remote job?"

So, short background: I obtained an intern position at my school district's IT department, doing IT in all the schools, and tech support, of course, comes along with that. Also short aside that it's entertaining that the Tech Director has asked me how to do things like Group Policy and the like, so that's always fun. 

On to the actual story.

One day a few months ago, a teacher we will call random econ teacher or **$RET** submitted a ticket into {Fairly popular ticketing system} (not sure if I can use names of software/infra). I decided to head down to **$RET**'s room after school that afternoon to see what might be causing this issue. Of course, it took an impossibly long amount of time to even login, considering many of our faculty are running on slow Dell OptiPlex machines with Core 2 Duos or Core i5s with like 2GB RAM, which is barely enough to *boot* Windows 7, let alone run it *acceptably*. So, after waiting a very, very long time, I got into network diagnostics and waited. And waited... you get the picture. Eventually, network diagnostics told me there wasn't a cable plugged in. So, naturally, I *again* checked the cable, and sure enough it was plugged in. I checked the wall, and the same outcome. So, I replaced the cable and all was well. 

You might be wondering what was wrong with the cable. Well, after running the length of the cable I discovered that either a rat chewed partially through it and cut 3 of the 6 wires, or that some jerk HS student used a knife and cut through some of the cables. Pick your poison.

TL;DR: Teacher submitted a ticket saying her internet wasn't working, replaced cable, found sever in the original cable that was either caused by rat or by student with a knife. Go figure."
7fdjst,13,2017-11-25,"There is too much bull shit posturing, and almost no real value any more",Murpett,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7fdjst/there_is_too_much_bull_shit_posturing_and_almost/,"I've become really fucking annoyed with the current culture of posturing surrounding success lately. To a large extent, I believe in putting action before words, but every other person seems to believe otherwise, it seems. I work in the Software/Finance field, so this is pretty fucking common for me to see. Here are a few observations of the bullshit I've seen:

The ""self-taught"" idiot:
So many god damn 'self-taught' investors and programmers lately, who wear 'self-taught' like it's some kind of badge of honour that shows their self-teaching abilities make them as smart as Einstein. Sometimes there are good self-taught programmers and finance people. But 99% of the time, they're just programmers who learned one set of tools, or finance people who turned a profit during the greatest bull markets in history (but still can't calculate a dividend yield without investopedia). I had one client who works in the music industry try to get in to running a Blockchain project - the latest software fad - even though he had 0 knowledge of software, and claimed he would ""learn on the job"" while running the project. 

The resume-padder:
During university, there were so many people who were trying to hack their resumes. They would strategically take extracurriculars, go to networking events, and network on LinkedIn. You know what they didn't do? Actually do valuable work. The finance resume-padders couldn't hold a conversation about their thoughts on market valuations, and the CS resume-padders couldn't finish a single challenge on HackerRank. 

The Life-Advice'er
I read and listen to a lot of people who give life philosophy. But Thai Lopez and Gary Vaynerchuk are just motivational tools that give you shallow, generic advice for success, without making you address actual habits. But the worst people are those that are 21 and posting career advice on LinkedIn, and I've seen it multiple times. 

The Risk-Taker:
These are your wannabe entrepreneurs and ""high-risk"" investors. They don't do due-dilligence, or invest in fundamentals - they just chase whatever looks like it will make them rich. They don't actually care about creating a product or service. I worked an internship with one guy who was *convinced* he would retire by 30. He would start a company, make millions, and retire. He didn't have an idea for a product or service, just a delusional level of self confidence. Don't even get me started on crypto currency and ICO ""investors"". 

I'm just annoyed. Everybody thinks they're so great that they lead with bullshit and sometimes follow up with substance. I really wish people would just keep their fucking mouths shut until they actually accomplish something.

As a little background: I've got an Associate's and a Bachelor's of Music. I found out a little late that I've got a real love for the various topics in EE and CS, and I've decided to return to school to get a degree in computer engineering. I'm currently in CT with my girlfriend as she gets her master's from Yale and I've got two options:

1) Head to the University of New Haven starting this spring. I've been awarded the largest possible merit scholarship and would be able to do everything in 6 - 7 semesters due to transfer credits. But, this being a private university, I'd be shelling out close to $10,000 a semester. So I'd be looking at a $60,000 to $70,000 education.

2) Wait a semester, continue my self studies, and head to a local CC next fall to get my Associate's in Engineering; something I could do in two semesters for in-state tuition (a total of $4,000). From there, I'd then transfer to University of Connecticut for $6,000 a semester and end up saving between $30,000 and $40,000.

Obviously option 2 makes more sense money-wise. But I've got some concerns. Will being at a big university for only 2 years hurt my internship opportunities? Will the inability to take advantage of all of UConn's electives be detrimental? I'd love to get a master's afterwards - would my options be hampered by this path? Are there any obvious downsides to either option that I'm missing?

7fg216,14,2017-11-25,Thinking about taking the leap into entrepreneurship. Hoping to get some advice.,N6723P,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7fg216/thinking_about_taking_the_leap_into/,"Okay, I am going to be general and keep this as ambiguous as possible for obvious reasons, but here is some back story: 

I am 26, living in a mid-sized metropolitan area, working for an ad agency, making between 45,000 and 52,000/yr. Used to be solely a graphic designer, but have since grown my skill set from solely graphic design into motion, video, web, and more. I've even concepted and art directed a few commercials for broadcast. 

I have a slightly better title now, but I'm still paid like a junior to mid level creative. I've always wanted financial freedom, and feeling under appreciated makes me want to chase it even more. 

I've been within my cities marketing and ad  community for about 6 years, starting as an intern in a small marketing team, to recently being the lead creative on a major cultural institution. 

Something I've noticed, unanimously with every client I've ever worked with is, they are simply incapable of having marketing that keeps up with the pace of culture. There are maybe, at most, a handful of local companies who actually have good branded content, and even less who have a worth-while social presence. It's a huge gap, and in my opinion there is a lot of money to be made. 

Small companies are forced into a decision - pay a social media consultant between 30-50 grand a year to make often subpar level content, or hire an agency and pay huge prices for quality work that comes comes at a very slow pace.  

So, you see tons of small businesses with generic and tasteless social media content, because they are limited by the skills of the social media coordinator of an in-house branding team. 

Or you see companies working with an agency who's process slows down internal teams and hugely inflates the cost for simple services, oftentimes competing with the work an internal team does and muddying the brand's identity. 

With so many companies struggling to do social the right way, there is a hole to fill. I want to take the skills that I have, creating quality, multidisciplinary content, design, editing, social media coordination, etc. and combine them with the skills of my close friends - organization, photography, videography, account management, and create a content studio. 

A content studio focused on giving small and regional business the ability to have consistent high quality branded content that actually works and creates engagement. That actually adds value to the day to day cultural conversation. That acts like an arm of the internal team rather than a separate entity. 

I want to work the way of a typical agency, but much more nimble, working on set monthly rates or on a project by project basis. Cutting timely, costly, and unnecessary parts of the approval process, in order to work at the speed that 2017 demands. 

I want to offer brand managers an option that offers both high quality content and quick turn around. Give them options outside of hiring an internal social person, or an outside agency. 

However, I know nothing about a business plan. All I know is that I think I have all the pieces to build something successful. I just want to make sure I build from a foundation of concrete, and I'm willing to take it slow. 

I don't care to be a millionaire next month. I mean I wouldn't be mad about it, but that's beside the point. 

Hoping to see maybe some other similar posts, or complete how-to's, etc. Or if my idea is idiotic I suppose that would be helpful as well at this time. 





TL:DR:
I want to create a content studio, to give small to mid level businesses the ability to create quality, multi disciplinary content without the high costs and long deadlines of external agencies. 

But I don't know anything about starting a business.

I am not sure what's going on in their mind with regards to what happens after I graduate. For example, I'm not sure if they will offer me full time as I get closer to graduation, or they are waiting for me to formally apply for a full time job, or if it will just end when I graduate and I should be looking elsewhere. Does anyone have any advice as to how I should approach this situation?"

I've never programmed anything that wasn't for a class assignment and frankly I don't have any interest in doing so. I just don't have enough of an interest in programming to ""make a project I'm interested in"" like the sub commonly suggests. I'm just in this major for the money; the technology itself is not interesting or fun. I'll make stuff if I need to, but I just couldn't feel more disconnected from the idea of programming just for fun.

I feel outclassed by all of my peers who get worse grades in the theory-heavy classes but are knowledgeable and passionate about the practical side of computer science, and the more I read through this sub with its emphasis on how GPA doesn't matter much and how important internships and projects are, the more I worry that I didn't do enough during undergrad. Should I be doing more than just firing out applications and finishing my classes during the next 6 months? I don't care about working for a huge prestigious tech company, I just want *a* job as a developer, and this sub makes me wonder if that's a hugely uphill battle for graduates without any real experience."

7fnkhr,2,2017-11-26,How do you grow a nurturing relationship?,AuriousGlorius,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7fnkhr/how_do_you_grow_a_nurturing_relationship/,"(Xpost r/relationships and r/confession)

TLDR: I was selfish and toxic. I think we could make it work, but I need to change and I don’t know how.

Hi. My ex and I are 21. We met a little less than 3 years ago through tinder. He was homeschooled through high school, so he hadn’t dated anyone before seeing me. I downloaded Tinder after breaking up with my long term high school boyfriend at the time, not really looking for anything serious. We set up a date, and started going out. 

We hit it off okay, and went on a few dates. I was kind of expecting it to not be very serious, and became physically intimate with him very quickly (like around 3 dates in). I didn’t recognize that he was falling intensely in love with me until we had sex for the first time, his first time. 

I was a bit liberal with telling my friends details of my sex life, and liberal in telling him the details of my past relationship when he asked. I think I made him feel less valued, because he loved me so much right off the bat, and I was hesitant to reciprocate raw emotional intimacy. Of course I liked him, but I wasn’t emotionally ready to fully commit to a long term relationship. This made him feel very insecure.

We continued to date, and my love for him flowed stronger over time. As the months go on, we pass the honeymooning period and begin to have less sex. His sex drive continues to be high, mine wanes. This discrepancy also makes him feel insecure. We start being at odds with sex, especially as college sends me through periods of intense stress. I can be a highly anxious person. I start feeling pressured that I am not giving him enough sexually. His self worth plummets. He is very sexy and handsome, but I do not make him feel it because of my lack of drive. I feel pressured, and unable to perform sexually. We have a deep emotional bond and attachment by this point, and very much enjoy our time together, with the exception of sex.

I feel high strung and unloveable. He begins to slip into depression. Even when we have sex, he does not believe my actions are genuine. Sometimes he gets drunk and spouts anger at me. Sometimes he calls me a bitch in public. Our sex life is highly corrupted because of this. I feel as though I can not do anything to satisfy him, he feels the same about me. He does not feel valued. He never forgives me for talking about my last boyfriend, and not loving him passionately from day 1. 

He begins liking other girls’ bikini photos on Instagram, putting on a fake masculine facade to shell his insecurities. He is depressed, and invests very little in his school work. While I get internships and work in other cities, he spends long periods of time alone, exacerbating his spiral.

In this last month, he asked for a break, but then we spent almost all of our time together. We left school for Thanksgiving, and suddenly when we were apart, he asked for a break again.

I love him very very much. He is the kindest, most wonderful man I know. We traveled Europe together. I love his sense of humor, his raw curiosity and his relentless sense of adventure. We fit together well in this way, because I am very organized, but also adventurous, we do well when we want to go and do something. Often we spend fun afternoons together, going on small adventures and eating good bread and cheese. I cherish these moments. I miss them.

I just feel like I corrupted our relationship from the very beginning by sharing the details of my past life. I feel frustrated because he blames me for our uneven sex drives, but I think his lack of communication stems many of these problems. On one hand, I think I was toxic to him. At times I was very selfish, and negligent to his self worth. I think I could have been more nurturing. I want to be more nurturing. I have a hard time balancing life and my love life, and I feel like I am mostly to blame for his depression. Feeling toxic is really horrible.

So, I want to know if it’s salvageable. I think we have enough in common that it is, but there is a ton of groundwork to lay. I don’t know how to make him feel valued, but I want to make him feel valued.

I don’t know how temporary this break is. On one hand, he has never dated anyone, so maybe him wanting to do this was inevitable. He is still liking all of my photos online, still has himself listed as “in a relationship” on Facebook. I do not. I don’t really know where to go from here, whether it would be better to give him some space or ask him to forgive me and work on it. I think I need to go to therapy and learn more about emotional intimacy and how to grow a healthier relationship. My parents are divorced, and were separated most of my life. I think that I haven’t really been given a good foundation to understand the needs of others.

Prior to that I've worked as a buyer for other, more mechanical areas (materials and services for manufacturing plants, that kind of thing).

As a Buyer, you usually aren't the actual expert that will be designing IT or machines, you usually sit at the commercial/contractual side and get the specifications from the requesters. It does however help a lot if you have a background understanding what you are negotiating about, how things are done by the suppliers and what is possible. Whenever suppliers want to get technical, you usually shut that topic of discussion town or they will run wild with claims that you can't validate.

Anyway, does anybody else has experience as an IT Buyer and could recommend avenues of information to read up, e.g. what kind of contracts are common, what clauses/KPIs/whatever are standard or could be considered etc.?"

They recommend either EE or MechE because their degrees are much more versatile. I was wondering if this would be a better route because I definitely do not want to go to grad school. I am generally interested in designing prosthetics and other medical devices if that helps.

I guess my questions are
1. What are the differences between the 4 concentrations of BENG in terms of classes taken and curriculum?
2. Is it better to major in EE and minor in something else bio-related instead? Or maybe double major?
3. How are internship opportunities and job prospects for bioengineering students?

The fuck is a catastrophe modeler?: we keep track of insurance company exposure in regions prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, winter storms, and provide business recommendations based on analytics to internal stakeholders. Sounds sexy right? Here's what they don't advertise outside of the job posting. The insurance industry is very antiquated in terms of culture and technology, an overwhelming majority of people are 40 and older with a breathtaking lack of enthusiasm about life (except for upper management). The job itself? The catastrophe models themselves are developed and sold to us by a third party and are essentially a black box that we (the insurance companies) just run our data through to get an answer. So our jobs are primarily building tools in excel/SQL/R/Python in order to make sense of the modeling results and explain it to people who don't know a damn thing about statistics. In my opinion it's absolutely soul crushing and not what was advertised before I got hired. 

So what now? I need out of the insurance industry altogether. My boss make a great point about 3 things you need to have a happy, successful career: are you intelligent? can you communicate you're intelligent? do you give a shit? Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to care about insurance on any level and I've got SEVERE job burnout and am battling a pretty nasty bout of depression at this point. 

Things I'd like in a career:
  *Something that's fundamentally interesting and that I can create a 
  passion for
  *Attracts interesting and driven people 
  *Requires an element of creativity
  *Is intellectually stimulating

What doesn't matter to me:
*How related a new career is to my current one
*A monster salary
*Location

What kind of matters:
*Will I have to swallow debt?

I'm overwhelmed by the amount of industries I could potentially break into. I've always been a somewhat talented writer and enjoy the process of gathering information and making arguments on topics that I think actually matter. I've done open mics around NYC to see if I had the chops to make it as a comic (probably not). Data science? Although bootcamps/grad school require a lot of time and money and would require me to quit my current job. Overall I feel lost because I thought the career I got into would be the one and I've spent a lot of time and energy getting here only to get completely burnt out. Any guidance or ideas would be very much appreciated.



TL/DR: Spend a lot of time in SQL and Excel in an antiquated industry where it's soul crushing to come into the office. Want an environment that's more fun and a career that's more stimulating.

7fpueg,2,2017-11-26,"2nd year Pharmacology student in the UK, looking to go into bioinformatics. Any advice?",eddyekko,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7fpueg/2nd_year_pharmacology_student_in_the_uk_looking/,"So I'm in my second year of uni in Scotland, where Bachelors last four years. This year was the first time my course actually had any coding in it (we're learning to use R for data analysis), and I found that I really, really liked it. Like it was the most fun I've had at uni, in a class, in the past two years. Pharmacology as my uni is part of a more general neuroscience, anatomy and physiology, and reproductive biology course, so I've had a fairly wide-ranging education in the biomiedical sciences so far, but the most fun thing I've done is still coding. 

However the electives available for people in my course are pretty restrictive; many mandatory (as in must pass in order to get an Honors) course next year require/recommend I take certain courses this year, meaning that my one elective slot is essentially full. So I can't take any dedicated computer science courses.

However my uni is aware of how important R and coding is, and we're all meant to be fluent in R by the end of the program. So my question is:

Is going into a Bioinformatics Msc in 2 years worth it, with only my Pharmacology/biomed background knowledge? Will I be able to learn enough in that 1 year span to work effectively in industry/academia? What kind of work would I be able to get (making simulations, analyzing data, etc...), and how similar is it to normal data analysis? 

What would the pay be like? How transferable are the skills to normal programming? Do people ever make the shift from industry bio-informatician to industry programmer/ software developer? How similar is bioinformatics to data science, and should I consider going into that instead, or are the skills transferable enough that I could theoretically go from working in bioinformatics to working in data science?

Is bioinformatics a good, fun industry to go into? One of the reasons I chose pharmacology is because I like applying scientific knowledge, but 2 years in the thought of getting the Phd needed to actually design drugs is pretty daunting. Would work as bio-informatician satisfy that drive?

And finally, what should I be doing now to give me an edge? I'm already learning to program at places like Code Academy; are there better resources out there I'm missing? Do companies even offer internships in bioinformatics? What would relevant work experience look like, and what's the best way to get it with my background?

Thanks in advance!"

I've been programming for close to a year now, and I've really been learning a lot, especially in the courses I'm currently taking towards my certificate in programming/web development.  I realize I'm nowhere near being a mature software developer or anything like that, but I'm curious as to where I am on the spectrum of learning.  To give you a more specific idea of what I know how to do so far, we've just gotten into creating classes (true object-oriented programming) in my C# class and previous to that we were covering structures, enumerators, tokens, and 2D arrays. Besides that, we've just covered tree structures, session variables, cookies, and query strings in my ASP.NET course.  I know those are still beginner concepts, but how much so?  How much more proficiency do I need until I can get a (hopefully paid) internship or an entry-level job?  

I still have four courses to go for my certificate, most of which I'll be taking next semester.

Thanks!"

My GPA will be around 3.85 UW this year (junior) maybe higher. 1430-1520 possible SAT score. But, my freshman and sophomore years were seriously lacking (Bs and Cs in my core honors classes but they were rigorous), with an average of around 86-90. But, this year, I will have way higher grades in my core classes, 2 are AP, all high As. Does this upward trend help at all? I am a VP of a club, president next year.

Any college ideas? My main focus is good price/Financial aid, and opportunities for internships, jobs, and connections. I'm from NY. 
Also this is sorta a stupid question but will being a girl possibly affect admissions? I noticed a lot of CS programs are almost 80% guys and it seems like they might want more diversity. Hopefully they will be more lenient but let me know.
I was thinking Rensselaer. Any chance of better schools like Carnegie Mellon, Rice, Tufts, etc...? My dream school was university of Colorado at Boulder due to the amount of startups and internships, but it's way too expensive as they have bad financial aid especially out of state.

I really hate writing, and that is a large part of being a professor, and with my ADHD, a job that unstructured sorta seems like hell. 
But I love the research, and I love network science.



Here are my possible paths as I see them:

1. Get my PhD in Computer Science or a related field like Informatics

2. Get my masters in applied mathematics and get a job as an analyst at an agency or company. While doing this I could publish the research I have been working on and take my math GRE which would open up applied mathematics PhD programs alongside the computer science ones.

3. Get a job without getting my masters

4. ?

Background:
*Triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Sociology
*summer internship at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, helping the analysts
*Two summers doing social network analysis research at an REU

Likes:
*Doing something that has a positive impact on humanity (or at least not a negative one. I.e. not verizon, weapons contractors, etc)
*Structure
*Problem Solving
*Being the computational or mathematics expert on a team of people from other backgrounds

Dislikes:
*Excess of writing
*High stress

I'm an independently homeschooled HS junior, and my parents think that counselors are stupid and incompetent, so I'm looking for advice and reassurance. This seems like a really helpful sub, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

Some stats and info:

Female, white/asian, in US

""GPA"": UW 3.9, W 4.7

SAT (took it in June): 1550/1600, RW 790, Math 760, Essay 6/6/6

PSAT (just got back scores): 1520/1520

Intended major: electrical or mechanical engineering

Main Extracurriculars: 

- been playing piano for 13 years, cello for 11 years; 

- founded a music technology project when I was a freshman, which grew to a team of 12 college students, which I lead. We do lots of rapid prototyping, electronics, coding, UI design, etc., and we give workshops and do public speaking at local schools and festivals (this is a huge time commitment for me, I spend 30h/week in peak periods, and we all meet once a week for a few hours). If all goes according to plan, we will apply for a patent by the end of this academic year.

- president of a service organization (alumni from a children's convention), and currently leading a recycling initiative with the Federal Reserve

I don't have many extracurriculars compared to some other people on this sub, but at least they are genuine passions.


I've been auditing college courses at a top university since freshman year, and the professors have been super-nice, so they let me participate in projects and take exams (hence the weighted GPA). So far, I've taken around 13 undergrad/grad courses, almost all in STEM fields (ECE, CS, math, physics). This sets me on track for some solid rec letters.

I'm planning on taking 10 AP exams at the end of the year, almost all in STEM or language subjects.

To complicate matters, we frequently move for my mom's job (I haven't spent a whole year in the same place since middle school), and next semester I will be in China. I will have an internship with a manufacturing firm, but it also means I won't have any actual grades for spring of my junior year...

I want to study electrical or mechanical engineering, at a top university, preferably with a good business program. My dream is to work in a manufacturing industry.

My parents keep telling me that I will get into wherever I want to go, and everybody will be flooding me with scholarship money, blahblahblah. It's very frustrating, because I need to take initiative on everything -- signing up for exams, looking for opportunities, etc. I literally found out about the NMSQT three weeks before I needed to sign up, and as a homeschooled student, it's very hard to find schools that are willing to proctor my exams. My parents are highly educated but they didn't go to college in the US, so they just assume that getting a good score on a bunch of exams will guarantee university admission.

I really want to make sure I'm doing all this right, so if somebody could tell me if there are any opportunities that I need to apply for, or if this going to China for the spring is going to mess stuff up, etc., that would be super helpful. Also, should I retake the SAT?

Thanks so much!!!

TL;DR: I have pretty good stats, but as an independently homeschooled junior, I have no clue if I'm doing stuff right."

I was on track to have  a lot of opportunities and on the path to a nice job making good money in an amazing city and state until two years when I let my head get the best of me and I wouldn't leave my room work weeks at a time and spot going to work until I was fired in March of 2016. I lost all of my professional networks. People I can ask for recommendations, my reputation is irreparable. I lost a huge part of my identity. I had a prestigious position. Especially for someone from out of state with zero family or university connections. Even my parents were surprised I earned the position I had.

I hospitalized involuntarily. 

I slugged along not working for a year. I took a class at a community college in a trade but dropped it because I was really shitty at the work I lacked natural talent in the field and was too embarrassed to ask for extra help and unmotivated to put in the effort. 

Then last fall I decided to pick myself up I started to eat healthier and exercise. I lost 25+ lbs that I had gained in the last few years. I went to therapy and was on medication. I started to reach out to friends I had cut myself off from. I took a job washing dishes for a 2 months period after Christmas and worked for my hands off. Literally, they were wrecked. I was an awesome employee. I won an award for being such a good employee. 

I was in talks with someone to run a new non-profit. I had a way to hopefully repair my working reputation. I was excited about the work. I had a sense of purpose. I was rebuilding a part of my identity I had lost. But the job did not work out.

After that job didn’t work out I started to spiral downward. Gained back all the weight I lost. I started isolating myself again. 

I have had 2 interviews for 2 jobs I was qualified for but failed to get one that was entry level. I prepped for the interviews. Asked people who previously worked at the company for advice. Prepped questions I thought they would ask and composed responses. I prepared questions to ask. I created a 4-page document to help me prepare for the interview. But failed.

I have applied for 6 jobs in the last two months that I am qualified for and heard nothing. People are looking over my resume before I send it in and say it looks good. 

I have 6 years of experience in public policy/ government but it is very specific to the state I live in now. A lot of non-profit openings are for development which I have minimal experience and would only be qualified for such a position after unpaid or low paid internships. I did an internship to get my foot in the door initially. I worked 2 jobs 60+ hours a week. I don’t think I have the motivation to do that again just to get my foot in the door.

Unemployment in the low 4% in my state and I can't get hired as a barista. I have applied to 3 coffee shops. Got one interview but zero job offers.

I'm broke. I need to file for bankruptcy because I am $40,000 in debt. My bank account is negative. I am selling my car to pay rent. Without a car, my job search is limited to a smaller area that is accessible via my bike, walking, or public transportation. 

All my options going forward are bleak. I will never be able to have the life I want. The chances of getting back into my career are slim. My future earning potential is low. I have no retirement savings, I’m getting priced out of my neighbor by rising rent. The hobbies I had are too expensive for me to participate in now. 

There is nothing that gives me purpose, or happiness or even contentment. My question is why is now not the appropriate time to give up? I’ve tried and I failed. I have lost a major part of my identity. I have no one that depends on me financially. I’m ready to quit."

I'm in a bit of a pickle and thought it would be a good idea to seek some opinions of other engineering students!

I'm a mechanical engineering student in my junior year.  I have had an internship last summer and have an internship lined up for this upcoming summer.  I'm on track to graduate in 4 years but received a pretty good offer from another company to Co-op during the next (Spring) semester, effectively delaying my graduation by a semester.

I've had a lot of different thoughts on the matter:

For one, it's a good opportunity in product development which is what (I think) I want to persue as a career.  My previous internship last summer was in product development, however, the company was a chemical company and the job dealt more with chemical engineering/chemistry while my current co-op offer on the table gives me the chance to dive into mechanical systems (which as a ME I do find much more interesting).

On the other side of that I'll be graduating late and be roughly 7-9 months delayed from a real full-time salary.  I will have 2 internships (one in product development and one in manufacturing) and some design team experience.  Much of my family says that I will be fine getting a job and can figure out my passions throughout my experience through actual jobs out of college.

Is it really worth delaying my college graduation for this experience?  It looks like a great position and all, but at the same time it's not like this is my dream job I'm pursuing, it's just a great way to see if I like this area of work.

I think it's also worth mentioning that I have a great group of friends that I do homework and study with and they are half the reason I have a 3.6 GPA as opposed to something like a 3.4.  I would be behind in them in most of my engineering coursework if I took this spring semester off from school, however.

I read appreciate all who read this.  It's a lot and I have to make my decision quite soon so I really appreciate any feedback on the matter!"

What other jobs are out there if I want to do more ‘research’?,azile1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/7fsrhz/first_fulltime_job_out_of_university_as_a_credit/,"Hi. I’m starting a full time job after graduation this January as a Credit Analyst. I’m also taking the CFA level 1 exam this December.

So I’m just curious on the different roles out there in Finance that will be a good fit for me. So here’s a bit of a background on my experience and education:

I’m actually an Economics student, and found myself getting into Finance. 

I worked under the personal and commercial banking department in one of the big 5 banks in Canada. I realized I can’t do a &gt;80% client facing role, and so I hated it.

Now as I was writing my thesis in my final term, I realized I like doing research and using econometric models, handling large datasets to interpret and analyze, and presenting data to other people in a very pleasing manner. I realized that I wanna do more ‘analysis’ and ‘research’ roles more than client facing. However, I don’t mind doing a bit of both since I think I can be personable, just not majority of work as client-facing.

That said, I accepted this CA role since I think it will be a foot in the door in the finance industry since I only have the CFA and that internship as my finance background. 

So bottomline: what are good career paths for me in terms of doing research/analysis roles under finance? (Taking into consideration that im taking the CFA and will have this CA experience)

This is something I've been tumbling with for the past month and I can't decide what to do. I currently live in Austin and work in advertising. Without going too deeply into it, I basically want to pursue that CS degree. I've only been in advertising for less than a year and I'm already kind of over it. I'm 25 and while I know I'm young, I'd still like to be as time efficient as possible. I'm already learning programming on my own (and enjoying it!) and working on brushing up my math skills (surprisingly enjoying it as well!) so I don't walk back into the classroom completely fresh. 

My options are: 

Stay in Austin, get a CS Associates at Austin Community College (ACC) in one year and if I do well, transfer over to a good college like UT for the second year. That might be tricky though, since I already have a bachelors (140+ college credits) and I just don't see a big college admitting me just for that one year. Everything I've read about ACC looks really great and I feel I could build a solid network there. I'd also have more time to head out to events and meet ups in the Austin tech scene, something that I find hard to do with my full-time job. ACC would be very cheap and I'd be taking classes with some amazing professors from what I've read here on Reddit. Maybe I could even find a part time job or internship once Ive become more well-rounded, especially since Austin is booming. 

 
Go back to UTEP. I graduated from there and heading back should be relatively simple, I'm also familiar with the campus and how everything works there. All the people I know who are in the CS program are very happy with it. The downside being that the tech-scene in El Paso is still in very early stages and a lot of these peeps find it hard to land jobs around town.  Student jobs that are career relevant would also be highly competed for and there's not too many of them. UTEP would be the fastest option as I would probably be able to complete the degree within a year and a half. While social scene doesn't matter as much to me anymore, it'd still be great to know that I have options for when some R&amp;R is needed. That won't be the case as much here, but  I guess that means more time to build my portfolio! UTEP would also be a very cheap option (costs would be around the same as ACC!).  Forgot to mention another advantage, the good thing in my case is that I have good access to people in the EP tech scene, including a mentor or two!



ASU. School looks great, opportunities for career advancement and networking look great and people are very happy in the CS program, Phoenix also has a solid tech scene. Basically everything I've seen about it, I have loved. I would also be closer to home, something I would definitely appreciate. All in all, ASU would probably be my top pick... BUT it's the most expensive one, by a LOT.

7fthrq,2,2017-11-27,Help Picking Major Regarding Computers and Technologies,Shivers3,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/7fthrq/help_picking_major_regarding_computers_and/,"New here so sorry if I screw up any post etiquette for this subreddit.

Recently just got out of High school in May of 2017 and decided it was best to take a gap year (Along with one math class because I suck at Math) since I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do and I lacked any funds/grants/scholarships/aid to go to college. Although it's really difficult deciding what you want to go into as I've further researched majors. My high school was also not very helpful in this endeavor or in about anything else (Some teachers were pretty good though) and it only makes it harder to do when you see everybody out there already getting a major picked out with a career.

I have had a interest in computers for a long time but it did get elevated to a entire different level when I got a IT internship at High School where we went around the school district, fixed shit, did little projects like a binary clock, or a electronic drum kit. Problem is, I'm a vegetable when it comes to what we did such as coding, networking, or just the basic fundamentals of computer science. I mean, I know how to fix computers, put them together, etc. but the stuff that my Boss/Supervisor knew how to do was crazy and went over my head.

I should probably make it a little bit clearer and a bit more to the point, I'm thinking about majoring in something to do with computers or technology but I have no clue in what such as science, engineering, software engineering and the same goes for where to start in any of those subjects. 

I do have other interests for majors but I feel as they would be lesser options should computers not work out. Would appreciate any help or experienced people in this field.

7fuiph,1,2017-11-27,What part of IT might I be good at?,N7Valiant,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7fuiph/what_part_of_it_might_i_be_good_at/,"I'm currently 30 with no experience in IT outside of a required 120 hour internship at my college's internal IT department as a PC Technician Tier 1/2 Support(according to my supervisor).  I have 8 years of retail experience and live on Oahu, Hawaii.  The job market here is very dry on the software dev side, but almost everyone needs IT services of some kind.  One possible market is cybersecurity due to the many military bases we have, but nearly all positions require a security clearance of Secret or higher, which I do not have.

&amp;nbsp;

I will be graduating this Fall semester with an Associate's Degree in IT that is focused towards programming(Visual Studio using C#) and cybersecurity(basically 3 security classes, the last one is not required for the degree, but qualifies me for the CEH exam).  I have a CompTIA A+ and Net+ and am scheduled to take Security+ in the middle of December.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm kind of curious what career path I should take, basically what position I want to aim for, how high up the ladder that position might be, and how to move towards it.  I feel I am strong towards programming, although due to a lack of research I did not focus on Computer Science as you normally would and cannot afford to go back to college either to change majors or continue towards a Bachelor's at the moment.  My immediate concern was getting my foot in the door, work for a year or so, and go back for my Bachelor's.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been eyeing Cybersecurity as a field because of the local job market and I've been told that it's a field with 0% unemployment.  The caveat might be that I need a Bachelor's to get my foot in that particular door.  I'm eyeing the Penetration Tester position, though I'm not quite sure if that plays to my strengths or if there's a non-security alternative.

&amp;nbsp;

I know little about actual hacking and penetration testing in the practical sense.  I was able to follow a walkthrough, make multiple adjustments(because it never works like it says it should), and was able to gain root access to a sickOs VM.  That doesn't make me suitable for pen testing, it just (to me) demonstrates an enthusiasm to jump into something I know little about and perform a lot of on-the-spot troubleshooting to fix whatever issues that prevented me from using my Kali Linux VM to penetrate the other VM.

&amp;nbsp;

My experience as an intern reflected that as well.  I wasn't a fan of the physical labor, the physical installation, spending an hour pulling out all the network cables from 20 computers and moving everything.  But I was like a kid on Christmas morning when the Help Desk brings over a laptop or PC, says it's broken, and they don't know what's wrong with it.  I enjoyed especially difficult solutions that frustrated even my senior coworkers(Windows update hanging, enabling the root account on a Mac to wipe all old install files of McAfee, finding the most efficient way to install all necessary drivers on a wiped Dell PC, how to stop File Explorer from opening up after an image of Windows 10 is put on).

&amp;nbsp;

I will be having an interview soon where I expect to be put at a Help Desk(but more customer service role rather than the hands-on work).  Which is fine to start with, just not sure what the next step is.  Presumably if I can't get my foot into security until I have a Bachelor's, what position should I try to shoot for that would best qualify me?  I have it in my mind that my path should be something like Help Desk ---&gt; ? ---&gt; ? ---&gt; System Admin ---&gt; Security Analyst ---&gt; Pen Tester.  Also plan to pick up CEH, CCNA, CCNA-Sec, CASP, OSCP, CISSP along the way."
7fvr1i,2,2017-11-27,Advice for New Grad Offer,Throwaway68936,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7fvr1i/advice_for_new_grad_offer/,"I was recently offered a new grad position for a defense contractor in Schenectady, NY (Small 'city' in Upstate New York, close to Albany). The pay is $61,000 and the benefits are pretty good.

I'm thinking about declining the offer though. The location is not great. Fairly high crime/poverty and harsh winters, so that is a slight issue for me. On top of that, it requires security clearance. The issue there is I've smoked weed within the last ~4 months and it says it's a guaranteed no if I have used any illegal drugs in the last 12 months. Never been a huge smoker, but I've definitely used it throughout college.

I graduate in May and I've had no internships and I have a few good, but not great, projects. I'm really torn because I want to take the offer because getting some experience would be incredibly helpful for me. Paired with the relatively low cost of living in the area, I could live fairly comfortably, albeit in an area I wouldn't enjoy. I'm afraid of not getting another offer and don't want to miss out on my best opportunity. The advice of seen here lately is that if you aren't a very attractive new grad, then you should take a job that you may not love, just to get your foot in the door. This seems to be my best opportunity for that, especially because I'm definitely afraid of not finding another.

I also don't want to go through all of this process just to get denied my security clearance and lose the job anyway. 

Like I said, I don't think I'm going to accept because I'll be denied security clearance anyway, but I'm curious if anyone had any advice or input. Thanks in advance."

7fx36b,2,2017-11-27,Have great part-time Marketing job... but need to search full-time soon.,Electric_Helix,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7fx36b/have_great_parttime_marketing_job_but_need_to/,"Been working at an enjoyable part-time position for the past 3 weeks now (Marketing Manager). My issue is that I am seeking to go full-time soon for better pay and benefits. My question then becomes when should I start looking for a new job if I can't go full-time with my current job?

To give more context... I really enjoy my new position; the work, people, and environment are great but they hired me only part-time. There is no obvious indicator that I might be going full-time with this position anytime soon. They are also aware that I am seeking full time since I am just finishing up with my other part-time internship position this week (graduated with Bachelors this past May so fresh out of college). Living at home with family so current finances and billing I can take care of and they are generous of me staying at home until locking in full-time.

My plan was to wait until mid-December to begin looking for full-time work. Once I get an interview offer for a desirable position, I'll give a ""kind"" ultimatum to my current employer stating essentially that I'd love to work full time for them but Company B is offering the same work for full-time and benefits across the street. If current employer then offers me full time with same pay/benefits I'll stick with current job but if not I'll have to leave. 

What are your thoughts on this plan? Would you go about it another way? I'd imagine this conversation has been repeated on this subreddit before so if easier to link me to those similar conversations then that is much appreciated.

Tl;dr: Been working new, desirable part-time job for a month now but need to go full-time soon for better pay/benefits. Plan on searching for new job soon but don't want to leave current employer high and dry before they can warm-up to me and consider me for full-time; but not sure how long to wait."
7fxi8j,13,2017-11-27,Why I went from accounting to pm at a hardware company to software engineer before 30,soulencoded,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fxi8j/why_i_went_from_accounting_to_pm_at_a_hardware/,"This is a little story about my journey to software engineering. I'm also starting a youtube channel recreating everything I learned from my Bootcamp. Links below. Would love feed back.

Growing up, I was a terrible student. I never really liked going to school and it was always a struggle for my parents to drag me out of bed every morning. It all seemed so pointless to me. Learning random formulas, bits of trivia about the American Civil War, and the barrage of extracurricular activities. In all honesty, all I wanted to do was play video games. I guess I was just like any other kid growing up with the N64. Bottom line, I hated learning for the sake of learning. I wished I knew this about myself a long time ago. 

Everyone whines about why it was so hard for them to get their first job, especially my generation. I graduated college in 2010, so it wasn’t that long after the financial crisis of 2008. No one wanted to hire a fresh college grad with zero experience. My friends and I would often complain about how hard it was to find a job, and how ridiculous these companies were looking to hire grads with two years of work experience. I went to college so I can get a job. How were we supposed to have experience already? said every college grad during that time. If I look back though, there were plenty of opportunities for me to get my feet wet. Instead of applying for internships during the summer, I went abroad to Korea and Japan. Also I was a guild leader in WoW so that took some time away. Biggest understatement ever. I didn’t really try to get more experience, because I believed that a awesome job awaited me after I graduated. The point is, getting my first job was tough for me. I grew up pretty sheltered, and I never had to pay for anything. It was such a shock for me that no one wanted to hire me. A fresh college grad with no useful skills with just an economics degree. Its kinda of funny that I thought like this back then. In the end, I convinced my parents that I need to go back to school, and this time I would learn something really practical. Something that every company needed. 

I found a accelerated accounting program at Santa Clara University that taught everything you needed to learn to sit for the CPA exam in about 8 months. It was perfect for me as I was still not a big fan of school and the thought of going to grad school for two more years gave me the chills. Enter my first job as an Accountant. I was pretty close to getting into one of the big fours. I even went to the final rounds with E&amp;Y. I still blame WoW and my raiding schedule on why I didn’t get that job. Luckily, I knew enough Korean and accounting to land a job at a Korean CPA firm. I was pretty stoked about it and I thought I finally made it. This feeling didn’t last long. I can go into many reasons why I hated this job, but the main thing was that I didn’t enjoy accounting. For lack of better words, I found it boring. I didn’t really make anything, I just accounted for things that had already happened. Kinda of ironic that I didn’t notice this fact about the job. Even the title of the job literally describes what the job function is. Working for the sake of working is draining. Towards the end of my year at my accounting firm, I wanted to jump ship desperately. 

Good fortune shined upon me once again in the form of my father. He was able to hook me up with a job at one of his friend’s company. This was a totally new field in the semi-conductor industry. I had zero experience and no technical background, but my new boss accepted me with open arms. I started working at Green Circuits. We made PCBA assemblies for hardware companies in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. the following 5 years or so, I learned a ton under my bosses wings. I become a PM, I had my own clients and things were pretty great, but something was missing. I had a crazy desire to make things. During this time of growth, I started to dabble into a bunch of side projects. My friends and I wanted to make apps so I learned how to draw and make assets. We released a few games and that was awesome. After that, I ran a webcomic series for about a year, started a t-shirt business and even published children books on amazon. I also got into making YouTube videos and podcasting. For whatever reason, I just kept wanted to make things. I had a passion for learning something for a specify goal.

My fiancé at the time, now wife, eventually got fed up with me switching hobbies every few years and told me to pick one thing and stick with it. After racking my brain for couple days, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to give programming a serious shot. My rationale was that, since I knew how to draw and make assets already, If I just learned how to program, I can make apps all by myself. After about two failed attempts and a lot of encouragement from my developer friends. I fell in love with coding and developing apps. I simply couldn’t get enough of it. I remember rushing home from work just so I can do more Hackerrank problems or working on a todo app for the umpteenth time. After I released my first game to the app store, a simple clone of flappy bird re-themed to a space ship dodging meteors, I knew programming was something I was passionate about. My friends were probably pretty annoyed at me by then, because all I wanted to do was talk about tech and ask them about simple programming concepts. What the hell is REST? and who is resting? Noob questions for days. Looking back, I’m very fond of these memories. Eventually, I came to a fork in the road. Stay at my current job, or pursue this new found passion of mine. It was tough, I had just gotten married and telling my newly wed wife that I was going to quit my job was the last thing I wanted to do. Surprisingly she was very supportive and said this Not many people get to do what they are passionate about for their living. 

Go for it babe. She is pretty amazing and I’m lucky to have her as my wife. :)

I’m working as a software engineer at Capital One and I’m loving every minute of it. In summary, I understand that not everyone is in a position to just quit their job and chase after something they are passionate about. It’s definitely an extreme thing to do.

The only thing I can say is that the pain and hard times chasing after something you are passionate about is worth it. 

Thanks for reading this little shindig of mine. One of my goals for the next year is to recreate my entire bootcamp content on youtube for free. 

Also I’m hoping to journal more about my experiences, programming, reviews of software classes I took and many more

7fxkdk,41,2017-11-27,"Advice on Burnout, that I can't Google",fox1212,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/7fxkdk/advice_on_burnout_that_i_cant_google/,"I'm in my last 40 or so credits at Tech. I've done 4 internships so everyone tells me to ""get it over with, graduate"". I'm a first generation student, I pay for all my things, my family is currently hurting because my dad's sick, leaving me as what is technically the bread-winner. I work part-time at an engineering job 20 hrs a week and do full-time school, like 10-13 hrs on average, yeah I know I'm weak.

***

**I'm dealing with burn out, I need advice from fellow students. Please give me advice on moving forward. Tell me your similar experiences and how you solved them. Are there resources at Tech besides counseling for me?**

***

**Problems I'm facing now:** I'm so behind in my current classes at the moment because I was gone for a week before break for a world finals CS competition, it was a great honor that I don't regret. I feel like I'm gonna fail 2 of my classes this semester. I have lots of HW to do, but those deadlines have already passed. I'm afraid to do it and turn it in late because they might not accept it and I would let other work get piled onto me. I haven't talked to the professors yet. I'm so afraid of the: ""Sorry you didn't notify the department so I can't grant an extension"" answer

***

**On burnout:** I think it's mostly because I feel like I'm spinning my wheels at both school and work. I'm so interested in my 4000 level classes, I have motivation to understand, read, and I go to classes. But doing the HW and studying for the tests feels impossible, I feel like no matter how much time I allocate I don't finish or perform poorly. Lots of little careless mistakes in hand-written math.

***

If I kill my GPA in the next year it could really screw my chances of getting into grad school here, I'm at a dead-on 3.0 so that would be easy to do. I definitely want the grad school option. I'd retake the 2 classes I'm in now so that I could actually enjoy them, but the idea averaging a F/D with a A/B plus getting a semester behind is ridding me with guilt. So many friends have come and gone and yet I'm still here. I'm a girl, over the last year I've become really withdrawn. I need to work on being social and meeting new people again. 

***

It's no overstatement that age 17 - 22 for me has been a whole lifetime in 5 yrs: homeless and cashier to engineer. I've specialized through internship experience, I want to continue my education, I know I could push the boundaries of my field, I have more meaningful work experience than people 3yrs out of school.  My CS team for that competition wants to build a start-up, guess who owns most of the IP, me. Stopping my education will not make me happy, that would be like hitting rock bottom. I've continuously done things to prevent burn-out: water, good food, exercise, sleep, and counseling on and off campus. Everything you can google. Now that those aren't working, I feel like trash. Actually getting the sleep I need has really cut down the amount of work I get done.

***

I'm considering doing part-time school Spring 2018 semester, just 2 classes. This would allow me: 1. concentrate on work at work and actually feel like I'm moving forward in my research. 2. be able to succeed at those 2 classes and prove to myself that I can be successful. I would take the semester off and just work, but I've done that 4 times. I don't think that will help me conquer my burnout. I think my burnout stems from feeling helpless to succeed in classes due to the limited amount of time in the day. I feel very guilty about doing part-time school a whole full semester, it makes more financial sense to take the semester off.

***

**TLDR QUs:** I feel like I'm frozen because I'm afraid to make choices and move forward with solving these issues. Will professors take my late work? I wish I could have fully with-drawn from this semester, but its too late for that. Has dropping to part-time school helped any of you with burnout do to feeling academically overwhelmed with full-time school?

I have been looking for a job for over a year and have had several interviews.  I feel like I fail at the interview level though.  I know the basics like arrive early, dress in a suit, be courteous and polite, etc.
I have been at a construction company doing project management work for almost 3 years now.  My background includes the following.
-3 years doing small renovations and commercial build project management.
-2 years at att doing b2b project management.  I handled custom software and network installs.
-3 month internship doing software development project management.
-I started a software dev studio.  I ran the entire business end including all project management.  We created virtual reality software and I have 2 concurrent projects across 40 employees.  The company only lasted 6 months as our investor backed out at the last minute.(should I mention this work I did??)

I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t say.  I am incredibly tech savvy and extremely computer oriented however I always have stayed on the hardware and software end and never explored networking much.  I build my own computers and so on so I feel like I can learn networking fast.

Any tips going into this interview would be greatly appreciated!!"

I was a pretty good student in high school and, as a result, got into a lot of prestigious undergrad schools (although I think that’s largely because I excelled in the SAT IIs). However, I kind of crashed and burned in college. I’m not proud of it. It was a combination of, well…I don’t know. Loneliness? Depression? Anxiety? Lack of motivation? Laziness? Lack of discipline? Some combination of those things? I don’t know, but I screwed up in college, and at one point, I was placed on probation and at risk of dismissal. I was able to graduate, but then the economy tanked. I worked at an internship for a year and a half or so, and was able to get into a pretty good grad school (again, because I aced my GRE, not because I had a stellar resume or anything). But within weeks of starting grad school, I realized I didn’t want to be there. I (and my parents) dragged myself kicking and screaming through grad school, but it was plagued with many of the same problems that plagued my undergrad.  

I got a software QA job after grad school, but it was just…meaningless. I mean, I hated it, but it was the only job I could get. I fumbled my way through that job for 2.5 years, barely knowing what was going on, until my whole team was laid off last year. I was on the market, but I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I know what degrees I had and I know I had certain skills, but if you asked me for a job title, I wouldn’t know what to tell you. I didn’t really know what I…*do*.

I applied to a data science boot camp and got in. I was ecstatic, mostly because I thought this would be a chance for me to really reboot my career and point it in an exciting direction. Data science seemed way more interesting to me than the work I had been doing. I finished the program, but struggled to find a relevant job. I was finally able to find a job, but it was similar to that QA job that I hated.  

In the last few weeks, I’ve been trying to add to my repertoire of skills/knowledge and do some projects. Specifically, I’ve been going through the websites for some of the Stanford machine learning courses (CS224n, CS231n, etc.). I’m going through some of the coding assignments and finding myself completely befuddled. I don’t know if it’s the vague terminology or the fact that you have to think in matrices and vectors, but I’m struggling.  

My brother, by contrast, was able to breeze through college in 3 years and finish his Masters in just over a year, both at very prestigious universities. Meanwhile, I’ve been barely able to keep my head above the water.  

I know that I’ve fucked up. A lot. I know I can be better. But that feeling is very, very intense right now. Every time I take a peek at the solutions to the code for CS224n, I just feel so…dirty. It’s like that feeling I used to get when I was stuck in Final Fantasy X and had to look up the walkthrough, only this is actually important.  

Anyway, this is just…sort of a rant. I’ve always wanted something better than what I have now, professionally speaking. And I thought I’d be able to accomplish that - actually get an interesting job that I’m passionate about and good at. But I’m wondering if that’s just a pipe dream. It sure feels like that right now."

A quick rundown of my history. 

* Dropped out of college when I was 20 in 2003
* Ran my own small business IT support company
* Went back to school with the plan to get a PhD in 2010
* Started an accelerated master’s program
* Decided to take an internship after finishing my bachelors degree. 
* Three weeks into my internship the company offers me a full time position and offers to pay for the rest of my masters degree.
* Starting total compensation $75k in 2013
* Raise in 2014 to $84K
* Promotion in 2015 to  $115K
* Raise in 2016 to $124K

We are coming up on our annual performance review / salary increase and my boss told me he put me in for another promotion, which should hopefully mean another big raise. As the title suggest I feel like a big fish in a little pond. I work with a defense contractor and most of the people on my team are aeronautical engineers who are self taught programmers. Within the first few months of me working at this place I felt like I was the best programmer in the office (Small team of 10 people). This is a mixed blessing because everyone else is so bad at their job it makes me look like a superstar. I get constant praise for saving the day, I get awards from the company, and I keep getting raises. What I would love is to have someone better than me to learn from, to not get stuck as a senior programmer of old technology, and to actually work on software using good programing practices. I have tried to convince my team to start writing unit test, doing code reviews, or writing comments, but these things don’t happen.

With this post I’m really just looking for some advice on how long I should stay at this easy job with good pay or should I start looking for another place to go before it’s too late?"

I've struggled to fall asleep my entire life; I remember being a kid and being AMAZED that my friends fell asleep as soon as they hit the sack, because it usually took me at least an hour. 

I've almost failed multiple classes because of my sleep problems (sleeping through or being late when they take attendance), and my boss at my internship last summer was really annoyed with me because I struggled to get to work before 9:30 (I was also exercising regularly during this period). I've slept through 2 exams in my college career (luckily, both professors took mercy on me). I naturally fall asleep around 5am, and have a hard time waking up before noon. I miss out on a lot because of this, and I've really screwed people over if we had a morning obligation and I've overslept. I'm usually sleep deprived, because I'm up late even when I have to wake up in the morning. 

Late night electronics use is definitely a problem, but I'm often up late working, and as a computer science major, most of my work is on the computer (my other major is art, and if you know artists, you know that doesn't help either--I way too often get in the ""mode"" around 1am). 

Exam period is coming up and it always gets worse then; I usually get on a 6am-3:00pm schedule by accident without classes to force me up, and don't manage to reset until I pull an all-nighter. During last years exam period for the fall semester, there was a good 3-4 days where I didn't see sunlight and man, that takes a toll on your psyche. Today I slept until 3:30pm and I need to get up tomorrow morning. Also, getting up early to finish work? Forget it. Won't happen. If something isn't done, I'm better off staying up to all-hours because ""wake up at 9am and get it done"" has never worked for me. Ever. 

I've tried melatonin, but it gave me some terrible nightmares. My doctor prescribed sleeping meds to me for a period to ""reset"", but I've gotten off schedule again and I don't want to be addicted to them. I don't like the idea of taking stimulants during the day and depressants at night my entire life. Of all my ADHD symptoms, this is easily the most disruptive for me. I don't know how to fix it. Multiple alarms don't work (trust me, I've tried several different apps and I usually have at least 10 alarms set, which is hard on my roommates). Vitamin supplements don't work. Meds don't work. Asking other people to wake me up isn't reliable and unfair to them because it's still difficult to get me out of bed (I've had one roommate tell me that they have to stop trying to help me up because they didn't like the extra stress in the morning). I have a 9:30 am class next semester, not to mention I'm graduating soon and have to actually work a regular schedule when other humans are up and functioning. At this point I seriously don't know what to do.

I graduated in may 2017 with my BS in Environmental Science. I was unsure about graduate school during my senior, as I had only done research once and only had one internship experience which was also sort of research oriented. Upon getting my first job I quickly realized that the private sector is kind of boring and I missed academia. That was in September, I did not take my GRE until the end of October, and I did not even have a concrete 5 or 6 programs I wanted to apply too. I have professors and professional contacts to write letters of rec and I contacted them a little spontaneously, and now I feel kind of silly having to email them again telling them never mind. 

I definitely have a couple programs I'd like to apply to, but don't feel like im 100% certain about any of them. A lot of them sound interesting, but then I look at the professors who are involved and their research, and it is usually not as interesting. Lastly, my front runner program has an early application deadline that I would probably need to apply to ( Dec. 15th) if  I want a shot at getting enough funding where I'll be able to be fully committed to my studies. This then has me thinking about retaking the GRE because I did not do that great ( did not study like a fool). I know that standardized test scores aren't that important but I'm worried about someone getting chosen over me for a TA position or some other kind of funding, because while we maybe both had good GPAs, letters of rec, background that mend well with what we are applying for, etc. they'll be chosen over me due to higher GRE scores. 

All this has me thinking that I should wait until next year. This worries me a little though because I likely wouldn't be starting until fall 2019 at that point, as most of the programs I've seen don't admit students in the spring, or it's harder to get funding. A two year gap seems like a lot of time for me, as everything I did in undergrad won't be as fresh in my mind. There is also that whole GOP tax plan thing that everyone seems worried about, not that I am that informed enough on the matter to know how much it will really affect me. 

So yea, what do you think, I should probably just wait another year right? 

Thanks in advance! "

The first company Makes operating Systems and stuFf. The second has a blue logo and usually a huge signing Bonus
 Right now I am leaning towards the second for the following reasons: 
 • The area is closer to where I live and I know a few people there
 • I liked the office and culture more when I visited during the on site interviews 
 • slightly better pay but I know it won’t matter at the end because the cost of living is much higher, but I think it will be the same at the end considering the fact that the difference is significant. 
 • I was given the impression that it’s more likely to get a full time offer after my internship at the second company but still not sure.
Things making me hesitant:
• I like the department I got an offer to work in from the second company a lot. People told me that this company's work is more”serious” but I don’t think that's totally true. 
• I feel like the second company has a bigger name but I am not sure which one stands out more Any input would be really appreciated. 

If you can tell me some things I should consider it would be great.
Thank you so much for everything. I have been lurking here for almost 9 months and if you're reading this you have probably helped me so much to reach this point in my life."

A close family member of mine works with a major software company and wants me to apply to the company for an internship. By the sound of it, he's very close to the people involved in hiring and my resume would most likely go to the top of the list. 

However, I also have an opportunity to hike the Pacific Crest Trail next summer, which is an absolute dream of mine. 

The internship isn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it is a ""permanent"" internship, so I'd essentially be an intern there part-time until I graduate, then I'd go straight into having a full-time job at the company. 

The idea that I could have an internship that pays so incredibly well and that I don't have to leave during the school year sounds absolutely incredible to me, I could possibly move out of my house (I have a lot of stress related to my home life), and getting into it this early into my school career is just so absolutely mind blowing to me.

But hiking this trail is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I've dreamt of doing it for a long time, but it would drain my savings, and upon coming home I'd end up going back to a minimum-wage job until the next year when I could potentially apply for this internship then. But I don't know if my uncle will be in the same position to give me such a large boost then.

I just feel lost. Someone point me in the right direction."

I was interviewing for multiple internships for my final semester of college (media/entertainment industry) and received an offer last Tuesday for one that was tied in my 'favorites' with another. Wanting to check in before I made a decision, I informed the team of the other company (which we can call AC) that I received an offer who would like a response by latest Monday (today). 





This morning, AC responded with an email stating that I would not be able to intern in the Spring ""due to scheduling"" (including a small section talking about how it was difficult to schedule this applicant pool because everyone was available the same days), and the following text:





*We hope that you will check back with us for a summer internship position. On April 30 we will begin accepting resumes. You will not need to submit yours again nor will you need to interview a second time, but if you could send us your availability around April 30 for the summer, we would love that. Additionally, we will check back in with you around that time as well.*





*A spot cannot be promised, however if scheduling permits, we would love to have you be a part of our intern team. If you are busy for summer, there will also possibilities for the Fall 2018 Internship position when that time comes.*





Now, I'd like your opinion on if this sounds like something promising, how I should touch base in April, should I send a thank you email now, etc. I've never been told that I won't need a second interview before, even when I've received an offer and pushed it off for a later semester.

I'm sorry for this wall of text, but I guess I'm way more lost than I thought I was. But this is a great community and I thought I'd take a shot with your good graces. Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

As the title suggests, I haven't racked up very many ECs in my time in high school. Uncharacteristic of this sub, I have not yet found my passions in life. I just moved from a small town in the midwest where my school had next to zero clubs to a huge public school in California. However, what I thought had been my passion: computer science, seems to be turning out to be not for me. I tried to take AP CompSci but because I transferred so late the class was full. And I attended a hacking club meeting the first week of school, but the people and the concept just weren't for me. I never considered robotics, and I fear its too late for that now. I'm attempting now to teach myself how to use Swift to code iOS apps, but its a long process, which is making me feel like I might not be all that interested in CS. But at the same time, who knows, I've had so little exposure I don't know how to tell. I also feel like it's too late into my junior year to join any ECs to find out, am I wrong? I know I could email all of the tech startups in my town asking for an internship, but what's the likelihood that they'd actually take me on, as a person who knows so little about programming? My second largest interest is Aerospace Engineering, but again, how would I ever really know as I haven't had the opportunity to take any Physics classes yet and all I know is that I really like math and I am obsessed with airplanes and rockets (and I did like Chem, but I'm stuck in IB Environmental Science this year but now that I'm looking back at it I really wish I would have taken AP Chem or Physics which I didn't even know was an option but my only friend in the school was in IBESS so I didn't want to switch out, stupid of me, I know, but ugh). And engineering extracurriculars seem even more daunting to me, like how would a high schooler ever get access to some engineering related activity? This comes into play because my dream school is UC Berkeley, I think, but at this point I don't have a scrap of a chance at being admitted to the CoE which leaves my best bet as applying to L&amp;S Computer Science and I don't even know if I would be interested in that! My second choice school is Cal Poly SLO, however, which I think I have a good shot at getting into either of those majors, but once again, I don't have any true passion other than years of geeking out on computers and waving to airplanes as they fly across the sky and SLO is a ""list major on application"" school. I really want to attend Berkeley to prove to myself that I'm worth something, and that my effort in high school will all amount to something, and I'm dreading the fact that my abysmal ECs and passion in general will hold me back from my dreams. This has turned into a rant, and I'm sorry, but if anyone is still reading I'd greatly appreciate any advice you could give me as to how to proceed with my search for ECs, or honestly life in general. I don't feel like my school counselors are helpful, and my parents can only praise me so much before it becomes more detrimental than anything else.

TL;DR
I'm halfway through my junior year and I don't have many EC's at all, let alone passions in general for EC's to even be associated with. I like computers and airplanes, and that's about it. I feel lost, and I'm looking for any advice."

Also i should state that what I'm struggling with is not really easy to put into words (at least i don't know how) so put your empathy hats on and bare with me,
as i try to put my thoughts down in really inconvenient and drawn out sentences.
 (Again, i'm sorry!)

Let me start off by saying that i *really* hate the idea of having a job thanks to my shitty attitude 
and with ""shitty"" I mean that I seriously can't stay at a job that i don't enjoy personally for longer than 3 - 6 months. That's the way it has always been up until one point. I've *tried*, believe me, i really did try to go on about these routines for more times than i can think but i still always end up quitting it, cause i feel like shit. I can't really pinpoint exactly what it is that actually drives me nuts, though.
Maybe it's the fact that i'll just be working on a machine and *figuratively* become a gear in a machine altogether myself.
Getting up to work, just to come back tired to go back to sleep.
**Rinse and Repeat.** (especially in a kitchen scenario, dishwashing y'all!)
I've tried a lot of other job situations, though.
At first i always start off being all hopeful and enthusiastic about the new job/money i'll be getting, but after the 6th month or so, 
the only real ""work"" i'd be putting into anything in the morningwould end up being my bed sheets, seeing how i can best avoid the sunshine meeting my eyes when i pre-maturely wake up. 
(sounded better in my head, so insert another obligatory wordplay/shitty a here)
The thing that i've noticed is that i actually start to enjoy just about any aspect of life just
that much more *less* that it becomes noticable.
I mean i know that it's supposed to be normal because i'm more tired thanks to my schedule actually consisting of more things than sleeping and eating and doing hobby stuff.But it gets to the point where i literally can't enjoy a thing. 
I just get really damn lethargic and i get moody, people even notice it and confront me about it. Whatever i do, in the back of my mind, i always have this damn devil in my head, telling me 
""Oh, you better not enjoy this too much, you'll be working from 9 - 5 tomorrow again!
Better not get to bed too late, too!""
It has always been this way.. up until a few years ago! **(ppsst, this is where the real struggle will start to show)**
Up until a few years ago my only hobby was gaming, really. Maybe even the 'ol ""I like to meet my kek friends"" cliché.
My life was boring as hell (still is except for one part). Some unimportant events later and I was about 12-13 (i think) and i ended up trying to write music, because a friend was really good at playing the piano. Needless to say it blew me away! I was captivated, I seriously found nothing on this world to be so damn soothing, exciting, tiring and challenging at once. All that mashed together and it was the time of my life! I ended up getting a *really* shitty guitar, 
where i wrote a few notes at a time, really shitty music, honestly. A few years later I quit my current ""job"" because i wanted to go to school again
(actually didn't get fired this time, woo!)
Though honestly, I only wanted to continue school because that would mean I could draw out my life-schedule just that little bit more.
So the usual 6 month went by and I actually wrote whole entire songs!
That was unbelievable for me, because for the first time i worked really damn hard on something
and it never really came out the way i planned but I was never growing tired!
No matter how much time i had spent on my (new-found) hobby, i loved every single bit of it.
So i figured, why not take my new-found love for a crash course and find a fitting job?
Well, where I live creative jobs are hard to come by, you need a (proper proper) education 
to even find something or you need a whole lot of Vitamin B and/or money
None of those things I had.
Time to shake the right hands then, I thought.
I started an internship at my local music studio and that's when it really clicked for me.
After seeing all this, and having a super nice guy welcome me to the world of producing, the cards were dealt for me. I wanted to make a living producing! Hell, maybe even make music myself!(?)
""Back-Then-Me"" probably knew that this -most of the times-, is but a dream people have,
since it's really hard to get yourself known.
""Current Me"" still thinks that but ""Current Me and ""Back-Then-Me"" would both find an agreement 
and say we'd give it a shot. Else we'd ""never know what could've been"".
So.. i created a really stupid musical persona and..
*OBVIOUSLY* started making rap music. (though its more of a rap/metal mix)
**(You guys, this is where the ""fun"" starts"")**

So I wrote, I mixed, I mastered, for over 3 years, put every creative fiber and soul into this project! 
It may not sound like much to anyone out there on a surface level, but it means so much to me.
And now that i feel like it's done.. I feel like i am as well.
You see, because i had no money and a stupid cocky attitude, I decided to do everything myself.
Basically almost all of the songs I've written took me about 700-ish hours (not counting how many times I've re-visited them). Given that I've finished about 30 songs..
That's a shitload of time i put into that by my estimation.
The worst part is, that it was in my eyes, the definition of development hell.
(or musical hell? No Justin Biebers jokes here, sadly)
I had countless problems with my shitbrick of a pc that was probably hitlers very own computer from back in the day according to the way it shat all over me.
I had bad input signal, had super shitty latency issues, plus my hard drive died on me so i lost 80% of all progress and the original files, so i had to re-do most of the record -or what i could.
And thats just to name a few issues i had.
Not saying it's not my fault for not upgrading/repairing my pc, 
I had no idea what I was getting myself into and I didn't have my priorities straight.
On top of that, the biggest burden was probably that I didn't have anyone to really reflect on.
I have some friends that are into music, some are really talented too.
Most of my friends aren't into this type of music, though. 
So the only thing they'll tell me is that it's not their cup of tea.
So i get into this weird mindset where i think ""If it's *not* that, then what is it?""
I somehow concluded that it must be because my music is shit and they don't want to tell me out of the impulse of being friendly, or they don't really want to bother.
So i probably come off as really delirious or even pretentious when i want to hear their input.
But all i want is for them to critique me, it's how i want to grow, too!
Maybe i feel like I'm not being taken serious?
Don't get me wrong, i have super nice friends and I'm probably reading this entire situation wrongly
and give them wrong credit for what the situation holds, I mean truly they are so good to me.
But it just feels like im in a mental prison where i feel like my effort will be all for nothing
if i can't express my ""art"" in a way where i get input from others. 
It may sound really damn self-centered and i wouldn't want it to sound that way,
but that's what my mind is circling around all day.
Do you guys see a pattern here? 
I'm really good at not seeing the forest for the trees. But moving on
**(pppssst guys, this is the climax of this entire thing)**

Now here i am, finished with most of my stuff. 
With the power i had, i finished what i set out to do.
I learned so much and i know I've improved so damn much in just about every aspect of myself
Not just musically but as a human being. -BUT-
**I'm burned out.** 

I have *such* a hate/love relationship with this project 'cause it caused me so much stress.
So what do I do now? - I have no idea!
Since then I've dropped out of school because I'm stupid
And now I'm sitting here with this product that i want to get out to the world, but i want to make it justice.
I want to do videos for the singles, but i have no money nor the creative juices to keep going.
But I don't want to take a break! This EP is already dated production-wise, so i don't want to wait till 2020
to put it out, since then it'll sound even shittier because production in music is moving forward so fast.
And i mean don't exactly want to meet the Zeitgeist (again, production-wise speaking) 
but i damn well don't want it to be aging anymore, too!
It would be no problem to just re-master them later on,
but the original files of most of the records poofed with the HDD, 
so this is the best I can get it to be.
And some things i don't think i can and want to re-produce. 
(let alone the fact that my voice changed a whole lot, too)
I may just be nit-picking, but this is what it all culminated to. 
Every single one of these ""issues"" (and so much more)
piled up to form this totally shitfuck situation.
I tried to take a break, but now instead of telling me about my schedule
and the fact that i should keep my hands over the blanket at night, so i'm full rested for work tomorrow,
the little fucker in my head reminds me that there is this unfinished, unreleased work that i've put so much energy and love into, but i can't move on, because there is no energy and/or motivation/money left.

My struggle is basically about me not really knowing what i should do with my life as of now.
I feel like this is the only thing im capable of/good at, so much so, that i have a hard time
seeing anything else but this.
Am i over thinking things? 
If yes, what is objectively the best thing i can do in a decent timely fashion before this unrest gets even worse? (If it does).
In before you guys go ""GET JOB"" 
I don't think i'd be stable enough just yet, as weird as it sounds, (going to the doc about that)
I have really tried to get along with the idea that maybe i should just drop it, 
get a job and forget about it for a while.
But I'm so close now, i can almost see the finish line!

I'm sorry for this mess of a post, i just needed to get it out of my system in a way so you guys could wear my shoes for 10 minutes, also this is the first time i'm actually posting *proper* stuff here, 
so formatting may be shite.

**((TLDR: I've burned myself out mentally because of a creative project i spent (in my estimation) too much time on and now i've lost all juice and motivation to do anything else, since i can't stop thinking about it.))**
Guys of /r/Advice, I call upon your magical power, please help me like you helped so many others
and show me a way out of this mess.

I will try my *very* best to answer to and reflect on any and every advice/thought you guys can give me.

I looked into transferring to another school for Information Systems as my university didn't offer any Computer Science degrees, when my adviser told me that the school is introducing a new program called Computer Informatics next fall. After looking into it, I think it's perfect for me, but I'm worried at the lack of definitive information on positions after college with that specific degree.

So my question is this, with a Computer Informatics degree, will it lower my job prospects upon graduating since it's a relatively new field? Or if I have an internship to have some experience on my resume will I be in just as good of shape?"
7g5ujw,2,2017-11-28,Concierge cost in Apartments?,quetzlthethird,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/7g5ujw/concierge_cost_in_apartments/,"Hello r/Germany! I'm living in Berlin and recently my building has been targeted for bulgary. Our doorbell has been marked, the backdoor's lock was broken with what looks like a Bohrmachine, and a thief was caught red-handed attempting a break-in (but unfortunately got away). Previously to this, we've had mail stolen from our Postbox, bums sleeping in the the stairway, and other unpleasent things.

Akelius, the company who owns the building, is proposing a 24/7 concierge service to tackle the issue, but has quoted us a price of 2,13€/m per month. Now, we live in a High Rise with 17 floors and 8 apartments per floor. If we take an average of 60m2 per apartment, this means each person will have an increase in rent of 130€ per month! So, the service costs in total 17,680€ per month (and 212,160€ per year).

My neighbors report the building used to have a concierge (but I don't believe it was 24/7), that was 35€ per apartment per month, totalling just 4,760€ per month.

All in all, this price seems very high and Akelius is notorious for being terrible* and I don't trust them. **So, my question is: for those of you with a building who has a conceirge service, what are their hours and how much per month are you paying for the service?**



*How is Akelius terrible?

I attempted to take over the lease when my roommate moved out, but they denied my application because my salary ""wasn't large enough to cover the rent comfortably for them"". They wanted the cost to be &lt;= to 40% of my salary, and I was at 40.15%. ಠ_ಠ Then, when they sent me the Nachmietvertrag, they had increased the rent per month by 75€ and not the 33€ they stated in the e-mails. When I called, they asked if I had the 33€ in writing, then called back to say ""it was the mistake of an intern."" ಠ_ಠ"

7g6fkb,21,2017-11-28,Feeling invisible at school and with a future career as a developer.,SmokyAnaconda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7g6fkb/feeling_invisible_at_school_and_with_a_future/,"I’m a junior in the last legs of my CS degree, studying at an predominantly white college. Looking around at silicon valley and the dev communities in the cities near me (NY, Boston, DC), I honestly don’t feel like I belong in this field. I’m a woman and Pacific Islander, I didn’t grow up with a Mozart-like childhood, and only started programming when I took my first CS class freshman year. I didn’t have a lot of encouragement or role models before I entered college, (my older sibling went to college for a year, got kicked out, and went back to study a liberal arts field). Despite a bumpy upbringing, I graduated in the top 5% of my high school, and now attend a school in the top 20 for CS. I do fine in my classes, so academically, I’m fine. 
 
I haven’t met a single Pacific Islander at my school other than my own sister, and women in the CS department are scarce too (something to the tune of &lt;15%). Because I’m Asian as well, I’m frequently lumped with the prodigy-Asian crowd, students who’ve been programming since they were 16 and are crazy connected. I can’t even apply to programs intended for racially underrepresented minorities since those are targeted towards Hispanic and Black students, and Pacific Islander folks are brushed over. Just talking with some of the other women in CS is pretty alienating for me, we don’t watch the same TV shows, read the same books, or have common experiences from our backgrounds. I don’t have anyone to look up to as a role model, save for maybe Melinda Gates and Sheryl Sandberg, but both those ladies are white. 

Just taking a scan across my classroom is disheartening, and I feel like me and my struggles are completely invisible. I feel capable as an engineer, but like I will never fully belong the way a white or Asian person will. I don’t think I can be happy just ignoring my background and cranking out code at a job when I graduate, yet acknowledging my race and ethnicity is incredibly difficult when there’s not a single person out there for me to look to. I’ve applied to a ton (70+) of internships, and gotten rejected from all, so that probably doesn’t help either. I’ve begun to think that CS just isn’t for me, and that I can still make a career out of non-tech roles. That’s really not what I want to do though, my dream is to work as a developer when I graduate. I just feel so swept aside and that there really isn’t a place I belong. What can I do to look forward instead of down? Is there a community out there that I can reach out to? Any other companies with jobs/internships that cater to minority students?

7g6k1s,13,2017-11-28,Matchbox Iridium,Goodbye-Blue-Monday,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7g6k1s/matchbox_iridium/,"My name is Bennett, but you can call me Will.

Open your computer and look me up on the map. Crack your fingers and type in SALEM COLORADO in big, black letters. It doesn’t matter how many Salem's there are. Once those bright letters enter your head your mind jumps to the interesting one, the historical one. 

Maybe you think about Puritans burning innocent women alive or torturing them to confess to using witchcraft. But that’s only a half-truth, 19 of them were hung at the gallows, except for Giles Corey who was crushed to death by boulders. The head of my school newspaper always told me to lay out the facts and proceed with caution. 

My name is Bennett, but you can call me Jeremy.  

I think it was a Tuesday when Salem’s radio station broadcasted there would be a blizzard in early September. It didn’t matter that the sun scorched us above a cloudless sky, 23 students wore winter coats to school that day, and they didn’t seem to mind. Then again, memory is such a fickle thing. 

I was tasked with writing an article for the school paper about the spreading of misinformation. The editor told me to lay out the facts and proceed with caution. I counted the 23 students and wrote their names down on a sheet of paper so I could back up my claim, but left them anonymous in the real article. When I was done I typed my name in big, black letters and submitted it to the head of the paper. I think I wrote Bennett but I can’t be certain.

The next morning I woke up with a horrible fever and barely got out of bed. My skin was burning at the touch and my sweat was gasoline. My mom had read an article somewhere that high schoolers were faking sick to skip class, so she took my temperature to prove it. I may have been burning hotter than any woman in Salem ever had, but the thermometer came out as a 96.5. 

By the time I got to school my hands felt a little cold so I put them in my pockets. The whole building was buzzing about the article I had written even though the paper didn’t come out until Friday. A guy named Thomas came up to me and freaked out about how he had worn a coat on a moderately sunny day. Now Thomas was a little like America before Puritans colonized it for themselves, that is—he had no reservations.

Thomas was also full of shit, because I had already counted all of the students who wore coats the day before, and he would have made it 24. 

He gave me a toothy grin. “It’s nice to see that at least someone can tell the difference between what’s real and fake anymore.” 

“Thanks man—hey, do you know where people are getting the papers from? They’re actually not supposed to be out yet.” I rubbed my hands together as the room seemed to grow colder, 

“Oh yeah,” Thomas snapped his fingers and pointed ambiguously to no apparent part of the hallway. “Right over there, don’t forget to take it easy, Will.” 

“My name is Bennett,” I said, anger rising in my throat. “You don’t have to stop fucking with me, I just need to know why. We both know you weren’t one of the 23 yesterday so just back off.” 

Thomas laughed with blank smile and spoke in a sing-song voice. “Hey man, that’s-a fine by me.” 

I stumbled down the hallway hearing fragmented conversations of people all claiming to have worn coats on Tuesday. My fever was replaced by a creeping chill in my stomach. I glanced at a forgotten newspaper lying facedown on the floor and grasped it with numb fingers. 

The front page was dated Thursday, September 26. An article by Jeremy Anderson claimed 42 students had come to school wearing winter clothes after hearing that there would be a blizzard. When I called my mom to come home because I felt cold, she told me I should’ve worn a coat. 

My name is Bennett, but you can call me Will. 

Before lunch people were talking about how Mr. Linderson had gone to a playground with a double-barrelled shotgun and held it hostage by threatening to shoot himself in front of the kiddies. When a police officer came to the scene, Mr. Linderson decided to decorate all their little backpacks with polka dots and brain matter. Everyone heard it from someone who heard it on the radio. By the time lunch was over, Linderson was taken away in handcuffs. 

You see memory can be a fickle thing. You never notice when something like it burns. Like most things in this world, it happens passively. One moment you’re occupying your time with random bullshit and before you know it, a vital part of you has fled to the unreachable chasms of your mind. But when it burns, it burns.  

I had written down the 23 names somewhere. I had written them in big, black letters on an orphaned sheet of paper. When I got home my mom was watching the local news station report that swimming star Sam Jakowitz had been awarded a student-athlete trophy. Two years ago Sam Jakowitz had practiced his diving technique off the tallest building in town and moved to Denver for medical services. 

23. Twenty Three. That was a fact. I had been taught certain things were non-negotiable. Things like a person’s name or the direction of gravity. Sometimes facts could be lost to the march of history or opinions of others but that couldn’t stop what is objectively true. It was as if one truth could still exist alongside an opposite truth for different people. If enough people had memories of something untrue, would its legitimacy be democratically cannibalized as well?

Maybe you think I was insane. So were the witches in Salem.
 
That night, I got out of bed and drove around in my underwear listening to the radio. I didn’t know what day it was and from what I could hear, neither did the announcers. My car didn’t slow down as it left the edges of town towards the dark mountain roads. “It’s gonna be a cold one.” They told me. It felt like a beautiful summer night. “We’re looking at another winter storm tonight.” A woman said cheerily. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.

Despite the world in front of me illuminated by my headlights, I had to resist what the voices said. When they told me that all roads exiting town were closed, I almost saw road workers in my peripherals. When they said a warrant was set for my arrest, blue and red lights danced behind me.   

I drove for three more hours before I ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere. I was inside my car, staring at the road ahead of me when they found me. They took me back to SALEM COLORADO in big, black letters where I was put directly in the hospital. Apparently, I was off my meds. I never had any. 

I stayed in the hospital for five days, even though there were Christmas lights when I got out. Five days can get awfully boring, so I was given a radio to keep myself entertained. For a while, all I could say was that my name was Bennett, but doctors eventually got to me. 

Every day a cheerful nurse would come in and greet me by a different name. Sometimes Garrett, sometimes Joey, but never Bennett. One day when it was snowing outside, Thomas came over to lift my spirits. 

He entered with a small piece of paper and dropped it on my lap without saying a word. The writing was sloppy and uneven, but it was unmistakably mine. On it contained the list of names I used for my article in the school paper. 

There were 42 names in total. 

It was that day that I was cured of my affliction. It didn’t matter what people called me. I had got so caught up in details that didn’t matter to me or anyone else. People love to spout on and on about the capital t truth, but in the real world, most of us are happier when that truth is what we make of it. Because as far as I can tell, this world seems real enough to me. 

My name is Bennett, but it doesn’t matter what my name is. 

One thing I’ve noticed about this subreddit is that people love what seems the most real. Stories that immerse the reader in a world they think they are unfamiliar with. View your memories on film reel and convince yourself that what you know is the real truth. And when one memory doesn’t agree with the rest, light a match and burn it at the stake. 

So go ahead, open your computer and look me up on the map. Try to disprove me, and don’t forget to cite your sources. 

When I got back to school there was little fanfare, since I was only gone for the weekend. It didn’t matter, the local radio station had offered me an internship, and it’s always good to get experience. 

After class, the editor of the paper came to me about how things in town have been going crazy. He said that no one has left town in months and that all communication outside of Salem had gone silent. When he looked in my eyes, he was speaking to Bennett. 

Lay out the facts. 

Maybe he was right, but so was everyone else, so where did that leave him? I just smiled and told him the same thing people around town always say in a sweet, sing-song voice. 

 “Hey man, that’s-a fine by me.”

I'm going to finish my CS in about 3 months. I've been studying game development for the entire time (C#), I also had some JavaSE and a project made in JavaEE/JSF. I've decided I want to move out to different country and this lead me to leave game development as it's way harder to live off it. Since I have some basic understanding and experience in web app development, I thought this would be a good path for now. So as I'm nearly done with my bsc CS degree, and only had short intern as game programmer with C++. I'm trying to find Java intern to get more proffesional experience before leaving the country, but having no experience kinda make it harder to find anything.
**TL;DR** So my question is, would I end up better picking up offer from company **A** (huge company) that offers programming intership in any language so I could possibly pick Java, and no field specified or company **B** (company counting few people) that uses .NET/ASP and might offer higher salary than company A. The salary is not important for me, all I want is experience so it would be easier to get Java webdev(or any Java) job when I move out."

So anytime I make a change on one computer it is saved in dropbox so they have the same versions of everything.

I've noticed a weird overwriting issue happening every now and then, and can't actually figure out why/how it's happening - So I'm looking for a better way to code seamlessly without any hiccups. The company I work for is also talking about hiring a developer intern, so I'd need to be able to add people to projects easily if possible.

I know if I got rid of prepros, it'd take away one less step in the saving process - and maybe stop the weird overwriting error from happening? But I really don't want to, I love it a lot. I just don't know if it plays well with others.

Looking for any and all suggestions here!"
7g7po4,1,2017-11-28,How is the job market for engineers in San Diego?,AlchemicHickey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7g7po4/how_is_the_job_market_for_engineers_in_san_diego/,"For 6 months I have been struggling at finding a full-time job in my field. 
I get interviews and often make it passed the first/second rounds but there are just way more people with civil engineering degrees than there are jobs so the competition is just very stiff. On top of that I probably get edged out because I live about 50 miles from a bustling california metropolitan area where most of the opportunities are. 


It is close enough that I can get interviews but not close enough that I can easily schedule informational interviews and become a regular at meetup events to the point where I can make some friends who can really vouch for my skills and experiences and take advantage of networking. 



I tried applying to positions all over the US, technician/engineering tech positions, data entry, branching out beyond civil engineering, mock interviews, etc. The only thing I haven’t tried is moving to a new city. 
Luckily, I have a cousin who lives in San Diego and he says I can live with him rent free the first month provide that I pay him back in a year, and help keep the apartment clean. His girlfriend's brother took a year to find a job in Chemical Engineering. I have enough money saved up for 3 months worth of living expenses, including rent. I know I will be able to find some survival job within 4 months. Meanwhile I can schedule informational interviews, apply to engineering positions, and start building lifelong friends in the area.  


On the other hand, I have never had an interview in the San Diego area. They have all been in LA, and Orange County, with a couple in riverside. Even the one internship I have was in the OC. I don’t want to waste a ton of time and money investing in San Diego only to find out there are zero opportunities and I need to move again. 


TLDR: People living in San Diego who work as Engineers (Mechanical, Civil, Industrial, Chemical, Aero) or know someone who works as an engineer in that area what is the job market like in the area? Did you or they really struggle to find a job in the area or was it an almost effortless process? About how long did it take to find that job? Will I even need to work full-time or will it happen fast enough that a part-time job will sustain me to the offer?

I've only recently realized the matter of trying to get a SWE internship this summer and how important experience like that could look on a resume for my future career. From what I can gather as of now when trying to develop a resume is that I'm not sure if I have remotely enough to even warrant trying for an internship. I have one decent project that I'm almost done with as part of a class and a good gpa but I'm not sure if that's enough. I'm also really only comfortable using Java. Not really sure what I'm going for with this post mostly just looking for direction on where to proceed. Should I focus on developing my skills by learning a new language or work on a project in Java. There's also the matter of learning about the types of technical questions friends have been asked in interviews and most of those seem very hard and I could also just focus on studying for those. At the same time as doing this I could shoot my shot and try and apply for summer internships but I don't think I would have much success. My immediate concern here is how much time I have left until most companies have completed their hiring and my odds are even lower. Sorry for the long post mostly just pouring my thoughts out to get some advice.

Currently, I've landed a Data Science Intern at Boeing that pays fairly well, but am wondering if this opportunity would be as beneficial as a summer research position doing data analysis and machine learning. I only ask this because I have heard in order to become a full time data scientist a PhD is very useful and research is a good way to get into a PhD program, whereas an internship is not. I would like to know, that with this considered, would the internship still be more beneficial to become a data scientist than research?

Also, in case this is important I am already doing part time data analysis and machine learning research. Although, the opportunity to do it full time in the summer would lead to much more interesting and complex research projects."

I don't know if many of you will read through this, I would like to hope some people will. 

Ever since I was in sixth grade, I have been somebody who is mentally off. I would ponder about religion, about how I couldn't understand where the ""god"" I was told to believe in came from, about how I didn't believe that ""god"" existed, about how I yearned to know what would happen to people after death. 

In seventh grade, my life gained some stability. I had one steady friend I would socialize with at school. For whatever reason, to other kids I felt like I was an odd one out, and was often treated as such. However, this was one of the few instances in my life where I can recall a stable household life. The one kid I found friendship with at the time received a multi-month suspension from school. I underwent a deep depression, likely because I had no friends. I felt alone. Everyday before school, I would beg to be homeschooled, kick and cry like a toddler, and think about how my deepest desire was my death. Eventually this passed, however the overall depressed feeling didn't. 

In eighth grade, I had an alright year. I feel like eighth grade is when I had my final period where I was truly blissfully happy at times despite my depression. In April of my eighth grade year, my family and I took a vacation together to visit my brother. I would say this is my last happy memory. 

In early ninth grade, my mother disappeared for a extended period of time, and ever since then, I can't say she has been my mother. The most helpful things she has done for me since that time was pick me up from school or buy me fast food after school, when I would often feel empty. She became a raging alcoholic. She was no longer somebody I could have laughs with, confide in, or relate to. She was always belligerently drunk and incoherent after my ninth grade year. I remember this year, I entered a depression much similar to my seventh grade year. 

My father and I have always had a very complicated relationship. I unquestionably love this man to death and he is the most important individual in my life. Throughout my middle school and high school years, I did have tendencies to act like a spoiled child, because despite my unhappy home life, I did have a tendency to always get the material things I desired. However people have validated that I do not appear to be as spoiled, or behave as spoiled, as my father often accused me of. Throughout high school, My Dad would often emotionally harass me. I do not feel as though he realized it. There were times when I was at my emotional lows, and he would bother to do nothing in terms of emotional support but drag me down further through insults and harassment, and there were times I felt alright, and he would come home and ruin it. 

Despite my emotional struggles throughout high school, my Father never failed to be there for me, in a financial sense. 

In high school, I spent most of my evenings and weekends pathetically lonely. I had three close friends, maybe four, however I didn't truly relate to these people, and at times when reflecting I feel like the main reason I may have decided to spend time around some of these individuals was my lack of options in my social life. Towards the end of my high school career, I held a solid GPA of around a 3.6 and performed well on the SAT. My Father and I began discussing college. I realized that I wanted to go away to a large university that was a reasonable distance away. I wanted to be at a university where I didn't feel like everyone knew everyone, like they do in high school. I wanted to be at a university that put me in a completely new location, where I wouldn't have to deal with the lurking empty memories and emotions I associated with my hometown and high school. 

And as I stated before, my father, when it comes to things I ask for, rarely fails. I found myself getting accepted into a relatively good school that was out of state but not ridiculously expensive. 

One thing that always bothered me in high school was my lack of social life, sex life, and the fact I had never had a girl friend. In the beginning of my freshman year of college, I quickly entered my first relationship. It was really fun at first, and should have been a fling, but lasted way too long, resulted in me not developing a lot of friendships in the beginning of college, and ultimately left me feeling awful. I did learn a lot from this experience. After that relationship, I did go on to make several good friends at my university I feel that I truly relate to.

I would like to say, that currently, I am a engineering major. I major in both mining and civil engineering, and am on a rigid five year path to receive dual degrees. Exiting high school I realized I have no idea what I wanted to do as an adult in terms of a career, so I decided to study engineering as I knew it was something that often resulted in solid salaries with high employment rates. Due to starting off slightly behind the average engineer, I was a semester behind. I realized I had excellent grades at the end of my freshman year, no internship, no true friends back home, and not much to return home to, so I decided to go to school during the summer. While I successfully put myself ontrack with other engineers during the summer, I reached one of my low points of my life. I found myself alone, for extended periods of time, with nothing to do but sit myself down and study complex science and mathematics. This was the first time in my life I felt truly suicidal. I was able to pull through, getting B's in every course I took in the summer, heading in to my second fall semester with a overall gpa of a 3.68. 

This semester, I was slated to take 18 credit hours however I decided to only take fifteen. I am currently enrolled in a engineering course called statics. There are four sections of statics taught this semester where I attend university, and by chance I ended up getting one of the worst professors at the university for statics. Firstly, I will say that after being in school, busting my ass, for a consecutive year, my effort has taken a dip, however this dip has not been significant. Due to my professor, and the toll in my effort, I am now borderline between a D and C in statics, more likely to get a D than I am a C. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. 

I feel obligated to due well and excel in school as my father pays for my education. This semester I have been careless with his money and spent a good bit more then I should have. However I have been upfront with him about my lapse of effort, my spending habits, my feeling of being worn out after so many consecutive semesters of difficult material in school. He is very understanding of my struggles and tells me all he wants is to see me relax, to see me be happy and enjoy my youth and find myself and take things slow. But his words don't prevent me from feeling like a failure.

If I am to fail statics, this means I will either have to become a six year student to receive to undergraduate degrees, neither of which really interest me, especially the mining degree, which brings me a ton of financial aid. It is difficult for me to change majors, as my tuition would go up drastically and I could potentially loose scholarships. Switching schools is also extremely difficult, as few schools would give me the same financial package that this school gives me. If I were to return home, I would get a decent amount of money in scholarships, but I would return to a place full of bad memories where I have little friends. The alternate to a sixth year as an undergraduate is to go to school another summer, and given the location of my school, it is relatively remote here in the summers. I simply do not think I have another summer semester of school in me. I also strive for internships, so I can make myself a valuable employee, despite the fact I know I likely will not find myself enjoying them. 

Even if my current worry is not statics, it would be something else. I constantly am a unhappy, suicidal person. I have had counselors on and off since I was in sixth grade. I have taken antidepressants. I have expanded my social life. I have tried a lot to improve my social life. 

I do not want to be a student, studying two undergraduate degrees, one of which I really simply don't give a fuck about, for six years. I don't want to spend another summer, in the middle of no where, studying every god damn fucking day. I do not want to return home, where I have empty sad memories. I do not want to pursue internships, in a field where I find myself with zero interest. 

I understand that there are kids starving in Africa. I understand there are kids with awful childhoods much worse then mind where there are both emotional and financial struggles. I understand I am much more well off and spoiled then some other kids. 

However I simply feel very little happiness. I've done the things you are supposed to do. Go to counseling, branch out, exercise, try anti depressants. I don't see purpose in my life. I constantly feel over whelming depression, anger, anxiety, and difficulty moving forward. I constantly see myself as someone who isn't enough. I constantly have visions of myself tieing a noose, jumping off a bridge, loading a gun and saying my goodbye to the world. I just truly don't want to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to go home. I don't want to be a student anymore. I don't want to complain anymore. I don't want to study anymore. I don't want to wake up anymore. I know life is hard, I know life gets much harder then getting a D in college. Maybe life just isn't for me, maybe I am just not built for life. I don't have an abundance of friends, I've never really had a true girl friend. If I had a handgun, I would load it with a sense of euphoria and end my life in this moment. I feel like I simply wasn't mean't to be, wasn't cut out for life."

My stats are 3.6 UW 4.8 W. Only Honors and APs except for P.E and Chem 1 Sophomore year, Schedule could only allow for 2 more APs than I have taken than I have taken, but one would have to be during football practice.

Won and placed in school wide competitions over last couple of years. Tutoring through Mu Alpha Theta, NHS, Social Justice Club, and non profit started by student in my grade. 

Didn't talk that much about it. Should I submit another update on supplement page talking about tutoring experience and tying it back to essay I wrote about improving education? I am calling Harvard in like 3-4 hours to ask if my updates will be considered which I assume they are, counselor recommended doing so anyway to show interest and make them look again. Also talked about my personal creative writing and submitted a flash fiction I wrote as the alumni who interviewed me advised me to do. Interview went really well, guy was smiling the whole time, no awkwardness, I for sure got only good comments. On app and interview I overall presented an image of a socially mindful individual. My GPA obviously isn't great, but transcript shows significant improvement. Please address whether or not you think my URM status as both black and Haitian will contribute. 

Also chance me for these schools if you can and recommend any others to apply to. Columbia Cornell Johns hopkins Notre Dame UPenn Vanderbilt as reaches. NYU, UM, and UF as matches. I have no safeties at the moment, but will probably apply to nonselective state school. Thinking about Mcdermott scholarship at UTD so chance me for that if you are familiar.

After that I've never had anyone, not my mom or dad not my brother or friends, notice and aknowledge how bad I've felt and talk to me about it or even just hug and hold me. Not a single time when I was having a meltdown or anxiety attack or when I've wanted to kill myself. In part because I have no one to talk to either, but from what I've read from online sources it sounds like being consoled is pretty common? Like having people notice when you're not doing so good and act on it is something that totally happens in real life? Even just having more experienced people give advice or mentor you is something I haven't experienced much. Guidance, I guess. Literally the only time anyone has taken the time to properly teach me anything was an acquaintance teaching me to play dota so I could play with them. I played for the company until I got sick of the game and now no one plays anything with me because I don't want to play dota.

I'm sick of making constant efforts all by myself (regarding getting some help with my mental health - no one's ever offered to help nor ask about it and for years I convinced myself I was imagining things, trying to be a special snowflake or something) and they're not even paying off very much. I hate being this envious of everyone I hear from, it sounds like things just fall in my friend's lap without her trying all that much and she is able to enjoy that too because she isn't a depressed, socially anxious mess like me. She is able to see things she wants to achieve in life and she can be excited just about everything. She's planning for her dream job and she talks of ways of getting prettier and she has roommates she instantly clicked with. The only roommates I've ever had avoided me and never talked to me. ALthough I suppose eventually I mirrored that right back at them. For me, this friend I mentioned is the only person who even talks to me frequently. And she seems uncomfortable to talk about my depression or offer any support, not that I can blame her very much but I always offer her every support she's asked for and humored all her more weighty conversation topics that I realized were such.
 
Most every day for me is trying to convince myself I don't have enough reason to kill myself yet and that there might be something to look forward to once I start therapy. I can't enjoy almost anything I used to love and I have no one or nothing to spend my days with, other than the vortex of depressive and anxious thoughts that make up most of my inner dialogue. I have no dreams to pursue and I'm probably unemployable. I barely even have items I want. I've never had a job other than one internship that was arranged for me, despite my best efforts at summerjob hunting for the last three or so years. I think the only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet is because I know for a fact that it would either cripple me to a point where I'll be unable to attempt again or to where I'm unable to get help in which case I suppose I would still die but it would be out of dehydration or hunger instead. Or else I'd succeed without anyone even knowing I was contemplating it and then they'd find out in maybe a month or two from now if even then because that's how much contact I have with people. Well, I also never want to do that to my brother because I care about him but his mental health can't be the sole reason for my continued existence when it's like this most of the time. I wish I was a robot so I could turn myself off but no one would have to be very sad because it's always possible to turn me back on, at least in theory. I'm so tired and I feel broken and I wish I could've been the boringly average, mostly happy kid instead. As things are, killing myself is the only future I can see unless I get ""lucky"" and die of something else before I do it myself. I don't think I've told that to anyone before, and I've only told a psychologist about the occasional suicidal thoughts.

Thanks to any who read through all this and I'm sorry it was so whiny. I have no one to talk to as I've found out this last year, and needed to get these things out even if it is to internet strangers. Also, I'm not about to kill myself today but this felt too suicide-related for the depression subreddit."

I'd like to be able to develop locally and then push to that server. Now my real concerns are the database, plugins and media files. How do we keep those the same across the board? Do I just have to put the entire wordpress install into the repository and use some sort of tool like wp migrate pro for the database?

7ges7g,3,2017-11-29,What are the best arguments when negotiating a raise?,wamp_that_puck,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ges7g/what_are_the_best_arguments_when_negotiating_a/,"Quick background:

I work at a major hospital in the US. My department aids in commercializing research at the hospital, providing entrepreneurial consulting for doctors/scientists seeking to move their inventions out of the hospital by forming a company/licensing the technology. This is my first job out of school, and I've been working here for a little over a year. I graduated in June 2016 with a degree in economics &amp; mathematics from a top university.

I have become more and more enamored with my work and have decided that I want to stay for at least another year or two before I eventually go back to school for a Master's/PhD. The hospital is connected to a number of universities in the area, and affiliated with a top medical school. I hope to leverage the connections I’ve made, to help in the application process.

Because I love the job so much, and because of the inroads I’ve made with the academic community, I have been willing to ignore the fact that I am not paid very well. 

It took me a while to secure an offer, and so when I got this one, I basically accepted the terms on the spot. I was, and still am, very naive when it comes to negotiating pay. 

I am currently earning $15/hr. The hospital is in a city where that doesn't go very far, and I have had to work a number of side jobs at restaurants &amp; bars. I am basically living paycheck to paycheck and it has begun to affect my mental &amp; physical wellbeing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyways, I was told earlier this week that I am in line for a significant raise (30%), salaried, and new title, based on my performance over the last year.

The raise would increase my salary to ~42k.

The title will most likely be ""Data Analyst"". I have ~3 years of experience in the field (2 while at school as an intern statistician, and 1 in my current position).

I am wondering how I can best negotiate that raise to be higher. Based on my degree and what the going rate is for similar jobs in the city, I believe that I should earn at least $55-60k.

What are the best ways that I can demonstrate to my boss that I deserve this higher pay?"
7gf0le,13,2017-11-29,Just got a very unexpected full-time offer...and now I'm between a rock and a hard place. Help me weigh my options?,dunnowhichtochoose77,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7gf0le/just_got_a_very_unexpected_fulltime_offerand_now/,"Hey guys. So I am graduating this May with a Computer Science degree. I had an internship (Company A) this past summer and was expecting a full-time offer from them, but was told in October there was no full-time spots for any of the interns. So I got on my interview and job hunt grind.

I got a pretty good offer Company B in the NJ area that I was planning on accepting. But then today, I suddenly got a call from the head of the Technology program at Company A saying that he fought really hard for me to get an offer since they really wanted me and that ended up increasing the headcount and extended me an offer. So now...I have a tough decision to make. Here are the stats:

Company A (place I interned at):

* Salary: $77k base
* Bonus/Raises: $10k signing, annual bonus and raises depends on team
* Program details: Great opportunities to grow and learn new technologies (big data, machine learning, etc) with two rotations on different teams
* PTO: 21 days
* Commute: 40-45 minutes, no tolls

Company B

* Salary: $75k base
* Bonus/Raises: $3k signing, 8% annual company performance bonus, and $8000 max individual performance bonus
* Program details: No rotations, 18 months before getting placed. It's a cellular company, so I don't expect anything exactly cutting edge. 
* PTO: 18 days
* Commute: 50-65 minutes, toll roads

Objectively, Company A's offer is better for so many reasons. But I have some issues with working there. Would it be stupid for me to accept an offer from a company that denied me a few weeks back? Or should I see it as a positive that I was fought for? 

And my second concern is my resume. I interned at Company A for the past two summers. So when/if I were to move on with my career, my only experience would be with that company. Whereas with Company B, I'll have more variety on my resume. Both companies are well-known. How much would this hurt me, if much at all?

Really stuck here. Any advice?

I am a junior in aerospace engineering, and I sent out a ton of applications to various places at the beginning of this semester. From prior experience, I know that this process takes a really long time in engineering compared to other fields, so I wasn't expecting to hear back from many places until after the new year. However, I did get an offer about a month ago from a federal position that I applied for pretty early on. The pay is very competitive as far as engineering internships go, and I've never had an internship before, so I took the offer because they wanted my answer by the following day.

At this point, I've submitted all my paperwork for my background check and security clearance, but I haven't signed an employment contract. The offer was an email that specifically stated that I had been ""tentatively selected"", and my only form of commitment so far has been a reply to that email. I haven't looked into whether this officially locks me into the position, but I'm guessing it probably doesn't because (a) the facility is in an at-will employment state (not sure what that means for a federal position though), and (b) the ""tentatively selected"" wording makes me think that my official offer is contingent on my security clearance coming in.

Fast forward to today: this is where it gets interesting. I got an email today telling me that I landed an interview with a huge private-sector government contractor that I would really like to work at. Their internships are highly sought-after, extremely competitive, and really good experience, so I was very pleasantly surprised to even get an interview. I agreed to take the interview, which is next week, because worst case scenario I can turn the position down if I actually end up getting an offer. However, I would much rather withdraw from the federal position if possible because the private-sector job aligns much more closely with what I'd like to do in my career, and I would get more pertinent experience for the kind of position that I want to go into when I go full-time.

About 20 minutes after I emailed back confirming the interview, I got an email from the federal agency telling me that I need to travel out of state to do some pre-employment appointments at one of their facilities. They scheduled the appointments for the second week in January, so I've got a bit of time to make arrangements, but as far as I can tell, this is the last step before I fully sign on for the position. They're also reimbursing me for travel, so I feel that if I decide to withdraw, then out of courtesy I need to do it before I go to the appointments and cost them a lot of money in travel expenses, HR time, etc.

Like I said before, my interview for the private-sector position is in a week, and I have no clue how long it will take them to get back to me with a decision. So that leaves almost exactly a month between my interview for the private-sector position that I would much rather take, and what I'm considering the ""point of no return"" for the federal position that would still be decent experience and good pay, but wouldn't be as good for my career goals as the other position.

So my question really is, what's the etiquette for a situation like this?
Should I treat my ""tentative"" commitment as a full-on employment contract, or would it be okay to withdraw if I get an offer for the private-sector position?
Also, am I right in assuming that it would be pretty bad to withdraw after going out of state for the pre-screening appointments, and that I should decide what I'm going to do before then?
I've only had low-paying part-time jobs before, so this is really my first experience with this ""big-ticket"" type job-seeking, and I would appreciate any advice or insight.

**TL;DR: I ""tentatively"" committed to a federal internship that I was offered (haven't signed a contract), but now I have an interview for a really good private-sector internship in the same field. The private-sector position would almost definitely be better experience for my career goals because of the kind of work I would be doing, but I don't know if I'll get an offer before it's ""too late to withdraw"" from the federal position. I also don't know when ""too late"" is besides after I sign an actual employment contract. Any advice on how to approach this situation?**"

7ggs4j,0,2017-11-29,Desperately Need some advice on transferring to the uW.,PTTruTH,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/7ggs4j/desperately_need_some_advice_on_transferring_to/,"Hey everyone, this might take a giant wall of text to explain but I really need some answers here from people already at the UW. I'm currently a 3rd semester Computer Science Major at Syracuse University. When I applied for college last year, I applied for direct admission into the Computer Science program at UW, but unfortunately was not admitted. Syracuse was a second choice for me so I decided to come out here to New York to major in Computer Science. However, last summer I applied as a transfer student as a Computer Science/Pre-Engineering student and was accepted. Unfortunately, I know that the Paul Allen school for Comp Sci doesn't take applications for winter quarters. Therefore, I would have to apply to the major itself once I started next January. Now I've heard a lot of people talk about how Comp Sci is an extremely hard program to be admitted to at UW, so I'm very conflicted on what I should do. I'm already almost half-way through the program here at Syracuse and am slated to take intensive Comp Sci courses next semester. The problem is I know since I wouldn't be a Comp Sci major at until I actually got into the program, I probably won't be able to take those kinds of classes as a Pre-Engineering student. I'm mainly worried that I wouldn't be able to get into the Paul Allen school and will be stuck with a major I'm not really interested in. As far as my chances are concerned. My GPA coming out of high-school was around a 3.4, which obviously wasn't enough to gain admittance in the first place. However, up until this point at Syracuse, I should have around a cumulative of 3.7 - 3.8. I won't know for sure until after Finals of course, but I finished my freshman year with a 3.86. Ontop of this, I just got an offer for a 10 week internship in the TAP program at JPMorgan Chase for this summer. However, I'm also worried how transferring might affect my ability to actually take it. The description says you must be a Comp Sci major - now knowing that I won't be one for next quarter makes me think this could cause issues. I'm also seeing now that the internship starts possibly right before finals week in the beginning of June 2018. After taking all this into consideration, I'm thinking of staying at Syracuse as it's most certainly simpler logistically. I've always wanted to go to the UW, but I'm really not sure if it'll be worth it in this situation I'm in.

I'm really not sure what to do here. Really, any advice would be incredibly appreciated.

7ggy08,7,2017-11-29,European wants to know admission chances for US Psychology Grad School,ClinEurUs,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7ggy08/european_wants_to_know_admission_chances_for_us/,"I will be moving to the U.S from Europe soon and I hope to apply for some Clinical Psychology programmes. Ideally, I would eventually like to end up as a practicing clinician in a forensic setting. I haven’t taken any GRE exams yet so I’m wondering how strong my application would be apart from these. I know they are a huge part of the application but first I want to find out if the rest of my skills/experience make me a reasonably competitive candidate. 

It doesn’t come naturally to me to talk about my skills/achievements so sorry if I come across badly! Here’s a bit about me:

* Undergraduate degree: Major in philosophy, minor in psychology. 
* Masters degree: philosophy (thesis relating to philosophy of cognitive science)
* Psychology degree: the one I did is known in the UK as a ‘conversion course’. It is equivalent to an undergraduate degree in psychology in every way including accreditation (but it is condensed into a shorter time period and is only available to people who already have an undergraduate degree). I did this in the top university in my country, graduated second in my class. 
* GPA (using online calculator): 3.88 
* Currently: in my 3rd year of a 4 year Ph.D in cognitive neuroscience. 

[To anyone unfamiliar with the European system (or at least the system in my country), to become a clinical psychologist you need to do a particular professional doctorate degree (e.g. a D.Clin), whereas a Ph.D in my country is only concerned with research and cannot qualify you to be a practicing clinical psychologist. That’s why there is a need for me to do a second doctoral degree.]

* Hope to submit my thesis next year
* 3 first author publications
* I have presented my research at national and international conferences
* I have also worked as a research assistant in two different labs (one a cognitive psychology lab, one a cognitive neuroscience lab). 
* I did an additional part time degree in statistics 
* I have received academic scholarships and awards (one fully covering the cost of my Masters tuition)
* I have been on psychology/neuroscience student committees, was editor of a national student-run psychology journal, and a neuroscience journal in my university
* I have also done a fair amount of copy-editing and peer reviewing for undergraduate/student-run journals.
* Teaching experience: I was a teaching assistant during my Masters, I have worked as an research skills tutor for undergraduate psychology students, as well as a teaching assistant for statistics for both undergraduate and postgraduate students in psychology.
* Letters of recommendation: I can get three strong letters from people who have supervised my research at various levels. 

My main concerns are these:

1. Will I come across as odd and lacking direction because I would already have a Ph.D while applying for another Ph.D position? (I know in general two Ph.Ds is a big no-no, but I would require a clinically focused doctoral degree as opposed to my purely research-based one in my country).

2. Will the people reviewing my application look badly upon the fact that my psychology degree isn’t a B.A, B.Sc, etc.? It is completely equivalent to an undergraduate degree in psychology and contains all of the necessary subjects, etc.

3. Is my GPA high enough? I don’t necessarily need to apply to top-tier schools. 

4. I lack experience in clinical settings, e.g. volunteer placements and internships (I have done some work with homeless people, elderly people, and health-based charities but nothing substantial with a psychological patient population, or with a forensic population which I would eventually like to get into as a career). Is this bad? I still have time to improve on this.

5. Final question: based on the above information, what tier of university might be suitable for me to apply to realistically? Obviously I know this will depend on department interests, my GRE, etc. as well.

**If anyone read all of that, thank you so much, I know it was very long! Thanks so much for any help you can give me.**

I'm a sophomore at a decent state college. I was studying EE and just switched into Computer engineering because i realized i wanted to be a software engineer. I was wondering if transferring as a junior transfer into EECS at berkeley is worth the $60k/year considering I only pay $10k/year at my in state college (scholarships, in state tuition) if I even get in. I have a 3.6 GPA, 4 (college) internships, and some projects/extracurriculars. I was told Berkeley hardly accepts any transfers outside of California so I was worried about that as well.

Max of $600. Would definitely prefer $550 or less. USA.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Battery life doesn't matter so long as it can get at least 6 hours with moderate use (browsing and streaming). Would prefer 8, however. Beyond that, I know I need at least 6gb RAM just from experience with my current computer (HP ENVY Touchsmart) 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Please, less than 6 pounds. My current laptop is 5.6 and I would love for the new one to be less than that. But I will take a 5lb. laptop with good specs and battery life over a lighter one without.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Somewhere between 13 and 16 is ideal (12.5""-15.6"")

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
I often stream while working on multiple tabs, so I would need to be able to do the same. Some light gaming. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
The only games I play are CIV5 and Sims 4. Sims 4 is fine at medium settings, I have no idea what settings are even available to me for CIV5. I consider myself to be an incredibly casual player, so the settings on CIV don't matter too much.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I would prefer non-touch with a decent mousepad and keyboard. But if there's a 2in1 out there that's absolute awe-inspiring, throw it at me. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I'm a student teacher doing my internship next semester, which means lots of lesson planning and creating/collecting classroom materials. I mostly use GoogleDocs, but I may also decide to add Word/PWPT/Excel. I usually have quite a few tabs open and I stream often. I know I mentioned gaming earlier, but I thought I would clarify that I prioritize being able to stream and be productive over the Sims 4 (and I value Sims4 over CIV5, so if something isn't able to play CIV it's not a deal breaker).
I will plan to take this computer with me to teach English in South Korea next year, so something sturdy (really just non-delicate) would be appreciated. 

Also thank you for your help, I'm in way over my head here. "

My official title is Software Developer/Technical consultant Intern. I was recommended for this job by a teacher at a community college I was attending at the time. I've been here for roughly 7 months now and I'm confused about how much work I'm actually doing as an intern.

Some of the work has included building a small website that we use in house to track some of our VPS, and our VPN services. This includes building the entire front-end, back-end, and the database for the website. I'm currently managing all of the companies VPS's and keeping track of nearly all of our VPN's. I'm working right now on a older client that someone who worked for this company before wrote, and trying to get it working for a project that we're finishing up. The client is written in C# which I have no experience in. I'm also in the process of rewriting this client in python. I'm also trying to spearhead a project to automate some of our checking on our VPS's, like reading logs among other things. Just a few days ago I've found out that I'm now going to be teaching some new interns about some of our practices and teaching them how to set up a VPS/VPN combo.

I also want to mention that this company I work for is split into two parts afaik, a more ""training"" side, and a technical services side. Our entire team for working on all of the technical stuff consists of the CEO, 2 part-time employees, and 3 part-time interns (possibly more interns soon). I'm currently the only person on this team who knows programming well. Mostly everyone else is network/server knowledge. We've lost two employees in the last year, one of which was an intern.

 I consider myself pretty good with programming, as I feel I have moderate knowledge of Python, Java, and a couple of web dev tech, like node.js, css/html. I'm currently in my 4th year of college, I've been taking classes slowly and I'm about to transfer into a college this spring to finish the last two years of my Bachelors degree. The only programming classes I've taken are intro to programming and intermediate (both in Java). I've taught myself mostly everything else. I feel that the amount of work and/or the way this company is set up must have something wrong. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Am I actually doing Intern level work for this company? 

I do get to work from home, with occasionally having meetings in person once or twice a week. I'm currently being paid $20/hr.

Any advice? "

I'm going into the program starting Winter 2018 quarter and I was wondering if I could get some thoughts on my planned schedule? And maybe some advice on whether my class pairings are too difficult or if there's a better way to pair them? Is 3 classes over the summer do-able?

I'd like to take Parallel Programming and Mobile &amp; Cloud as my electives because they seem to be the most relevant to getting a job and also I've seen a bunch of people on here say 352-UX is a waste of a class, haven't heard much about 373-DADA or 464-Open Source other than a couple people saying they were easy, a couple people saying they were a waste, and I heard 464 might no longer be offered?

I also figured if I do it this way then I'd be graduating in the spring when new grads are getting hired. And hopefully the 1.5 year track has time for me to get an internship. I'm also ok with doing the 2 year track if I need to.

Problem is that QA is not at all what I want to do. I’ve always wanted to go into software/web development but struggled to find position coming out of school and had an internship doing QA so I found a position quickly doing that. I figured it would be a good segway and allow me some time to learn and hone my skills.

I’m pretty miserable at work currently, I work a lot of hours, hate having to do manual testing or writing automated testing scripts or any testing in general, and any sort of development work i’ve done to improve processes for our team have gone unnoticed. I’m really apathetic towards my job now and do whatever I can to make any time for myself to work on side projects and learn more software development skills. 

I’ve been applying and interviewing for Web/Software development jobs for a little while now, but I either don’t even land and interview or get rejected during the interview process. I don’t think i’m unqualified. Overall think that my side projects are impressive and my knowledge in the main technologies for the jobs i’m applying for is great. 

I’ve come to a point where I feel like quitting my current job and instead use all the time it opens up to commit myself to full-time interviewing/open-source contribution/projects/free-lancing. I’ve been told by multiple people that it’s a bad idea and that I should just stick it out at my current job until I find another one. Am I wrong for thinking that I’d be better off committing myself to building my own brand and landing a job that I want? 

I think it’s also important to mention that there isn’t really a great opportunity or timeline to move into a software development position here coupled with the fact that the culture isn’t very good.

So I guess my question is, would I be completely shooting myself in the foot leaving my job at a fairly prestigious company to work full time on landing a position where i really want to be?"

I liked working there and the offer is very generous and hard to turn down, but I do not want to be doing driver development for the rest of my career.

I have research experience working on parallel algorithms and scientific computing, and have found that I like working on those types of problems more than driver development.

Offer:

- Salary: 120k base

- Bonus: 18k signing, 13k 1 year anniversary, 7k stock

- Details: Would be working on a driver with heavily abstracted meta C code that resembles it's own language.


Pros:

- Generous offer from well known company

- Familiar work environment, I liked working there

Cons:

- Worried that I will spend a lot of time learning this meta C language that may not be applicable to future jobs

- Don't want to be stuck doing systems software for rest of career/want more variety on my resume

- Don't enjoy system's software as much as other things I've worked on (but I don't dislike it)

To introduce myself, I'm a freshly graduated student in CS and have to move aboard (Canada) for my first job. I already did an internship in this company earlier in the year but after it, the conclusion was that my social skills aren't good in English. Even in my native language (French), I'm have difficulty to speak to others, so in English, it is worse haha. During this internship I tried time to time to get socialized but I find it very hard, and didn't get any friend (but I have the chance to be with my bf so I was not too lonely, he was also very considerate). At the end of it, my manager kindly suggested that next time, I should try to speak more to the others. I am not very comfortable when being with people (afraid of language mistakes or being judged), I guess I have some kind of social anxiety.

I'm eager to improve myself this time, be more confident with my team members and maybe make some friends (not necessarily at work). Would you please have some advice or feedback from similar experiences?"

If I drop my classes next semester to focus on the internship, I will have to wait a full year before taking MA classes again because they are not available every semester. This won't be a problem if I'm offered an extension. But I'm fucked if they don't give me an extension.

Uber is offering 44/hour with a 1k/month housing stipend in San Fran (pretty low considering rent in SF). IMC is offering 8500/month (~53/hour) with amazing corporate housing in Chicago. I'm not sure which one to take since Uber would look great on my resume to all recruiters whereas IMC would look great to top tier recruiters but others might not have heard of it as it's a small proprietary trading firm. Uber is in SF which is where I want to end up but IMC is paying so much more. 

Which choice would be better for my career overall if I want to eventually end up back in tech in San Fran?

Thanks "

I study CS and math and am graduating (perhaps to my own doom) in 3 years. I unfortunately only have 2 research experiences, and could do another if I stay another year, but would prefer not to.

Grades: 4.0/4.0. Took multiple graduate classes in ML.

Research: 2 years with one professor in NLP, 1 year with another doing undergraduate thesis in reinforcement learning. No publications though............ yeah. My thesis and the paper for the group I've been with for 2 years will be both published at the end of the year (if all goes to plan).

GRE: 169/157/4.5 for Q/V/W.

Recommendations: 1 strong, 2 medium, 1 strong from industry internship manager

Summers: Internship at big 4 tech company (no research).

Statement of purpose: Strong, with help from others.

Fellowships: Didn't apply in time for NSF (are there other good ones to apply for that it's not too late for?).


Do I even have a shot at top 4? How do I look for other programs (top 5-15)? Thanks everyone."

Hi guys!
We are doing a survey asking about companies responsiveness to internship applications!
We are raffling out FIVE $5 AMAZON GIFT CARDS. The more companies you enter, the more chances you have to win a gift card!
So as UMD Computer Science students who have been working hard to find internships, we have noticed that some companies are much better than others about responding to our applications. Because of this, we decided to design our Intro to Data Science final project around gathering data from students about how responsive different companies are during the application process. If you have been working hard like we have applying to jobs and you want to help us out, please respond to this survey. 

We'll publish our aggregate data so that everyone can see things like what the average GPA of a Facebook intern is, if any company is particularly bad at responding, or if their interview process is universally liked/hated, among other stuff. Help us find this stuff out!

I really can't tell if I hate my job, if I'm burnt out from working, and/or being a programmer isn't for me.


Things that are tiring me out:


* 2+ hours of commute a day
* Long, 9.5 hour days (9/80 schedule, government job)
* No co-workers to mesh with. Everyone else is 45-50+ years old. I feel like everyone's kid, and I get a strong vibe that a lot of the old timers aren't fond of me even though I try to be as nice as possible. At my previous place, I was a helpdesk intern. My co-workers were only in their 30's, and they became some of my best friends and it made work WAY more bearable.
* Underpaid at $58k in LA, but at this point my confidence is so low that I feel like I'm not worth more
* Work is mostly conversions, so working with old technologies (COBOL, PowerBuilder, ColdFusion...)


When I was going to school, I was very interested in programming. I'd browse /r/cscareerquestions, /r/learnprogramming all day for years. I was obsessed with being a great programmer since high school.


Now, I avoid looking these subreddits like the plague. Anything that reminds me of work just makes me depressed. I don't even know what was appealing about programming as a career to me, looking back. 


I dread work so much that I have been coming in 30-60 mins late everyday now for the past 4-5 months. When I started, I was always on time and a great worker. I worked hard. If I didn't have anything on my plate, I would ask my boss for more. Now, after I completed my first project, I'm lazy as fuck and have no motivation. It's not like I get yelled at or micromanaged or anything. I just feel like I'm wasting away and just don't want to be at work. I'm scared that 20 years pass by like this, just living for the weekends, retire for a few years then die. 

What are some signs that this isn't the right career, or if my workplace just sucks?

I am a 21 years old man. But here are some of the rules that I need to follow to ensure my 'safety'.

* You should be within the campus by 6 PM.
* You should be in the hostel by 9 PM.
* You want to go out on weekends? Let the warden speak to your parents and make sure they are okay with it.
* Same goes for going home for vacations.

Last night, everything crossed limits. I applied for an internship via the university. At first, it was all well and good, as my application was sent to an organization, let's call it ABC. I was looking forward to working at ABC as its aim aligns with my ideas. However, at the end, I was informed that I got an internship at some other organization, XYZ.

Now, XYZ is a good place to work. However, I will not be able to work in the field I like over there. Moreover, the university did not inform me about rejection from ABC and the forwarding of my application to XYZ. 

When I spoke with the officials, stating the same point, they relentlessly told me that it's not their fault that I am going to XYZ, and that they will ensure I intern there, so that the university's reputation is not hampered. They are even willing to stop my degree to make sure I intern at XYZ.

My university is willing to waste my time, waste my potential and my future prospects just to ensure that its reputation is maintained.

I am sick and tired of my university."

Why do your executives have rape buttons at their desks?,Phosphoreign,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7gprnv/nbc_why_do_your_executives_have_rape_buttons_at/,"Executives at NBC have a button to lock their doors at their desks for... ""security reasons"".  Here's my logic... maybe I'm missing something.

1)  Door is open, maniac with gun bursts into office.

1a) Button locks door... doesn't help, he's already in your office

2)  Door is closed, maniac with gun bursts into office

2a) Button locks door... doesn't help, he's already in your office

3)  Door is open, and you hear gunfire in the office

3a) Button locks door... doesn't help, door is still open, you still need to get up and lock the door yourself

4) Door is closed, and you hear gunfire in the office

4a)  Ok, you locked the door... couldn't you have just gotten up and locked the door?  Do you sit in your office with the door closed all day, I don't know many managers that do that... and are these metal, panic room security doors?  Couldn't he just blow the lock off if he's after you?  Maybe kick the door down... so is this a *convenience* in case of security issues????

5) You are having a meeting, and you don't want someone to burst in, but the door is open

5a) Button locks door... ok... um... door is still open.  You need to get up and lock it manually.

6) You are having a meeting, and you don't want someone to burst in, and the door is closed

6a) Button locks door... ok... um... couldn't you get up and lock the door manually yourself, when the conversation becomes critical?  That's what we do in my office every day.  Ok, *convenience* that is not security related

AND THE WINNER IS:

7) You invite that good looking intern / actor / co-worker into you office... you ask them to close the door so you can have a discussion... you clandestinely lock that door behind them... and you make your rapey assault moves... they move to run, only to their dismay they discover the door is locked and they can't get away from you weinsteining?

SO AGAIN, NBC... I'M LOOKING AT YOU NBC... I'M ALSO LOOKING AT ANYONE ELSE THAT HAS THIS ""FEATURE"" IN EXECUTIVE OFFICES...

I think I might need help though. I'm a 20-year-old male currently away at college in my second year studying engineering.

I take care of myself. I recently landed a really big engineering internship for next summer. School has been going really well, probably going to get all A's once again. I go to the gym usually about 4 days out of the week. I have made some good friends this semester (had trouble making friends my freshman year because I often prefer to stay to myself and not go out). I have very high standards for myself, often pushing myself to the edge.

Feelings of inadequacy swing from day-to-day. On some days I'll feel timid and not worthy and other days I'll feel as though I can do and take anything. In the last 2 weeks or so, my feelings have swung back and forth between feeling ecstatic and feeling despair. It has gotten much worse recently.

It seems to have started around when I heard news that a close friend of mine from high school killed himself about 2 months ago but I'm not certain this is the cause. I've recently been feeling suicidal. Let me be clear though - I can't really see myself actually doing this. I do think about what it would be like if I wasn't here though, feeling as though it might be easier to just not exist sometimes.

I've been involved with this girl recently and not really sure where I stand, used to be a hookup type of thing but now we're kind of invested in each other. Sharing stuff and being emotionally available to each other. Never really had this with anybody else before. She's going with someone else to her semi-formal and it's eating me up. Stuff literally drove me to tears, something that I have never had happen before. I've cried several times over the last months when I used to go 6+ months without doing so.

My sleep has been messed up badly over the last several weeks, often unable to sleep for hours when laying in bed.

I'm not sure what I'm even hoping to get out of this. Not sure if I just needed to vent or what but I want to hear what people think. I don't even know if I'm typing coherently or if this is just rambling. I'm worried that I have a mental illness emerging. I was reading online and it seems like the swings associated with bipolar disorder happen less frequently than I am experiencing but I'm not an expert by any means. Also was reading about borderline personality disorder."

I'm finishing my second semester in my undergraduate engineering degree, and I have some questions for those of you who are farther along or who have graduated recently.

Some background: I'm an older student, early 30's, doing my first Bachelors. I have experience in blue collar industry.

I'm attending an accredited state school (not very notable, middle America) and so far, my feelings have been mixed. I chose the school because it was affordable, and because I had the grades to get accepted with the assumption that most undergrad programs will be relatively similar. Some professors have been great, others duds, but that's to be expected. 

In the two semesters I've been there, I have tried to take advantage of everything I can. Unfortunately I'm noticing some negative patterns.

I'm wondering if these are common issues in all undergraduate programs, or if people in private schools or top tier schools have had different experiences.

**1. The students seem disrespectful**

Am I just an old fart? No one owned laptops when I was in high school, so maybe this is common now, but I mean... *front row,* on your cell phone seems so rude. In some classes, it's the majority of students.

**2. The clubs and extra activities are not doing anything.**

There seem to be a ton of clubs in our school, but there are no adults supervising. 

Initially I thought this was great, after all, I believe young students are just as capable as adults, but the students really haven't been on the ball.

**3. There's limited access to facilities**

While technically there are labs and shops, the people running them are not exactly inviting, and it seems like by asking anyone for help you are bothering them.

**4. The student body doesn't promote collaboration/energy.**

I went into school with the idea that real learning would come from projects, extracurriculars, internships, and clubs, and that while in school I would meet motivated individuals and play off their energy.

I understand that in an underfunded state school, it's hard to provide mentorships and guidance. I figured, ""I'm an adult, I know what I need to do and the extra effort I need to put in.""

But without the students around me having that guidance, I'm feeling more and more... isolated? I don't know if that's the correct term.

So, are these universal experiences? Are the first years of any program a let-down until you get closer to senior projects?

I appreciate any feedback, tyvm"

Coding wise I haven't done much, I built a calculator for my phone and some random fan page for a rapper I like. I picked up a bit of JavaScript at this job during my free time but really it just feels like I'm translating everything I learned in C++. 

Actually any language I've picked up has felt like I'm translating stuff I already know unless a certain language makes coding something easier. For example Python was a lot easier to use for a vigenere encryption program than C was.

I've been applying to jobs but get no responses probably because I've only been here for about 7 months so I'm raising red flags. I guess I have to stick out this IT job for a year which means I would've been out of a school for 2 years. What are my options? I'm thinking going for a master's so I can apply for internships. I still write code sometimes but nothing crazy that would catch someones attention. I'm guessing I really have to be a master at development now before I can get an interview?

I'm currently a junior in college dual majoring in Information Sciences and Technology: Design and Development and Security Risk Analysis: Information and Cyber Security. I've actually posted here a while ago about questioning my career path, but now that I'm nearly finished my current semester and I thought about my future a lot more, I felt I would share my (potential) decision as of now.

I think I'm going to drop my Cyber Security major and but finish IST: Design and Development degree, potentially with an SRA minor. Doing this would allow me to graduate a semester early and give me more time to do more game/mobile app development on my own. I know Cyber Security is a high demand field right now but what I really want to do is develop games (and maybe mobile apps and websites) in some fashion. The concentration of my IST degree specifically focuses on front-end software development (mostly Java, but I have some light experience with C++), so I feel like I'm in a pretty decent spot. There's also an IST course specifically for game development that I'm taking next semester. Best of all, I would be able to graduate a semester early and have more free time to learn game/mobile app development on my own. And IF I really wanted to pursue a Masters in Computer Science or Software Engineering, I could get a head-start on it (although I heard people say they might not be necessary depending on how I go about my career, it's more about my projects).

I just bought five courses on Udemy over their Cyber Monday sale (3 for Unity, 1 for Unreal Engine, and one for iOS development with Swift). I feel like completing these courses over the next few months will be really benefit me. A few people online suggested bootcamps for game development so that's something I might consider when I graduate.

I'm going to try to get any job I can get out of college (hopefully I can get a job where I interned back, I already got an offer for a returning internship). But it was for general IT, so who knows.

Let me know what you all think about my current approach. Recommendations and constructive criticism are always welcome, I am certainly no expert!

Thanks!"
