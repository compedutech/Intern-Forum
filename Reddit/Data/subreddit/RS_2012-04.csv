The requirements for the position are to be well versed with:xhtml/css, javascript/ajax, mySQL, and PHP.

While I have code snibbits from practice and projects here and there from different classes I have been in, I would rather put together a project that demonstrates proficiency with all the technologies above.  I need some ideas that would be easy enough to create in a few days time but would also show that I have a grasp on the languages.  Any ideas?  

**TL;DR**I need suggestions for a project that incorporates xhtml/css, javascript/ajax, mySQL, and PHP.

rnrty,0,2012-04-01,What should I do over the summer? (Currently a CS 1st-year undergrad),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnrty/what_should_i_do_over_the_summer_currently_a_cs/,"An internship would be best, I assume, but I didn't actually bother going to any of the career fairs since I was told (by several different professors) that companies basically never took on freshmen, and getting dressed up and going through the bother of missing classes (plus the inevitable anxiety) just didn't seem worth it. I'll need to begin attending them next year though, I know.

So, over the summer I suppose my two options are to either get a menial minimum-wage job, probably at our local movie theater since I already know two people working there, or skip the job and just focus on teaching myself something cool, like Clojure maybe, over the summer and keeping up 1-3 projects.

Right now I've only got one major side project going on, I've been working on it for about 6 months now in free time, but it's [a plugin for Minecraft SMP using the Bukkit API](https://github.com/Everdras/MCTowns), which is probably a bit too childish to actually mention specifically on a resume/application, so any projects I did would probably be iOS or Android apps, or if I actually find a need, a desktop application.

As for programming background, I've been coding in Java since mid-high school and just picked up C++ during college, as that's the language my uni uses as they teach basic programming and data structures. I also know a smattering of Ruby  (no Rails, unfortunately) and python. So I can probably teach myself anything I'd need to use for any project I took on.

I've never actually had a job before, so I just wasn't sure if it would look better on an application/resume to say ""I worked this summer at [local theater]"" or ""I spent this summer learning clojure and working on [1-3 GPL-licensed github projects]"".

So, what should I do this summer? Thanks in advance for reading. I know I tend to be long-winded."

I'm a college student who is weeks away from completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and have spent the last three years working feverishly as a Software Development Intern (30 hours a week) and student. I've been paid well and out of sheer fortune, have been employed at this company for 2 years (Since my second semester in college). I have a strong GPA (3.7) and am among the top students in all of my classes. My manager at work appreciates the work I do and intends to hire me as a full time Software Developer with a very competitive salary (at a well respected company) when I graduate. 

I'm a logical person, however, I feel like these accomplishments aren't that exceptional. I feel like I'm lazy, and should work harder and learn faster. That I could be so much further along if I had pushed myself. That I should have been an EE major or an ME major, something with more rigor, with more respect. I feel like because I did poorly in high school, that I will never be able to distinguish myself from the herd, and yet, I try so desperately to do so. 

My question to you is this:

How can I get over this feeling that I NEED to differentiate myself?
How can I feel happy with my accomplishments, instead of constantly feeling like I need to reach higher and further?
Is this just natural? Does everyone feel this way?

Thanks. "
rpn3d,0,2012-04-02,How does one optimize startup times in Server 2008?,mistawac,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rpn3d/how_does_one_optimize_startup_times_in_server_2008/,"One thing that has always bothered me about Windows is their startup times.  There doesn't really seem to be a system in place to properly manage how Windows goes about starting up critical services when it's rebooted.  As it stands all I see is the system booting and all services making a bat-shit crazy dash for resources to get started. It's fucking stupid.

This is something I've been struggling with lately.  We're looking to implement completely automated Windows and AV updates on all of our machines using WSUS, Group Policy, and our AV Admin services.  THe problem I'm facing is that Windows only offers two options for starting services: Automatic and Automatic(Delayed), which translates to ""Mad Dash for Resources"" and ""Wait until those morons quit fighting, then start.""  This is obnoxious because it turns what could be a minute long process into a five to ten minute long process.  What's more obnoxious is that Linux can reboot in about a minute and have Apache, PHP, SQL, and FTP running.  

My question is this: is there anything I can do about this at all?  Are there any third-party services out there I can implement into our system to help manage this issue?

EDIT:
First off, before I start getting flamed out the ass, understand that I'm basically a junior system admin.  This is my first system admin job, and it's a small company and the people running it before were devs doing extra work.  I came in as an internship to help straighten things out and lightne their loads.  This is all shit I don't really understand and am trying to without schooling, which I'm actually in for Network Administration.  This is just temporary and I'd like to understand more."

I can't take it anymore. ,KidRose,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rp39z/my_mom_hates_me_i_cant_take_it_anymore/,"Ever single day she tells me. She hates me. Nothing I do will be good enough and everything I do is wrong. I'm a complete fuck up. I wear the wrong clothes and get yelled at. I don't wear enough makeup or do my hair the way she likes. That means that I'll get a lecture about how everyone else hates me and they're all going to laugh at me because I look stupid and I'm fat and I'm never going to get a job. 

I can not live like this anymore. I hate her, too. She's a stupid bitch who's fucking obsessed with what other people think. I hate makeup, and I hate straightening my hair, and I hate the clothes she demands I wear(or else I won't get a ride to somewhere I need to go). I hate her declaring that I owe her money the second I get any at all. Fuck her. I'm tired of being criticized every fucking minute.

Maybe I deserve it. I'm 20 years old, I haven't accomplished anything. I don't have a paying job(fucking intern), I don't have any degree. I'm going to be stuck living with this jerk forever and it isn't worth it. 

Everything is fucked up. I hate myself. She's made me hate myself. She laughs at everything I try to do, as condescending as possible. Oh, I'm trying to make it in graphic design? She'll laugh and ask how it's possible that anyone will pay me for my stupid childish hobby. 

It gets worse every day and I want to die. I can't move out. i don't have ANYTHING. No good experience, nothing. Who the fuck would hire me, anyways? I look like a stupid fucking hobo and everyone will probably laugh at me and think I'm disgusting.

My sister laughs at me, too. She often agrees with my mom. That whenever I get upset over this stuff I'm being dramatic, sensitive, and paranoid. And she calls me selfish every time I ever need anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to do everything they want! I have to just obey what my mom wants me to look and act like, and stfu whenever I might need anything because I'll get in trouble if I dare voice anything. if I ever try to bring up something I'm thinking about I'll get yelled at. I should just never talk. I should just die. 

I'm doing everything wrong. Maybe if I was the kind of daughter my mom wanted then I'd be ok. Maybe she'd even help me with the other shit that I'm going through. That's the worst thing. That the only help I really need from her she'll never give me. I don't know what I want anymore. 

I can't stay here, and I can't get away. Suicide looks like the best option, but I'm scared. I don't know if I have a choice. I can't stay here. "

After the summer when I started school I was asked to stay and work part time. I agreed and have been working with them since then. Its a some what small company of about 150 people. I still have 1 more year of school left and have been offered a full time job once I graduate. I really enjoy going to work and enjoy working with everyone there.

The thing is that work is somewhat far from home and school. I really would like something closer to home so I dont have to drive so much. I have a couple of interviews lined up and I just want to know how I should go about quitting. Should I how many weeks notice should I give? I never signed any type of contract or something that told me how long I would work for. Im only working part time. What would you guys suggest? Would you even suggest quitting? Its just that fear of the unknown going from a place you like working to a place you know nothing about.

* I have zero work experience in the field
* I have good marks (in the honours program)
* I am used to getting jobs in the customer service industry
* I live in Montreal, Quebec, but I am not bilingual."

I am an ME senior graduating soon in May. I have done an internship in the past; I applied for a full-time rotational position there but they went with someone with a better background and experience. I have continued to apply for entry-level positions I find but it gets frustrating not hearing back about any of the opportunities. 

My question now is: what is the general opinion about applying for internships after graduating? The company I interned with before liked me and they have several internships available this summer, in process engineering and other relevant fields. I feel I would get excellent experience out of several of these opportunities, and since I have yet to hear back about serious job opportunities, would it be frowned upon for me to try and do another internship?

Thoughts and opinions on this subject? Thanks /engineering, I hope to spark discussion on this"

[Why don't Cracked.com articles ever fit on a single page?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxyv?context=5)|We spread the lists across two pages because people are more likely to read something when it's bite-sized chunks. It's the same reason we write lists. There's less of a commitment when your scroller isn't the size of a pinhead, and we feel like we can win you over through the first page because our content is good. 
 |On a bigger a note, I guess I don't understand what the problem is. It's literally as easy as the push of a button to read the rest of the article. Is everyone so jaded that pushing a button sounds like too much work?
[Are there cubicles? Are they personalized? Is there photo-documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvye?context=5)|Yes, there is an ID scan so don't bother trying to break in.
[Is this because O'Brien is too shit faced to do one?   How hard is it to get started in your industry? Like, let's say I wasn't funny but had a winning smile? Anyone like that at the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47py6b?context=5)|I feel like this is probably an insult directed at me. But I also generally assume the world revolves around me on account of the winning smile.
[How much can you bench press? I'm going to be a little disappointed if it's not at least 100x my body weight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pw1b?context=5)|Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. But I can only do three reps.
[Do you get very much man-on-the-street recognition? Swarms of fangirls swooning at your feet?  Do the girls always end up asking for Swaim's number by the end of the convo?  Can I have Swaim's number?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qazr?context=5)|We get recognized sometimes. I get it a lot less than Dan and Michael. Crowds will form around Michael, it's incredible. I've even taken pictures for people of Michael. It's a nice humbling moment.
[Aside from your own, whose writing do you generally like the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q35e?context=5)|I think Dan O'Brien and Seanbaby are consistently the funniest writers on Cracked but David Wong writes articles that will change the way you see the world. Brockway is still my favorite though because his goal is always to terrify you just a little bit while making you laugh, and I really appreciate that.
[Are there actual (non-acting) people around when you guys film After Hours? Do people ever get up in your business when you film? I would ask if internet fame has ever gotten you laid, but if your articles are any indication then that's a silly question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q101?context=5)|We film After Hours from about 6pm to 6am. The place is closed while we film so the only people around are crew and extas. It would be impossible to film while the restaurant was open. Not because we're famous or anything, but because plates and people are really loud.
[Did the crash of Digg have an effect on Cracked traffic at all?  Cracked was always front page when Digg was at it's peak.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q893?context=5)|Not really. At first we saw a dip but by that point we weren't really relying on Digg for the majority of our traffic. Now if Facebook crumbled today, we would probably be in trouble.
[Why do most people on the internet seem functionally retarded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q809?context=5)|Because you're only seeing the worst and the worst people just happen to be loud. Just remember that nothing is personal and that there's a very specific reason everyone feels the need to troll or tear something down.
 |Unless you're including me in that statement, in which case I can't tell you for sure. Probably on account of the retardedness. 
[Are the Cracked columnists friends in real life or do you all secretly hate each other? Or openly hate each other? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q4b0?context=5)|We are all really good friends. At least those of us who live in the same area. Sometimes Seanbaby will come down to visit and that's always fun. 
[Where do you film Cracked After Hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvdm?context=5)|We film at a restaurant called the Los Feliz Cafe in Atwater Village, Los Angeles.
[If you, Swaim, and O'Brien all had to switch bodies with each other for the rest of your lives, and you got to to decide who gets which body, what would you do? Would you choose for your own benefit, or to spite Swaim and/or O'Brien?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q9xa?context=5)|I would do the selfless thing and let them decide, then I would take whatever was left over. I've had it pretty good until now, I think I could turn one of those other busted heaps into something useable.
 |Honestly though, Dan is more in shape and probably stronger than I am now. He runs marathons and everything. That might be an upgrade minus the freakishly long torso.
[The subjects of the articles written by you and the other writers varies so much, which topics tend to get the most interest and feedback?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q0rv?context=5)|The ""X things you didn't know about being ______."" Do really really well because people are genuinely interested. When I write about fighting turkeys or the best kinds of monkeys, usually those aren't huge traffic drivers but I still love doing them.
[How much do you edit their article when a user submits? Is it a ""you aren't funny, let me try"" or do you leave them as is?  And also, what are some of the dumbest articles you've received? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pzkb?context=5)|We usually work with the writers from the pitch stage so we know that they have great ideas to start with. From there, I'm always impressed with how well they understand the voice of the site and the sophistication of their humor. We've had to do completely rewrites before but we also have some articles that we barely have to touch.

Each article comes to us as a pitch first. The titling happens at the end, once the article is finished and we title based on what we've seen be successful in the past.

If you are submitting to Cracked in our writer workshop, keep submitting. Our feedback will tell you exactly what direction you need to go. We will essentially work with you throughout your entire pitch because just turning everything down doesn't help us at all.

I've discovered that I HATE office jobs. I'd never been more depressed in my life than when I had to go into work and sit in a chair all day and work. I need to work with my hands or be moving or else I get so lethargic and literally depressed. 

It sounds stupid with all the education I'm getting, but I've been looking at becoming like a mechanic or plumber. I know these don't pay  nearly as well as engineering, but something is so satisfying to me when I fix/build stuff with my hands. Does anyone have any experience they could share with me? "

I told them I wanted to take some time to think about things (since I was holding out for a position at another non-profit). I went to do the interview for the 2nd place yesterday and I might have shot myself in the foot because I ended up mentioning other positions that I was looking at and essentially might have made it seem like I was more interested in other positions. At the end of the interview we basically decided to try to work something out with a research program I'm in so that I would be working for them but not for the duration of a full internship. If this didn't work out, I would go on board with them for the full internship position. After I left I realized how ridiculous and confusing I was being so I sent her an email asking to just go on full time in the internship program.

Still haven't heard back from her but I really need to get back to the first internship people that offered me a position. I'm worried that if I tell internship #1 I found something else, internship #2 will decide not to give me the full position and I'll be left with nothing. Should I risk it?"

I'm a sophomore CS major. Much to my dismay, I've so far been unable to land an internship this summer. I think I've gotten close a few times, but haven't quite been able to seal the deal. I'm feeling a bit discouraged because I spent a lot of time over the past few months sending applications &amp; interviewing with different companies.

I have a pretty good GPA (~3.5), I'm attending a well regarded university, and I'm a full semester ahead in the CS track. However, my lack of real world programming experience seems to be my Achilles heel.

What I need are ideas for things to do over the summer to help ensure that I'll be able to land an internship next summer. I really don't want to end up graduating without an internship under my belt... Unfortunately, I'll probably end up having to work a typical min wage summer-job, but hopefully I'll have a little time to invest in a programming project.

I've been wondering what doors are open because of my UK citizenship. Pretty much, what does this citizenship mean i can do? 

My idea was that after school here, move to the UK for cheaper post grad school (looking for a PhD in Economics, or maybe a Masters), and also to get out of the US. But i have no idea how this works. I remember my mom saying that for you to really be recognized as a citizen in the UK, you actually have to live there for about a year to get all the benefits. 

I'm also thinking about just moving to England after i graduate, and either trying to land a basic job with my Bachelors, or trying to get an internship at a relevant company to my major. Grad schools seem to like it if you don't go directly into your post grad work, so moving to England for a year before to get used to the culture, and to get myself settle could be a good plan. Where would one go to find jobs/internship openings within the UK, specifically for economics?

So my basic question to you reddit is, with my British citizenship, what are my options after i graduate? Would i be able to attend a British university as a British citizen, or would i still be a foreign student, and not get the same tuition?"

I see stuff like this all the time:

[The Founding Fathers believed, and the evidence still shows, that industriousness, marriage and religion are a very important basis for male empowerment and achievement. We may need to say to a number of our twenty-something men, ""Get off the video games five hours a day, get yourself together, get a challenging job and get married."" It's time for men to man up.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/04/opinion/bennett-men-in-trouble/index.html)

and this:

[Burress, a cute, short, African American 24-year-old grad student who is getting a doctor-of-pharmacy degree, had many of the same complaints I heard from other young women. Guys high-five each other when they get a C, while girls beat themselves up over a B-minus. Guys play video games in each other’s rooms, while girls crowd the study hall. Girls get their degrees with no drama, while guys seem always in danger of drifting away. “In 2012, I will be Dr. Burress,” she said. “Will I have to deal with guys who don’t even have a bachelor’s degree? I would like to date, but I’m putting myself in a really small pool.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/2/)

It seems like there is this societal consensus that men who play video games are lazy, useless and un-marriageable.

I am a man. I am 22. I am married. I have two bachelor's degrees, one in Computer Science and one in Mathematics. I graduated college in three years, because I clamped down and studied super hard. I took classes spring, fall, intercession and summer, every year until I was done. I also did research which was published by BYU and attended numerous math conferences. I held a 20 hour a week, minimum wage job during my first two years, and during the third, I did a 20 hour a week corporate internship.

During all of that, if I didn't play at least 4 hours of video games a day, it was a bad day. I usually played SNES and NES games on my retro-duo. Kung Fu and Killer Instinct got played through more times than I can count.

I was being actively courted by graduate schools for math when I finished my degrees, but decided to go into the workforce. Upon graduating, I took a job as a software developer. My starting salary was $62k/yr. With my first paycheck, I bought wedding rings, paid a an Italian restaurant to feed everyone at the wedding reception and bought an xBox 360 and a Kinect. I married my girlfriend of several years pretty quickly thereafter, and began paying her college tuition so she could have a degree too. I pay all the bills, she studies, maintains our apartment and cooks meals. Sometimes I work crazy hours, but every day, when I get back from work a couple of hours either go to StarCraft II, World of Tanks or something on the 360.

Last year, I started my own business. Pretty quickly I was down about $3k. I held with it for four profitless months, then started making pretty good money. Now I'm up $70k. If things get much better, I'll quit the software developer job and work on my business full time.

Through that whole adventure, I played Halo III with my wife and my old roommate every night and drank many beers.

Don't try to tell me that playing videogames is a problem or that it leads to lazy unsuccessful men. Video games are what my generation likes to do. Surprise, surprise, different generations have different pass times.

**tl;dr:** It's a bad week if I don't game as much as I worked and I'm pretty damn alpha."

[HUGE* fan of yours. Loved Super Size Me, the 30 Days TV show, and Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden.   I'm originally from Columbus, OH, which is where you and your girlfriend (now wife, I believe?) spent time for the episode of 30 Days that talks about living on minimum wage. Since all the other questions I wanted to ask have been asked in the AMA so far, I am wondering if you have any salient memories about your time in Ohio, or stories about what it was like trying to live with next to nothing... if I recall, this was before the minimum wage was increased, so I think you guys were making like $5 something an hour. What was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rrhx2/i_am_morgan_spurlock_time_to_ask_me_anything/c482di0?context=5)|Was difficult making that show.  My girlfriend and I have since split up, my work being one of the contributing factors, but I love Ohio.  We've shot there many times.  I think its a great representation of the country, so we will shoot things there because I think they translate well to a large audience.
[Wow, thanks for responding! Sorry to hear about you and your lady :-\  I agree that Ohio is very representative of the everyman, we used to get a lot of product trials in Columbus because it apparently provides a good cross-section of consumer acceptance of a new product or service. Apparently we also have generic accents.   Just out of curiosity, what do you think about the minimum wage increases? I remember making $5.15 an hour working at Radio Shack in the late 90s, and I find it unconscionable that it didn't increase until 2007 (at least on the national level). Do you think it should increase more than it does/has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rrhx2/i_am_morgan_spurlock_time_to_ask_me_anything/c482maz?context=5)|It can always be more, and some states are already higher than federal, but its still really low.

[Were you nervous at all while making Where In The World Is Osama Bin Laden? Did you ever fear for your safety while on or off camera?

rsbgv,1,2012-04-03,Different levels of programmers?,Teekoo,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/rsbgv/different_levels_of_programmers/,"I've been looking around the job sites trying to nail an internship in software development and I noticed the companies usually search for programmers with various titles, eg:

- Intern

- Junior Developer

- Senior Developer

- Architect 

- Guru (not sure if this is a real title)

Now can somebody explain the difference between these titles? How does a JR developer know when he's at Senior level? How many years of experience do you need for each level?"
rsarz,3,2012-04-03,Using Vlookup and IF functions to compare values in two columns ,[deleted],excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/rsarz/using_vlookup_and_if_functions_to_compare_values/,"First of all, thank you in advance for reading my post. I recently started a new internship and I am being asked to do some things that are way outside my range of knowledge. I will try to explain as best as I can.

What I am looking at is comparing two average results from different branches from 2003 and 2005. However, some branches lack results from 2003, and some rows lack from 2005. When a branch lacks a result from 2003 it usually means it hadn't opened, and I need excel to report ""not opened"", and when it lacks a result in 2005, it usually means it closed and I need to report ""Closed"".

If there are data for both years, I need to compare them and have excel report whether the data in 2005 shows an improvement or if it has declined. 

My boss wants me to write different macros for this, and have the macro highlight the row in which each (""not yet opened"", ""closed"", ""improved"", ""declined"") occur.

I've literally spent 8 hours online trying to figure this out, but I've never used excel before so I'm having a really hard time.

Let me know if my explanation doesn't make sense, and I'll try to explain better.

Thanks!"

ructe,6,2012-04-05,"Frankly, I'm not even sure if this warrants attention.",lenavis,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ructe/frankly_im_not_even_sure_if_this_warrants/,"I go through the motions of living every day, but lately it seems as though even that is too much. I wake each day looking forward to only the moment that I can lay down again and go to sleep. I find that my happiest moments during the day occur during that brief period of relief before my eyes shut.

I'm a sophomore in a very expensive university right now, and I thoroughly feel that I have wasted my life. My grades have been on the low side of mediocre, and I think that the majors that I have since switched to will leave me as one of the many chronically unemployed degree holders in this country. I'm not a member or contributor to any bit of the social life on campus. I have only a handful of acquaintances here. I haven't landed any internships - haven't even put in the effort for applying to them out of the very reasonable expectation that I'll be declined.

I've descended to the point that I no longer attend class regularly because I simply haven't the energy or willpower to rouse myself and walk those 50 steps to the classroom. I ignore assignments and disregard homework. My motivation for schoolwork seems to have wholly disappeared.

I wasn't always this way. I used to be extremely driven in high school, and though I have always been socially anxious, kept a a reasonable number of close friends with whom I generally had a pretty fun time with, and had an avid interest in literature and science. Although I have always struggled with long bouts of depression and anxiety, it seems that my entrance to college has only worsened these problems.

My personal interests have dulled and have been largely thrown aside. When I pick up a book or begin to sketch out a picture, I no longer find the enjoyment that I once had. I feel completely out of my social element here and suffer from a constant sense of inferiority. Am I as intelligent as the students around me? Am I maybe just very boring and stupid? Why don't people like me? Why do people never approach me to speak to me? Is there something inherently ""off"" about me?

Every day, the possible methods run themselves through my head like a comforting litany. I could find some cyanide somewhere. I could buy a rope and go into the woods. I could find a high place to jump from or find a gun or slit my wrists - the possibilities are many. But I'll probably never do it, I conclude, because I am a coward. Because as an atheist, the prospect of an eternal void terrifies me. And yet, these obsessive thoughts continue, somehow deeply comforting me as a convenient end solution and a way of escaping responsibility.

Suicide is selfish. I try to tell myself so.

I have a brilliant, beautifully understanding and comforting boyfriend who is my only source of comfort in this place. I have friends who would probably be at least shocked and horrified with my death. I have a family to whom I owe masses of support (both financial and emotional) to. I have a really great RA currently who would probably lose his position if one of his residents decided to off herself.

And yet, I twist these sources of comfort into incentives.

My boyfriend deserves far better than me - he deserves someone who is truly up to his caliber and who is able to support him as much as he supports me. He doesn't need a cling little bitch to constantly pat on the head. My parents have wasted too much money already by sending me to this university and have gotten little to show for it. I've always been the ""failure child"", the one whom my sister has been explicitly told not to imitate, lest she ""turn out like me."" My friends have moved on, into larger circles and away from me. I am probably nothing more than an afterthought. My RA...well yeah, that's going to be pretty shitty for him. Sorry.

I don't know if this is even a legitimate post for this subreddit. Maybe this is nothing more than an extenuated whine for attention. Maybe all I was looking for was a few pats on the head. But these thoughts persist to the point that they linger daily as small reminders, and I don't know what to do about them. 

I'm tired. I'm really just very tired at this point.

I was initially intending to be a game developer having previously worked in the gaming industry however I somewhat recently realized that the chances of my getting my ""ideal"" game development job right out of college would be small. I have a family to support (and hang out with!) so I am hoping for something which will allow me to work somewhat reasonable hours. 

That said, I don't want to write bank software of hospital software. I would love to be involved in science (computational fluid dynamics, computer modeling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc). I am totally happy and willing to go to grad school but it's looking like it might be difficult to get into a grad school given that my current university is so small and has no name recognition or undergraduate research opportunities in Computer Science.

So I am looking for ideas for things to focus on, to study, to apply for internships in, companies I could work for, tips for getting interesting software development jobs, etc :)"

I recently started a 6 month internship at a business doing app design and programing and I'm having a hard time dealing with the fact that the weather outside is beautiful. I don't have a problem with my hours, other than the fact that I miss a lot of sunlight and the peak of the day.  

I know this may be because I'm used to having summer vacation, but the thought of everybody I know who isn't working full-time this summer being outdoors and enjoying the weather bothers me. I almost feel like I'm grounded. I enjoy the work I'm doing, the pay I receive, and the opportunity I have, but I'm really worried about working in an office setting for the rest of my life. I'm having a really hard time missing the day. I get upset and uneasy thinking about the wonderful weather I'm missing and can't help but feel that the office setting isn't for me, although I absolutely love the work I do.  
  
I'm hoping full-time office dudes and dudettes of reddit can give me some insight, advice, or just some perspective on how to deal with this, whether is means accepting or rejecting the office.

rwyym,0,2012-04-06,Performer Magazine are lazy scumbags. Please read if you want to help me troll.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rwyym/performer_magazine_are_lazy_scumbags_please_read/,"Hello Reddit,

I wanted to share this with you guys, although I'm not sure how interesting it is to people other than me.

I wrote music reviews and the occasional feature as an intern for Performer Magazine in 2010. There were no problems, whatsoever. My writing was printed verbatim (a bit weird in itself), and the EIC and I got along fine. It was a remote internship, as I live in Washington and Performer is an East Coast publication. 

After my internship, I asked for a letter of reference (what else is an unpaid internship good for?). The Editor in Chief said he would get it to me the following week. At first I was very patient, but he never delivered. Weeks passed, possibly months before I wrote him again. He told me had, in fact, already written my letter and that he would email it to me as a .pdf after he wrapped up the current issue of Performer. I wanted to ask why he didn't just attach the letter in the email he was writing to me at the time, but I simply said ""sure,"" and waited some more. That was several months ago — the last I ever heard from them. I have called and written them numerous times to no response over the months. 

My new employer, lacking a letter of reference to check after my job interview, called Performer Magazine and left a message. They never returned my employer's message. I have no idea why Performer started avoiding me, but they left me high and dry when i needed a reference. 

A couple days ago, after more unanswered emails and calls, I realized I was never going to get a reference from them. So, I took to posting on their facebook page. Nothing offensive, no swearing, just kind of bugging them. I knew they weren't going to give me any letter at this point, but I also knew they couldn't do anything to me. Every time I posted a comment, Performer deleted it immediately. Stuff like ""What would you do if I actually showed up to your office? Would you hide behind the curtains until I walked away?"" or, ""I wonder how long it will take for this to be deleted?"" got removed within minutes. Pretty uneventful, sure, until...

LO AND BEHOLD, Yesterday I got a response to one of my wall posts! It went as follows: *""Kevin, our company wishes to have no further communication with you. Please stop calling, emailing and posting to our social media sites. Further attempts by you to contact us will be ignored.""*

...and then they deleted that post as well. I took a screenshot this time, it's in the album.

**TL; DR:** 6 MONTHS OF FREE WORK AND PERFORMER MAGAZINE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A REFERENCE, EVEN AFTER CLAIMING THEY ALREADY WROTE IT FOR ME. THEY IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER'S CALLS FOR A REFERENCE, EITHER. 

So, DAE want to troll Performer Magazine's facebook page? I was thinking it would be cool if everyone wrote something like ""Hey Ben, where's my reference letter?"" Or whatever you twisted fucks come up with. If you ""Like"" Performer Magazine's facebook page, you can post on their wall. It would make my day GLORIOUS, FOR I HATE THESE PRICKS. **And admit it, you're bored as fuck right now.**


[PROOF] For some reason, I couldn't find all the emails, but I dug up a few to show you the time span we are talking about. Also, screenshot of the facebook response they gave me.

Though unfortunately USD has a bit of a smaller CS department (30ish students) and I haven't heard really much of anything about how people in the industry view them (if at all).

So does anyone have any insight on whether or not attending USD is a good idea from a internship/job standpoint? Also, any general advice into my choice would be appreciated. I'm completely on the fence right now.

I'll start...",AnonymousCourage,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rvl52/at_what_point_did_you_stop_being_a_boygirl_also/,"It occurred to me one day that the point you stop being a boy and the point you become a man might not be the same. I thought of it more and found for me it was different and the order was 

the reverse of what I was expecting.

**THIS IS A LONG STORY. YOU CAN IGNORE THE STORY AND JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH YOUR OWN ANSWER :)** 

Everyone will have different definitions of being a boy/man and some of you will roll your eyes at my personal experience since it is tied strongly with my romantic relationships growing up 

but here we go:  


**The point I became a man: 19 years old**

When I was 16, I got an unrecognized contact request on MSN. I accepted it and it was someone who had tried to add someone else whose email was very similar to mine but made a typo. By chance we found out we lived in the same city and then through one of the most statistically unlikely events I've ever had in my life we pinpointed each other down to the fact that we both had taken the same summer school course a month earlier. I sat at the table with my male, public school posse. She sat at the table beside us with her female private school posse. It was funny because they had nicknames for each of us at the guy table while I know our table didn't care for any of that because we were too busy discussing the finer points of Diablo 2 min/max stats. One of her friends who sat at the table got added to the conversation, her name was Sally. That night Sally and I talked until 6am on a school night. I felt the kind of connection that only naive teenagers could feel that night and I was so sure She Was The One.

I fell head over heels for her, and she did for me as well. We were both very shy so we were indirect about it in that ""*well, if you have nobody to go to Winter Formal with, I **guess** I can go with you*"" kind of way. We chatted every night until the break of dawn and I think those 8 months or so were the happiest times of my life.

I met some of her friends, and her cousin who she was very close with. I became aquaintences of her friend and a close friend/confidant of her cousin **Vera** who had some serious emotional issues and found it easy to talk to me. This will be important later.

Sally was my second girlfriend I ever had but after the winter formal she disappeared without a trace. I did not commit any horrible faux pas at the formal so it's not like I drove her away. Just all of a sudden one day I lost all contact with her. We didn't go to the same school (her school was very far away) and her friends all similarly disappeared. It would be 3 years before I saw her again.

The question always on my mind was: why did Sally disappear? What did I do? How did I screw up so bad and not realize it? Why was it something that couldn't be at least explained to me instead of breaking off all contact with me and telling her friends to also break off all contact? Why? I wanted ""The Answer"".

In those three years I did not find another girlfriend. I went to my prom stag. I always felt miserable inside. I would sometimes think I saw her around town but then when I looked again I wasn't sure if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. We went to the same university but it was a very large campus and we were in different disciplines so sightings on campus didn't happen (or maybe did, and I didn't think it was her?). I had some interesting dates in university but I never allowed anything real to develop from them. I never called back, and I never so much as kissed a girl in those three years though I had lots of opportunities to do so.

Vera was my only link to Sally but she refused to divulge anything. I didn't push her because she was very fragile emotionally and was in a borderline abusive relationship. I got a lot of 4am phone calls in those three years and had to go pick her up when she was drunk or crying on the street and was constantly afraid she would follow through on one of her many suicide threats. 

One day when I was 19 years old, Vera called me and told me she wanted to talk over some coffee. I was used to this routine by now: something bad had happened between her boyfriend again and needed someone to talk to. Strangely this time she said she would drive over and pick me up. 

I noticed that there was someone in the front seat when she arrived and I climbed into the back seat. I leaned forward to introduce myself and I froze because there was Sally sitting in the passenger seat. ""GUESS WHO I BROUGHT???"" screech Vera estatically. It was a very awkward ride to the cafe as both Sally and I had been tricked into ""coffee"". 

At the cafe we talked about our high school days and tried to catch up on what happened in the past three years. Eventually Vera left and we had a private moment and we finally talked about the elephant in the room.

Sally: I'm really sorry about what I did to you

Me: I don't think you need to apologize... I feel like I am the one who should apologize. 

Sally: really? I always imagined this moment, I would be apologizing for... disappearing on you like that. Aren't you curious, like what happened?

This was the moment I had been waiting for for three years, and yet somehow, what came out of my mouth was completely not what I expected.

Me: I always thought you must have had your own reasons for disappearing. I'm sorry if it was something I did. 

And that was it. It felt so surreal because in the past three years ""why did you disappear?"" was everything to me. And when I finally had the answer within reach I somehow let it go and was satisfied with it. We never talked about it again. 

Looking back, this was the moment I became a man. When I could let go of the one thing I wanted most and walk away.

Sally and I would chat occasionally but it was never the same anymore. We had become different people in those three years and we eventually drifted.

I am closer with and still good friends today with Vera (who is doing much better now!) and I will forever be in her debt for what she did for me that day.



**The day I was no longer a boy: 22 years old**

This story relates to my first girlfriend, let's call her Gina. 

Gina and I met when I was 15. We started a relationship that was cute, happy and in retrospect the definition of puppy love. If it had run its course normally then it would have had little impact on my life. Unfortunately she had strict parents and when they found out about me, they threated to send her back to her home country unless we ended it. I was not a bad boy (quite the opposite, I had straight A's and never smoked/drank) but *parents, amirite?* We decided to end it and there were a lot of tears. I was quite upset and thought the whole thing super unfair. I missed pretending to be embarassed when she covered my entire locker with post-it notes with hearts on it and I missed holding her hand and I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself at lunch, after school or on weekends anymore.

Fast forward: I am now 22 years old. Sally matter had run its course. Guess who is in town? It's Gina. She went away for University (I went to a local university) and she needed someone to pick her up at the airport as she nolonger knew many people here. I agreed and picked her up. We went for some dinner and reminisced a lot. She was staying at her uncle's place because her parents had now moved back to her home country. Her uncle hated her and made her sleep on the floor and basically made her life awful during her return to our town. I helped by driving her to buy some proper bedding and pillows and ate out/hung out with her a lot that summer. I picked her up when her shifts at a local cafe were done and we spent every day of summer almost exclusively with each other.

One day someone had eyes on her at the cafe she was at and gave her his number. She discussed it with me and I told her to go for it! I didn't have any romantic thoughts of Gina and although this guy seemed a little creepy, I told her if she was interested she should go for it but use common sense. I told her she could call me if anything went wrong. Gina and Michael dated for a while although after I met him I did not like him because he seemed like a very petty person. He knew I was Gina's ex and he would ""turn up the bravado"" when I was around (eg: feed her food in front of everyone like she was a baby). Gina thought it was ridiculous too. 

Then one day the heartbreak happens: Michael dumps her. Gina is really upset and calls me at work. I was a programming intern at the time so I was expecting to stay overtime until 11PM. Instead at 4:30PM I grabbed my coat and left immediately. I found her crying on the grass at a local park, little kids pointing at her from the playground. We sat there for a while and I cheered her up the best I could. We went for dinner and a movie and went to watch airplanes at the airport while sitting in my car. This was something that Michael had always promised they would do but never did. That night she fell asleep on my shoulder and I didn't want to wake her so we just slept there. In retrospect, this is my favourite memory of a single night in my life.

For the rest of summer we went back to our pre-Michael ways of hanging out every day until summer ended and we both went back to our universities. I dropped her off at the airport and as I drove away I realized that this was my favourite summer in quite a long time (first summer not ruined by Sally and ""The Answer""). As classes went on, I realized how much I looked forward to summer. How much I looked forward to seeing Gina again. We talked a lot by skype and MSN but it just wasn't quite the same.

I revealed this to Vera, who suggested that I definitely had a thing for Gina. Hearing it from someone else made me realize that indeed I hadn't felt this way in a long time. I was saddened though. She lived on the other side of the continent. ""You'll find a way"", Vera said. And I was inspired.

I took on two extra jobs, with my classes and saved every penny I could. I also worked extremely hard to finish all my school projects early and a week before Thanksgiving I handed in all my term projects which other students would take probably another 3~4 weeks to finish. I went online and spent all my hard earned money on airplane tickets to her city for Thanksgiving. I had never worked so hard in my life for a single purpose and put everything on the line in such a crazy manner. My friends all thought I was foolish and that this would end in heartbreak but I didn't care. I've had plenty of heartbreak and this couldn't be worse than the past three years. 

I arrived and surprised Gina at her dorm. She was excited and happy that I suddenly arrived out of nowhere to visit her and I stayed for about a week. During this week we hung out and had a great time. I slept in her dorm and she showed me around her campus and she was really glad I came because everyone she knew had disappeared over thanksgiving break. The last night of the visit, I told her honestly I realized I had fallen in love with her over the past summer and if she would consider starting a relationship again. She was quiet and told me that she had to think about it.

The next day as I got ready to go past the security at the airport, she told me that she loved me back when she was 15 and when she came back at 22 we had become different people and that incredibly, she loved me again as a different person. However, she felt a relationship would be a bad idea. It was long distance. Her parents were still an issue (Her Mom eventually warmed to me but her Dad will hate me forever) and she wanted to focus on her career. She went to the United States to study because she was ambitious and wanted to succeed professionally. I was a smart guy who could have went to my pick of universities in the US but I chose to stay because of my friends, family, and I did not have big ambitious dreams. I understood what she meant and we gave each other one small kiss and I walked through the terminal. 

On that day, I ceased to be a boy. I knew I stopped being a boy because I would ever again be able to summon the boyish naivete that allowed me to drop everything and put all my effort and 

energy into chasing such a optimistic quest.

Gina and I kept in contact for quite a while after this, but eventually she hit the corporate ladder and got too busy and we drifted. We both got into relationships and last I heard she is working her way up in a big financial firm in New York. 

**Today**

I am turning 26 years old in a couple of weeks and I will be spending it with my girlfriend of 3 years. I am lucky to be a man with a job he loves, a lovely ladyfriend, surrounded by friends that make every weekend seem like it passed too fast. When I think back though, these two experiences are what made me into the man I am today. I have no regrets and will always cherish these memories.

I am currently on a CS track (first semester), but after talking to an adviser in that school, it looks like it will take longer to complete than I originally thought.

However, I did get a business minor with my Psychology degree, and my school does have an IS degree available there.  I could complete the degree faster since some of my business classes are already done, and from what I understand it could get my foot in the door in IT.

My question is, is how do I make it so that I am actually marketable candidate for jobs once I get out of college (should only take 2 years seeing I already have all my gen eds done from previous degree)?  

I already plan on getting an internship no matter what.  But, are there any certificates I should aim for or any personal projects I should do on my own time that would help me out?

Again, I really love programming, but I don't think I will have the loan money to pursue a CS degree.

rxzl6,6,2012-04-07,Jumpstarting a Programming Career,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxzl6/jumpstarting_a_programming_career/,"I want to program. I have experience in IT support and some programming  from a few years back. I'm working to complete a night class BS-IT program which I will focus on programming in. I also have a good background in Math and Science and have taken some more traditional theoretical CS classes in the past. Here are a few questions I'd like to posit to the community:

**1. How do I not get typecast as a IT support guy?** 

I spent 2 years doing that sort of work full time. While there I did get to do a modicum of programming so I will try to focus around that in my resume. I still fear that I will be viewed as best in a support role. Besides my work full time work with support, most of my other part-time jobs were similarly help-desk or system level support and I know that isn't really the career I want to pursue.

**2. BS-IT V. CS?** 

Due to various time personal factors and time constraints I am taking a degree in BS-IT, with a math minor, as opposed to CS. I have no doubt that CS provides stronger fundamentals, yet I am also glad to be able to take more practical classes, than those that constitute a CS degree. The program I'm in is pretty good, requiring a descent amount of math like Discrete Structures. I've supplemented this with classes in Physics and Math, I used to be a physics major, so I think I have comparable amount of knowledge to a CS grad in all areas besides high level stuff that won't play a part in my career: compilers, functional languages, assembly, and OS level programming. I know, or knew and can refresh, on concepts such as efficiency, O-notation, linked listed, data structures,etc. **Sub-question, what would be a good way to refresh my knowledge of this stuff for interviews?**

**3. iOS V. Web Development?** 

I am very interested in iOS and see the app economy as a good place to start a career. I'd like opinions as to how career development in iOS will compare to more traditional web development. I have some past experience in web development so I could leverage that to help get my foot in the door, but I think I am more passionate about iOS and see a brighter future there. I realize that all trends pass and that having the fundamentals and ability to learn are more important in the long run. But let's face: most jobs ask for a highly specific skill set so to be practical I need to start developing it ASAP.

**4. Getting my foot in the door.**

Sort of the capstone question. Given my past experience and interests how do I get my foot in the door. I need to start work sooner rather than later but I'd hate to settle for an IT support job that might further typecast me, just because it will be easier to get in the short term. My current plan is to brush up on what I do know, then learn about iOS development and try to build out a basic app that I can bring to an interview to prove I'm competent. Any advice for going about this? Any other ways to approach it? If I need to get my feet wet with internships or even free work at first I'm will to do it. I think based on my experience I could get an employable programmer within a few months of refreshing and learning.

Thanks!"
rxmts,3,2012-04-07,Questions about CS?,Esotericity,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/rxmts/questions_about_cs/,"So I'm going to be a freshman CS major this coming fall, and I had a couple of questions:

1. What programming languages are typically used in the CS classes? Also, do classes tend to be only theoretical at first, or can I expect to have actual coding assignments my first year?

2. What non-CS classes do students usually end up taking their first year (such as Physics)? 

3. How hard is it to land a paid CS-related (such as coding?) internship during the summer after freshman year? I'm pretty motivated and willing to work my ass off to obtain the skills that an internship would require. Is it really uncommon for a freshman to get an internship?

I've tried my hand at a couple of languages over the years, but I haven't really ""excelled"" at one, so I sort of want to spend summer to really get a sort of headstart for college classes, as well as work on the skills I'll need to hopefully land an internship!

rxlpq,0,2012-04-07,Need help deciding on which internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxlpq/need_help_deciding_on_which_internship/,"I have been offered two internships and I'm unsure which will lead to the most future success.


The first will have me working with other interns on a project using MySQL and JavaEE writing a web application from the ground up.


The second is focused on cyber security and will have me doing related work with C and a little Python.


The first company seems like it will allow me to put more marketable skills on my CV, while the second seems to have a better overall employee satisfaction online and better prospects for future employment(at the same company). From what I've seen online, Enterprise Java programmers seem to get paid quite a bit more on average compared to C/C++ developers, is this true? It also seems like it will be easier to move onto another job having developed applied skills outside of class with Java and SQL.

How much weight should I give to employee reviews on GlassDoor? the first company is around a 2.3 while the second has about a 3.4


Both pay around $22-23/hr(which is pretty good, I don't live in a very expensive area like in NY/CA)"
rxd8d,1,2012-04-06,Need some advice for an upcoming interview.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rxd8d/need_some_advice_for_an_upcoming_interview/,"So I have a job interview next week for a position I REALLY want. I'm going to try to keep this relatively vague but the position is for the assistant to the head of PR for a record label. When I was finishing up college, I interned at a different label where this guy had been working. Therefore, the interview is with someone I already know and who already knows a lot of my work ethic.

This isn't bad by any means. When I was an intern he gave me a lot of tasks to do that I was able to get done quickly and efficiently and he actually helped me land my first job in the industry, which I unfortunately got laid off from. I'm nervous simply because I don't want to come off as too chummy during the interview but at the same time I don't want to be too formal. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Or does anyone have any advice in general?"

[What is your feedback to pepole saying they hate unity and want gnome back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957tg?context=5)|Gnome the upstream moved on from Gnome 2.x. Unity did not take it away, it's simply that the sun has set on Gnome, at least for the upstream developers and maintainers.
 |I don't know how you can hate Unity. I find it highly efficient and a pleasure to use on my netbook and my workstation.
[It's so pretty, beautiful, elegant, promising! But FUCK, it was as buggy as KDE 3.9.9.9.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49dned?context=5)|I'm not going to say anything here that might offend KDE 3.9.9.3 developers.
 |I can say, again, that there has been a huge focus on robustness in 12.04 for all of Canonical developed code that lands on Ubuntu, not just Unity. We will probably make one last Unity upload this Monday, so if you want to give it a spin on Tuesday there *shouldn't* be any new bad Unity bugs. However, experience tells me there will be. So if you could help verify that it works perfectly, or help us suss out those last critical issues ... that would be great.
[Can you give us some of the major differences you noticed immediately in the environment between working for Microsoft and Canonical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The differences between the environments could not be bigger. On the whole, I find Canonical engineering staff to be smarter than Microsoft engineers. Canonical engineers are, as a group, the most humble group of engineers I've ever encountered. Microsoft thrives on conflict, Canonical thrives on mutual support.
[Is it almost like going from working in a corporation to a small office environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The Ubuntu Engineering team is a home-based work force, so my office is small indeed (part of my bedroom)! :) Working from home is much different than working in an office, in ways that would take too long to go into.
[What do you think is holding back any Linux (including Ubuntu) from being on more desktops for home users? I personally think its due to not being easy to get certain tasks done as easily as in Windows since half of the time you have to enter the terminal to do what you need. What do you think Ubuntu can learn from Windows (which everyone uses)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495a0c?context=5)|I think that people are used to Windows and there are misperceptions that Linux based systems are harder to use.
 |For example, you don't, in fact, need to use the terminal in Ubuntu to do normal things. There are GUI ways to do anything. Similarly, there are some tasks on Windows that require their command line. I think Ubuntu is easier to use than Windows.
 |I also think that Microsoft and Apple have marketing budgets that are orders of magnitude larger than Canonical's entire budget.
[Who and how decides on stuff like using Unity instead of Gnome(for Ubuntu), and what were the primary reasons to abandon using Gnome to use something not nearly as much tested and arguably reliable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957mj?context=5)|There wasn't a single moment when sabdfl suddenly annonuced to us ""we are making Unity"". These things evolve slowly. Unity started during the netbook craze. Canonical's OEM team started a project called ""Ubuntu Netbook Remix"" because OEMs wanted something with more consumer appeal than GNOME offered. Slowly over time, we realized that we could create something better than GNOME. Obviously GNOME upstream came to the same conclusion because they went on to create gnome-shell.
[Can I have a *free* copy of Ubuntu?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496kz4?context=5)|Yes, if you send $5 I will send you a free copy/
 |I just occurred to me that maybe you weren't being snarky. Just in case my sarcasm detectors were overly sensitive, Ubuntu is free to use and share, and always will be. You can download it from ubuntu.com.
[Do you think all Android smartphones constructors will embrace Ubuntu for Android and produce smartphones running Android and Ubuntu? How is the process going for now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495af6?context=5)|Yes, I believe that Ubuntu for Android will be pretty standard on higher end phones in the coming years.
[Please get your power management under control...  otherwise people are going to be complaining about battery life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496mk0?context=5)|Ubuntu has done a ton of work to improve battery life for 12.04. Working systematically to measure, tweak, remeasure, etc... 
 |Summary here: [Link to smackerelofopinion.blogspot.fr](http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.fr/2012/01/improving-battery-life-in-ubuntu.html)
[What do you think about Android?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49562r?context=5)|I have an android phone that I use daily. I like the openess of it relative to iOS (I will never by an iPhone under the current circumstances). However, I really don't want to learn another application programming stack, so I haven't bothered to write any apps for it. I really only enjoy platforms that I enjoy writing apps on.
 |I can't wait for [Ubuntu For Android](http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android).
[What are your thoughts on Android fragmentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ajf?context=5)|Meh.
[So does sabdfl brag all the time about ""when I was in space""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495u6g?context=5)|Haha! This is sooo not his style. To be honest, considering his financial situation, I find him astonishingly, sorry to say it this way, ""down to earth"".
[What would you recommend to someone who wants to get into programming/software development who has little to no prior knowledge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496igq?context=5)|I would suggest learning Python, the language and the libraries. One way to get started is [the free MIT course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/).
 |Think of an app that you would like to have, or a version of one that you would like, and start writing it. To do this, get Quickly from the software center, and look at the tutorials. 
 |Ask questions when you get stuck.
 |Mostly, have fun!
[Thoughts on linux mint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496k5j?context=5)|I haven't used Mint myself, but Mint users seem really passionate about it. Clearly they are doing something right. The maintainers seem like really good people too, I hope they see continued success.
[How does one profit from providing free software? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4964jd?context=5)|Canonical strives to make money from Ubuntu by ""providing services in and around Ubuntu"". I have friends who earn a living providing training for free software. Many Free software vendors provide support and consulting (see [Link to blue-mind.net](http://blue-mind.net) for example). However they do it, apparantly Red Hat now pulls down $1billion a year! So, it can be done.
[A charge often levelled at Canonical is of a lack of ""giving back"" to upstream communities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|When one chooses to write Free software (in the sense of the 4 freedoms) one does so for the benefits that accrue to the users of the software, not themselves. In other words, we make our software free to bestow freedom upon those who use our software. There are responsibilities encoded in the licenses for users of Free software though, and those are pretty simple, keep the software Free.
[What responsibilities would you say that companies such as Canonical have to the wider Free Software community and do you think that Canonical does enough in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of making money from the Ubuntu Archive, there are lots of ways to do that. Affiliates codes, as in the Banshee case, are a good example of how you can do that. You can also straight up sell your software. For all of the money that Canonical spends on Ubuntu, I think it's only logical that they claim a slice of revenue to continue to support it.
[A bit relatedly, an issue for third parties is how they can make money out of products in the Ubuntu archive. Canonical has shown with the Banshee Amazon move that it is willing to take a slice of this kind of revenue for itself. Do you think there are/should be any boundaries to this kind of activity on Canonical's side? How can upstream projects be sure that they will be able to make money from products in the Ubuntu archive when Canonical reserves the right to divert this away from them? (Is this just a part of the deal that you accept when writing free software?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of diverting, this is, indeed part of writing Free software. People can and do choose to use it to make money. For commercial projects, such as Firefox, there are different approaches, like reserving the trademark, etc...
[I have a question about Ubuntu for Android. Which of the new and upcomming SOCs would you recommend for Ubuntu for Android? Tegra 3, Qualcomm S4, Huawei K3V2, OMAP5, the new Exynos?  And a second Question. Will it be made easy for the open source community, I think about the great devs at XDA here, to port Ubuntu for Android on devices without official manufacturer support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496h0a?context=5)|For your second question, Ubuntu for Android will be Open Source, so if you want to use it all the code will be there. I think there was some initial confusion about this because Canonical is not making a ""Ubuntu for Android Edition"", because there is so much handset specific work required that an Eiditon would not make sense.
[What is your day-to-day schedule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495r28?context=5)|Rest of morning: If things are not okay, work with people awake in Europe to see what are the problems, get them resolved. Have calls with people in Australia (it's end of the day for them). As Europeans and English folks wake up, have regurlarly schedule calls with them. Paper work, maybe a bit of programming, etc...
[How do you bridge the gap between people working in your offices and those contributing from home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495r28?context=5)|Which brings me to your bridging question. All of Ubuntu Engineering is home based, but spread out from Portland, OR, USA, to Sydney Australia. So there is a lot of timezone jugglling, and every now and then, someone has to take it in the teeth and do a call in the middle of the night. We have become very heavy users of Google Hangouts, as it works so reliably.
[How about Wayland? Can we hope that there will be some preview in 12.10? How it will affect to unity and apps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4959ni?context=5)|There is a preview of Wayland in 12.04! 
[Do you plan to focus on Qt or GTK library?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4959ni?context=5)|Apt-cache search wayland     libwayland-dev - wayland compositor infrastructure - development files     libwayland0 - wayland compositor infrastructure - shared libraries     libwayland0-dbg - wayland compositor infrastructure - shared libraries (debug)     libxkbcommon-dev - library interface to the XKB compiler - development files     libxkbcommon0 - library interface to the XKB compiler - shared library     weston - reference implementation of a wayland compositor.
[PS. Thank you for great OS and impressive progress with Unity in 12.04!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4959ni?context=5)|For my own application development, I am focusing on HTML5 atm. Canonical develops apps in both Qt and Gtk. 
[What was you duty in microsoft before joining ubuntu community and if it was about developing any part of windows os,what do you think about microsoft/windows as an former employee? if a windows/os X user ask you ""why is ubuntu(or linux) better than any other os"" what would be you answer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495bhg?context=5)|I started as a Usability Engineer on Visual Studio, then Usability Manager there. Then I was a User Experience Manager for Microsoft Virtual Eatrth (only for a year). Then I finished up as a Lead Program Manager in the Windows Tablet Division, just as Vista was shipping.
 |What do I think about Windows? To be honest, I don't think about it much. I never use it, it has almost no impact on me personally. 
 |Compared to Windows and OS X, I think Ubuntu 12.04 is better in every way. It's faster, more up to date, prettier, easier to use, easier to write apps for, easier to find and install apps, more secure, etc... Ubuntu is also a Linux based system. Therefore, the kernel and the plumbing are very well designed, and are constantly improved.
[I'd like to contribute and I'll look into it. (Very political answer from you!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49hcwg?context=5)|I don't know what you mean by ""political"" here. Sorry if I inadvertantly offended you. Quickly is a labor of love for me, and a project that I do in spare time as a community contribution. I wish it were the case that I could make it be all that I want to be, but I just can't dedicated more than a bit of time to it here and there these days.
[How do you gather community feedback aside from user-submitted sources?  What I'm specifically getting at is, do you occasionally read blog posts or articles or reviews to see what critics/reviewers/users think, and is that feedback taken in?  For example, this usability article was doing the rounds a few days ago.  Does anyone at Canonical get to see this and add it to a 'feedback list' somewhere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gq3?context=5)|I personally spend a part of every day reviewing what users, press, and the community is saying. I We have internal mailing lists where we occasionally discuss things like that article, including that article.
[I notice you drive the development of Quickly. How do you see (or want to see) the experience of app developers changing in years to come? An IDE? New language or toolkit? An entirely different framework?  Are there any major changes you're seeing in Ubuntu that haven't gotten the visibility they deserve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rlh?context=5)|I think that as Ubuntu starts to run on more form factors (TV, tablets, phones, etc...) there will be a lot of changes, in terms of a lot of interesting apps to write! I, personally, suspect that there will be multiple technologies that are well supported for this. I think QML and HTML5 are going to be good choices. Personally, I am currently working on a new Quickly template to make it easy to write HTML5 front ends, with Python backends.
 |In terms of major changes ... I think it will take a while for it to sink in for people just how rock solid the Ubuntu client has become. On the server, I think Ubuntu Cloud is so innovative and such a radical simplification of an otherwise complex space that it will take a while for the world to catch on.
[What do you think about Nvidia Optimus technology, bumblebee project and solving problem with ubuntu users who have notebooks with optimus techology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4958nv?context=5)|I wish we could provide perfect support for all hardware. However, if you choose graphics hardware for which the vendor only provides proprietary graphcis support, we can only do so much to help you.
 |The Ubuntu Desktop team has some top notch xorg talent though.
 |You might want to check this thread: [Link to askubuntu.com](http://askubuntu.com/questions/96552/how-well-will-nvidia-optimus-cards-be-supported-in-12-04/97259#97259) 
[Your thought about the ""Linus Torvalds"" persona?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495hh7?context=5)|Well, I really like his attitude about how people can and should use the kernel. I don't agree with his technique of using public humiliation to influence people. However, from what I've seen, he appears to be an exceptionally generous person.
[How do you think we can help Ubuntu's market share to grow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4958lg?context=5)|I think Ubutnu's market share will grow noticably with 12.04. The Ubuntu desktop is a polished jewel, and Ubuntu Server is the most innovative server OS ever!
 |I feel that my top responsibility is to continually drive improvements to how we build and deliver Ubuntu so we can meet and exceed user expectations for quality and robustness.
 |Just realized that I didn't answer your question. How can *we* help Ubuntu's market share?
 |I would say, using Ubuntu is a good start :) Share Ubuntu. Share your knowledge. Most of all follow the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. I think the CoC is one of the strongest things that Ubuntu has going for it. If people know they can participate in the Ubuntu community without fear, more people will take the plunge.
[*Ubuntu Server is the most innovative server OS ever!*  What features, in your view, make it more innovative than others? In other words, what features do you like in Ubuntu Server that are missing in others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4977jd?context=5)|In a nuthsell, everything that make Ubuntu Cloud. Maas, Micro-clouds, OpenStack clouds, and the ability for juju to target all of these in addition to public clouds. Add in the juju charm store, and you have a simple to use, but incredibly powerful system at your fingertips.
[No it isn't. Backports and PPAs for newer software are not common, and they are not terms that I would expect the target audience of an OS with the tag line ""Linux for human beings"" to understand - let alone compiling from source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49hd3v?context=5)|I also agree that accessing PPAs is not ideal for typical users. Also, PPAs are not vetted, so installing from a PPA can make configuration changes on your system that you are not expecting and can be hard to recover from.
[*It's easy to upgrade to get the lastest and greatest every six months.*  But what about the potential boot problems. like this bug .  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4962nz?context=5)|There are bugs.
[I, personally, would really like to see applications become more Ubuntu-ish. For example Libreoffice or Firefox being cross-platform beasts at heart, have nice, but not full integration. Esp. compared to other applications, such as the more-gnome-ish Abiword, Gnucalc or Midori. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Firefox and LibreOffice as upstreams both see themselves as cross platform, and the portability of their experience across platforms is important to them. We do cooperate, and they do listen. We also offer patches. We carry distro patches where necessary.  From a community perspective, I think having more Ubuntu advocates in those upstream communities would help. Also, just having more users in general make Ubuntu more important to them, so just being a user helps :)
[Does the engineering team invest time and effort into integration of such third-party applications? And how to do do that? Do you coöperate with the upstream developers? Are upstream developers of Firefox and Libreoffice listening to Canonicals suggestions, changes and integration-issues? Is there something we, the community can do to ease your work there? E.g. vote on upstream patches, mail upstream developers and so on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Canonical puts a lot of effort into making these apps integrate with Ubuntu. Our engineers have good relationships with their engineers. 
[Are you enjoying the French wine? :-)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957tz?context=5)|Well, I was enjoying it a little too much to start. So, I'm off the wine, cheese, and pastries until a lose another kilo or so :)
[What's your favorite dish there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49eq1h?context=5)|Hard to say. Maybe the Fois Gras?
[I saw some numbers yesterday that indicate that Ubuntu staff contribute very little to the development of LibreOffice. Do you feel that Ubuntu should be better supporting OSS that are an integral part of the desktop environment and that determine to a very large degree whether users will use a given platform or not? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495hwq?context=5)|We spend a lot of effort making LibreOffice work with Ubuntu. Consider how many packages are an ""integral"" part of Ubuntu. Then calculate how many engineers wold have to working on those packages for Ubuntu to be on the top contributor list for those projects. We'd never have time to write Ubuntu!
 |Anyway, that misses the point. What Ubuntu brings to Free software is critically important. Every six months Ubuntu allows you to access the latest and greatest Free software in an integrated user experience. We make Free software matter to people who would never otherwise consider using it. That's our role. It's an important role. It is a role that I am very proud to be part of.
[I recently applied to Canonical, but my application was responded to as ""unsuccessful."" Any protips if someone is looking to work there on what types of information is looked for? Thanks in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496i5o?context=5)|There are so many engineering groups with different requirements in Canonical, I can't be decisive.
 |I look for resumes that match the requirements, of course. I look for something that makes a person look like they may stand out as a leader (yes even for solely technical positions). 
 |I get turned off when someone ""spams"" the jobs (applies for every available technical position, for example). 
[Do you think there will be a Gnome version of Ubuntu (Gnobuntu, Gnomebuntu, whatever) like there is Kubuntu with KDE, anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496i74?context=5)|Having flavors of Ubuntu (Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, etc...) is a big part of what makes Ubuntu Ubuntu.
[As a follow-up, was the name ""Unity"" intentionally chosen to troll the rest of the GNU/Linux community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4969hc?context=5)|No, as Mark said many times, it reprepresents the Unification of UI elements across all of the form factors that Ubuntu will be running on in the comming years.
[What do you think about a steam kind of gaming for ubuntu? Gaming is the only thing stopping me from running full on Ubuntu. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496b0y?context=5)|Something like steam would be really nice. Of course, we already have the Software Center, which delivers a lot of software, but we don't really have the games like a Steam would have.
[Where do you see gaming on Ubuntu/Linux going in the next couple of years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495lq7?context=5)|I don't really have a clear view on this. For my part, I gave up using a PC for anything but casual gaming 15+ years ago. It seemed every new game required newer hardware than I had, even if I *just* bought by computer.
[Can you comment about Canonical's recent choice to start referring to your kernel as the ""Ubuntu Kernel"" instead of the ""Linux Kernel""? Does Canonical truly feel that the term ""Linux"" is taboo for widespread adoption, or was there some other reason behind that change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c497855?context=5)|I think the ""Ubuntu Kernel"" thing was a bit of a tempest in a teapot. It's just something that the release manager wrote in release notes for a beta. To be honest, I was glad to hear that someone even read the release notes.
[, drawing from that, how do you respond to the people who accuse Canonical of being the new ""Apple""; as-in, Canonical contributes very little back upstream (less-than Microsoft, surprisingly) while relying on many of those upstream products to make their product?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c497855?context=5)|I have not seen any credible comparisons between Canonical and Apple. The companies don't seem the same at all. 
[I have noticed a recent trend with smaller distributions basically becoming platforms for various desktop environments. In other words, there is only one distribution, but any of the major desktop environments can be installed.   It seems like out of all of the distributions out there, Ubuntu could gain the most from this philosophy. They could capitalize on being being the ubiquitous distribution, but cater to the various tastes as far as workflow and desktop organization. Unity might be awesome for some people, but for others (myself included) it has been enough to make me reluctantly switch to lesser distributions.   Is Desktop Agnosticism a possibility for Ubuntu's future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496aob?context=5)|I think this is by and large already achieved in Ubuntu.

I mean, it fundamentally works, but the driver support will take a while until it's easy to do the things such as you are mentioning.
[Really? I thought most people became supporters of Canonical's position after the first few weeks of the conflict becoming public, mainly because the move still resulted in a net gain on the part of the banshee team and attracted so many new users. I guess time will tell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496frc?context=5)|Well, it wasn't just the money. In fact, it was a net benefit for Banshee financially speaking. That wasn't really the problem.
 |Canonical just bungled the situation a bit. Part of the company promised them one thing, than another part of the company withdrew the offer, etc... 
 |The Banshee team showed a lot class and patience throughout, imo. Suffice to say, we learned a lot from this experience.
[How closesly do you work together with nVidia/AMD for X11 drivers?

It is still proprietary software, though, so there's only so much that can be done.
[Why is there no option to revert to a classic environment? I personally don't like unity at all. Its too convoluted to use.

I'd always thought Kubuntu was a great product and a credit to the project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49bnuo?context=5)|It's actually not accurate to say that paid development of Kubuntu stopped. There are many flavors in the flavors community, and only Kubuntu had a dedicated person. This was strange because while Kubutu is great, it is not one of the more popular flavors. Also, it didn't make business sense anymore of Canonical to offer paid support for Kubuntu. Therefore, we changed the way we support flavors so that all flavors (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, UbuntuStudio, etc...) all have access to the same resources.
 |Note that there was exactly one person who was paid to work on Kubuntu, and Kubuntu is a largish community. I really don't expect that you'll see any difference in the quality of the project.
 |At 12.10 UDS I would like us to revisit how we manage flavors and see if we can be providing better infastructure and services to make it easier for them to do what they want to do, rather than just keep doing it the way we have been for years without thinking.
[So why do I have to apply a kernel patch to install aircrack-ng?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c498jdi?context=5)|I don't think that cracking wireless networks is really a core use case for the kernel team, so I wouldn't expect them to prioritize carrying this.

However, you sound like a hobbyiest who likes control. You might want to look at the Ubuntu Core release that we are doing for 12.04. You can use this to create a customized minimal system and then add just pieces that you want from our repositories.

I love Ubuntu, but NB Edition is just slow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49fe0c?context=5)|There is no more netbook edition, we merged it with just plain Ubuntu a few releases back. I am using 12.04 on my dell mini 10v at this moment, and I do every day for a couple of hours at lease. I find Ubuntu with Unity to be quite snappy and responsive. Responsiveness has in fact improved in 12.04 due to some contributed patches that boosted performance.
[With the latest list of kernel contributors having been released, how does Canonical heel about Microsoft making more contributions of code to the Linux Kernel then Canonical(Who prides it self on being the biggest Linux Distro out there)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49gqw7?context=5)|It's pretty clear what is happening here. Linux cloud images, of which Ubuntu seems to be on of the most popular, are in incredibly high demand in public clouds. If Microsoft wants Azure to be at all credible, they must modify the Linux kernel so images like the Ubuntu ami run well there.
 |I am proud that our efforts to simplify cloud computing and to deliver an ami that everyone wants has helped bring Microsoft to the Linux table.

It is my go to language. I don't use an IDE. I think IDEs are good for making complex programming environments accessible, but Python programming is not complex, so the IDE just gets in the way.
 |I agree with Mark about Go. I think it will come into heavy usage. I think the c-like syntax is more accessible to people than Python's radically simple syntax, and I think that the built in concurrency is targeted right at avoiding so many of the bugs that application *and* system developers run into these days.

(Chemical/Biomedical),[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rx5ko/how_do_other_people_find_and_get_internships/,"I'm a female sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, biomedical option (my university doesn't have stand alone biomedical engineering, it's chemical engineering plus some specialized classes).  I have been trying to find and apply for internships since the fall.  I have looked all over the internet with no success.  The few I did find were not relevant to my interests and I was denied anyway.  My university's career services center is not helpful to me; they exclusively help chemical engineers get internships at oil and natural gas companies, which is useless to me as I want to be a biomedical engineer.  I don't even know what companies I should be looking at for biomedical engineering internships besides the few I have found through internet research that do not accept undergraduate interns.

Am I not a strong candidate?  I am a female sophomore as I said, but I started college with 32 hours from AP credits so I have junior standing.  I have had some chemical and general engineering classes (if it makes a difference, specifically chem e fundamentals, chem e computing, chem e fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, statics, electromechanical systems...).  The chemical engineering classes are only offered fall or spring and must be sequential so I'm forced into a 4 year degree, which just means I'll only be taking minimum hours to be a full time student the next two years.  I have a 4.0 GPA (yes, straight As), work as a research assistant in the chemistry department, am in my university's honors college (which means extra classes and honors classes), have three years of programming under my belt in java and Excel visual basic, have been involved in my university's orchestra playing the bassoon, and have been involved in robotics club.  I'm taking 18 hours this semester and working and literally have no time to do anything else.  So, why can't I find or get an internship?"

But at the same time, in that damn UT thread I'm reading people going ""Yeah lol me and my 3 friends all got internships at Facebook"" and the guy after that going ""Hurr durr I got an internship at Amazon as a freshman"" and I'm going, how the fuck did you get that opportunity.

Due to this, u can see the given minimal amount of advice and reads (all appreciated). So I thought I would give Reddit a go:

I am a very well rounded IT guy, with a passion for programming in particular. I have been through a BS program less the internship as I refuse to go lower than minimum wage (i.e. free) and/or such opportunities find the institution lacking. Since then, the catalog for my degree has changed, so I am making peace without it. I go up for job interviews and get myself no farther than a submitted resume. I have even changed my strategy and made this website: [http://goo.gl/qqpN8](http://goo.gl/qqpN8) to showcase my highlights (but not at all exhaustive) for specific areas in the US and paid for classified ads. The 'internship' is notable as I am just trying to get my foot in the door.

Because IT is so vast, with programming and engineering in particular, I spend my time researching the requirements for the job I am applying for. This has made me that well rounded guy I spoke of earlier, but has made me a victim of being a jack-of-all-trades; unfortunately being a master of none.

I embrace my gung-ho attitude and find it to be a trait that has powered my career before. But I am starting to lose steam. I want it straight. What is not appealing about everything I am doing? What are the technologies that I need to focus on that are in great demand at the moment?

I have relevant experience in my field from two internships and my GPA is alright for my major (3.1 in major) but I am still struggling to get past the application process with most companies. 

I believe my cover letter is hurting me the most because that is obviously the first thing a company will look at. So far I have been structuring my letters in the following format:

-Introduction about my academic background, discussing relevant coursework and programs I am involved with.

-Next I talk about my relevant work experience and the results of my internships. 

-Finally I conclude with how I believe I will fit into the company I am applying for, and discuss any other relevant experience I have that I think would be a strength for the company. 

Does this seem like a logical format or am I taking too long to begin talking about what I would bring to the company? Should the entire letter be about how I can contribute to the company and tie in my information with that discussion, or does it make sense to keep it separate?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, with graduation approaching I am starting to get nervous about finding a position and I just want to make sure I am marketing myself in the best possible way. 

Thanks for any help or advice, I really appreciate it.

s1cw6,5,2012-04-09,"I feel like the last company took advantage of me, can I really not do anything about it?",reallyjustconfused,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/s1cw6/i_feel_like_the_last_company_took_advantage_of_me/,"Coming out of undergraduate, I was desperate for some sort of income as I had a lot of bills needing repayment.  I willingly took an internship with a company in SC, as the person who hired me really sold me on the process they follow at the company.  Unfortunately, two weeks into my internship, he was forced to resign (the company owner has some pride issues, and their original partnership plans fell through when the owner decided he didn't need the guy who hired me anymore)

Here's the beginning of the problems, after those two weeks, I started to put in more than 30 hours, occasionally surpassing 40 hours.  I was doing development work up to par with their senior developer and front-end developer - but I was still the ""intern"".  

Throughout my whole employment there, I was required to be at the office no later than 9am (the owner didn't bother to hide his disapproval if I were late to other employees); I was expected to show up during ""happy hours"" (even though I didn't drink beer, AND the owner pulled me aside telling me it's very important that I go to these, or else I wasn't being part of the ""team"") or any other activities they were holding; and I was required to file leave of absence forms for unpaid vacations or sick leave (those were probably the only times I worked less than 30 hours).  I was never paid overtime, and it was always on an hourly basis. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I was given a ""promotion"" (if you can call it that, they paid me 50% LESS for a person with my experience and degree) to ""junior developer.""  Even though I held a more ""permanent"" role, I was not treated the same way as the other hired employees. All this time, the company had not taken out taxes like all my older jobs and offered no benefits.  I began to worry.  During my internship was fine, I figured they handled it like the way my college did when I was a student assistant.  But if I was supposed to be ""salaried"" and supposed to be an employee, why wasn't I given benefits and etcetera?  I wasn't as worried about the benefits (all of my previous jobs had never offered me any benefits as I was always part time or PRN, so it didn't occur to me to ask about it) as much as the taxes not being taken out, so I confronted the owner about his.  His only response was that this would be better when I went back to graduate school during fall of the next year.  He said I was a student anyways, so it wouldn't be a big deal; they would give me a break. (Actually, I had already graduated at the time and I didn't find out until later that I couldn't really count my tuition fees from that spring semester as part of this tax season because I paid them off last fall).  There were other things too that let me know that I wasn't held with the same respect as other employees - I was given no key to the office (everyone had one), offered no personalized business cards like the rest, and so forth.

Near the end of my employment, I heard him asking others if I was worth keeping at the company, as he just hired a new director at a 6 figure salary, easily 3 times more than I was making, and he felt that I was not fitting in with the company, even though I got along well with the group I was working with.  I knew company profits were down and business was slow, but I was the only other developer who could help take the load off of their senior developer, who would have been overallocated had I not been hired as their intern.  So knowing I was next to be fired and knowing that the two managers/directors I trusted were trying to buy me extra time, I quickly found another job and high tailed out of there.

Anyways, I shouldn't have believed the owner at all, about anything. I definitely owned the government this year, and anyone I spoke to about it has told me that I was wronged.

I have already also filed an SS-8 (employee determination form) with the IRS and am still waiting to hear back...but I know it takes forever.

And after speaking with the guy who originally hired me for the company, he said that he knows I had/have an employee file with the company, because he didn't have me sign a contract like he did other contractors for the company.  

Is there no legal action I can take about what the company just did to me?  "

I'm a 24 year old college graduate. I have 7 years experience in Information Technology, 8 years experience running an at home business doing web development. I graduated in 2010 with an AAS. As part of my degree I had to do an internship in the field of my degree, I interviewed for my internship at the company I currently work and was accepted for 120 hours unpaid in September of 2010. After my internship ended in early 2011 I was hired as a temporary employee (first intern hired ever apparently) through an agency working as a sys/network administrator under the director of I.T. In feburary of 2012 I was hired full time for human resources and I.T. basically filling two job roles helping HR, and my current duties under I.T. 9 days after I was hired my boss called and told me he was putting in his two week notice and moving to Florida to be a I.T. director at a new company. 

Being the most familiar with the layout of our company, operational needs, and experience the upper management decided that I would assume the responsibilities of my boss and would review the performance after 30 days. 

He had a Bachelors in CIS and 20 years experience, was proficient in our MRP(manufacturing resource planning) software and written some custom applications for the business.I'm not to his proficiency level in the MRP software, nor have I written in the language he developed the applications in, I'm more or less in a maintenance role at the moment, making sure the business runs smoothly. 

**My 30 day eval is this week**

I need some pointers on salary negotiations - I've never negotiated my salary before, I'm informed on our area's salary range for network administrators I'm grossly underpaid (about ~27k with OT). Right now I'm hourly, but they are leaning towards putting me on salary. The starting salary for an entry level in our area is about 37K, 35 - 40 was what I was thinking of. I'm not greedy but I live with my parents right now and I have a car loan I would like to move out this year. (Additional information: Health insurance to start after 90 days, profit sharing, 401k, tuition reimbursement after 12 months - I want to go back and get my bachelors in CIS) 

Additionally I need help in my department, my boss was struggling trying to keep up with just him (3 locations in the US, two in state, one across the US with between 90 - 120 personnel total), which is why they hired me after my internship. I want to come off with saying I need help but not in a way that It sounds I can't handle the job. "

The company will develop and launch the following:
E-commerce sites and platforms
Mobile apps (practical, not games)
tech patents and products
Business development consulting (included)

The major roadblock is coding. I have the entire image drawn up in my head but never learned how to code. I've spoken with many coders and while I don't mind sharing the company with them, 50% of it just for the initial coding is pretty ridiculous. I also don't want to outsource the coding either (even though it can be less costly).

How should I go about acquiring people to code for the new company? 
I've come up with the following ways
1. Hire a software development company to do it for me
2. Get a team of coders who want to help start the company
3. Get a single coder who is knowledgeable in all of the necessary languages to do it
4. Hire interns to code
5. Work in tandem with a software company and give them a portion of the company instead of cash (kind of how ebay owns 25% of craigslist).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and feel free to message me to discuss if you've started a company before. 

Edit: I'm well aware of the costs, etc in regards to programmers. I'm already quite experienced with business operations, marketing, etc. The main thing I'm looking for is advice on the best way to acquire coders. I know that. The 50% part was just for the coding and then not staying with the business and multiple people have said that to me. I don't mind splitting a company with a technical co-founder, but they'd need to stay with the company for that amount. "

The organization is shoddy, and my work rate will continue until the end of this semester (early May). 

I am not by any means ""interning"". They threw me into this management position, and are expecting to do all of this work which I have neither training nor time for (my department is under staffed as well).

So far I have told my boss that I cannot work 60 hour weeks because it will more than likely cause myself to stay sick, but he just went on vacation and I am receiving no help because we don't have the bodies.

Is there any real chance that they would terminate me early if I let them know now that I won't be staying after I graduate? If so, I wouldn't be able to get my diploma. 

The other option is to wait until I have my diploma, then put in my 2 weeks. I have been mentally and physically drained for nearly a month, and I wish to not prolong my stay unless absolutely necessary.

From those of you that come from the corporate world, what do you suggest I do? "
s2rso,6,2012-04-10,"About to graduate, feeling helpless/lost/depressed....help me Reddit",IntotheRealWorld,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s2rso/about_to_graduate_feeling/,"I am about to graduate undergrad with a bachelors in Management Information Systems and I feel like I have lost all my passion in life. This time last year I was very motivated to graduate, start a career in IT and move out of my parents, but now as I feel I get closer to graduation I find it hard to motivate myself to do anything. The only way I can think to express my feelings is by explaining the factors which I believe lead to my feeling of this. The main things that distract me the most are job hunting/school, legal troubles and my awareness of issues.
 Job hunting, while I know I haven't been searching long (about 3 months) I am starting to realize things about my education that may actually set me back. I never had an internship nor worked in my field of study and now this is hurting my job search. I love what I went to school for, specifically the idea of creating a solution for a business based on technology. I become discouraged when I search for jobs because they are mostly more technical positions, which I also enjoy but my Major isn't as technical as say a Computer Science degree. A lot of my classmates express similar feelings and are seeking jobs in other fields. 
Another big thing is I was arrested last December for possession with intent to sell marijuana, it has been dropped to three possession charges since then and I am hoping it doesn't hurt my job search (if it hasn't already). It makes me feel like I am a bad person, even though when I really think about it I had no intentions(and don't believe I actually did) to harm anyone, I was only trying to make a quick couple bucks and smoke for free. Regardless it really took a hit on me and stressed me out. 
 I have also recently become politically interested and like to spend a lot of time educating myself on the problems in the world and thinking of solutions.  I find now that the only motivation I can get is with these problems. Many times I will write down solutions, some of which are completely doable and this is the only time I feel I can make myself think, stay focused and motivated. 
Overall, I feel very unproductive lately, and can not find motivation to use on school work or job searching. I feel distracted, like I can't stay focused on anything productive. Can anyone relate to this? Or have any advice for me? I know I need to get my ass in gear and to stop feeling sorry for myself, but I can stop feeling useless, helpless, lost and depressed.

s2py4,166,2012-04-10,How Do You Make Him Stop?,Pharazlyg,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s2py4/how_do_you_make_him_stop/,"I’m an idiot. A real fucking screw up. You dabble and you muse and when you dive in it comes to bite you in the ass.  I sit on the internet all day, watching horror movies, researching legends and myths, and when I found reddit and everything it had to offer on these subjects, you can just imagine to what level my obsessions went.

I’m writing this with shaking hands. I can’t tell if it’s fear or just the poisonous amounts of caffeine and nicotine in my body right now. I’m writing this to tell you guys to stop. If you’re obsessing and reading and can’t get enough, just stop. It’s not worth it when the computer screen finally goes dark and you’re left in your room all alone. In the dark. With him.  

I played the game about a week ago. It’s called the Midnight Man. I’m going to guess anyone reading this knows what it’s all about, but just in case you don’t, here’s the basic premise; At midnight, you write your name on a piece of paper, place several drops of your blood on it, and put it in front of your door. After that, you knock twenty two times, open the door for a moment, and then close it. At this point, it’s said that the Midnight Man has entered your home. You’re supposed to have a candle with you, moving around your pitch black house until 3:33 AM. If you stop moving, the Midnight Man finds you and forces you to hallucinate your greatest fears until 3:33. 

I played with my girlfriend. The house was dark and we both had our candles. After about an hour of moving around, we became a little bored. I snuck up behind her and gave her a good scare. The scare was enough to ensure a little friskiness and we ended up on the couch in my living room. In the middle of the festivities, I turned my head and swore I saw a black shape on the already solid darkness of the room. I jumped and ended up scaring my girlfriend yet again, unintentionally this time. I told her what I saw and she told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was full of shit. I got an earful about how I was too obsessed with this horror shit and needed to get my priorities in line. This wasn’t the first time I had tried to freak her out mid-hayroll. She stormed out. The time was 2:26 AM. 

I fell asleep on the couch after that, attempting to get her to text me back. 

I had the worst nightmare that I can ever remember having. There was blood. A lot of blood. But it wasn’t coherent, it was just screams and faces. And fear. Just pure fear. At any moment I could die, and DID die, but yet, remained in fear for my life. A life that was always in danger, yet never in danger. It was fear without end. It wasn’t even corpses, or creatures, or the normal, routine stuff of nightmares that any horror addict had grown accustomed to. It was just pure terror, as if injected straight into my veins. 

I woke up, sweating and sore. My throat felt raw. In the nightmare, I knew I was running and flailing and panicking and screaming. I must have done so in real life. I can still feel the burning in my throat now. I feel like I couldn’t scream again even if I wanted. 

I was convinced I did see the black shape at this point. I checked my phone; 3:35. I knew I had spent at least two minutes scanning the now, seemingly, darker room for any signs of life or otherwise. 

I told my girlfriend. She didn’t believe me. I’m not going to even go into the details. You’re all smart people. Most likely as addicted to this stuff as I am. You know how skeptics get. It wasn’t a big deal until the next night. 

I fell into bed after a ridiculously long day. The elevators had even broken just as I was on my way out (I’m an intern at an accounting firm downtown). I was just reaching that point of half-awake/half-asleep when my last bit of consciousness caught motion at the end of my bookshelf. Now, my room isn’t nearly as dark as the rest of my small house, as the windows for the second floor are right at streetlight level. However, this does mean that all sorts of crazy shadows are thrown into the room. If you had asked me a week ago if that creeped me out, I would have laughed. Not now. 

I saw it again. The shape of a man, or what something thought a man should look like. It had the appropriate limbs and structure, but it just looked unnatural. It was a shadow with texture, like a black, decomposing snakeskin sliding between the shadows of my room. It made no effort to hide itself. As it moved, I saw its mouth opening and closing sporadically, like it was trying to breathe or talk, but couldn’t quite figure out how. It became more agitated as it moved from behind the bookshelf, to in front of my desk, to the point where it peeled itself off the wall and started gliding towards me. 

I screamed like I never thought I could. I swear I tore my throat open. I screamed the way I thought no one did in real life. I scrambled to my night stand and hit the light. In one, eye-shielding instant, the room was awash in the soft glow of my lamp. The figure was gone. I sat shaking, unable to move. Sick fear was in my gut and it wasn’t going away. It still hasn’t. I sat up all night. 

I kept the light on for the next two nights. But now he’s gotten smarter. He just waits outside the circle of light, pacing and silently babbling. And he doesn’t stop there. He’s suddenly everywhere. 

Yesterday, I was told to go home from work. I don’t blame them. I look terrible. I haven’t slept more than a few hours per day. My boss found me passed out on my desk. He woke me up and told me to go home. I told him I was having some family troubles. He seemed to buy it. I stepped on the elevator and hit the ground floor button. As the elevator started moving, the lights flickered once. I almost lost it right then and there. In the instant they flickered, I knew he was there. I didn’t see him, but I saw him. I know, somehow, I did. I ran out of the elevator as soon as the doors opened wide enough. 

That night I slept at my girlfriend’s house. I thought sleeping somewhere else would help. It didn’t. The nightmares came back, except this time he was there the entire time. The screams, the pure fear, the faces, the blood, and him. He just stands there the entire time. Twice, my girlfriend woke me up. I got another lecture on this “horror shit.” She didn’t appreciate the thrashing and the screaming. I decided it was another sleepless night. 
From where I am right now, it’s about seven hours until sunset. I don’t want it to happen again. I looked everywhere for a solution. I burned sage, I bought a crucifix and a bible. I even poured a circle of salt around my bed. I don’t know if any of this works. This has never happened to anyone else who’s played. I wanted a thrill and now I got one. 

Don’t fuck up like I did. If you’re obsessed, take a break. It’s not about fear anymore. I’ve had enough.

[Have you kept in touch with any particular guests (if any)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adats?context=5)|HELL THE FUCK NO.
[Did you have sex with any of the guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abuwb?context=5)|Only the trannies. 
[Tranny is kind of a slur like faggot, do you mind not using it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ah4y0?context=5)|I guess you have never said OP is a faggot... maybe you should start now...
[The individual guests put themselves there, to be sure, but the show chooses which guests and how to present them.  And it picks on minorities in particular, in a very nasty way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4aqhrn?context=5)|I'd say more of the people I dealt with were white, actually. 
[Nope never have and never will. It doesn't convey any real meaning and it just meant to hurt someone, furthermore it holds the connotation that being gay is something bad, which I dislike very much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4al9tl?context=5)|You won't make an exception to the rule? 
[How fake is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abujq?context=5)|40%. Haha, everything is embellished, but rooted in truth. People are hired to Make a couple into a love triangle, everyone has to fight, and you should see these people before they go in to hair and makeup. 
[So, these people have actual issues with the other guests but make it bigger than life somehow? Is it that the show's writers make a small family feud into some sort of incestual thing that it never was? Could you elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adk69?context=5)|It depends. Some people are really acting a lot, but the incest story that I was talking about was pretty legit. The girl who was fucking her stepdad was talking to me about it when I took her outside on a smoke break ( they had to be supervised at all times) and was telling me that her sister really did hate her for it. Her sister confirmed this many times. The couple was creepy as fuck, and the sister really did hate the fuck out of them... so their fight, story, etc. was pretty legit. 
 |On the other hand there are many instances of bullshit... 
 |One woman didn't know what accusations to make so she made up the following while I was in the room with her.. pretty hilarious : I Found a condom under the bed, we don't use condoms! 
 |I've also heard ""she's my homegirl I don't want to fight her.""
 |The best instance of this though was a scrawny little black man that seriously looked like Flava Flav, named Santiago. He had a tranny girlfriend that was approx. 400 lbs. This obviously wasn't enough of a scandal so they hired some dude to act as a third lover to make a more dramatic ""love triangle"". 
[*People are hired to Make a couple into a love triangle.*  What does that mean?  are you saying they hire a prostitute to fuck a guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahcis?context=5)|No, they don't fuck. The third person is just a hired ""actor"" who just goes along with whatever story the producers give. 
[Was there a particular guest, or couple, that stood out the most to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abu6r?context=5)|Oh yeah. The most disturbing was a family of two sisters and a stepfather/ father. 
 |Sister A's (lets call her Tina) father was deceased, and her mother remarried and had sister (Well call her Val). Val's father and mother had recently separated, and he and Tina, his stepdaughter, became engaged. This couple was the raspiest, dirtiest, most Beverly Hillbilly people I have ever seen. The sister, Val, was a 6 foot tall bohemeth. Absolutely disgusting. 
 |And when the time came for the on stage fight, and scrawny ass Tina kicked the shit out of her, I was the one locked in a bathroom taking off Val's shirt to reattach her mic to her newly broken bra. -_-
[Tall people are not disgusting :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahmhe?context=5)|She was 6 foot tall and probably 350 lbs... and I had to put my hands inside her sweaty shirt to fix her shit so she could go back on stage to do some more fighting. 
[Because of this story, I have an inter-quest to go on.....any idea of what season/episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ah7zq?context=5)|Ummmm... it was shot in december or january of 2009/2010. I have seen the episode before I will try to look for it too! its a great one, and the individuals involved were well... the only way to describe them is ""grey"" if that makes any sense..

 |These two images are the only proof I could find, they are emails from my immediate supervisor. Photos or other proof isn't something I do have as we were not allowed to take pictures of the studio. 
[Need any help with print screen on a mac?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4alb2t?context=5)|HAHA I had to google how to do it, I'm in a classroom on campus and I am mactarded.
[Does Jerry ever have relations with any of the chicks in the audience?  Are there really groupies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac33h?context=5)|The security guards won't let anyone near him :( 
 |The security guards won't let anyone near him :(
 |I did not see groupies. I was taking a guest out on a smoke break and walked past the makeup room with her, everyone jumped and told me to go back to her green room. Jerry just stood up and introduced himself to us both and that was that. 
[How is Steve Wilkos?  I mean is he cool or a doucher?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac5qk?context=5)|He's a cool doucher I guess. His show is some FUCKED UP SHIT. That's the heavy stuff and his wife is the exec producer. He always makes comments about sex when it comes up and it always looked super awkward for her. 
 |Jerry was way chiller, less egocentric for sure. 
[Its funny to me when he gets into it with people on his show, gets in their faces, and throws the chairs around and wont let them ""sit on his stage"".   hahahaa.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac7ya?context=5)|The men hate going on the show... I wonder why. 
[Thats like judge Judy. Even if i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt i was in the right, being a male, i would NEVER go on judge Judys show. Shes a hateful cunt. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ak564?context=5)|Except Id go on a court show... no matter if you win or lose the case, the show pays for it... good way to get out of getting sued by someone. 
[What was the most amount of boobs you've seen in 1 episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4acg1k?context=5)|I dont want to recall because they were all fucking gross. 
[How awesome are the bitch fights? Anything epic ever happen that didn't actually make it on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac0yz?context=5)|So much better when wigs or flowers are involved. And basically everything goes in. 
 |Jerry's little stand up act before is cool, but itis the same every time. 
[Does it actually ever help anyone?  after the huge confessions do they actually work out their problems backstage and go home happier than they came in?  or is it like you said mostly for tv and nothing really changes between the people who have problems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adrb7?context=5)|Yeah basically its just women hating their baby daddy... they leave still hating their baby daddy but at least they have 5 or so packs of cigarettes when they leave and get to take a limo to the airport. 
[Would you and the guests have fun choosing clothes to portray a certain image? Were any people completely different when they talked to you compared to when they were on stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac1jp?context=5)|The wardrobe was my FAVORITE PART. I couldn't believe what these girls thought looked good... But it wasn't really up to them. The production assistants told me what they were going for... Slutty, pure, etc. from there I pulled clothes and brought them to the green rooms. Basically nothing was slutty or trashy enough, they wanted everything too small, or something with a terrible fit every time. 
 |Trannies aka t girls are the worst. Try stuffing a fat ass man foot into heels that people have to wear again and again. Ugh.

[How was Jerry like towards you or other employees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac5gm?context=5)|Met him once, but it was a genuinely pleasant interaction.

How is it possible to only met the host once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahn3u?context=5)|H is just the host. He comes there, does the show, leaves. When I was working there he was also doing dancing w the stars, so he was commuting from ct to Vegas. 
[Is Jerry nice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ac7rw?context=5)|No but basically everyone wanted to know how much weed costs. Ya know since guns and pot are related and all.

[How often would the people who call the toll free number actually appear on the show, given how you've explained the importance of hired actors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4agsu7?context=5)|HAHA this was hilarious- I worked in studio and production. Production was when I would dress the guests take them places etc... when I worked in the studio department it was basically calling people who had signed up for free tickets, or who have come to the show before to get them to come again. Very rarely did people call about the ""question of the day"" or whatever it was, but usually it was a woman crying about getting abused, about her daughter, or something equally sad. It was always really fucking awkward, bc what is an intern supposed to say to these people? so I just transferred the call to a dead line..

s29ja,0,2012-04-10,My story,ADHDthrowaway101,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s29ja/my_story/,"Hi /r/adhd, I just discovered this subreddit and after reading a lot of comments that I could relate to I decided to just sort of spill my story and heart out.  Please excuse me if the writing gets sloppy at some points.  It's late at night and I've been drinking a few beers...

So I'm 21 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 1st grade, which I believe was around the time when ADHD was starting to become more well known and understood.  I can't recall how much it affected my childhood and it's not really important to this conversation so I won't really go into it.  

You know what, let me get to my main points because I'm starting to feel less and less motivated to do this, so let me get this out quickly before I just abandon it altogether 0_o.  Fuck it I'm going James Joyce 'stream of consciousness'...

About two years ago (summer before junior year) I started to feel very depressed.  During that summer I started my first job as an intern and hated it.  I hated working for people, I hated being told what to do, I hated doing bullshit tasks etc.  Around that time I also started self-studying philosophy, which I've continued to do since then.  I feel I've become a lot more intelligent since I've started studying philosophy, but at the same time I've felt more depressed by doing it.  Ecclesiastes 1:17-18 really speaks to me there (I'm atheist btw).

Also I'm a virgin.  Not exactly an easy thing to say, even anonymously on the internet.  Never had a girlfriend, but I don't think I'm ugly and I can generally talk to girls pretty well.  I think I have an appearance issue though.  I always have to see how I look in a mirror and I'm generally uncomfortable with how I look, so I always feel that girls will just find me repulsive for whatever reason, despite deep down I know I'm rather attractive. I guess I always I always have these fear that I'm being judged around strangers or acquaintances as well.  I think I'd be a pretty baller boyfriend, I would just love nothing better to cuddle the shit out of whatever girl I'd be dating.  I really can't think of anything better than to get under the covers, spoon like a boss, and listen to that rainymood.com site for hours.  This all has been a large influence on my depression obviously.  

I have almost no motivation to do anything.  I have a bad habit of not doing my dishes and when my roommates asks me to do them I get really pissed off, despite the fact that I know I should really do my dishes.  I guess I have a really hard time being told what to do.  My major is marketing, but I fucking hate it.  I feel like college has been a general waste.  I really really hate being taught.  I have a test tomorrow and I'm looking at the book and the chapters that are supposed to be on the test and I just couldn't care less.  Despite this I still love to learn, as I mentioned before, I like to read a lot of philosophy books and I also like studying science, and economics, history, politics, psychology etc. but only if I choose to on my own.  I took a philosophy class last semester and dropped it after three days because I was starting to lose interest in it just because someone was teaching it to me.  what the fuck?  Does anyone else feel that way too?  I have this really strong desire to write a screenplay, write poetry, write song lyrics etc. but it's hard to bring myself to do any of it, and when I do I cross it out thinking it's just not good enough.

So I'm about to graduate college soon and I am trying to find a job.  And by trying I mean I've done very little about it.  Mostly it's my father who has been pushing me to send my resume out, make contacts etc. but I feel that if I get out of college and get a job in marketing, my brain will just collapse in on itself.  I wouldn't be able to handle it.  For the last few months I've been obsessing over just taking some menial job.  I was looking at some of the top thread in this subreddit, and I noticed some comments in which the redditors stated that they would like to just do menial tasks like gardening or painting.  I really wouldn't mind working at Barnes and Noble or even fucking McDonalds.  But what the hell am I supposed to do with the rest of my life?  I still what to live normally (whatever the hell that means).

I take medicine for my ADHD, and it helps me to think clearly, but I can't use it forever.  I can't really talk to anyone when I'm on it, so it wouldn't be practical to take at work or whatever.  So it's like a lose-lose situation.  If I take it at a job I'm asocial.  If I don't take it I can't think clearly.  

I was supposed to call my dad on sunday about emailing a friend of his regarding job contacts.  Still haven't done it yet.  I think I'm just going to call my parents tomorrow and tell them there's no way in hell I can get a ""real"" job right now.  I just can't do it.  What the hell should I do?  I'd really just rather sit on my ass all summer and read, sleep, relax etc maybe work at Barnes and noble.  But I really can't get by in life with this sort of overall mindset going on.  I want a normal life (again, not entirely sure what that means) but I don't see how it's possible for me to get one.

I feel like I could do a lot of great things with my life if all these issues were constraining me."
s26t3,2,2012-04-10,I don't want to go home after school is over. Anyone have any experience with my situation?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s26t3/i_dont_want_to_go_home_after_school_is_over/,"My parents don't treat me poorly, so it's not like I'm in a Harry Potter-like living situation, but I dislike how reliant I am on their welfare and we aren't currently speaking to each other due to recent events. 

I don't have any job experience, and I'm broke as all hell. I haven't had much money in my accounts for as long as I can remember and today after school has been paid for I've got less than $60 to my name and I'll have to reserve all that for food.

Do any of you have any suggestions for how I can land a job when I don't have any prior experience to put on a resume? Do I just mass apply everywhere and hope they overlook that fact? Does it even matter that I don't have job experience in anything? Every job application I've ever seen seems to require previous employment history.

I'm a 4th year computer science major but honestly I don't feel like I've learned much so I'm reluctant to try for an internship in my field. At any rate, I'd like to build up some capital so I can hopefully rent a cheap apartment while continuing to work and pay off loans.

Any suggestions at all would be pretty helpful. If you read through all that, thanks - in a way, I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head.

**tl;dr** Broke, need money to live away from home, what do?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How did he feel about the new definition of Santorum?  Did he actively have people working on changing the google results in the earlier days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as983?context=5)|He would never stop talking about that. He hated it so much. He did have many people working on it. I actually made an effort to contact google (although I knew it would be fruitless) to remove it.
[Who do you plan to support as a republican candidate now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as9s9?context=5)|Ron Paul.
[If i was an American I too would support Ron, but in all honesty, do you think there is a chance that he could become the Republican presidential candidate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbj8?context=5)|As Joe Shmoe, I would say no. But after taking years of Pol Sci, I have learned that it is a possibility, I would give him a 1:4 chance 
[Now we all know Santorum was a bit *enthusiastic*, to put it nicely, as were some of his followers... But what people didn't focus on it seems... Were people who protested his ways were equally or even more *enthusiastic* sometimes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)|Good question. A popular thing was to wear ""spreading santorum"" shirt to his rallies, speeches, etc; that reeeally got on his nerves. Another was many gay couples would get as close to him as they could and kiss. Although I found these both humorous (as they arent violent or very insulting), he didn't like it, and spoke out about it a few times 
[**Question**: What was the craziest thing you say someone do to protest his campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)| 
[One thing Santorum said that made you lose respect for him?  One thing Santorum said that made you gain respect for him.  Best and worst memory of your time employed there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Best is when one tie Karen Santorum wasn't replying to his calls for ab out 30 minutes, and he got very nervous an worried that she was in an accident or something. It really showed a compassionate human side to him few see. Worst memory was the one listed above, it demoralized many staff members.
[Which one of the last two ""Won out""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Obviously the first one, which is a reason I left.
[Alright... Since you're unemployed you should spend some of your free time watching Doctor Who... It's really good, and reddit becomes much more interesting when you get **all** the references...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as3q6?context=5)|Hahaha, thank you. I will check it out.
[Did you actually support his opinions or were you in it for the money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arli5?context=5)|To be honest, I did this for the work experience, as a younger guy with a pol sci major, not many jobs are available, and within those, it's better if you don't pick and choose with your beliefs. My beliefs never interrupted him, as I never brought them up much. So, this is really just to get deeper into the political field  
[Hate to tell you this, but in the world of DC, it's pretty much impossible to switch sides. Once you've worked for a republican, it will be VERY hard for you to get a job with a democrat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asczm?context=5)|I understand that. But, as said, I am conservative. I just don't agree with all of Santorum's ideas.
[Did he ever have any advisers tell him that he was already seen as so far to the right, it would not hurt to make some comments that would make him more appealing to the middle? To a lot of people, he just came off as crazy, and even if he won the primary, would stand no chance to Obama. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asrkj?context=5)|Many did. One said that ""the trip going back to the center would be a tougher one than staying where you are""
[How did you get the gig? Are you from PA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxl9?context=5)|I spent my childhood there. My aunt knew him and knew I had a pol sci major, and she helped me out as an intern, but when the camp found out I had a major from a good school, they told me I could be an aide. Really straightforward. I did hesitate though.
[What were your responsibilities, and how much did you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqm5?context=5)|Another good one. It ranged from helping his wife on camp-related errands, to researching speech venues, to typing up posters, and writing letters to various organizers and event hosters, to even getting him things he needed (yes, I did get him a Peets coffee one time)
[Have you ever noticed the religiousness among his staff members? Are your colleagues as religious as Santorum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbu4?context=5)|Most were, I tried to keep my atheism downplayed. There were a few others like me, but not many.
[What are your personal political and religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqce?context=5)|Conservative-Libertarian. Atheist.
[*Atheist.*  Something tells me you never bothered mentioning this to Rick...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4artsz?context=5)|Yeah. It somehow slipped my mind when we talked...
[What was it like working for arguably one of the craziest Republican candidates in history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arm8p?context=5)|Tough at times, although he was a very nice guy around the office, he did have a bit of a temper. Again, I don't agree with much of his views, but he's a nicer guy than people make him out to be. He was one of the biggest gentleman I've seen when Karen (wife) was around 
[Oh I'm not saying he wasn't a nice guy, but when a nice guy says half the shit he did...kinda scares the shit out of me that a guy like that could be seriously considered a presidential nominee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqis?context=5)|He was a very outspoken candidate. And many are, and that works well for many of them. It didn't work out too well for him though 
[It seemed to me like he was always very defensive and would be hard to correct. Did anyone ever correct him ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as144?context=5)|Not many tried, he had a temper and he liked to stay in control of things.
[Blah people* What are your feelings about glitter bombs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arswi?context=5)|More annoying than effective. I've seen two I believe.
[Did he ever strike you as someone who really should be president ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as5bn?context=5)|It depends. At times, yes. At times, no. I would say he did have moments where I saw him as someone with really good ideas. And also, at time where he...didnt.
[Is this guy as big an asshole as he seems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arkfi?context=5)|I expected this from reddit :) Although I don't agree with his politics or religion too much, he didn't talk turkey with us too much around the office(s). He was actually a very nice, and respectful guy to me and my coworkers.
[Don't get me wrong.  I don't dislike him for his politics.  He just seems to have issues with anyone different than him.  As a woman, I have a REAL problem with many of the things he has said.  College? Not necessary.  Yet, he and his wife have degrees.  Problems with public eduation?  Why fix them, when he has the ability to home school his children?  Black?  Why help them, when they are obviously NOT part of his target market.  Those are the things that make him an asshole, in my opinion.  I don't care if he is too religious or too conservative.  That's his choice.  But does he really have to make off-handed comments that are so hurtful to so many? EDIT: to add words I omitted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arpit?context=5)|There isn't a real way to answer that, from my opinion. He could be harsh at times, but so can anyone. Also, the media jumping on him (whether he was right or wrong) just amplified things to hell.
[Have you ever looked back at the Santorum Campaign, with the 'JFK makes me sick' and other recent statements, and say ""I got out at a good time?""  Also, for proof, maybe by showing an official letterhead memo with names/numbers removed in sharpie or blurred.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aseit?context=5)|Of course, I got out before it really hit the fan. And yes, I'll look for a memo. I had to turn in most of the office stuff I kept, but I should have one.
[Did you ever meet his wife, and if so, were they crazy together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arocr?context=5)|His wife is a great woman, and they actually seemed to get along very well. She was supportive of him throughout my time there (til Jan.)
[After Herman Cain, none of the candidates seemed to appeal directly to the Tea Party. Balance the budget immediately, cut back on trade with China, limit immigration. ( my spin of what the Tea Party stands for. ) Why did none of the candidates take the tea party seriously? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asgp8?context=5)|Again, its hard to answer questions like that. My guess is that Santorum did want to distance himself form the far-right (as you know he didnt do well though)
[Yeah, gonna need some proof for this one before the karma train leaves the station.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arl4e?context=5)|Understandable request. What can I do for you? Scan a document from him? (probably with some things redacted)

s42ui,2,2012-04-11,Should i contact an ex after many years together and she does not know i received a transplant? ,Porthios,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s42ui/should_i_contact_an_ex_after_many_years_together/,"Long time lurker first time poster (i think first time poster anyways) So im sure many people are rolling their eyes thinking not another one of these. But hear me out.

When i was 18 i lost both my kidneys (unknown cause) None of my family members where a match so i had to take dialysis. It was a rough first year my test results would come back horrible. Seem like i was not taking care of myself but i though i did. I would ask the staff for advice and i was getting some but none that help me out. 
Then one saturday during treatment i meet this wonderful tech (lets call her... Jane) Jane looked young to be there and i though she was an intern but lo and behold not only was she not one, but she had been working as a tech for ages. I got to know her through her working every fortnight on saturdays. One day she saw how bad i felt and she began to just sit down and talk. Nothing in particular just sit and talk, and man that helped so much.
Fast forward a few months and she changed her schedule just to be able to see me more often. Shortly after we began to date. Now i know many people say this but she saved my life not once but twice.
Here is why i say that, first she took over my whole medical chart and looked it over, asked questions to doctors and even had me change my doctor for another one. Not only did the new doctor change my medication he also told me about things i did not know. Sure enough a few weeks pass and i began to feel better and my test results proved that. Thanks to her i dont think i would have changed doctors as i figured this was how i was supposed to feel. 
So number 2, there was a time when i began to feel pain in my side. Not horrible pain just uncomfortable pain. She always told me to go get it looked at, but being stuborn i said it would just go away. A few days later she knocks on my door, she doesnt get an answer so she opens it and goes it (yes she had a key) and there i was in bed in extreme agony. She doesnt say anything just picks my butt up, now you have to understand she is like 5'0 125lbs soaking wet she just hauled my butt to the hospital where i had my appendix taken out. Doctors say if she didnt bring me in i would have died because my appendix was ready to burst. 
So basically I hold her in the highest of regards. 

Time passed and i did ask her to marry me, and she accepted, but we ended up splitting up. I think it was due to myself getting too comfortable in the relationship that i just took advantage of her thinking she would always be there. Anyways i transfer clinics because i knew it would be hard to see her, but i always remembered what she said about how to take care of myself and never forgot. 
Two years later i received my transplant. I wished she was there because i know without her i may have never lived enough to receive one. 
Now i think back and i would love to tell her thank you, thank you for what you taught me for what you did for me but also thank you for loving me at a time i though i was done. I know she is married now and i am happy for her, all i wanted for her is to be happy and if that was not with me then oh well. But i sit here and think, i would love to tell her thanks.
So i know where her folks live and was thinking, should i go and just drop off a note? Maybe ask her mom for her number? 
Its been around 5 years since we last spoke and i just feel if more time passes the more likely it is something will happen where i will never get a chance to say thanks. By that i mean she moves i move whatever. 
So Reddit what do you guys think? Im i just being retarded and should just leave well enough alone, or should i try to thank her?

Thanks for any advice guys and gals.

TL;DR  Girlfriend showed me how to take care of myself after losing kidneys and wanting to know if after 5 years and a transplant later should reach out and say thanks. "

I only know the very basics of only 3 programming languages.  Java, C, and Python.  Not enough to code anything fancy.  I have no projects outside of school because i don't like programming enough to do it outside of school.  I spend most of my free time working on recording and playing music.  I've been reading some posts here and have read that a lot of companies ask ""so what projects have you been working on, on your free time""  it makes me laugh to think that i would be replying with ""nothing"".

I feel like if i were to go in to a technical interview right now, i would not know how to go about doing anything, and would just stand there like an idiot.  Yet somehow, i've gotten A's on all coursework relevant to my major.  I still don't know how i managed to get any of that, surprises me.  I don't think it's a good representation of what i actually know at all.

so some might ask well then why are you a CS major?  Well the answer is because i'm doing it as a compromise.  I sit in front of a computer for a majority of the day so i felt it was natural to get a degree in something computer related.  I wasn't expecting this though.  The alternative career path i used to pursue (music) is not an option at this point, as it very difficult to make a decent living at it.

Oh and to make matters worse, the internship that i thought i had set up for the summer just fell through.  I need the internship for college credit, and without it, i won't be able to graduate when i planned to.  At this point it's really difficult to find a replacement,  basically causing me a crap load of stress, something i don't need right now.

At this point i'm just taking it day by day, and trying to ride the wave as long as i can.

One thing i realized that i do not want for a career is one where it seems like i am constantly working.  I know people who are programmers and they work 60 hour weeks and then bring work home almost every day.  Screw that crap, that's something i don't want.  My motto is that life is too short to have to endure a garbage life like that.  My goal is to find something where i can comfortably support myself while maximizing my free time to pursue things i actually like.  I understand a lot of people never achieve something like that, but it's what i am going to strive for.

At this point i'm just going through the motions of school,  and i have this overwhelming feeling that I won't be successful in this field.  I do not know what I am doing."

Since then I've fixed numerous IT issues within the company and have gotten the place to be pretty stable overall. 

Fast forward to today, when I arrived I was immediately pulled in to a meeting. There I was told basically this, ""you've done a great job around here and we want to thank you, but we're cutting you back to 20 hours a week since things are running so smoothly.” I told them this would be a financial disaster for me and their only response was ""well, have your parents help you"" which is definitely not an option. So starting next week my income is going to be halved. I started applying for other jobs because I can't afford rent/tuition/food/transportation with only 20 hour a week paychecks. I can make it about 1 month before I'm financially tapped out, and I know the job market is horrible. I feel I'd be better of financially if I got myself fired and started collecting unemployment, but I fell like that's the morally wrong thing to do. What are my options?"
s6wjv,1,2012-04-12,"Hi reddit! Student here, repeated pattern of harassment by college security + bullshit ""disciplinary hearings"", crushed my spirit + mental health. Should I sue? Is there risk in suing? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s6wjv/hi_reddit_student_here_repeated_pattern_of/,"[apologies, but this was extremely long. If not interested, skim or don't read!]

OK, throwaway account because my primary is for joyful humor. But this is personal and painful. I'll try not to vent and write this factually instead of emotionally...

During my 2 years at this fucking hellhole, I learned that students were to show no evidence of any conflict with staff whatsoever. It was like they had an itchy-trigger finger when it came to calling security, and then charges and punishment were doled out without ever understanding WHAT crime had supposedly happened. I believe it was a clear case of mis-using (illegally?) security to retaliate against complaints. It was like they had used Kafka's The Trial as a how-to-manual.


I had never seen a campus, (or any community institution besides a jail) with such a mercilessly authoritarian attitude. Being a jewboy hippy who does not take bullshit from any petty tyrants, I stood up for myself when the epic incompetence of the college reared its head. There were 3 occasions over the last 2 years in which my solidarity with the underdogs of this earth called me to action. Each time, security was used (illegally, I'm assuming) to retaliate against my complaints. The main part of this story are the three confrontations by security, so skip to those below if you want.) Alternately, here's some back-story to put those events in perspective:

***


**BACK-STORY: (skip this part if you want)**
I have attended 4 colleges. Good grades, full-time class load. Unfortunately, each time I transferred (for marriage/divorce/relocation reasons) each new college summarily rejected about half my earned credits. Due to this, I am now in my EIGHTH year of college (finishing my very last class now!) but I will only have achieved a (standard 2-year) associates degree. Needless to say, 8 years of debt (near $50,000) for a 2-year degree is depressing. I could have been on my way to a phd by now! I was shocked to learn that my human services program requires 90-some credits, yet I had by now earned **233** credits, almost all in my field of study! Needless to say, by the time I enrolled in this college 2 years ago, I was fed up and determined to just finish school and get the damn piece of paper as soon as possible. Attending this college was one of the worst mistakes of my life.


Now, due to my previous 6 years of education, I expected to be advanced toward the end of their human services program and wrap things up with an internship and a few classes. Instead, I was actually denied information on WHICH classes I still needed for my degree! The best anyone would do is give me their ""best guesses"" on what courses to take-- many of which had taken 2 or 3 times before, and had to pay for. After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. There were also many, many mistakes by the degree evaluators such as losing my official transcripts, getting my name wrong, etc. that held up the process. To give you an idea of the incompetence, even last term, two years into their ""program"" my advisers told me to register for 4 ""best guess classes"" (well over $1,000) and later told me I didn't need any of them! (this was not an isolated incident, it was what I'd been dealing with and paying for for 2 years). After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. I had reached the limit of my patience and started demanding some answers. Thus begins the tale of my harassment by security...

***

**Bullshit Event #1-**
-Was given a grant from the school, an advance on my financial aid so I could buy books at the bookstore. Waited in line over 2 hours (they pack us in like sardines here), they told me I didn't have access to that grant. I showed proof, asked for manager. She personally ok'd my proof, sold me a computer and signed the form. Go back next day, wait in line 2 hours, cashier again refuses to accept my grant money for books. Told her I already went through this with the manager and showed her proof. She refuses and gets very ghetto and macho with me, while 200 students wait in line behind us. As I leave, defeated + book-less a security guard approaches and gives me a piece of paper. This tells me to appear at a ""judicial hearing"" in which I am sat down in a creepy back office with security guards and college officials who tell me I could be expelled. Outraged, I tell them that a disagreement in the bookstore has nothing to do with security-- I hadn't broken any rules or done anything wrong besides disagreeing with a cashier about my right to spend my own money.
They act like they are doing me a favor by banning me from the bookstore. When I take one step toward the bookstore window to simply ask if I was allowed to get my bus-pass they hand out there, they call security again. I never yelled at or threatened anyone ever.

***

**Bullshit Event #2**
As I say, this gulag is incompetent. Their system seem to generate alot of automated form letters cancelling our financial aid over + over, and then when you go to dispute them (since they make no sense), no one will take responsibility- they just say ""our computers sent the cancellation, whether we agree with it or not you need to do an appeal (40 day process). I've gotten 3 such letters, and each time after the appeal they put you on probation for a term. The 2nd one, well, I got this one week prior to an internship at a homeless shelter. I had spent the last month interviewing at places to find an internship as I was told to, and was hired at a great place. (they later offered me a job!)

Now, even though they admitted the financial aid robo-cancellation was bullshit, they insisted I go through the 40-day apeal process. I explained that I could not start my internship without financial aid, since I couldn't pay out of pocket, and that I needed someone in administration to waive the bullshit rob-cancellation so I could start work. I began seking a meeting with anyone who would listen in the administration building- BIG. MISTAKE. The attitude I found was that student DO. NOT. request meetings with administration. Even to walk in and speak to secretaries there was regarded as ""suspicious"". I was actually told it was ""illegal"" for students to speak to the vice president. When some nasty woman told me it was illegal, I took out a pen and asked for her full name and if for the record she was stonewalling me, that I was not allowed to even make an appointment with someone. Never yelled at or threatened anyone. She was not concerned about her safety- she was obviously angry and disgusted with me, and she grabbed the phone, called security. 

As I left the building, defeated, 3 security officers drove up to me on scooters, surrounded me, and told me ""the vice-president's office wants me ""trespassed""  (odd, since I was not allowed to make an appointment with her)..... They said they might have to track me by my cell phone (I did not have one) so they could tell if I was near campus. Luckily, one guard took a liking to me since I was from NY (City, USA, once upon a time), said people talk differently there than the ""flakey west coast"" (true) and told me to go home and have a beer. I did. However,  I also filed a formal student complaint (in hopes of getting approval to start my new internship). They never responded to the complaint, one woman said ""because I didn't remember to sign it"" (I did, had photocopy to prove it). They did informally respond to it by waiving my 2nd financial aid cancellation and letting me do my internship, yet they made me attend another creepy back-room disciplinary hearing with security guards and officials who now had ""proof"" I was a repeat-offender with some kind of supposed aggressive tendencies, and acted as if I was menacing or harassing staff. They made ALOT of references to school shootings (I found their use of that tactic *unbelievably* offensive.) and said if anything happened again I would be expelled.

***

**Bullshit Event #3**

After 2 years of endless meetings with my advisers, the dean, degree evaluators, and counselors, they still would not give me any information on when I would graduate or what classes I actually still needed to get my degree. Keep in mind I had been relentlessly seeking this information for 2 years and was at that time (as usual) being told to take over $1,000 of classes they then admitted I did not need. I had just dropped a grueling writing class near end-of-term which they casually mentioned I didn't need, and my bill for next term (based on bullshit ""best-guesses) was comming due soon. I had had enough. So I went to disability services. I have a disability (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) but in my 8 years of college I have NEVER mentioned that to any teacher or counselor before- I wanted no special treatment and I wanted to prove I could graduate without their ""accommodations"".  I filed an Americans with Disabilities Act Complaint (like my formal student complaint, no response to this either after months, other than an email saying ""this doesn't seem to apply to you"").

 I also went to the regular counseling department and said I felt like I was heading for a nervous breakdown. The counselor sent me to her superior, I told him the same thing and then asked for help. He was not there to help me. He chastised me for seeking guidance from too many people and smugly said I should get a lawyer."" I asked one last thing- I said ""So 8 years of full-time credits, $50,000 in debt, and no answer on even when I could HOPE to graduate?"" He told me again to get a lawyer and so I just picked up my things, shook my head in disgust, and walked out. I think it was my evident disgust that unleashed the most epic shitstorm yet: A woman came out and said the head of the counseling department wanted to see me. I thought ""OK, I'll give this one last try"" and sat flipping through a newspaper. In a minute SEVEN security guards filed into the room and I could see them talking with the smug tool I had just seen. I knew they were for me. The head of counseling came out and asked me if I was alright in a condescending voice, like she was talking to a small child. I said ""Sure. These seven security guards aren't here to see me by any chance are they?"" She said no, and I got up to leave. The security guards followed me and surrounded me. I asked if they were ticketing me with something. They said no, so I went to walk away. They followed me and surrounded me again (at this point I was confused- like ""either give me a damn ticket or let me go, don't fricken stalk me!"" They acted like they were in riot formation or something, like football players in a scrimmage line, trying to pen me in. They eventually let me go and told me they wern't going to charge me with anything. I went to class. 

As I was leaving psychology class two security guards swooped down on me and took up their formation/scrimmage line thing. They gave me a ticket and had me backed up against a wall in front of my peers. This is when I cracked. I said rather loudly ""IO HAVE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. MY FATHER BEAT ME AND MY MOM TO A BLOODY PULP ALL THE TIME. I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. YOU PEOPLE ARE STALKING ME AND IT IS WRECKING HAVOC ON MY MENTAL HEALTH!""   (true story. oh well, at least he's dead. rot in hell dad!)

Thus begins the final chapter of this long macabre tale. I attend my 3rd disciplinary hearing in that creepy back-room with security guards, some semi-judge dude, and a friend and a Disability Services counselor there as advocates. [20/20 hindsight- should have brought a damn lawyer!]. I was sure I was getting expelled. The meeting was 2 hours of hell. I was sweating bullets and just generally miserable in life. I wanted nothing more than to never step foot on that campus again, but I COULD. NOT. let them steal my degree after 8 years of college. They didn't expel me. They pulled my file and finally made a judgement on when I could graduate. They said I needed only ONE more class (obviously someone was pulling strings to get me out before I either went nuts or sued them). But the guy who made the decision to put me on probation told me not to speak to anyone besides one disability counselor. He has since been tracking me, and appearing out of nowhere, as if he has appointed himself my watchmen, and very aggressively threatening me for such things as sending an email to the financial aid department (to appeal my 3rd financial aid robo-cancellation) and for requesting a form from the registration window. I have alot of rage toward this guy, since he has the power to expel me and has basically said ""you cannot speak to a single person (except the one lady) or use any services at this school, nomatter how trivial. If his goal is to make me feel as alienated, isolated, and quarantined like an infected outcast, he has. The good news is my very last class is an independent study I can do from home and I don't need to go to that macabre place ever again, except to walk in graduation which I have mixed feelings about to say the least.... I'm almost free!!!


The End...?


***

**Now, if anyone is still reading this:**

1) Do I have grounds to sue?  (I have kept every complaint form, scrap of paper, email, and timeline of events in case I do). What would my accusation(s) be legally? What would I be asking for besides a letter of apology? I don't really crave money, but is that how it works?

2) Is this wise?  The corruption of this institution knows no bounds. Nothing would surprise me at this point, such as the school claiming I was harassing, menacing, or terrorizing staff, or just fucking lying in any way that could hurt me if I sue?

3) Should I play the disability card? It's true I have PTSD, but it's embarrassing to me and I hate the idea of having to admit that I am broken in some ways, and that the real damage the school caused me was exacerbating the symptoms of that (nightmares, panick attacks, etc).  I have wondered if some kind of Americans with Disabilities complaint to some college-oversight ethics committee might be more appropriate than a lawsuit.

4) I should mention, I HATE anything to do with lawyers and court. I had one minor trial that was hell, and I have seen court destroy a dear friend of mine. Reddit always say ""lawyer up"" but could I be getting myself into a HUGE mess here if I do? Does the college have the right to counter-sue me and could I get charged and convicted of their bullshit claims?

5) If I decide to just put this behind me, do you think I should walk in graduation? (Or is that like having a cute little tea party with your previous captors, if you know what I mean?) And most
important of all, how do you think I should get the feelings of rage and resentment out of my heart now?


**TL;DR: I had genuine complaints against an incompetent college. They used campus security and judicial hearings to retaliate and make my life misreable for 2 years. Wat do?**"

I have slipped into the sysadmin arena over the last month or so messing with AD on Windows Server 2008 as I would like to have a little background in this. Our domain is at a 2008 level if that needs to be said too. 

Let me start off by stating how they add users to the domain:

1. They copy a current, lets say customer service account, and create the new user.
2. They then plug-in the pc at the desk, etc, etc.
3. The domain admins log in to the pc with their domain accounts and add the CS users domain account to the local admins group, and then they are done.

To me this sounds TERRIBLE, local admin domain accounts? This is not the way it should be in my mind. How would you traditionally in a business structure add users to the domain? I don't think adding them locally to the admins group is correct, but I could be wrong since I am new to this.

EDIT: I just learned 5 minutes ago, this is how they do it on servers as well. WOW. I just looked at the file server, and there are atleast 50 accounts in the local admin group that are non-existent or the employee left."

I am writing this because I need to point out some things. I don't think you realize your actions and their effects. I really can't forgive you for all the shit you've done to me over the years. Your recent bullshit has sent me way over the edge and I'm not going to keep silent on it anymore.


When I was 11 you decided to get rid of Mark who was the only person that was a good influence in my life. I know he isn't and wasn't a bad guy. Who did you replace him with? That asshole Nick, the guy I got into 2 physical fights with as a kid. I had to put up with his shitty parenting up until your divorce, which by the way was shitty of you to cheat on him with Rob. That's dirty shit. But even before that happened you were a raging alcoholic who would argue at night and keep me up. Remember that time when I was 10 and you and Igor went to the bar and I wanted to go home but you wanted to stay and drink? I do. Fucking shitty parenting. Remember that time I got an internship and you and that fucking drunk Alex decided to get shit faced until 3am  and cause a ruckus? Remember how I had to sleep on the train before i went to my first day to that internship? I DO. Remember how you called the cops on me when I wanted to pull your ass out of the bars because you were getting shit faced? I DO. Remember that time you called the cops on me when I wouldn't clean my room? I DO. Remember how I left the house when I was 21 working a full time job and going to school because I couldn't live with you because you would talk shit when you got home drunk? I DO. You remember how you asked me to come home and help pay rent when you lost your job and to pick up sophia? I DO. I didn't give you shit about it I helped you without giving you shit about anything. I can give you so many more examples of how fucking shitty you've been during the years but I think even you can maybe get the point.


You know why I have asthma? It's because second hand smoke from when I was 12, you deffinetly needed to smoke in the kitchen and now I have asthma because of your selfish shit. You don't like calling the doctors for me? IT""S YOUR FUCKING FAULT I HAVE THIS SHIT TO LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF MY FUCKING LIFE. You are the direct cause of my disease, fuck you.

You upset you need to help me when I'm 27 so I can finish school? Guess whose fault that is? It's not mine, you created such a shitty environment for me and no stability whatsoever. Every time I do something good, you're there to fuck it up with your selfish bullshit and how you're suffering by having to deal with my mess. 

I grew up alone. I grew up with no father figure and a mother who put herself first. Literally from 18-27 I raised myself. And you wonder sometimes why I don't show my affection to you? Are you fucking kidding me? You're one of the shittiest people I've met. Any time I give you some trust you fucking shatter it, consistently.

This is how easy it is to prove you don't know shit about me:

What's my favorite music band?
What's my favorite video game?
What's my favorite movie?
What do I really want to do with my life?
Where is the first place I want to take a vacation to?

Can you even answer those questions for Sophia? You think you're so much better then Nick but you're the same, you think spending some money on someone is enough to pass the good parent test.

Now yet again you're fucking up my life with your most recent shenanigans, I now have a strained relationship with Qi the kid I knew since 5th grade. Real nice of you to put your problems with me on him, but then again that's what you do. Me and Diana didn't work out because of you, because you ruined my ability to trust in women.

You have a drinking problem and you can try to convince yourself otherwise but anyone whose spent a night with you and has any kind of brain whatsoever can tell you act like a complete senseless idiot.

In conclusion, I don't give a shit anymore. Cancel the phone, I am going to get a new one this weekend, you want to take me off your insurance, go for it I'll survive. I never deserved the shit you put me through , NEVER. 

You've done good in my life but it's doesn't outweigh the shit. To be frank I lost all respect for you since I was 18. I haven't had love for you since the day you kicked me out when I was 21. The only reason why I decided to do the things I did for you was because I am better than you. I don't shit on people when they're in need. 

I'm an amazing person. I have my faults and I've made shitty mistakes with Sophia. But I know more about her then you ever did about me. My greatest faults is that I'm messy, poor and take things for granted sometimes. All in all that's not bad and everyday I try a little harder to be better. But instead of recognizing this you decide to pick at the little shit all the time, you're a negative influence on my life. You couldn't keep your shit together for the 2 months I needed to graduate? 

When I yelled at you , you deserved every word and I hope that shit burns into your memory forever. The only thing that I feel bad about is that I let someone get to me like that.

Even if they are true? ,help12me34,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s5qc9/can_sending_conversations_to_a_persons_spouse/,"Okay reddit I really need help with this.

To avoid a long backstory (although details can be provided with requests), my ex-girlfriend made horrible false accusations against me to get marijuana charges that were not yet filed against me filed. She was successful, and while I got nailed with a felony selling three grams of weed, her felonies were all reduced to a summary offense and a one year no-contact order. Meanwhile, I had to transfer schools, lost a special degree I was going to get, lost my internships that would have given me a future career, and suffered from depression and anxiety from the reality that a girl I loved could do such a horrible thing to me. 

Well today, that no-contact order is long over, and now she's engaged. The thing is, she cheated on her fiance at least two times, and multiple people saw and know about it. I don't know this guy, but he needs to know what he's about to get into....quite literally. 

I have written conversations I had with one of her roommates who goes into detail about how many guys she cheated on her current boyfriend with (both she and her BF are named in the texts). They were on facebook, so you can clearly see who she is. I, however, am not visible.

If I were to print those out and send them to her BF (who is the fiance) - the guy I've never met and have no legal quarrel with - can I get in any kind of trouble? Especially legally - could it come back to bite me in the ass?

I also have pages and pages of private investigators reports on how she is a manipulative liar who fucks anything that moves from all of her friends and ex-boyfriends....so her credibility fails to exist with far more people than just me - it's more or less everyone she knows. 

What do you think? 

EDIT: whoops - poor choice of words in the title. SOON TO BE SPOUSE - they are engaged, not married yet. the point is to save this mans life from having to marry a sociopath. "

I've been trying to get better, but therapy isn't having a lasting effect. I'm taking antidepressants, but the medicine can only do so much. No, my real issue is with the point I'm currently at in life.

I guess I was smart, but now seeing people go about their lives getting internships and having hundreds of friends and making lifelong memories drives me to panic. I have wanted to do so much, but I feel that with my leave, all these plans will be postponed. 

Loneliness is at the core of my daily life. I'm an anxious person and can't help feeling inadequate when talking to mostly anyone. Going to school at an Ivy League, where people are rich and amazing, is a brutal reality check and reinforces my insignificance.

Despite my efforts at optimism, I really do feel excluded from everything interesting going on in the world. The depression is swamping me, and it's hard to hold back tears as I type this. There is this monster that has ripped me from my tentative spot on a trampoline to success, dragging me down into a canyon of despair.

I feel like I suck at everything. I even feel bad when I browse Reddit, because the experiences of people on here seem to outdo my own. 

I have contemplated a number of ways to end it, and I'm feeling that a train would be the most efficient course of action, as I don't own a firearm. I don't think anyone would care about a collision as much as they would cleaning up my guts if I shot myself. 

My only regret would be not having been born a different person, one with a rich social life, successful academic career, and life prospects. I will never have a wife, nor children. I would be ashamed for such people to exist when I am in this state. 

In my heart of hearts, I know this is taboo, and I'd like your thoughts on the matter before it becomes too much and I go to wait on the tracks."

Not to mention the many cultural and religious differences. We dated for almost the whole 3 weeks I was there (most amazing three weeks for both of us) and then decided to leave it at that, when I went back to my home country as it seemed crazy and not realistic to build a long distance relationship on such a spontaneous, short summer relationship. After I went back, we still talked a couple of times a week, and I couldn´t forget about him. And although we never talked about ""us"", I always hoped that he was still thinking about me too. So after 6 months of almost daily talking via Facebook and sometimes Skype, I decided to fly back to visit him and see what would happen. The moment I rang his door bell...most exciting moment of my life. When he opened the door, he kissed me almost immediately and we continued our relationship from the summer as if the 6 months hadn´t been between it. By this time I had already applied for a 6-months-internship in his hometown (I had to do an internship abroad for my university degree anyway), hoping that - if I could live there for a longer period of time - we could give this great relationship a real shot. Shortly after I left his hometown for the second time, I got accepted for an internship there. The minute I told him, he decided to come visit me in my home country for the first time and that´s the moment we decided to officially and exclusively be a couple. That was April 20th, 2011. Only two months after he visited me, my internship started and following were one of the best 7-months of my life. We are now back at a long distance relationship, but he´ll be moving to my home country in a couple of months and I couldn´t be happier. Had I not decided to fly back to visit him half a year after I had met him, I would have missed out on this amazing relationship. People told me I was crazy and that I didn´t even know this guy, when I decided to visit him again. Even he himself didn´t believe that all of this could ever work. Now he is thanking me for not giving up and following my heart :) Today is April 20th, 2012 - our one year anniversay!"

Made comments about a female in the student activities office being his girlfriend. Flirted with a female in our organization. She told him to stop and he laughed at her. He's the president of another club. Would bring random people into our office to have business meetings. Didn't do the things he was supposed to in his position on the exec board. I caught him lying. He always blamed other people for everything.

I go to the advisor and talk to the student conduct officer on a thursday. The next day at our meeting five people quit. He steps down from his position but continues going to meetings.

In the other club, he decides to have an event for speed dating. Puts an ad in the newspaper saying that wings is sponsoring it. They aren't and threaten to sue the school. The event never got approved and thus the ad was never supposed to go in the paper. He's friends with the editor in chief of the newspaper.

He decides to run to student trustee. Another candidate discovers guys passing out flyers smearing her name. She asks if the guy send them and one starts to say yes before the other shushes him.

I quit the organization I was in. He's still in it and is still president of the other thing. The results of the winning candidate are not in yet.

Can anything be done? Nobody else went to the advisor out of fear he turn everyone against them and make them look bad."
s7qkf,1,2012-04-13,My girlfriend got sexually harrassed by an ex-coworker yesterday and she's talking to the offender today on MSN like nothing ever happened. What do I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s7qkf/my_girlfriend_got_sexually_harrassed_by_an/,"Here's the full story:

Yesterday, my girlfriend had to go back to his old work place to get some internship certificates she needed to graduate. In the middle of that, she runs into one of her old co-workers who had a -major- crush on her (and still has, it seems.). They were good friends, and she told me all about it and how he kept gifting her roses and chocolate when she was doing her internship over there. I was like ""Well, you're being pretty straightforward and honest to me and I appreciate that, you can be friends with whoever you want anyway.""

Well, seems like he got pretty confident about himself yesterday, because he pulled her to a secluded place and ran her against a wall and tried to kiss her. My girlfriend got out of that position, in the meanwhile one of his bosses is walking down their way so she started talking to him normally so he wouldn't get in trouble I guess, I don't know why.

Fast forward today, she tells me everything that happened yesterday (the story above). We started chatting like the lovebirds we usually are until around 3am, since I had to go work early I give her my good night, sleep well etc. But she tells me she'll stay online for a couple more minutes since she's chatting on msn with someone else. I ask her who, out of curiosity?

The ex-coworker.

Naturally, I flip my shit at her asking her how the hell can she still talk to that son of a bitch after what she did to her. Then she literally tells me ""Well he tried to kiss me but he didn't make it, that's what counts right?""

I turned off my pc right away.

Am I overreacting here? She looked pretty surprised that I was mad, but come on, I was already lenient enough about her having him on his contact list even after the repeated attempts to take her away from me. But this is the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's strange because, we spent the whole night talking about our future and all that, I want to believe we're both in love and I don't want to do or say anything that might hurt our relationship without necessity, so that's why i'm asking here.

What do I do?

**Edit:** I might have been a bit extremist with the ""sexually harrassed"" on the post title, I don't know.

I'm a molecular bio major, which has completely nothing to do with CS.  Anyways, I have a few questions that needs answers in order for me to decide which route I want to take.
1. Does school matter?  I've read somewhere that the drop off is so significant between a school like MIT and Madison that unless this is what I have to choose between, it doesn't matter.  I would love to hear your opinions as it would help a lot with my decision.
2.  MS or BS?  I still need to take a handful of basic computer courses that are required for entry into a Master's program.  I probably have a lot of the gen-eds completed from my previous degree that would also fulfill CS BS requirements .  These required classes would also fulfill a BS requirement as well.  However, for a BS,  I would probably have to take Calc based physics and math beyond Calc 2.  I'm approximating about 2 years for either degree.  I guess my biggest concern is skipping undergrad and all its foundation courses to plunge into a graduate program.
3.  Is there anything else I can do to get a head start?  Time is definitely not on my side so any suggestions, even ""internship, ASAP"" would be wonderful.  I really have no idea where to start except enrolling community college courses.  I had a conversation with someone from work and he suggested looking for collaborative ""open source projects"".  And I found out about project-Eula on reddit, which I will check out after this.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your input!

I am in the middle of taking introductory (Java) programming series at community college (no prior programming experience). I also have applied to my state university's CS program, but it is very competitive and I won't know if I'm accepted until July at earliest. I think these are good first steps, but I really want to be doing more to learn and get experience. I am not really being challenged at all in my programming class. I could (and likely will) learn the rest of the course material within the next week or so. But other than that, what can I do? Learn another language? Try making Android apps? Read more advanced level textbooks? I tend to struggle/lose motivation with learning things on my own because I don't know what to learn next, but I can learn/work extremely quickly if I have some sort of structure to follow or a project to work on.

Another thing I have been thinking about is summer internships. Does already having a bachelor's degree disqualify me from internships? Is it even possible that anyone would hire someone with as little experience as I have? I live in the Seattle area if that's relevant. I know it's unlikely but the sooner I can get experience the better, and being unemployed I have ample time to learn."

I wanted to inquire about your use of Google / stackoverflow / etc for any of your programming projects, whether they were professional or personal. 

I'm currently a junior working towards a CSE degree &amp; work as a software engineering intern at a company, and I can't help but notice that as the classes have gotten harder and I've been writing professional code that I've been googling a TON more. Not necessarily for full-fledged solutions, however. Let me explain with an example. 

One of our projects for a web infrastructure class was building a tool that let us retrieve an HTML page. I knew how to do the TCP part but had no idea how to do the HTTP component on top of TCP, so I googled questions on how to write an HTTP component; I ended up finding a fully working solution. I didn't copy / paste the code, but I understood exactly what the solution was doing and re-fitted the function calls and steps to my own program. I feel sorta guilty that I googled a solution to a problem and ended up using it, but this class doesn't have a book nor a reference guide, so we're kinda on our own. Not only that, I made sure I understood WTH was going on, e.g. building a HTTP query as a string and sending away. So, I did feel like I learned, and I did not copy/paste because I altered the GET statement to my own needs. 

However, how often is this done? Is this something many other programmers do? Can you guys share your stories and perhaps let me know what it's like in a professional setting? I completely understand having things like php.net always open and googling for random errors, but what about situations like mine where you don't exactly know 100% what's going on, but use search engines to figure out what it is?"

I am socially awkward. I have a hard time connecting with other people, but am doing well academically. I am in shape and workout at the CRC more than a couple of times a week. 

I have recently overhauled my wardrobe a little by following some advice from [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice)  and searching former asksubreddit posts, I have started being myself? (not sure whether I am doing this wrong). I am a pro at small talk and then ejecting (Hey how's it going...nice..take care/have a good one) but I am so fucking alone that it kills me. On Fridays, my limited friends are playing some videogames, but mostly I've spent the past couple of weekends alone in my room or walking out and about because I am clueless about clubs/bars that I can get to without a car. Even if I did, I don't know people to go with. It seems like being in a frat, would have been a great option to have something to do on weekends, but I am 2 semesters away from graduation, and it's a rather fucking lonely place to be. 

Most of my attempts at talking to girls are epic fail too. I have been on a grand total of 2 dates this semester, but most girls I like, I am too chicken to talk to, or they are taken or the others I don't want to mess up the social friendship/acquaintance thing that I have going. In my classes, seems like everyone has their own groups, so I feel alienated in the class. And the only other place that I see girls that I'd be interested in talking to are at the CRC which I made a pact with myself not to do. Mostly because I'd much rather do my workout and let the girls do theirs besides I couldn't engage in such behaviour because if I were a girl, I'd probably think of the guy as creepy? Unless they know each other which seems like the norm for all frat/sorority people at the crc or in classes/etc. 

Anyway my life seems to be in a funk and I am not even sure why I am studying to be an engineer anymore. I am unsure about life post graduation as the limited (two) summer internships that I've had have lead me to believe that I fucking hate my guts working on some stupid analysis and optimization stuff.

Anyway, I already have a some extent of gamedev experience, so I'm thinking of skipping college/university and instead do internships as soon as I leave school. I'd say I'm a proficient programmer and a fast learner. Does anyone have experience with doing this? Reasons why I should or should not do it? How far is a college education actually gonna bring me in the 'real' gamedev world? Those are some things I wanted to know and I hope you can answer my questions.

Thanks in advance :) "
scsa0,0,2012-04-16,This is my own story of avoding suicide and my interpretation of suffering,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scsa0/this_is_my_own_story_of_avoding_suicide_and_my/,"I really didn't want to go to school because everything seemed so meaningless. The thought of cutting my veins kept occurring to me. I learned from an online post long ago that cutting your veins and soaking in a bathtub with warm water is the least painful way to die. I wish I do not need to live with the guilt and unbearable pain of loss. I wish death is the easy escape. However, I still managed to go to school with 15 min late, because I needed to turn in a take home exam; because I needed to get good grades from my class; because I needed good grades to get a good job; because I needed the money from the job to repay the tens of thousands of dollars my parents paid for my college, and make them happy the rest of their life. I still cannot let down the people that still love me.

But with the unbearable pain that I was afraid I was not the girl they thought I was. Yesterday I told my mom that my boyfriend proposed to me, my mom and I were both so excited and thrilled. From my mom's loving and happy expression, I suddenly felt I grew up and I was no longer a little girl, and I was a whole new fully matured woman capable to take responsibilities in life. Yesterday at this moment I felt like the happiest woman in the world with my boyfriend getting me the perfect ring I wanted. It was like I finally found the meaning of life.

My boyfriend is the nicest guy in the world, even though at the beginning he was flaky; but later on, he fully devoted himself, and I never felt so good with a man. It was like my dream from my childhood came true. I was his princess and he was my prince. I never felt so secure and right with a man, and we could see our future together.

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch at that time. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own fear that I would lose him. 
I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation--just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer--we are challenged to change ourselves."" - Victor Frankl

This is from the book my wonderful boyfriend let me read not long ago, because he noticed the saddes and depression and anger that happened to me sometime, which I tried really hard to manage. I never found a book so enlightening, and I believed it cured my depression where the psychologists did no help. This is just one of the numerous things I so deeply appreciate my boyfriend. I cannot find a reason not to love boyfriend now. Yes, even after what happened, even if I was damned, I always love him."
scpeg,0,2012-04-16,I work in a small business and my colleague does absolutely no work. What can I do to have her evaluated and possibly fired?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scpeg/i_work_in_a_small_business_and_my_colleague_does/,"Like I stated above, I work in a small business. Its a federal contracting firm, and there are probably ~15 people in the office. I have been working here around 6 months as my first job out of college, and I work hard every day (until i get on reddit). I have a colleague that is female, and black. I have nothing against women. I grew up in a heavily populated area with very diverse nationalities, so no, I am not racist.  I along with many other colleagues before I entered the company have had multiple conflicts with this woman--multiple times. She causes problems. Every time you disagree with her opinions, she gets extremely defensive and begins to undermine your position, stating that you are not qualified to make such an accusation. (I'm an engineer, she claims to be an architect but she does no architectural work....but she is a ""project manager"") I asked her how to read a drawing in a particular architectural scale (1:50m) and told me to ask someone else. I'm not an architect but I can definitely read that scale.

The most recent event happened on last Wednesday. She stayed on the office phone for FOUR HOURS trying to figure out a cell phone bill issue. Then the following day she was on the phone for an additional TWO HOURS just to re-order a coffee table that wasn't the color that she wanted. This entire time, I am at my desk working my ass off. She sits there speaking under her breath on the phone for four hours. Then better yet, I see her time sheet for the last two weeks and she BILLS the hours saying that she worked. She is the last to come in, and first to leave.

I constantly interact with my colleagues. I get work from multiple people in my office, and I always turn it in on time and in great quality. I work easily 9 hours a day, and stay after work just to get some more experience. This work habit is consistent to everyone in this office, except her. I am already involved in more work in the company than her, and she has been here for a year and a half. I applied to jobs for 6 months straight after graduation and FINALLY got employed, so I am trying to make the best of it.

This is the part that REALLY aggravates me.  I am working at my full potential, because I have what a lot of my college graduate friends STILL do not have. But I work next to someone that myself and a few colleagues consider an overpaid paper-pusher. Someone my age could easily fill her overpaid salary position in this company, that is not only more qualified to do the work, but can generate work at a higher quality. We don't even need one person to fill her position, we could hire 2 people each with half of her salary. More work would be done, and a friendlier work environment would be made. We work as a team here, and she is the only person in the whole office that works solo. It has come to the point where colleagues cannot ask her for help on something. Her work quality is terrible, so anything she works on has to be redone. We recently got two part time interns, and now all she does is push her work to the interns. Her work is simple enough to have these interns do it. All of the others in this office are skeptic to dish out our work because it is too technical for someone to understand without prior engineering experience. I have written emails to my boss twice on how myself and a colleague have been personally offended (in an extremely unprofessional vocal manner) by her, and nothing seems to be done. My boss is completely content with his situation, and wants absolutely nothing to do with these events that seem to keep reoccurring. It has gotten to the point where no one talks to her unless they HAVE to. I feel like my boss is too scared to make a move towards questioning her, it would just release a disaster of arguments and self defense.

What can I do?

sco9r,0,2012-04-16,"My roommate/landlord's cats are destructive and disruptive.  I can't stand it anymore and would like to move out, but she is still going to hold me responsible for rent unless I find a subleaser.  Am I really just going to have to suck it up?  Details inside.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sco9r/my_roommatelandlords_cats_are_destructive_and/,"These cats were not part of the deal when I moved in.  She adopted them and asked me prior-to if I would mind the cats moving in, and I said I wouldn't mind because I was under the impression that they would be well-mannered, well-behaved cats and I am a cat-lover myself.  There was no written agreement or anything involving the cats living here. 

Now, the cats are very cute and sweet for the most part, but they are also the most destructive, annoying cats I have ever known.  Of my belongings, three pairs of shoes have been damaged, one of which I can no longer wear, a clutch purse, and two brand new reusable ziploc bags (the washable, $10 a piece kind).  That may not sound like a lot, but I'm an undergrad college student that worked an unpaid internship this semester.  One of the bags was even stuffed into the very bottom of my double-zipped book bag and on a low lying table...I came down one morning to find it pulled off the table onto the floor with both zippers open and the ziploc bag demolished.  This cat eats plastic, yes.  All kinds.  I can't leave my bedroom door open for even a minute because they'll get under my bed and start eating things that I am trying to keep protected.  I can't leave my belongings downstairs besides books and things because they will get chewed up.  I can't even eat in peace because of the incessant meowing, prancing around the tables and counters, and one of the cats will literally steal the food off of your plate if you get up from the table to go 10 feet into the kitchen for a moment.

I am at my wits end, despite the fact that my landlord/roommate has done her best to try to train the cats.  My main issue is that I start all distance education courses in the end of May as I finish up my undergrad degree this summer and I will need a peaceful place to study.  Here I can't even peacefully study anywhere besides my room because one of the cats repeatedly bangs the cabinet door that hold their food as he tries to open it.  It has a kiddy lock on it but that doesn't stop him.  He also noisily vomits up the plastic he eats pretty regularly.  My dilemma is that my lease isn't up until over a month after I start classes, and given the intensity of summer courses it would be extremely stressful to try and move in the middle of them.  And I seriously don't think I can last until the end of my lease with these cats...I really am miserable and am not feeling safe or comfortable in my own home.  I apologize for the long rant, but I want you to understand that I am not just a crazy cat-hater.  I love cats and these cats are just insane with their behavioral problems.  

I've told her how I feel and that I would like to terminate my lease early, but she said she is still going to hold me responsible for payment of rent unless I find a subleaser.  I looked through my lease agreement and it does say under a section, ""Quiet enjoyment.  Tenant, upon payment of all of the sums referred to herein as being payable by Tenant and Tenant's performance of all Tenant's performance of all Tenant's agreements contained herein and Tenant's observance of all rules and regulations, shall and may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof.""  Does that mean anything?  Has she violated her agreement as landlord by putting animals in the home after the beginning of my lease that disrupt my ability to leave peacefully and quietly?

Can I do anything at all here or am I just going to have to suck it up?  Any insight or help would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** My landlord acquired two cats since the beginning of my lease and they have become incredibly destructive and disruptive, including doing monetary damage to my belongings that I have not been reimbursed for.  Do I have any options as far as terminating the lease early and moving out because as they are interfering with my right as a Tenant to ""peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof""?"
scit3,1,2012-04-16,Senior Design Project for a company?,quickqthrowaway2012,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/scit3/senior_design_project_for_a_company/,"I recently started my ""Senior Design Project"" for my CS degree, and the situation to me seems a little unfair. 

At the beginning of the semester, we get a list of ""Sponsored Projects"", which are essentially semester long assignments for a customer.

I later find out that these customers are companies that pay the university $8,000 to have their project put in the list for a semester. Then the students pay thousands of dollars to enroll in the class, and work as programmers for the companies for the semester.

My question is this: Is it really legal for the university to accept payment from both sides of this transaction? It almost seems like they are selling our work without us getting any cut. Is this an opportunity I'm taking for granted? Is this common in CS programs across the country?

I've already had an internship for a couple years so the idea of doing the same work but paying out of my pocket to do it makes me feel like I'm being cheated."
scbib,7,2012-04-16,Australian biomedical science student wanting to do an internship (or some such thing) overseas. Does anybody know how I could go about applying?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/scbib/australian_biomedical_science_student_wanting_to/,"Hi guys, I thought this was the best subreddit for my question. As I said, I'm an Australian biomedical science student in the fourth year of my degree. At the end of this year, I'll have had one year of experience working in a laboratory. I'd love to apply to do an internship overseas, as I know that some universities have those kinds of programs for students, but have no idea how to go about applying. I've asked around at my university, but they haven't been very helpful, so I thought I might have more luck asking some overseas students such as yourselves if you knew of such a program. 


I've been working my ass off this year, however (unfortunately) I only realized I *really* wanted to stick with science and do research until it was too late. Meaning that I had plans to go off and get another degree after I was finished with this one and never look back. I developed my passion too late. As such, my GPA stands at about 2.6, or something equally as depressing. I'm really annoyed with myself as I know that this will impact my chances of universities accepting me for any sort of project they have. I feel like I'm at a disadvantage and need to make up for the time I wasted not doing research or making connections in my early university years. 

I guess my questions are

* Do any of your know of a university who runs these types of programs?

* How would I go about applying? I've looked on the internet for a bit and all I've learned is that I should apply to the lab I'm interested in directly, instead of going through the administrative channels.

* Would my year of research experience make up for my incredibly average GPA?

* If I can't get past the GPA issue, is there anything I could put on my resume to help me stand out?

Just as a side note, my main interests are in neurogenetics/neurogenomics, intelligence, consciousness, stem cell research and genetics. I enjoy...building things. "
sc4y2,60,2012-04-16,What is the number one problem with the U.S. education system?,PirateLogic,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sc4y2/what_is_the_number_one_problem_with_the_us/,"This may have been asked before, but I couldn't find it, and I'm curious to know what reddit thinks. To get things started, I'll say this:

The state of the U.S. education system has always infuriated me. There are so many issues and it seems that there is no consensus on where we should start. Because nobody else could figure it out, one genius came forward and threw out this gem: Children are failing at school, so we obviously need to make it easier.

My biggest problem with the U.S. education system is that students aren't being held responsible for their laziness and lack of effort. Officials are dumbing the system down and making everything easier to get students to pass. Students are catching on to this – whether they realize it or not – and it's making them become incredibly lazy. The parents, in turn, go to the principle and blame the school who blames the teacher for being too hard on the student. This vicious circle repeats it self and the entire system cracks a little bit more during each cycle. 

The fact of the matter is that students aren't being held responsible for what is, more than likely, their own fault. Of course there are situations where it is legitimately not the student's fault, but it seems to be the popular reaction for parents to blame others for their child's failures before having all of the facts.

Another problem is that everyone is scared of their child's feelings being hurt. Name calling seems to be such a big deal these days; one student calls another student a slut and the next day both parents are in the principles office having a shouting match. A much more efficient solution would be for both students to grow up. Children in our country are being babied to the point that they can't take care of themselves while we all just sit by and let it happen. Why don't we do something about it?

I'm a computer science student and I feel very strongly about the state of our country's education system. It saddens me to realize that there is no hope of fixing the numerous other problems we have if we can't even educate the country's adolescents. I feel that everyone should have something they feel strongly about and my goal for next summer is to get an internship at a company like [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). For those of you who don't know about Khan Academy, it is an alternative, open learning platform for students who aren't satisfied with their current education. Maybe my impact on the overall problem will be minimal, but at least I'll be doing something, as opposed to talking about it.

What say you, reddit?

**TL;DR** The U.S. education system sucks. Why?"

seu1v,0,2012-04-17,Been Charged with possession as a minor for the second time. Whats going to happen to me? ,mackncheeseyx,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/seu1v/been_charged_with_possession_as_a_minor_for_the/,"
I tried posting this to /r/legaladvice but with no prevail. 

Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

 Sincerely, A Very Scared Redditor

I'll do an internship abroad this summer and I am looking for a laptop that I could bring with me

 General Questions

1) What is your budget?


around **400€**


2) What size notebook would you prefer?


 **Ultraportable**; 11"" - 12” screen


3) Where will you buying this notebook? 


France


4) Are there any brands that you prefer or any you really don't like?


Dislike: Hp
 
         
5) Would you consider laptops that are refurbished/redistributed?

6) What are the primary tasks will you be performing with this notebook?


essentially** multimedia** (movies, musics...), **internet** and why not some **light/retro gaming**


7) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places, leaving it on your desk or both?


As I said before I would bring it with me when I will be travelling but once I'm set up there I don't think I would be moving with it very often


8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so, please state which games or types of games?


I would play with whatever my computer can do, but at least TF2 or N64 will at least be not a problem for actual ultraportable?
 

9) How many hours of battery life do you need?

a good performance/battery life price, but it is **not a crucial point** for me

10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?

both will not be a problem

11) What OS do you prefer? Windows 7

Screen Specifics


12) From the choices below, what screen resolution(s) would you prefer? 

I'd love a **good resolution**

13) Do you want a Glossy/reflective screen or a Matte/non-glossy screen?

I've never have have a laptop so I'll guess a non glossy screen. But right now, I don't know the difference between both of them

Build Quality and Design

14) Are the notebook's looks and stylishness important to you?

not at all

15) When are you buying this laptop?

ASAP

16) How long do you want this laptop to last?

I'll may consider to resell it at the end of the summer...

Notebook Components

17) How much hard drive space do you need; 80GB to 640GB? Do you want a SSD drive?

SSD drive is not required and I have an external drive of 1Tb so I guess that I would **not** need** a big hard drive**

18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a CDRW/DVD-ROM, DVD Burner or Blu-Ray drive?

not really

seipw,1,2012-04-17,"Charged second time for Possession as a minor. What should I do, and what is going to happen to me?",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/seipw/charged_second_time_for_possession_as_a_minor/,"Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

 Sincerely, A Very Scared Redditor

sebis,3,2012-04-17,I'd like to hear r/compsci about Model-Driven Architecture/Development,huhuh11,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/sebis/id_like_to_hear_rcompsci_about_modeldriven/,"Hi,

My question is not really technical/in-depth but more about the general philosophy of things. I am currently working as a research intern on a big project that aims at providing industrial actors with an environment for developing critical embedded systems. 

Typically, the company can input its own domain-specific modeling languages and generate a whole lot of tools like code editor, graphical editor, simulator, code generator, etc... from their metamodels.

For those of you who are not familiar with MDA/MDD, i'll use the definitions from [modeling-languages.com](http://modeling-languages.com)
&gt;MBE (model-based engineering) process is a process in which software models play an important role although they are not necessarily the key artifacts of the development (i.e. they do NOT “drive” the process as in MDD)

&gt;MDD is a development paradigm that uses models as the primary artifact of the development process.

&gt;MDA is the OMG’s particular vision of MDD and thus relies on the use of OMG standards. Therefore, MDA can be regarded as a subset of MDD

I would like to know from anyone involved in the computer science field / software engineering what are your thoughts on MDA/MDD ? Do you think it will become more popular as tools develop, or will it only stick to critical embedded software ? What are your experiences with it?

Also, it is hard to talk about MDA/MDD without mentioning UML or a subset of UML which may often be one of the concerned domain-specific modeling languages. Specifically, what do you think of UML's idea of trying to do everything ? I'm talking about the possibility of execution of UML activity diagrams and/or of UML state machine diagrams.

Thanks for your input !"
sdygo,77,2012-04-17,[Q] Did any of you graduate without any internship or work experience? (AKA am I screwed?),jamaljermaine,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/sdygo/q_did_any_of_you_graduate_without_any_internship/,"As the title says, I'm wondering if any of you graduated without any sort of internship experience and I'm curious about how that turned out for you. I'm a Junior at a University very well known for its CS program, and each day as summer draws closer and I still have yet to hear back from any prospective internship employers (wasn't excellent at applying, did poorly in some interviews due to nerves).  I have a 3.4 technical GPA (freshman year was bad for me, but this isn't absolutely awful considering the school average) and I'm wondering how difficult it is to find work after graduating given that you have no work experience whatsoever.  

Even if I do secure an internship this late (school ends in a month) I would be sacrificing a family vacation to various parts of Asia like Taiwan/Japan, which is an experience that I would love to have.

Essentially I'm asking for stories and advice: Assuming I do get an offer, would you say the internship experience is more valuable than a trip with my family to the other side of the world? Assuming I don't get an internship, would you recommend summer courses to remove a humanities requirement so I can focus more on my academia, trying to get Research with a professor (unlikely grad school, but always a possibility), or trying to find some sort of open source project which I hear is also good to do (though I wouldn't even have any idea where to begin or what to do)?

Much Love ♥

sdpev,0,2012-04-17,Cover letter help,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sdpev/cover_letter_help/,"So, I am redoing my cover letter. It use to be a template with about 4 paragraphs, a big read. It has given me a few interviews, but for internships, so now that I am graduating from Software Engineering, I am not sure if this will suffice. I heard that sending a generic template usually doesn't work, so I am going to try something non-generic.

I have been reading some example tips, some of them have been slumbering for many years on reddit. A few quotes that I like and probably use are
&gt; I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I'm the best candidate for your ... position

I wouldn't mind using something like this, however, I wouldn't want to say ""best"" as I know I am not the best, I am probably average, no CS coder. And saying I'm a average candidate, well, no. Perhaps excellent, it doesn't have that over confident and naive sound especially coming from a recent grad.

&gt;with an outstanding work ethic

I would love to say this, it can be true at times, I work for 10+ hours, but either because what I am doing is very interesting to me, or that it's due very soon and I have nothing done yet. Just now I went on Reddit for resume tips and the first few hours it was just checking the top stories and then start working on my cover letter, so I can get off track if I am bored.
Mainly I don't like to overstate my abilities (like saying I am the best at something), although I wouldn't want to understate them as well. Or lying about my abilities, as I know they will come back at me if I do get a job.

Do I also need to make a new cover letter for each job? Or at least have the main stuff similar, but just change around words such as Company X to Company Y, and I want a job as a X to Y.

I took an example from Fuzebox13 in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/admbw/for_the_unemployed_redditors_are_you_tired_of/) post.

Ill submit what I have now, any comments or wording changes?

&gt;I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I am an excellent candidate for your Software Developer position. I am a keen worker and I am interested in challenging problems. I know Java, C, C++, plus several other languages and I can learn new concepts quickly. My experience may be lacking a little, but not my ambition.
&gt;
&gt;My final design project was to integrate an RFID module on wireless sensor nodes to authenticate and communicate with a handheld. I lead the software development with another group member as well as managing the groups schedule. I had to research TinyOS and nesC in order to implement the software as well as my group mate. I realized that my group mate wasn't doing much work, so I had to pick up the slack, and I finished it, all.
&gt;
&gt;We can further discuss why I am an excellent candidate for your software developer position at the interview. I can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Thank you, and I look forward to the opportunity.

sde8x,5,2012-04-16,Graduating from uni in 2 months and I want to work on my own Android projects - is it unwise to drift from the common career path?,jaccunio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sde8x/graduating_from_uni_in_2_months_and_i_want_to/,"As I said, in two month I will hopefully graduate from UK university, Bsc in Computer Science.
In December 2010 I got really into Android development and released 2 apps so far, one paid and one free. To my surprise, both achieved a reasonable success, and right now, after the initial boom, they bring enough money to make a decent living.

The dilemma I'm facing right now is whether to, as everyone else, find a normal programming job, or maybe pursue the freelance path from the very beginning.

I'm very close to the latter option, because I can always - in case of failure - start looking for a normal job. 
But imagine this scenario - I graduate, start making more Android apps and games, and after a year or two I run out of ideas/money, so I start looking for a job. It is worth noting at this point, that I have no real world programming experience (my bad, I know, but I was stupid and didn't look for any internships). So my situation is quite bad in this case - only freelancing experience, year or two after graduation...

Is it worth the risk?"

So I get a call from one of the partners at the PR firm I used to work at. She was an older woman, good at her job but TERRIBLE with computers. That said, she had become reliant on her Blackberry calendar to keep things in order. And she had A TON of calendar entries - stuff she wasn't even going to but wanted to keep track of.

She had an assistant who would plug in all of her hand written calendar appointments into her outlook calender.

Well, her assistant was going on her honeymoon and god forbid this lady learn how to make a calendar entry, so we assigned an intern to manage her schedule for the duration.

So back to the call I got.... she was frantic that her phone alarm had gone off several times during the night and she could not figure out why.

I go to her desk, look at her phone, and I noticed that there were upwards of 10 events scheduled between the hours of 9pm and 6am. It turns out that intern didn't know that you could schedule two things concurrently on a calendar. So, in his infinite wisdom, he assumed tha if something needed to be added at 3pm, and there was already something listed for that time, he would just schedule it for 3am, with a note saying ""*Actually 3:00 PM"". And then of course, he set up alarms for each of them..."
sgfq6,1,2012-04-18,Should I include my political affiliation/related activities on my resume/CV/Cover letters?,deathsythe,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sgfq6/should_i_include_my_political_affiliationrelated/,"Hey guys,

So I'm a graduating college senior with a half-decent GPA and a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a pretty prestigious (and unfortunately expensive) engineering school. I am also 6 credits shy of completing my masters, and have over 2.5 years of relevant engineering internship experience.

My non-academic accomplishments include founding, and acting as chairman for 4 years of my school's chapter of College Republicans as well as serving on the state board for CRs in an executive position.

I am also a member, and part of the executive boards, of the Archery and Riflery teams.

I do not hide these facts, nor am I ashamed of it. They showcase me as a well rounded individual, and show leadership, as well as a good deal of philanthropy (because of all the charity work I've done with several organizations - especially the CRs)


I have been advised by the office of career development not to remove any of this information - for the aforementioned reasons. I know the economy sucks, and the job market is awful, but I can't help but think that, in today's politically charged climate, it may actually be hurting me.

I know that not hiring me because of my political affiliation or sporting activities is discrimination, but I'm not one to make waves, nor would I really be able to prove that methinks.



Can any HR folks, managers, career development personnel, people who see similar things, etc... comment on this?



tl;dr - hold leadership positions in political and other ""non-pleasant"" affiliated clubs at school, and thinking of removing that info from my resume.




**Note - I am not here to debate anyone regarding politics, guns, or anything else. I put the affiliation there in good faith that the good folks of r/askreddit can look past it for a moment and discuss my situation.**

**Edit-** Thanks for the responses guys. It seems pretty split, but the leadership part does seem to be winning over the ""keep politics out of the office"". I appreciate the insight, and look forward to reading more as more comments come in."

My question is how much should I be expecting from an offer? I am 99% sure our meeting is going to be about that as he said lunch was going to be on him. I just want to know what I should be expecting as a recent graduate. It would be a C#/ASP.Net Developer position. Since I cant ask my other co-workers how much they started at as it is considered rude I thought I'd get some general information.

Thanks!

sfjen,0,2012-04-18,I'm curious about the prospects of a software engineer in NYC,scooterbuddy,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/sfjen/im_curious_about_the_prospects_of_a_software/,"I'm thinking about moving to NYC to live and work around this time next year. I already have a job as a software engineer that pays enough for me to be comfortable where I am now so I'm curious if I can expect the same in NYC. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, getting a full time position with a Department of Defense contractor where I worked as an intern for two years while I worked on my degree, so I already have experience in a professional environment which I hope can give me an edge applying for an entry level software engineer job.

Doing the math, it appears I would need a salary of $80,000 (pre-tax) to live comfortably in NYC, this is assuming that rent is only 30% of my expenses (assuming about $1700 a month) but I realize the reality may be that I spend nearly half of my income on rent if I make less than that and/or I am underestimating the cost of studio within the city. Am I right in shooting for this salary if I want to live comfortably here? When I say comfortably, I mean that I have a roof over my head within the city and money to go out every once in a while and I'm not counting pennies at the end of the month. The more important question is if this is what I can expect companies to be offering for entry level software engineer jobs, and if not, what should I be expecting?"

If yes, how so?",counttess,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sfhua/should_i_contact_this_employer_if_yes_how_so/,"I have applied for a full-time internship that I am likely not to get, but regardless, I need to act like I am going to get this job because I do want it very badly.

So I had some confusion about the job position itself:
It says full time, however, it is open to rising seniors or graduate students (who I would assume would be in school).  I will be only in school for 12 hours in the Fall and for only 2 days of the week, so I will be available much of the time needed, but I didn't know if maybe they were expecting something else.

Also, I will be gone for a month and a half soon to go on a study abroad.  This wasn't an issue with my last job as it is obviously an enriching experience, but now that the date is approaching soon... I would essentially be hired and leave.  I know I need to bring this up, and I would entirely understand the effect it would have on me getting this internship... but, I want this internship very badly.

Finally, I don't have the specific degree they are looking for but it is unfortunately not offered at my school, and I am definitely intending on going to graduate school for it. I know this would be something to come up in the interview, but if I am to contact them beforehand, I didn't know if it would be worthwhile bringing up.

Should I contact the employer ahead of time, or wait to see if I get an interview and bring it up then?  I simply do not want to seem deceiving, yet at the same time I do not want to lay a lot of issues on the employer before they even get a chance to call me in for an interview.

Thank you for any advice!"

I want to pursue an education in Computer Science while I'm younger and spend the rest of my years applying my CS degree to a more artistic direction e.g. Front End Development, Game Design/Programming, UX/UI, or Human Computer Interaction.  I might even do grad school in such fields.

---

I'm currently a community college student, and I've been accepted into two state schools.  

School A known for its Computer Science program than School B. With that in mind, School A requires more Math and Physics classes, which will take me a longer time to finish my degree. I'm certain about this extended amount of time because I struggle in math and science which tends to lead me to retake classes.  I wouldn't say my struggle isn't a stress free experience--I work hard to pass my classes, but it does affect my social life and my free time, which I could be using to have a part time job/internship.  (Although I must admit, that I do use my free time to learn web development, SEO strategies, and web design.)

I'm at a point right now where I want to graduate and apply CS in an artistic way.  I see School A the benefits School A will give me in terms of internships, connections, ""name branding"", but I see how School B gives me the benefit of time.  I would finish my degree quickly in comparison of School A, test the waters in the job world, and then pursue further schooling if I still want it--oh, can't forget less debt as well.

What do you guys think?  Is it worth spending maybe 5-6 more years at School A or to finish my degree at School B within 3 years?

sidam,0,2012-04-19,I'm considering a CS or CIS degree - what are your opinions?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sidam/im_considering_a_cs_or_cis_degree_what_are_your/,"**TL;DR** I'm considering going back to school to obtain a CS or potentially a CIS degree.  Math is not a forte for me, but people skills are, so I was leaning slightly more towards CIS.  I'm coming to reddit to ask for opinions because A) after some research there seems to be some sentiment out there that these degrees aren't necessary / what they used to be, B) I'm unsure as to which one would be most beneficial / useful, and C) considering I'm not brand new to the college scene and getting a little older, would I be better off trying to teach myself and get work experience rather than get a degree.

Any thoughts or opinions are quite welcome.

**Brief background**: I have approximately 100 credit hours under my belt from hopping around in various degrees when I first went to college (like many, I had no idea what I wanted to do).  I took a couple years off to work and get rid of some of that debt.  I'm 26 - and while I'm still relatively young (obviously I'm not headed for the nursing home just yet) - I feel as though I'm a bit late in the game for a CS/CIS degree.

A lot of people say that ""any degree is better than no degree"", and similarly, that ""you can be 30 without a degree or 30 with a degree"".  I agree with both of those views, and one way or the other I am going to finish my degree, but I'm looking for some practical advice.

After doing some preliminary research, it seems there are a lot of negative views about the IT world out there concerning computer science and information science. H1Bs are taking all the jobs, a CS/CIS degree is worthless without actual work experience, etc.

Would I be making a mistake going for either of those degrees at this point?  Is it *really* that bad out there for these graduates, let alone a guy like me who will be around 30 (give or take) when I complete it?  I have to admit it has me a little worried.

**My thoughts**:  My primary interest is coding and programming, and not so much the theory and math end of things.  Initially this lead me to believe that I should just self teach myself for a while, try to get some internships and an apprenticeship, and get work experience organically.  However after doing some research, it seems that if you go this route you stand a good chance of getting stuck as a ""code monkey"" (saw that term thrown around quite a bit), and have little job stability due to outsourcing and not having deeper technical skills necessary for better, higher paying work.  Hence my thoughts on going back to obtain a degree.

As far as a CIS degree goes, I figured it might be a better fit than a computer science degree as I do have a business background (some of my undergrad classes were in business), and work well with people.  In that sense it might be a better fit than doing the technical work 80% of the time.  However there also seems to be the sentiment that a CIS degree is worthless compared to a proper CS degree, and is for people who can't hack the CS degree.

I suppose it's also worth mentioning that during my earlier studies I only completed math as high as college algebra, so I would need to refresh as well as take Calc 1 and 2 etc.  I'm neutral towards math in general, meaning, I'm okay with it, but it doesn't come naturally or easily so that could be a potential struggle point with a CS degree.

Any thoughts or opinions you have on the matter would be greatly appreciated!

They work on very large and important contracts for large clients (some of them governmental projects). My interview went very well and they seem VERY excited to have me.

They also didn't seem phased that I have much more experience in Java than I do in C++, which is the language we will be coding in at work (using Visual Studio, mostly). I have been studying C++ extensively since my acceptance and really trying to hammer down the major concepts, most of which are quite familiar from my experience in Java.

Here's my question: I start the job in just a few weeks. What can I do between now and then to help myself be a better member of their software engineering team? I can learn C++ concepts, yes, but what can I do to prepare myself to USE those concepts in a fast-paced setting and on a team with people who have been writing in C++ since the language existed?

TL;DR - Starting C++ internship, what can I do to prepare myself to transfer my theoretical knowledge to being a valuable team member?"

After a lifetime of wishing I could move to the UK, it seems to be the right time to start setting plans in motion. 

About me:

* 36 yo, female, US citizen, born in Oregon
* I will receive my Masters of Public Administration this fall/winter from Portland State University, my focus is natural resource policy, with an emphasis on energy policy and conflict resolution. I also have a B.S. from Oregon State University in American Studies (focus on environmental science &amp; history, cultural anthropology, and ethnic studies) and a minor in resource economics. 
* Understanding that course work is not necessarily the same thing as experience, my academic background is in PR, tribal law, HR management, conflict resolution, administrative law &amp; policy, analytic methods/statistics, shrinking cities, grantwriting, finance &amp; budget in the public sector, and comparative cultures/ethnic &amp; indigenous studies.
* My interests, so far as future careers go, are mainly in the public sector, either at the local or national level. Energy, forestry, water, and resource advising, liaising, PR/Community outreach, and conflict resolution/mediation are my overall focuses, and I feel I'm well suited for work in most any agency dealing with some combination of these issues.
* I spent about six years working at OSU as a grant &amp; manuscript editor, secretary/assistant to department heads, a lot of my job was event and travel preparation, document creation (excel, word, mathtype, powerpoint, publisher, etc.) Since moving back to Portland I have worked as a legislative intern with Oregon's Citizen's Utility Board (a ratepayer advocacy group) and I have worked as a field representative with the U.S. Census for a little more than two years.
* No criminal convictions
* I have a bit of high school French and minimally conversational Spanish. By no means fluent in either, but I can usually get by in short conversations.
* I am looking for a semi-permanent to permanent expatriation, depending on how life goes.
* On the personal side, I have two daughters going off to university next year. Having a lot of 'mom guilt', but they seem to have come down on the side of ""we're going away for four years and don't really care where you are because hey, there's this thing called the internet."" My younger one has been asking to move in with her uncle and his wife for years, and seems to be genuinely excited about having a dad figure, so I'm leaving a lot of the 'when' to her. May be next summer when my oldest goes to uni, may be the summer after if my youngest decides she can't live without me...I'm thinking it will be somewhere in between 14-26 months from now.
* My boyfriend lives in Amersham, so I'm definitely leaning towards finding a job in that general area. I'd like to be close enough to see him within an hour...not so close as to smother him after being long (so long) distance for two years. I'm staying with him for about a month this summer and will have a good chance to see the area and surrounding cities better, as I've really only spent time in London and Wales (where my family is from). Hoping to go back in the winter/spring after I'm done with classes to put out feelers for jobs as the actual move date gets closer.
* I'm definitely looking at dual-citizenship, and wondering how much easier (if at all) it will be to go through the Welsh bureaucracy? My family is from Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire (and my distant cousins still live there). I don't know if one can claim repatriation 150 years after your ancestors fled the country, but while I am also Scotch and Irish by way of my mother's father's family, I would consider my heritage to be 'mainly Welsh' and think that may be the way to go.

I feel like there are about 400 things that have to happen in order, and I'm on number 3, but just deciding that this is happening and having the support of family, friends, colleagues, boyfriend, etc. is making it a lot easier to seriously think about making the leap. Any and all advice/connection/help will be most welcome!"

Right now I typically use Eclipse for everything, which I know can cause more headaches than it's worth on some occasions.  I used RedHat at one of my internships quite extensively, but still did my development on a Windows machine and instead based my project on a network drive that was available to my RedHat machine.  So I haven't truly experienced developing on a Unix system yet.  

My question is how to get started with developing in Unix.  It seems like there is such a steep learning curve and no one ""right"" way to jump in.  I've been looking into Fedora16 because it's similar to RedHat.  Is this a good version to start with?  Can I develop successfully with running it through VirtualBox?  I'd rather not dual-boot because my SSD is only 64GB big, and I'm sure my i5 and 8gigs of RAM can handle the load. 

How do most people code on Unix?  I wasn't a huge fan of vi when I used it at work, but I know some people are crazy for it.  I've been using Sublime Text2 which is pretty nice.  What should I install on my system after I get it up and running?  If somebody could help me get going I would appreciate it!"

The question is, how do I start??",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sj705/for_the_last_10_years_ive_hid_my_desire_to_become/,"Hello Reddit!
I am in need of some serious help. I'm not the best at forming questions, so I guess I'll just lay it all there. I am very sorry for the ridiculous length of this post.
When I was about 10 years old, I was wandering around in the library, when suddenly I came across a badly beaten up copy of Jeff Smith's [Bone](http://tinyurl.com/6uct346). I was instantly engrossed in his method of visual storytelling. That was my first encounter with graphic noveling.

Years later, I learned about anime and manga and was completely blown away by the amount of detail in the drawing and the wide range of genres that were available (as opposed to just being for kids like most cartoons/comics at the time were geared towards). It was around that time that I somehow got the notion that I wanted to be an animator/manga artist. However, I remember feeling deathly embarrassed about my love of comics/manga. There were a few moments during class, where I would be doodling some sort of character and one of my friends would catch a glance and flash me a ""oh no, you're not one of *them*, are you?"" look. I can still vividly remember the extreme feeling of shame I had.

Towards the end of High School, when it came time to take SATs and apply to colleges, I blocked out any options of going to art school. I applied to local state college as a potential business major. I was running full speed away from any silly ideas of being a comic book artist. Fast forward past graduation and a few internships at various companies (some sales, some marketing) and I started to notice that I was starting to burn out. I quit my job, and moved back home to take a bit of a hiatus.

Then, one day while living at home with my parent's, I had an overwhelming feeling to kill myself. I had bad days before where I all I wanted to do was disappear, but this time was *much* different. I lost all will to get out of bed, to eat, and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I contemplated which means of killing myself would be the best (easiest seemed jumping of the nearby bridge), but luckily my parents had caught on that not was all well with me and ended up taking me to the ER, where I was then admitted to the Psych Ward. Despite the stigma that Psychiatric Wards have, I found it to be wonderfully helpful and a great place for me to get help. I started taking medication, got into counseling, and started working towards rebuilding my self-esteem.

This happened about two years ago. Up until recently, I was doing well, working at a new and interesting doing sales with a small boutique store. However, I was finding that I was still unsatisfied with my direction in life. Every now and then I thought back to my earlier dreams of being a comic book artist, and I would feel a deep yearning to try my hand at it. I started gathering ideas and sketching and drawing more. I even started writing out a story, and then life kind of got in the way (busy at work, dating, family drama, etc). Weeks and weeks went by, and I hadn’t been able to get anything out on paper, and I started to feel hopeless that I would never be able to do what I really wanted to do. I imagined myself, 40 years in the future, still having not written anything of substance and feeling weighed down with the regret of lost opportunities. I started having trouble focusing at work again, and I was starting to have panic attacks. I started having the overwhelming urge to end my life or hurt myself. My sister called me while this was happening and when she realized that I was relapsing she drove over and forced me to go back to the hospital. 

This was two weeks ago. I got the treatment I needed, but now I’m worried about what the consequences of putting off my dream are. I used to write it off with thoughts like, “I’ll get around to it tomorrow”, but that image of me as an old woman having not accomplished what I wanted now haunts me constantly. 

Having given a very long-winded explanation, my question is: How do I start? Do I need to join a graphic novelist’s group? Do I work under someone as an apprentice or find myself a mentor?

I’m so confused about how one becomes a graphic novelist, that if anyone is able to read this long post and offer ANY suggestions, I would be very grateful.

For an idea of what my style looks like [here’s my deviant art page](http://nicigrigg.deviantart.com/).

EDIT: Perhaps I'm also very curious if anyone knows someone who has written/drawn a graphic novel, regardless whether it was successful or not?"

Datasheet -&gt; http://elcodis.com/parts/5709201/ADC0834CCN_p10.html. The circuit is set up correctly, I'm simulating the clock on the STAMP BS2p microcontroller. My code isn't working and I only have a week left to get results or we have to cancel the launch. Thanks!
  
  
Hey there, my university started this new program where they bring in the smartest high school students in the state and set us up with projects and internships starting our Freshman year. The problem with that is we don't know what we're doing, and it's becoming a very big obstacle to overcome as we get closer to the end of the project.

Our first project is to design and successfully launch a balloon 100,000 ft into space with a payload carrying sensors and a microcontroller to retrieve and store the data. It doesn't seem so hard, but I'm the only computer engineer in the group and I've never worked with the BASIC Stamp language (We're using the STAMP BS2p microcontroller) and I've definitely never worked with integrated circuits on this scale before.

So after completing the circuit board (we're using the BalloonSAT board) and doing the initial tests we were all stoked because it seemed like the project was going to be a breeze. Jump forward a week and a half and I'm still stuck with no results despite looking up and reading everything thing I could find on this darn chip (the ADC0834CCN). I've never seen and much less worked with a chip that takes a code to start so I was lost in the water until I found the waveform diagram. At that point I was pretty sure I could figure it out, but after testing my code and getting a serial output of only HIGH values no matter what we did with our solar power sensor I brought the board down to the electronics lab and used a logic analyzer. Unfortunately for me my code seemed to produce the exact waveform diagram as the example showed, but I didn't not get any values back from the chip.

Any tips or tricks, or even a step-by-step howto would be lovely. I can provide my code if it would help, but it's quite lengthy so I won't post it unless it is necessary."

**Stress:** Everyone knows both schools are stressful, but how much stress do EECS majors face at Berkeley? How prevalent are dropouts/suicides? How many hours of work do students typically put in a week?

**Extracurriculars:** What are some common extracurricular activities for EECS majors?

**Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Everyone knows Stanford has this entrepreneurial spirit, and it's something I found lacking at Caltech. What about at Berkeley (at Cal Day, professors mentioned some EECS students drop out to form startups. How true is this/how frequently does this occur?)










**Original:**
Here are a couple of key comparisons between the two schools that I have noticed:

**Class size:** Class size at Caltech is obviously smaller than Berkeley (35 CS majors vs. 300 EECS majors). Some lower div CS classes at Berkeley get as big as 200 students.

**Classes offered:** Caltech only has about 14 CS professors, whereas Berkeley has about 85 professors in EECS. At Caltech, they said that they didn't offer as great a variety of classes as schools like Berkeley because of the small department size. Caltech's CS is also very theoretical, according to both students and professors.

**AP credits:** Caltech does not accept AP credits, but Berkeley does (allows me to get out of more lower division classes)

**Core requirements:** Caltech's core is notorious for its rigor and difficulty (proof-based calculus anyone?) but makes me a better problem-solver and thinker (something interviewers like to see).

**Semester vs. quarter system:** Berkeley is on a 15 week semester system, whereas Caltech is on a 10 week quarter system. At Berkeley, I would have to take on average 4 classes a semester, but at Caltech, I would have to take 5 classes a quarter.

**Cost:** Berkeley is a lot cheaper than Caltech because I would pay in-state tuition (~$30,000 vs ~$55,000)

**Scholarships:** Berkeley is offering me the Regents' Scholarship of $2500 per year. This guarantees me housing for four years, gives me priority registration for classes (a big deal at Berkeley), a personal Faculty sponsor, and the ability to join the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (which hosts faculty dinners, alumni dinners, etc.) I don't know if this would give me a significant leg up over other EECS students in terms of getting letters of recommendation, finding research, etc.

**Housing:** Housing is not a problem at Caltech. At Berkeley, I have the Regents' Scholarship, so I am guaranteed housing for four years.

**Research:** About 70% of Caltech undergrads do research, but only about 1/3 of EECS undergrads do research. Caltech pretty much throws research at you; at Berkeley, professors want you to have more upper div classes under your belt so that you are more useful. Also, I feel like at Berkeley, I would be competing with other EECS students for research opportunities. Caltech is conveniently situated near JPL, and Berkeley is situated near LBNL.

**Internships/Jobs:** Everyone at Caltech says that a Caltech degree opens a lot of doors for you, regardless of your major (one professor offered the example of a Caltech Mech. E student who is now working for Google). At Berkeley, I feel like I would be competing with my fellow peers for the same jobs/internships/positions. However, these Berkeley grads seem to be doing fine (https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm), and Berkeley is conveniently located in the Bay Area (I'm from the Bay). Berkeley has a larger alumni network because of its larger size and because Caltech students are more academically inclined (more pursue academic careers versus professional careers).

**Environment:** Berkeley is known for being cut-throat. Caltech seems very friendly and welcoming (more cooperative than competitive).

**GPA:** The average GPA for Berkeley EECS is about 2.7 to 2.9. At Caltech, 130 of the 230 or so kids graduate with honors (3.5+ GPA)

**Double major:** At Berkeley, I have the ability to pursue a joint major (EECS and Materials Science or EECS and Nuclear Engineering). At Caltech, a common double major for CS students is CS and Business, Economics, and Management (BEM).

**Master's:** Berkeley has a 5 year's master's program for highly qualified EECS students (roughly 10 to 15 EECS students).

**Rankings:** US News &amp; World Report ranks Berkeley higher than Caltech for both computer engineering and EE (#4 and #3 vs. #8 and #7). Among people I've talked to in the Bay, they say that I should go to Caltech (more prestigious)."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What was it that made you decide to drop out and do this instead? Was there an epiphany moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypgh?context=5)|I went for my first interview at an investment bank for a summer internship. never wanted to step back into one of those again. 
[*•The local gang is on the payroll.*  I would like to ask about this... what do you get out of the arrangement? and how did that happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ez8yi?context=5)|Basically ease of mind. they look after me and any guests they see around. point them in the right direction if they are lost. make sure none of them run into any issues with the locals. The neighborhood is still primarily black, and myself and most guests are white, so you stand out. it came about after the 'head' of them kept seeing me leave each morning with female guests or walking with them to local stores. he thought this was countless 'walks of shame' by all these girls and asked my 'secret' haha. that lead into the conversation of what i do and what he does (i already knew what he did from local business owners telling me). its a friendly arrangement (if that seems possible) and its not too much. they have come though on a few occasions and helped avoid what could have been bad situations.
[Would you mind expounding on a situation in which he intervened? This sounds like it could be a good story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1ygb?context=5)|One example- there use to be this guy who was always hanging around the block drunk. one day a female guest was buying beer at the deli and he was aggressive towards her and threatening. One of the boys from the gang was in the deli at the time and grabbed the guy on the shoulder and lead him outside. they talked, not even loud enough for me to hear, and I have NEVER seen the drunk guy around since. Previously I would see him everyday.
[How was it attending the ivy league school?  By higher education, do you mean ivy league or university? If the former, how is it a scam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|I think that the current university system needs a complete overhaul. Especially graduate schools. It is inefficient, cost prohibitive, and in general just held up because ‘thats how it is always done’. More than half the schools need to be shuttered, as well as half the programs at each school.
[What did you think of the people while you were attending school? Now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|My classmates were amazing. Very talented people who were motivational to be around. That was the best thing about the program. I think many of them will waste the talent by chasing the highest paying career as opposed to creating things of value or innovating.
[Do you hook up often with guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eynmb?context=5)|Hahaha. My PR response would be “it is bad to mix business and personal affairs”.
 |The honest answer- it happens.
[Go on....  Best story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0z0r?context=5)|I don’t know about a best. i used to write some of the stories on a blog- [Link to hosteltales.com](http://hosteltales.com) a few are pretty funny. most will probably fall into the tl;dr category however.
[Are you financially successful?  Credit cards are a very risky way to finance a business, so I'm worried you'll get yourself into financial trouble.  After expenses, do you generate a profit, and if so how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyry0?context=5)|The most risky. however, some times you have to just jump in and make it happen. i paid off all initial expenses last month and now generate enough to live comfortably.
[By atmosphere what do you provide? drinks? music? movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyw6a?context=5)|Rampart on repeat.
[Proof, please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ezabw?context=5)|Ok. just sent to mods.
[No moderator has responded... Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f9cmq?context=5)|I sent it in to the mods yesterday. not sure why they didnt comment but i'll show you the reply from them [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/3OqTF)
[Perhaps the most obvious question but could you tell me your daily routine managing the hostel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2qn2?context=5)|Sure!
 |Most of the time I wake up and check my email. I usually have around 15 emails from people inquiring about staying here.
 |After that I kinda survey the place walk through all the rooms, clean up debris.
 |I look at what check-ins we have that day and get the beds ready. Then I tell my friend who looks after the place who is coming and going.
 |Then I usually bounce into Manhattan to do something. Or go with one of the guests somewhere. Or work on some of the other projects I'm involved with.
 |After that I usually head back to the hostel and sit in the common area (like I am now) and interact with guests/give advice and make plans for that night.
 |Then I usually go out somewhere with some of the guests and mix in some of my other friends.
 |My main 'job' is to make sure all the guests are having a good time.
[Have you got raided by cops for drugs or underage drinking or whatever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|No.
[What was the most expensive thing that someone broke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|A framed piece of artwork from a friend. Value +- $5k. It was in my room and someone ran into my door hard enough to knock it off the wall.
[Most disgusting thing you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Period blood on a mattress after a girl got hers early. then she threw up next to it.
[Most weird question asked by a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|To call them a prostitute and arrange cocaine purchase. when I explained I had no numbers for such things he got really upset and took my phone from my hand and threw it against the wall.
[Do you find yourself learning foreign language from your guests? For example, are you learning much french from having so much guests from France?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Yes. i knew Spanish before, but I am trying to pick up more french due to the large amount of guests. It is hard to learn! I also know intros in many languages 
[New York. So Columbia I'm assuming ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eylkb?context=5)|Correct.
[Great idea, NYC is sorely lacking in budget lodging. Where's the hostel? Are you glad you did it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyhj9?context=5)|It has been the best experience of my life thus far. everyone has their own unique interests/passions and talking with people about them everynight I have learned quite a bit. Also, I now have close friends all over the place, which the value was shown recently when I took a Euro trip to 6 cities and stayed with former 'guests' in each city.
[So you are like the manager/owner of this hostel? What does that entail? Is it mostly logistical maintenance like getting enough food, bedding, and other things for the travelers that come through? So far, would you say you've made a good life decision? I really want to travel the world and utilize any hostels and half-way houses I can, my brother and I are planning on it, So my last question is; do the backpackers that come through seem to be enjoying their experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0n0w?context=5)|Correct. I wear mostly all the hats owner, manager, janitor, etc.
 |I also hired one of my long term friends from where I grew up to help me with the day to day.
 |Most of my 'work' is in the reservations and handling them all. We always have more demand than we have beds, so it comes down to choose guests who I think would best mesh with the atmosphere here.
 |I have a local laundromat do all the laundry (big expense).
 |So far it is the best thing I have done. I love it. Hostels are really a great place and I have made not just acquaintances, but really close friends too.
 |All of our guests absolutely love it. It is why we get such a large amount of referral traffic now. We really nailed what we want to be and so far everyone seems to be enjoying it.
[Thanks, that's the answer I was hoping for. Just one more question I forgot to ask. Which country do most of your guests come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0rwh?context=5)|France.
 |Followed closely by Australia and UK.
[Lived and worked in hostels in the Baltics for the last couple years... Aussies are fucking everywhere!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0urz?context=5)|Haha. for sure. and from my observation are alcoholics, which I love.
[Are you making a lot of money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eygx7?context=5)|Not as much as my friends who got 'traditional' jobs, however, I have total control of my free time to pursue other interests, which to me is far more valuable.
[Do you make enough to do/buy things you enjoy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2kbc?context=5)|Yes. i can go out on nights I want to go out and go to the occasional Yankees game, which I enjoy :)
[Do you think that it was worth doing? its been 7 months but what do you want to have done in 7 years? I know that in Asia a lot of people make chains out of their hostels but is that possible to the same extent in NYC/USA? If so please do it. I always need a cheap place to stay!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyoql?context=5)|I would love to create the chain if i could get the right people for each one. the people and their personalities really make the situation.
[Do you (or did you, at one point in time\) ever regret dropping out?  What's the most amazing experience you've had doing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypjm?context=5)|I don't regret dropping out. I wish I had earlier. Higher ed is very good at teaching facts, dates, information, well. However, they fail at teaching skills, and skills are what translate into success. It is impossible to broadcasts skills to an audience in a lecture hall.  
[Cornell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f20as?context=5)|No, an actual ivy league ;)
[How much does it cost to stay at a hostel? how do i stay at a hostel? and how do I find out where they are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f16a6?context=5)|This hostel? or hostels in general?
 |Hostelworld.com is pretty much the standard for finding hostels in cities all over the world.
[1-10.  Difficulty of straying off the traditional path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyzuj?context=5)|4-- Parental approval isn’t there for this venture, which always affects a decision even if we don’t admit it. However, I always wanted to do this, and am 'good' at it so I’m happy, which I don’t think a lot of my former classmates can say with their jobs. 
[What inspired you to want to open a hostel? Did you have a great experience backpacking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|Definitely my past backpacking experiences. i met some of my closest friends in hostels, and just loved the entire experience.
[Do you want to do this for the rest of your life, or do you have other plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|I am working on a few other projects at the moment, not exactly sure what I want to do. If I keep doing the hostel(s) longer, I would hire more people so I could have less hands on time so I could again travel more.
[Silly question, are you usually able to get a good night's sleep? (what with guests getting locked out, noise, etc.\) As someone considering travelling and working in hostels for a few months, that's a small concern of mine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|Haha, the sleep question is great! I NEVER get a good night sleep. Between people coming and going, drinking all night, our excellent sound system, the lazer lights we bought--its a party every night. I have heavy earplugs that help slightly. My best sleep is in the middle of the day when all the guests are out exploring.
[I'll be visiting NY later this year, any discount for redditors? haha. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1792?context=5)|We do have a 'bro rate' that we could probably extend to reddit :)
[Are you in Bushwick? I know of a hostel in Bushwick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ezkbl?context=5)|We aren't there, but I love my neighborhood. I grew up in the typical suburbs in CA and never want to go back to that. You are 100% correct. I think Mos Def summed it up best in that song ""Brooklyn""---
[Was there a moment while you were still at school that made you decide ""that's it, I'm dropping out.""? What was that decision like, and what were the first step(s\) you had to take after that in order to successfully start your hostel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f3kny?context=5)|Stepping into an investment bank for an interview. Seeing my entire life become utterly predictable. It was like a nightmare--I would complete school, have to get a job to pay off my student debt, have to get a certain type of high paying job in order to pay it off. After I get said job, and work for xyz company for such and such years, inevitably I will fall into the classic routine of meet some girl, move to the suburbs, have the single family house, the BMW, and the family dog. Before I knew it I would be 45, an executive of xyz company, finally debt free, but a slave to my conditions. I would eventually retire around 60, at which time I would be too old to really do anything.
[What would say you decided first: That you wanted to start a hostel or that you wanted to drop out of school?  Appreciate the answers, I'm currently a student in a similar position as you were as far as what school I'm at/shared aspirations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f3kny?context=5)|The first was getting out of there. I moved out to Brooklyn and lived with a very creative friend. We always threw around ideas and one day I brought up the hostel. He really pushed me to to it. Surrounding yourself with people supportive of you and someone to hold you accountable to your dreams is important.
[Are you planning to expand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyq0s?context=5)|We need to. each night we are at or above capacity. but the draw to the place is that it isn't huge, and I can get to know the a lot of the guests. and all hostels are really based on the atmosphere within them, and the people.I've been looking at new places, however still struggling on how to maintain the atmosphere while getting bigger.
[What advice would you have for someone who's looking into trying to start a business rather than going to an expensive college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Read. It's free. No matter what you are going to try and do, someone has done it before. Read up.
[On a similar note, about how much money do you make per week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Its cliche but do something you love. Nothing about this feels like 'work'. One of your passions you can make into a living some way.  I make enough to live, go out to eat if I'd like, and not stress when I spend too much at the bar :) Never a ton left over at the end of the month, but no real money scares either 
[What were you studying ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ez3ip?context=5)|Finance.
[Looks like someone is downvoting all your comments LOL ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0e3j?context=5)|Haha, yeah, someone isn't a fan.
[Would you recommend others to start their own business? I don't really know what I want to do in life, but I think running my own business sounds fun.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2jmk?context=5)|If you have a passion for something, yes. When you think of 'absolute worst case scenario' it really isn't that bad. you probably won't starve. it also gives a nice feeling of pride, and makes you want to work harder.
[What made you want to start a hostel specifically ? Passion? Past experiences that made you think, "" I could do it better""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2afi?context=5)|Past travel experiences. I traveled a lot and stayed in hundreds of hostels. I made some of my best friends in hostels. I researched it a bit here in NYC, and thought I could do it a bit different than what was offered. (smaller more host interaction, better partying)
[Sooo I don't think anyone has asked this yet... but, how long have you been at this hostel and how long does the average person stay? I know it says 7 months in the title, but I'm not sure if that's how long you have been there.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1700?context=5)|7 months total! First day we had guests here, even helping set up the beds haha. Average stay is around 4-5 days. I don't like to do 1 day stays because you can't get to know the person much, which I like to do. Longest stay was about 5 weeks.
[Do you notice any common traits in people from the same country or are people mostly the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1e5o?context=5)|I do. It is one of the more interesting things to watch. After interacting with so many people you see traits not just from where they came from, but their interests or even age. Let me think about the exact examples and I will post another response.
 |Overall too the experience has reinforced that 'people are generally good' which is cool.
[Any particular group of people you dread coming? Though it sounds like you can kinda pick and choose who stays... Around here whenever we get bookings from Spanish or Italian groups everyone is like 'ah fuuuuck that' :S.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1u7t?context=5)|Hahaha, I guess older guests. i really try hard to screen, but occasionally you have the guest that makes everyone feel like their weird uncle is in the corner.
[How did you market yourself and let travelers know that you exist when you first started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f347c?context=5)|I let all my friends know. Especially all my traveling friends. I traveled a lot in the past and keep up with many of them on facebook. It is surprising how many people have a friend going to NYC at any moment in time.
 |Also, post the hostel on the typical online booking places.
[Have you thought about going to Europe and work in one of the hostels there? My suggestion, go to Budapest or Prague! I know that hooking up is popular in backpacking culture, any experiences on catching the guests on act? Tell it slowly...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f6f6f?context=5)|Haha, I have encountered some guests 'in the act'. the roof is a common place. or that one time in the living room...i wrote about that one here [Link to hosteltales.com](http://hosteltales.com/?p=73)
[For me, it was Wild Rover or Loki in La Paz, Bolivia. I ended up staying at both after Wild Rover got in trouble with the taxman and had to close for a few days (lol\). Such an amazing atmosphere at both hostels that I haven't seen matched anywhere else!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1ill?context=5)|For me-
[How safe is medellin? I might go there during the 2014 Brazil world cup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4fa6k8?context=5)|I loved it! ""city of eternal spring"" or something. weather was beautiful. I was traveling solo, went out almost every night, went to soccer (futbol) games and everything, never experienced any troubles.
[I've been looking into college myself recently and have been hearing more and more of it being a giant scam.

This time last year, I was living in a suburb of Chicago.  My job consisted of working as a sub-delivery knave for Jimmy John’s.  Below minimum wage plus tips, hated my manager, the store owner didn’t know how to treat his employees, it was garbage.  23 years old, college grad, living at home, my mom chewed me out at 3am one morning because I wasn’t do anything with my life.

Within weeks I was visiting some friends in LA, and decided that it was time to make my move out to Los Angeles.  I am a huge fan of the pop culture industry.  If it’s big, I’m fascinated.  After saving enough money, I moved out in October 2011 towards my internship at an online blog.  Within my first six months of living here, I turned the internship into a job, and I’ve interviewed the likes of Jason Lee, Brandy, and I’m soon to head to an event where I’ll be talking to Robert Downey Jr, Tobey Maguire, and Ben Affleck.

Working at JJ’s in 2011, I never thought I’d be this far only six months into my stay in Los Angeles, and I think I’ve done fairly well for myself.  Reddit, what are your “I never thought I’d be doing this a year ago…” stories?

smanp,3,2012-04-22,Help! Completely broke and feeling overwhelmed. Advice?,hittingmylowestpoint,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/smanp/help_completely_broke_and_feeling_overwhelmed/,"**tldr; college senior completely broke after shitty circumstances, needs money advice**

Never thought I'd be one to make a post like this, but I'm getting desperate. Hope I don't make this too long...

I'm a senior in college, about to graduate in a few weeks. This is the third year I've lived off campus in my own apartment. Before living at school, I lived with my mother, sister, and grandmother. During that time, my grandmother fraudulently used my social security number to open a credit card and failed to pay it back. 

Let's backtrack. My grandmother was not a very good person to us when she was alive. She was very manipulative, verbally abusive to my sister and I, and had almost every decision that any of us made was based around whether or not it would make her upset. It was a tough living situation, but we couldn't afford to live elsewhere - my grandmother owned the house we shared. Likewise, my mother insisted upon giving her ""second chances"" because this woman was her mother. I understood why she'd often turn a blind eye during less important fights we'd have or whatever, but it was obviously incredibly frustrating when something actually serious would happen and my mother wouldn't do anything about it. I, embarrassed and often really confused about what to do, never told anyone about my living situation outside of close friends, who also never really knew what to do about it. But can you blame me? I was a kid, I didn't want to call out my family on things that I weren't even sure were serious or not. 

That changed after leaving high school. A short time after going to college, I started getting letters from a credit card company that I didn't have an account with asking me to pay a substantial amount of money that I definitely didn't have: over $2,500. I looked into the statements that were sent alongside the bill and found out that the card was opened in 2004 - I would've been only 14 years old, way too young to legally open a card. I assumed the bills were well crafted scams, and didn't pay attention to them (possibly stupidly, but like I said, I was just a college freshman at the time). A short time later, I received a summons - the credit card company was suing me for a card I had never used or even knew about. I went to court, explained the situation as I knew it best, and showed them my driver's license and passport to prove my current age. My case was declared ""dismissed without prejudice."" This means that the court says that I don't have to pay the credit card company right now, but they can still ask me to pay the amount if they so choose. If they were to sue me again and the court ruled in my favor, it would most likely be declared ""dismissed with prejudice,"" meaning the company would no longer be able to ask me to pay. However, because it's without prejudice, the glaring mark on my credit reports that claim I had a card ""charged off"" will still remain until the card company decides that I don't have to pay it.

Because of that mark, I am unable to open my own credit card for myself, so over the last year I have only had bank accounts in my name, which up to this point has been perfectly fine. My mother added me onto her credit card account for a short while for emergencies, which I used responsibly. I had this card from 2009 up until the end of 2011, never missing a payment and only using it when I absolutely needed to. It was sort of a backup plan, as I do not have a proper savings account or emergency fund (I can thank grandma for that too. Apparently, the savings account that she had ""graciously"" opened for me (""But you can't access it, or you'll just spend the money, so i'll watch over it for you."") on one of my birthdays had been withdrawn from enough from her to deem it basically useless.). At the end of last semester, my mother had to take that card back because she fell into debt and had to close the account.

To compensate for not having that card, I picked up more hours at my job. I make $11 an hour there and work basically whenever I'm not in one of my classes or at my required unpaid internship (my major requires an internship for at least one semester before allowing students to graduate and most internships around where I live are unpaid). I also cut back on extra expenses - I stopped drinking completely, started buying groceries on a need base and tried to budget my money as best as I could, choosing to spend every weekend and work night working or doing homework instead of going to bars or other fun outings with friends. I was doing okay. Not great, but okay. I had a little extra at the end of the first couple of months, and started trying to build a bit of a savings account for myself.

I worked my ass off and it didn't help. Life has a way of creating obstacles at the worst moments and decided that this was the semester to send me a lot of them. Last month, my purse was stolen. My purse contained my wallet, my car keys, a camera, my passport (normally this was kept in my safe with other important documents and items but I had gone to Montreal the weekend before and had forgotten to take it out), and a few personal items. Almost everything was replaceable, but at a cost. Whoever had my purse now had my license and my car keys. I needed to get my door locks changed or risk my car getting stolen. I brought my car to the shop and got my locks changed - for a whopping $800. That's more than what I pay for groceries, rent, and utilities every month. At this point, I barely had that in my accounts, but I had to pay it somehow... Without my car, I can't drive to work, and if I can't drive to work then i don't have a job and if i don't have a job... the cycle goes on and on. 

My first thought was to ask my mother for help, but she was struggling with finances as well. I went to my father next, but he is in the same boat. So, I cut into my homework time and picked up any extra hours that I could. Because of this, I am currently struggling to not only finish my school work on time to even graduate without a failing grade, but I still can't cover everything with the money i've earned. My accounts have all been overdrawn and my utilities companies have sent me warning notices about late payments. The worst part about it is that once I graduate, I can no longer work at the job I currently hold because it's an on-campus position, held only by current students. I've been applying for multiple jobs in the area and secured one for after I graduate - finally some good news! 

Well, not so much. See, graduation is still a good three weeks or so away. Because my funds have disappeared and am now in debt, I'm terrified that I'm going to be kicked out of my apartment. I can't put in any more hours at work, I have no other means to pay for anything, my accounts are very overdrawn, and I have no idea what to do or how to get myself out of this situation.

Currently, my total debt for rent, utilities, and car payments is a little over $1,500. That's not even including food or toiletries or dog food or anything else that at this point has kind of become less of a priority over actually having a place to live. Going back to living at home is not an option - I already renewed my apartment lease, having secured a job for myself post graduation. Likewise, up until this semester, I've been mostly fine living on my own for the past few years. However, I am now completely broke and I have no idea what to do.

My question for you, if you've actually read this far down, is what do I do now? I have until the end of the month to come up with over $1k. I've never been in this situation before and don't know where to turn. I know that once I start working post graduation I can get back into the system I was on and be able to pay for everything normally again, but I don't know what I can do about the next few weeks. I know many people suffer worse debt than I do and many other college students suffer with money situations, but I've always tried to be really responsible about money so as to not fall victim to debt. Yet, here I am anyway.

EDIT. Totally forgot to give a little more detail about my current living situation. I live in an apartment with two roommates and my boyfriend. I also take care of my dog from back home that I've had since high school. My boyfriend lately has been paying for almost all of my dog and my food for the past month as I've used that money to try to cover bills. I don't feel comfortable asking my roommates or other friends for that kind of money because I know most of them have their own financial woes. I also don't want to ask my boyfriend for more than what he's already helped me out with."

I've seen posts in this sub before about how to properly list languages that you know as opposed to languages that you are familiar with/learning. With that and my current education status, I have a half page long resume and will almost certainly be skipped over.


Is it inappropriate for me to list past work experience if it is unrelated to the field (ie Waiter, Security Guard, Sales) just to prove that I have held jobs before? Or perhaps I could mention projects that I've worked on in school (Build Manager, Project Lead) as somewhat professional experience?

About a year ago I was working a general wage slave job at a grocery store.  There, one of our special needs employees, a bagger came up to me and asked if I could be her friend.  I don't know what mental disability she has, but I know for sure she has a lower IQ.  I agreed because I'm not a bad person, and would text her from time to time when she wanted to chat.  That was fine and all, but eventually she started pressuring me to hang out with her.

I did, because I know that she doesn't really have anyone to hang out with as she wasn't in high school anymore where there are programs and such.  We'd go to the mall, go see fireworks, I'd make her dinner, stuff like that.  But she started getting increasingly more demanding of my time, like she wanted to hang out for more than 4 hours or wanted to spend the weekend with me, things I just didn't have the time for.

I'm a full time student and for awhile there, I was working 2, 3, jobs while having an internship, while taking 18 credits.  I told her I could only see her every once in a while and she got pretty upset.  

Due to her disability she cannot drive, and therefor could only work shifts that were when the public bus ran.  One day she called and asked if I could give her a ride home from a shift so she could pick up an extra one.  I agreed as I live within walking distance of the store, but she lives almost a half hour away.  I did it because I felt bad that I didn't have time to hang out with her.

After this, I ended my employment there but I'm still working 2 jobs (one is freelance, so I have more time to myself now) but school is very busy and finals are ramping up.  After I gave her a ride once, she's constantly texting and calling me, asking if I can give her rides to and from work.  Even on days that the bus is running!  It's expensive and time consuming and quite frankly, I'm feeling upset and used.  I have my own freelance business to worry about but I feel like a complete and total jerk for telling her no.

What's the best way for me to approach this?  I know she lives with her mom and I think the problem is that the mom thinks ""great!  a friend who will do anything!"" and has even asked me for rides which I have said no as well.  I want to sever this connection as I feel like it's invading my time when I'm constantly getting texts asking where I am, what I'm doing, and if I can stop what I'm doing right now and drive her somewhere.  

As of now I've been ignoring the messages as I don't see her because I don't work there anymore, but it's making me feel like an awful human being."

**BACKGROUND** I am about to graduate from the University of Maryland in less than a month, with a degree in Government and Politics (* UMD's Political Science major). Before I get chastised for picking a liberal arts major, I justified my decision for two significant reasons:

* Politics and government are my true passion, and the one subject that I never seem to get bored with.
* I had a number of significant high school (student school board member, state legislative page) and college internships with federal(USDOT), state (MD House of Delegates, [CAPC](capc.umd.edu)) and local government (Rent Control Board Member, City Council Liaison). 

My GPA is a bit embarrassing, at a solid 2.86. Throughout college I have consistently worked a part-time job, struggled with severe depression, worked as an RA, and was elected to student government. Additionally I see a therapist weekly for depression/anxiety issues, and I am currently taking 10mg Adderall three times daily.
****
**CURRENT PROBLEMS**

* No employment prospects
* Overbearing parents
* Can't maintain enough savings from part-time income.
* insatiable desire to run for public office, or be involved in public service.
****
**PERSONAL SKILLS**

* I am quick to read and understand people, and am quick to empathize/relate to other people's problems.
* Good debater/public speaker (can improvise speeches off the top of my head).
* I can learn really quick, and I research everything - wasting many hour scouring wikipedia for no reason.
* I'm relatively proficient with PCs and widely-used office software.
* I love meeting people and being on the move. I would be miserable at a desk job/cubicle job. 
* I have a strong work ethic when I enjoy what I do, but I am terribly lazy when I am bored or uninterested in the work. 
* I can explain complicated and inter-related concepts in layman's terms. I've been told I would be a good teacher.
* I like to think I write well, and I weirdly obsess over orderliness despite the fact that my home life is messy (laundry, dishes, etc.) 
****
MY PROBLEM: I am interested in pursuing more education - particularly law school or a MPA/MBA. Though I am almost positive that my GPA and college performance makes this unrealistic. I don't really care if I make a massive salary - I'm more interested in finding a career that I am passionate about, that won't be hindered by my ADHD.
****
TL;DR I am an anxiety-ridden ADHD graduating college senior who has a mediocre GPA but aspires to be a successful and happy. Please ask questions!

spogo,1,2012-04-24,random thoughts,throwaway2345645,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/spogo/random_thoughts/,"I'm 21, on my last year of uni, doing the last projects I'm going to do and waiting for an internship opportunity to come up.

Last year I got into a massive depression that almost ended the already fragile friendship I had with a couple of classmates, who are the only people I have ever met who I could remotely consider friends.

I went to a doctor who sent me to another doctor who sent me to a psychiatrist who send me to a pshycologist and I have been taking first sertraline and then anafranil for the best part of a year.

My mood has been somewhat better, but I still felt like shit in the inside. A couple weeks ago my pshycologist told me she would be leaving the center where I see her and she would be replaced by someone I don't know. This came after visit upon visit of talking more about my OCD problems than my emotional problems. To her it is as if after being diagnosed with OCD everything had to do with that.

I'm emotionally unstable, I'm jealous of other people's habilities to make friends and communicate with other people and I can't stop thinking about the fact that I can't achieve that, that the couple people I had a friendship in class meant much more to me than I to them, I'm just another person in their collection of contacts and friends and people they can be with.

I've got no personality, no treats that make me special. I've been told I'm a good student pretty much all my life and I focused on being a good student because it is the only thing I knew I could do, but I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of feeling nothing, of working for the sake of working, of feeling alone, of not achievieng anything...

My days consist of waking up, eating and then spending the rest of the day in bed because I have nothing else to do, I don't feel like doing anything, I have no one to talk to, no one to share anything with and the only thing that has any meaning in my life is the two projects that I have to do for uni and that I hate and that I'm not able to do properly for god knows what reason.

I'm sick of feeling nothing but a void inside me. I feel useless, I can't do anything that I thought I was remotely good at before, I have no motivations, I'm growing older every day and every day I feel worse, more alone and further away from the life that I would like to have lived.

I stopped taking the anafranil, I stopped going to my therapist, I stopped caring for the work I have to do and for everyone I have to do it with. I have had suicidal thoughts for months, before, during and after the depression I had last year and the visits I had with doctors and more doctors.

The only thing that scares me is pain. I think about overdosing but I have nothing but diazepan that could do anything to me, and the ammount I need is not available. I think about cutting my veins, but fear it for it being to painful. I think about taking cyanide, rat poison or whatever the fuck I know would work, but I fear not taking enough or taking too much would fuck me up instead of killing me. I think of jumping off the highest building I have access to, but couldn't make myself jump after the two times I have tried. I think of cutting whatever other veins or artheries there are in my body that could make me bleed to death as fast as possible. I think of shooting myself in the head, but I have no weapons available, so I think of stealing one from wherever maybe a hunter in the forest. I think about drowning, about jumping in front of a car, a train, the metro.

Every day of my life I think about the lack of meaning or significance it has. Fuck a family that I don't like, fuck the people who say that care but do not care. I'm alone and I can't share anything. I'm feeling less and less able each day. My life is a failure and I can't see myself achieving any of the things I thought were possible when I was younger. I have no motivations to live and I live every day waiting for it to end because there is no joy in any moment of it for me."
spjzb,0,2012-04-24,"Hey Reddit, I really need some advice deciding what to do about something important to me...",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/spjzb/hey_reddit_i_really_need_some_advice_deciding/,"This will be a long post but hopefully someone will be willing to read it and help me out. So a little back story first. To start off, I'm 18 years old. Since my freshman year in high school, I concurrently went to a community college, taking 11 units every semester eventually getting an AA. I haven’t had a break since the transitioning summer of freshman to sophomore. I did an internship my sophomore and junior summer and took summer classes after I graduated to get a little ahead. Now that I graduated, I'm attending college but I'm seriously burnt out. Last semester I got mediocre grades and this semester it’s pretty much the same. I really want to get at least B's in my classes but I'm finding it to be very difficult to do so. I took classes in Biotechnology in high school, I took enough to receive a certificate in it from the community college, and since I found that really fun and interesting I decided to major in it. However, in order to get my bachelors and eventually masters, I need to take Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. As most of you may know these classes are demanding and require a lot of time devoted to them. These classes just aren't as interesting to me as Biology, which is another reason why I'm not doing so well with grades at the moment. 
	
During the summer I was hoping to get a lot of stuff out of my system and just take it easy. I was planning to return to school in the fall but not as a full time student and get a part time job. That way I can still go to school, have some extra money and not over work myself. Come spring and I will be a full time student, mind rested and hopefully be in the game and seriously study and what have you. Having said that, my mother doesn’t think I should do that. She wants me to stay a full time student and hurry up and graduate. I live close to my college so I still live with her. Since I’m a full time student right now, we made a deal that I don’t have to pay rent and other expenses. I also still get her benefits from her job. This however is only if I stay as a full time student. I told her of my plan and she gave me a lecture about how as soon as I get a job I will quite school and end up nowhere. Her benefits won’t benefit me anymore and I will have to pay rent, my own food, cell phone, and other stuff. *Note*, she is an immigrant who only went up to the sixth grade in Guatemala. She has worked hard and I understand what she getting at but she doesn’t know how stressful college can be. I don’t plan on fully quitting college, just taking it slow for now. 
	
I was also thinking of joining the reserves mostly for the benefits they offer. I went to talk to a recruiter but I felt like he was just telling me stuff I wanted to hear so I can join as soon as possible. Maybe someone can help me out with this as well. 
	
Thanks for reading. Can you give some advice on whether I should stay as a full time student and just soldier on or if I should follow my plan to take it easy for a semester or two?

**TL; DR**: I’m stressed from school and want to take it easy for a semester or two, mom thinks taking it easy will be a bad idea resulting in me never graduating and making me a failure. What should I do?

So I'm in the middle of a tricky situation where I may face a semester suspension at my university due to a breach of the student honor code.

I still require one more year to graduate and would like some suggestions as to what the best plan of action is for me to do during this time frame.

If I am suspended, it would be for the upcoming Fall semester and not affect my current student status. I have already obtained an internship for this summer, and if I perform well, may receive a job offer for when I graduate.

Now if I do get suspended, I will not be able to go back to school after my summer internship. If my internship goes well, would it be an option to ask if I could extend my internship throughout Fall as well? Would it be a bad idea to tell my supervisor I could work longer because of my suspension? 

I wanted to get an idea if this is an option, or if it would be better for me to just finish my summer internship and apply elsewhere for opportunities until I finish my degree, and potentially go back for full time.

Best."

I've been working in this position for 4 months.

My background is in mechanical engineering and industrial energy efficiency engineering, which I did for five years.  I liked the topic, but there was no design.

In my manufacturing internship, someone found out that I had this energy experience and grabbed me for 4 hours a week helping with energy projects.  There is no dedicated energy person on-site and I'm the most experienced energy person on-site.  There's no comprehensive energy plan.

I love the energy work far more than my manufacturing engineering.  My boss has only hinted at me being hired full time at some point in the future, and has explicitly said that I won't be doing my energy work anymore.  I have no commitments from them beyond that despite me asking about a job offer several times over the past four months.  Once I was even told to keep it on the ""down-low"" as if it was some kind of secret.  The only explanation given was that ""the division head is working on it.""  What does that mean??

I don't know if my ego is just too large, but it feels like opportunity is being pulled away from me.  With the energy work, I am in contact with the highest managers on-site and trying to bridge the gap between PM, capital shortages, and energy savings plant-wide.  With manufacturing, I'm working on a very small footprint of a small building, in contact with middle management, and will be spending a considerable amount of time as process support; doing the same job that non-engineers do, and not using any of my math or engineering skills.  I'm also afraid they'll use that as an excuse to low-ball any offer they give me.

Does manufacturing engineering have good prospects for advancement?  Will I be wasting my ME skill set and putting myself at risk of stagnation?  I don't understand non-desk jobs and it has me freaked out, clearly.

Thank you to anyone who reads all of this and replies.  I really appreciate your advice because this has kept me stressed out much more than I need in my final semester.  I have spent a lot of time talking about energy efficiency in this forum, so I'm not just a lurker hoping to take advantage of your kindness.  I do appreciate it.

Now I need some help making a decision on where to work and what offers are my best choices. 

Currently, I have an internship opportunity for a company I would love to work for over the summer. Only problem is I'd need to enroll in school to be eligible for the internship which is something I would consider but the costs are concerning.

The next opportunity is a job in another city that is expensive to live in. The salary would be enough to get by but no real room for substantial savings. The job is for a start-up company and I am reluctant because I've worked for one before and it is draining. I emailed a current employee of the company I know through mutual friends to see what they say about the company culture.

And last option is keep looking for work where I am: in a small city living with family. The ability to save money would be highest here although it is also a lot slower to find work and I don't have many connections here.

It's been about a year since I passed my preliminary exams and began research (but still I don't expect to graduate until 2015 plus or minus a year); in January I switched advisers due to complete disenchantment with my previous topic (no bridges burnt), but for a few reasons I'm just unhappy with things right now and want to try to apply around and see if I can't get a nice offer. In case it's relevant, I'm in an applied math program at the computational end of the spectrum and will be looking in the technology sector - data analysis and the like. There are a few details about my resume that I've got questions about given the situation:

1. Presently I've included names of my various research advisers/mentors throughout my academic career; should I not? At the very least my current adviser is a (relatively) well-publicized name, but some sources do seem to suggest excluding all names of any sort apart from my own.
2. A consequence of 1.: I *certainly* don't want my current adviser (or former, or anyone at my school) to be contacted by a recruiter; to that end I included a line at the end stating ""References available upon request."" Again, sources suggested such a line is superfluous and assumed, but I felt that it may deter any calls/contact to the names I have listed before we've actually discussed references. Thoughts?
3. I keep hearing different things about this: should I include GPA? I don't have any experience outside of academic research (and a research-oriented summer internship). All my GPAs since undergrad are quite nice, and because of my format including them isn't wasting vertical space.

Any feedback is appreciated."
svmic,62,2012-04-27,"Is it a scam? It's probably a scam. List of experiences dealing with scams, scum, and deceit.  ",ckallas2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/svmic/is_it_a_scam_its_probably_a_scam_list_of/,"### First some background about me:

I graduated the University of Illinois in 2010 with a bachelors in political science and an associates in philosophy. I have taken grad school level statistics courses, had paid positions in political campaigns, am currently interning in the marketing department of a theatre (we've had Lewis Black, Jack Hanna, and we are going to have Brian Regan), and I have another summer marketing internship lined up at the local chamber of commerce.

I tell you all of this to let you know that anyone can fall for a scam job proposal. I have fallen, or nearly fallen for, several such offers over the years. Starting in high school I have probably averaged 1 scam job offer per year, these last three months not withstanding. Over these last three months I have received 12 job offers that were all too good to be true. The first several interviews I received (way back in high school) I treated with the utmost respect; trying to garner the favor of the conman/woman. I ignored my proper senses which all told me these places were basically being run by carnies telling me anything I wanted to hear. I have become intimately familiar with their schemes, pitches, long cons, and everything in between because I started going to these interviews for fun. Messing with the recruiter, informing others in my group interview how their schemes work, and generally causing a ruckus. Honestly doing this is more relaxing for me than getting a massage. Moving on. 

## Why does this matter to you? Well I can help you, the desperate job seeker, from being taken advantage of by scalawags and malcontents. Here is a short list of things for which to be on the look out. 

***

**1) They call you out of nowhere but insist you sent them your resume.** 

Everybody knows that the economy is terrible which translates into high unemployment. These companies know that job seekers must send out resumes *en mass* trying and snag a position, any position, with a legitimate company. When you update your online resume via careerbuilder, monster, or linkedin you are adding chum to the water and these sharks can smell it. 

How to combat this trick: Keep a list of companies that you send your resume to; make sure to include parent company. Now when their recruiter calls and says ""I'm calling about the resume you sent in to company X"" you can say ""I never sent a resume into company X"". This is one small step in getting the upper hand.

Similar Tactic: Sometimes companies will just tell you that they trawled your resume from monster/careerbuilder/linkedin. This gives you the upper hand immediately because you know how to proceed. Most companies do not grab low level resumes off of a resume website; they make potential candidates vie for position by listing the opening. This is the first red flag people should get.

**2) When they set up the interview they tell you how to dress. (Make sure to dress up!)**

This is a sign that the interview is not going to be legitimate. Most companies will give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dressing yourself, the ones that don't are generally trying to set a mood for the interview. They are going to have a group interview and they want each of you to look professional so that the illusion of legitimacy is maintained even when other candidates are present. 

**3) If they ever use the term 'multilevel marketing'.**

Most of you are familiar with this type of sales structure but I am going to give a quick rundown for those that are not. A multilevel marketing strategy (scheme) is basically a legalized pyramid scheme. The recruiter is trying to build a team. Each member of that team will be giving a percentage of each sale to the recruiter. They encourage you to recruit a team so that you can start making that sweet recruiter income. You, in turn, will encourage your team to recruit more members. In several iterations the population of the planet will be working for you! Imagine what kind of check you will receive then!

**4) They offer 'unlimited income'.**

If you just work hard enough you can make as much as you want. We have people making six figures a month. 

This phrase, and explanation, is just used to put the burden on your shoulders. If you don't succeed then it is *your* fault, not the fault of the company or the recruiter. They will impress you with figures like 'just three sales a day and you will be making $2000 per week and that doesn't include the residuals!' and 'average starting salary is $5000/month!'. Maybe some sales people are earning $2000/week (or $5000/month) but they don't work for this company. 

How to combat this trick: These types of companies are basically made of hubris. They will never expect that you will try to validate their numbers. That's why they generally have a 'top earners' newsletter. That newsletter will be prominently displayed in the waiting room. Read it and see what types of salaries their 'top earners' make. If they have a top ten list, as they often do, then notice the bottom four or five salaries. You will notice something frightening: they aren't making as much as the touted 'average salary' of a starting employee. If the 'top earners' aren't making $5000/month then how the hell can they claim that as the 'average' salary. 

**5) We offer a flexible schedule where you work the days you want and you are your own boss.**

Bullshit. The recruiter is going to be on your back everyday to get out there and sell. Even if they aren't you are looking at 12-14 hour days just driving around from potential sale to potential sale not actually selling anything. Your recruiter is your boss and your hours of operation are always. 

**6) During the interview they ask what salary you want to earn and then they say ""don't low-ball yourself; I see someone like you making 8-10 thousand dollars a month at least.""**

This is just poor baiting. They are making you feel inadequate about only wanting what you need to survive and they are, again, putting your failure (when it inevitable comes) directly on your shoulders. 'They knew you could do it, but you didn't work hard enough'. It's also an appeal to the kid in all of us who once thought that we could be making $100K/year.

How to combat this trick: Ask them how much they make a month. They will be taken aback but they will also be in 'sell mode' so they are not going to say ""I can't tell you that."" They are also not going to tell you what they make (because it is roughly equivalent to 1/20th of a pittance). They will make an allusion to a six figure income but don't believe it for one second. They barely scrape by but by getting you in on the gig they will barely scrape by more comfortably. Ask who makes their suits (because you want to buy one when you start making the big girl/boy dollars). If they say George then they are dressed in Wal-mart chic (which there is nothing wrong with but very unlikely when making $100K a year). If they say Armani, Gucci, etc ask to see the label. Call them out on everything. 

**7) They insist you pay for training/product to sell.** 

They will say things like 'well we have to insure that you have a drive to sell this product' or 'it's company policy that each employee own our brand of knives/shoes/insurance'. With a simple wave of the wand they have made you into a customer instead of an employee. If you need a certificate for a job, that makes sense. Some jobs require additional training. If they require you to buy the product you are trying to sell, run!

**8) It's going to be a three part interview. Group interview, panel interview, one on one interview.** 

Just say no to group interviews. These are just presentations designed to sell you the product. Your peers are there to create an atmosphere in which you are afraid to ask questions. It also makes their small office seem populated and hospitable instead of cold and dead (like the inside of the recruiter's heart)


**Epilogue)** That's my advice. It is not comprehensive but it is, I hope, helpful. Each of these things are red flags which means that some legitimate companies may employ some of these tactics. That doesn't legitimize the tactic but it means that you have to be extra vigilant. Remember: companies need to prove themselves to you just as much as you need to earn a place within them. If a company feels scammy, it is a scam!

Good luck job hunters; I hope I have helped.

suxci,1,2012-04-27,Am I completely screwed?,[deleted],UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/suxci/am_i_completely_screwed/,Hey reddit I really need help with some advice. Last semester I got a 3.04 GPA and this semester I'm probably going to get anything between a 3.11-3.27 depending on the grades I get on some papers I already turned in and on my finals. I'm an aerospace engineering major and I'm really worried I've royally screwed myself out of any chance of doing well in school. I know the GPA isn't terrible but my though process is this: I won't be able to raise my GPA above a 3.2 by the beginning of next semester so I won't be eligible to apply for any internships over summer after sophomore year which means I'll come into junior year way behind the majority of other students in my class. What I need to know is if there are any engineering majors who have made their way out of a similar problem and how they did it. Thanks for the help in advance.
surfx,1,2012-04-26,"Considering applying to law school for a career in patent law, is it worth it?",mastaace,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/surfx/considering_applying_to_law_school_for_a_career/,"I am currently a computer science/engineering major and I am seriously considering applying to law school for fall 2013. Since it is getting close to the time when I need to either start studying and preparing for the LSAT or otherwise start on the path to grad school, I figured I should get educated a bit before I decide. So here goes:

-I currently have a 3.57 LSAC GPA (plan on at least a 3.6 before graduation). Assuming I get a reasonable LSAT score (165-170), what are my chances of getting in to a top 20 school?

-Assuming that I do not get in to a top 20, would it even be worth it at this point, as far as my getting out of student loan debt is concerned, to pursue a career in patent law?

-I have two internships under my belt as well as several leadership positions in on campus organizations. Also, if all goes well I should be graduating with honors (honors program as well as academic honors). Will this have any basis on my being admitted? 

-I come from a white middle class family, and did not have any spectacular hardships growing up. What would be the best way to make my personal statement stand out if at all possible?

-Is a career in patent law, particularly in software and/or computer engineering if it matters, a satisfying career choice in the first place?

That's about all that I can think of at the moment, but I would welcome any other advice!

sykc5,0,2012-04-29,Job Offer: be my Secretary / Coach,garoththorp,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/sykc5/job_offer_be_my_secretary_coach/,"**TL;DR** I'll pay you (negotiable: 50$/week) to manage my schedule and nag me to get things done on time.

I think the greatest challenge I've had during my stay at school has been time management. I'm just awful at it. The related problem is that it's taken me a few years and several failed courses to realize that this is something I'm terrible at. What I need is someone to pretty much make me accountable for my time, and force me, contractually to do the things that I should be doing -- while resisting the urge to point out how much of a lazy arse I am.

**So here's my proposition:**

I pass off some fairly simple tasks to you, such as handing you my assignment papers and having you make sure my calendar is correctly kept. Then once the datapoints are there for when I need to have things in by, you'd figure out about how long it'd take, and schedule time for me to do it -- and check back later to make sure that I'm actually on track. Basically, the goal is to ""mentor"" me to get my stuff done on time, and create accountability.

I don't generally require tutoring or anything of that sort; I'm just lazy. This position would basically be a cross between an executive assistant style job, and a coaching style job where you yell at me do extra pushups.

My only prerequisite for this position would be that you're also not a lazy sort of person, so some proof of you actually getting stuff done in your own time would be nice (decent grades or something). I guess some psychology courses would be helpful, though not mandatory.

I figure a fair salary would be about 50$ a week -- since really, it shouldn't take much time at all to manage a calendar and phone / text me occasionally. Should go a long way to covering weekly living costs if you're trying to save money. We can negotiate the price when we meet.

Anyway, so just send me a private message on Reddit here for extra information / to schedule a time to meet up on campus. Thanks for reading.

**My Background:**

I'm a 22 year old male computer scientist. I've finished all of my internships and am on my last few semesters of school. In general, I'm a fairly sociable guy and interested in philosophy and startups. In my spare time, I like to play board games and video games -- the usual."

[Hint: hit enter twice to create a break/paragraph.  Wall of text is difficult to read.  With that out of the way, thanks for the AMA, it sounds interesting.  What are the salaries like for your work?  Or is it more like contractor work, paid by the job?  I would think public speaking skills are important, to appear credible/likeable if you need to testify in court. I'm assuming court testimony is part of the deal, but have no clue - is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7zk?context=5)|Salaries are competitive with those of Civil Engineers in conventional areas. Yes, testimony can be part of the deal. But most of the time a case will never see the court room.

[What is the most bizarre accident you've ever had to reconstruct? One that really made you wonder how the hell they managed it?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hogw5?context=5)|My boss told me about the case, which happened long before I started doing this type of work. Based on the story he told me, I requested the set of depositions. My intention was to write a story based on them; they are Cohen Brothers script quality stories. I need to put it in motion.
[Is it harder to reconstruct an accident when ABS brakes are involved (due to fewer skid marks\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoj8r?context=5)|Slightly harder, but nowadays vehicles are equipped to record a long period of pre-crash data through the Airbag system. This, along with damage to the vehicle tells the rest of the story.
[How much historical data do those units record, i.e. is it recorded if the airbag doesn't deploy, and how far back does the information go?  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpeeb?context=5)|There are two types of events that are recorded in the Airbag module. Most auto manufacturers since about the year 2000 are equipped with such devices. This varies from make to make. The event can be a deployment event, in which the bumper sensor tells the computer to deploy the airbag; usually at higher speeds. Also, non deployments get recorded at times, these are low speed impacts which tell the computer not to deploy the airbag. The amount of time and data recorded vary. Typically you'll see information such as driver seat buckle on or of, speed 5 seconds before deployment, brake on or of, accelerator throttle, etc.
[Do you need some sort of authorization from the owner to get this information from the airbag module?  EDIT: 'Black boxes' (event data recorders\) mandatory for new cars in 2015. Source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uy?context=5)|This varies from state to state. In my state, It is necessary for us to fill out a form signed by whoever has taken ownership of the vehicle post accident.
[So bumper sensors actually exist? I didn't think cars actually had airbag deployment sensors housed in the bumper, it sounds like an easy way to have an accidental deployment. I thought they deployed based on the input from a few accelerometers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hstus?context=5)|It's a combination of both: [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag#How_airbags_work)

[Cool! What kind of a background do you have in terms of education? I can imagine many subjects which would be beneficial, but none that would encompass all of the skills I presume need to be possessed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hom9n?context=5)|I have a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering as well as several accident reconstruction and software courses.
[Whow. you were a civil engineer and switched into this ? If you dont mind me asking, what is the more lucrative career ? (I'm on my way to becoming a civil engineer. I don't ask because I plan to switch, just because I'm curious\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htdt0?context=5)|They're pretty well aligned monetarily, though in this line of work I travel a whole lot.

I get to meet a lot of interesting people and eat at a lot of great hidden treasure like places. From time to time I'll end up in a city where I know people and we'll have dinner, etc.
[Has the job changed the way you drive? Are you more wary of the dangers of driving, or put off certain brands of car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp0i7?context=5)|My job has changed the way drive indeed. I try to be very observant while driving through intersections. 
[If I'm driving behind someone and they purposefully slam their brakes to get me to rear end them, and there are no witnesses, can you prove that the accident was their fault?  And how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4homro?context=5)|It'd be difficult to prove that. The gold standard seems to be that the rear ender is usually at fault. If you can prove that his brake lights were not functioning before the collision, then you may have a case.
[Is it remotely possible to prove that the brake lights weren't working? Without the use of a dash-cam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4houpa?context=5)|There's a method in which you analyze the filament of a light bulb of a car involved in a collision. If it's streched it means the lights were hot (on) when it got struck, if it's a brittle fracture it's likely the lights were off. This makes a decent argument.
[Is it possible, at least in some scenarios, to examine tire marks to determine what happened? you'd think that the front driver suddenly slamming on the breaks would leave a trail on the asphalt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp2bm?context=5)|Yes. The deceleration rate (usually in units of g's or gravity-32.2 ft/s) is dependent upon condition of tires (new or old), surface details (new asphalt, grass, etc) and weather surfaces (rain, snow). A typical deceleration rate is 0.7 g's for normal wear tires on pavement.
[But if you get rear ended the tail lights more often than not get damaged. what happens if the lightbulbs were crushed in the accident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp6dh?context=5)|You'd be surprised how well the filament will hold up 
[How much fun is it, after you've investigated the skid patterns, debris, etc. to prove in court that someone was clearly lying about their speed, etc.?  Also, what's the craziest accident you've ever had to reconstruct, or the most challenging?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hobqv?context=5)|Challenging involves multiple vehicles usually. There was this one where a tractor trailer was coming down a ramp at a rapid speed while merging onto the highway, the truck flipped on its side and vehicles traveling on the highway collided with it. There was a ton of evidence marks and speeds had to be determined for three different vehicles.
[How did you get into that line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoaf2?context=5)|I started an internship while in college, liked it and stuck with it. 
[What is the most fucked up accident you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpe9c?context=5)|There was one where a farm vehicle was carrying a large wooden post horizontally and aligned with the horizon for approaching traffic (I hope that makes sense). He was driving on the side of the road and the wooden post was hovering above the lane of travel. A passenger truck drove through it and it seemed as thought the passenger who got hit by the post had literally exploded.  The farm owner was liable for damages.
[Do you work for a state, city or county agency?  How long was the course you had to take to become an accident reconstructionist (yes, it is not something you just learn ""on the job""\)?  How many years have you done this? and of course, worst accidents you've had to be on scene for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hox3w?context=5)|I work for an independent third party. I've gone through several courses. I have a BS in Civil Engineering and took a 2 week course in Northwestern University. I've been doing this now for 7 yrs. Worst accidents are usually the ones involving families and head on collisions. There was one where the truck driver was impinged onto a tractor trailer while it was on fire. He was still alive and communicating before he died. I get to read many pages of depositions where all the unpleasant details come out.
[Do you find that people driving larger (non-commercial\) vehicles tend to cause more accidents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hovcf?context=5)|That's a loaded question. Kidding. Well truck drivers are operating a machine about 16 times the weight of the average passenger vehicle and traveling at similar speeds. They carry more energy and have a larger tendency to be involved in accidents. Also their perception/reaction time is longer so they have less distance to work with.
[Do you ever analyze vehicles that were struck by a train? If so, does that involve different or more complex analysis than car-on-car collisions?  What's your hourly rate? Does it change for serving as an expert witness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7p0?context=5)|A train decelerates much much slower than tires on pavement. Investigating an accident involving a train requires permission from the railroad companies as well as research and evidence documentation. Were there cross bucks and gates? Lights? As far as methodology, it can be analyzed as a conservation of momentum case.
[If someone were to make ridiculous House/Psyche/CSI dramatization of what you do with you as the quirky dick of a reconstructionist genius solving the most important car crashes ... ya know, Princess Diana shit... who would you like to play you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpc9e?context=5)|Will Ferrell.
[What kind of advice would you have for road users?  What do you think is realistically possible? (With these two I mean like, licensing changes? policy change? whatever, etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpkhs?context=5)|I'd advice to pay attention always, especially when on high speed highways. Don't travel when tired, intoxicated, etc.
[Have you heard of SATAI?  Perhaps you have friends who are members.  What is your opinion of the organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hox69?context=5)|I have. I am not from that state, but I am a member because I took a course with them. Accident Reconstruction associations are generally reputable; most of them are made up of ex-police officers.
[So, my dad is a Marine Corps lifer.. and for a good portion of his career as a military police officer he doubled as an accident investigator. For a long time, he had a sawed in half tire filled with cement and a chain hanging out of it that lived in our garage. I assume it was some homemade instrument he used for teaching himself about tread marks.. I dunno. Anyway, during this particular part of his career I was conveniently learning how to drive. He decided one evening to show me pictures of some investigations he had been working on in an effort to scare me into driving more safely. It worked. I got my own Red Asphalt lesson right in our living room. My question is... have there been any particular accidents that have really shaken you or stuck with you throughout your career? Do you feel you drive more carefully knowing things like how fast your car will continue to travel after you hit the brakes if you're going 80 down the highway?  *Edit* - I accidentally a word.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpjki?context=5)|That's called a drag sled ([Link to www.gazettenet.com](http://www.gazettenet.com/files/images/20100524-232949-pic-5669238.display.jpg))
 |Police photos of a really bad accident are not very pleasant, but I've become a little more desensitized over time. I imagine people in the medical field have to adjust similarly. Working around death certainly lets me know to live my personal life to the fullest. And I'm not perfect driver, but I abide by all driving laws and try to share the road as much as possible.
[Have you started fight club yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpfoc?context=5)|I'm actually a huge Chuck Palahniuk fan.
[Curious if you subscribe to the same sort of skepticism presented by the narrator in Fight Club when he's talking about analyzing accidents for the big corps.

It was striking to find out that there are economic analysis companies that will put a pricetag on how much a deceased person involved in an accident is worth, based on age, profession and expected lifespan.
[How do you feel working with cars in which people have died?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp62i?context=5)|It's strange to come across brain matter and other bodily fluids during a vehicle inspection; certainly not my cup of tea.

Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp3cj?context=5)|I believe an insurance adjustor commented on an earlier thread that most of insurance fraud is medical billing. People generally lie about how fast they were going.
[What percentage of accidents you've investigated actually involved fraud, e.g. people intentionally crashing into things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp76w?context=5)|This is a very low percentage.

In fact, we have these glasses with a camera dot on the center of the eyes. We get a hold of someone the same height to wear them in the driver seat and record different points of view. This tool proved important in a case where a truck driver didn't see a pedestrian crossing as he accelerated after being stopped and therefore collided with the pedestrian.

How much more difficult would that make your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqzcu?context=5)|If your vehicle has a salvage title, chances are that after it was rebuilt, the airbags were not present. If these are not present, then there is no report filed by the module.  As far as analyzing the damage to your vehicle, we usually run a carfax report on the vehicles we investigate for that same reason.
[In a middle school math class, we had a police officer come in to give us an overview of accident reconstruction (specifically using skid marks and thugs to determine speed at an accident...many years ago do I don't remember much\).

Obviously the more airbags you add the better. Side curtains make a vehicle safer. My boss switched from Ford to Nissan a few years back because Nissan offers side airbags.
[I'm currently taking a course on Traffic Theory (Criminal Justice degree\) and we just studied a major 3-scene crash that happened on I-43 near Sheboygan, WI, in 2002. 50 vehicles were involved, 39 people injured, and 10 people fatally injured.

A major tip I can share is that if you're ever involved in a vehicular accident, whether it's your fault or not, take a high amount of photographs and remember that everything you say initially will end up in a police document at one point or another. If the accident is severe enough, hire an attorney. We live in a litigious society.

This is known as hot shock. If the break of the filament is brittle or if it's undamaged, it's likely the lights were off. This is cold shock.
[Saw that you have a BS in civil engineering, and was wondering if this was a job you could get with any bachelors degree or if you had to be more specialized?

I would recommend getting a linked in account and preparing a nice profile of your resume. Also, ""follow"" and join groups relating to this field; i.e. forensic engineering companies and accident reconstruction as well.

I am currently a senior (c/o 2013) in college pursing majors in Philosophy and Political Science and a minor in Computer Science. I had initially planned to go to law school after graduating, but after spending two years working as a paralegal, I realized law is not for me, but Computer Science, in fact, is.

As I am so far into my degree program already (24 credits stand between me and graduation at this point), I have settled for minoring in Computer Science and keeping my original majors. I realize that a minor in CS will not get me anywhere employment-wise, so I am looking into applying to and enrolling in a “transitional” Computer Science master’s program aimed at people moving into CS from a non-technical field.

I have a few questions related to my situation:

* Will potential employers look down on me for having an undergraduate background in a non-technical field, or will the fact that I’m pursuing graduate education entirely trump that? 

* What can I do over this last year of undergrad to make myself an attractive candidate to potential employers despite my non-traditional background? I doubt I’ll be able to get a relevant internship since I’m only a minor and not a major, so what sorts of personal projects should I be looking into buff up my resume? Any ideas on networking to make contacts in the field?

* Am I being fatalistic to assume that I won’t be able to find work in the field until I complete my master’s and thus have a bona-fide CS degree or will I be able to job hunt with any degree of reasonable success once  I have a CS master’s in progress?

* Is there anything else I should know that I’ve failed to even touch upon?

Thanks for the help!"

I am applying for the Human Resources Internship position within your company as posted on www.internships.com. With the knowledge I have of working on deadline, handling numerous tasks at one time, and my capability to successfully manage duties independently, I know my experience will be an asset to this position.

 

In a previous position, I worked as a Work Study Assistant within Penn State’s Human Resources Development Center. In this position, I worked closely with HRDC employees in researching and compiling data for upcoming campus-wide programs and presentations. I often worked with multiple computer documents simultaneously, proofread and edited various documents, and prepared our facility for upcoming public presentations. I also performed general office duties including filing, copying, faxing, and assisting with project work. I developed the ability to handle assigned tasks in an independent fashion, and consistently returned finished work to my superiors in a timely manner.

 

In addition, I am comfortable and skilled at working in an office setting, and have a mind for details and organization. I am very talented in working with technology, and I am proficient in the Adobe and Microsoft Office programs, and can work on either a Windows system or a Mac.


I am always willing to put in that extra time in order to ensure a more perfect product; I am able to withstand a stressful environment, and remain productive and level-headed. I am a hard worker and quick to learn, and would greatly value the opportunity to intern at your company.

 

I am happy to answer any questions regarding this letter or the attached résumé. I look forward to speaking further with you at your convenience!

 

Sincerely,

I worked on the 15th floor, at beck and call to one of the costume designers. This woman was, to put it frankly, a straight bitch.

I remember one day I called my mother, crying, because the woman was so vile. My mother said, 'remember what I told you', and other comforting words, but those two rules really stuck with me.

I had my hands full with coffee and drafts on my way to work on a Monday morning, trying to keep my mother and I's conversation in my head.

A young man, another intern, jumped on before the doors closed, when the heavy weight limit alarm went off. 

Everyone groaned, knowing someone would have to get off.

I looked at the man who had just got on, and he looked ready to cry. He must be late, I thought to myself. On an ordinary day, I would have forced him off, but I just couldn't do it, not with my mother's words ringing in my head.

'Never put yourself before others.'

I opened the doors to the elevator again, and hopped out, knowing I could just wait for the next one. I smiled at the guy, and he smiled back.

""Thank you,"" he said.

""You're welcome,"" I said. 

My faith in humanity restored, I didn't notice how strange it was that the weight limit for the elevator to be a person off.

I reported it to the maintenance man who nodded and said he'd check on it.

Later that evening, I flipped the news on and was shocked to see my place of work on the television screen, 'breaking news' in red scrolling beneath it.

I had heard that one of our models had gone missing that weekend.

Apparently someone had thrown her body into the elevator shaft.

No wonder the weight limit was off.

sywx6,4,2012-04-29,Any advice for someone looking to be a Database Admin?,herdyderdy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sywx6/any_advice_for_someone_looking_to_be_a_database/,"I'm graduating in about 6 months with a CS degree, and I've taken a couple elective classes that are heavy on databases/data streaming. These were by far the most interesting classes to me. If possible I'd like to get into DBA work or some kinda of database work as soon as possible when I graduate. All I can find though are job listings for people with 5+ years of database experience. I've only been looking in Portland, Oregon, however so maybe this isn't the greatest place for tech jobs (I'm planning on moving somewhere else when I graduate anyway). 

 I have about 6 months of experience in programming from an internship and a short contract job. Would these help me get a DBA position? "
