2f4j44,1,2014-08-31,Religious parent?,yimey,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2f4j44/religious_parent/,"My mother is a very religious and conservative Christian who doesn’t really tolerate other beliefs, at least not in her household. On the other hand, I have liberal views and wouldn't consider myself ""religious"" or ""christian"" since I don't necessarily believe in any particular religion. I'm sixteen and still living with her, and even though I try my best to keep from discussing politics or religion, it always causes conflict between us.
Right now I'm really focusing on school and my career by overloading my self with college coursework, SAT prep, and internships since I'm working really hard to attend college on scholarship.
However, my mother insists that I complete a religious course program that is offered in her church. It requires a lot of time and dedication in order to complete it (lesson plans, projects, memorization, and exams). I completed the first two preceding levels in elementary and middle school, but since then my life has had a complete turn around. Not only do I not have the time I used to, I am now completely against many of the things that this course teaches and stands for.
Completion of this course would require massive time, effort, and disrespect/disregard of my own beliefs. I don't want to take time out of my day to have to learn or make a project about how homosexuals are going to hell when I don't believe that homosexuality is a sin or that hell is a real place. I hate hypocrisy and I couldn’t stand to do this and become one myself.
She says it is “very important” to her for me to graduate from the course and have the ceremony because it will help me “grow spiritually”, but she doesn’t realize that having me do this is a disrespect of my beliefs. She doesn’t know that this is the issue because she doesn’t know what I believe in; I can't tell her because she would make it a big recurring issue between us just as she has for any disagreement that I try to peacefully discuss with her regarding religion or politics. At the end of it she always ends up yelling that I can have my own beliefs that will lead me into the pit of hell once I move out.
Although I feel strongly about this, I still respect my mother's beliefs and don't want to have yet another argument and damage our relationship any further. I already tried to emphasise how much work this requires and how little time I have because of school, but she insists that it’s not that difficult or time consuming (so this argument isn’t working).
So how can I explain this to her and go about a peaceful resolution where I don't have to take time from my day and go against my own beliefs and she doesn't give me hell for having my own beliefs and try to further forcibly convert me?"

I want to know to what extent this is actually the case as I am currently pursuing an EE degree (second year) and will soon have to choose between computer and electrical engineering.

I've done a lot of software internships and have generally enjoyed them, although I'm unsure if its something that I'd be interested in for life. I applied to EE thinking it would allow me to keep my options open, and that after graduating it would be possible to have access to a variety of both hardware and software jobs, assuming my co-ops were nicely varied. I want to know if this is possible. I go to uWaterloo if it's of any relevance."

2f6cnr,1,2014-09-01,What do I need in order to get a good internship?,[deleted],computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2f6cnr/what_do_i_need_in_order_to_get_a_good_internship/,"TL;DR: Should I stop resenting my job and work to better manage work and school?  

I don't like what I do but it pays OK. My situation is I get paid about 18-36/hr an hour for about 24 hrs a week.  I work 2 days a week Saturday, Sundays and Holidays.  What I do is a variety of things but primarily it is tech support.  Physically I am sitting in front of the computer all day but it is mundane stuff and not at all challenging.  I ideally want to find a paid internship that pays about the same.

My motivation for quitting is I don't feel that what I do is worthwhile anymore.  I am bored and I feel like my energy can be spent on other projects.  I have completed my resignation letter because I want an internship and a chance at real world experience.  I have not sent it because I am worried about not having an income and having to rely on loans.  Yes my husband makes enough money to support me and the kids but I like having a paycheck.  I don't know where to start and I'm not sure what kind of skills I need to make myself marketable.

1. My question is should I quit? I am not a normal undergraduate.  I am married with kids. What kind of compensation can I expect from an internship?  
2. Should I ask my company to give more challenging projects?  All engineering positions say full-time. I am also extremely awkward.  I just act however I want and don't really care about consequences or how I am going to be perceived.  But when I do try to make a good expression I usually have to research it.  So I would definitely like more advice on this.
3. What kind of jobs did you have while going to school?  
4. Or did you rely on student loans?  Was that better for you?"

This is something that has bugged me for a long time and it took a while to build up the gusto to post, but here it goes.
I'm in my last semester of college. I've done well grade wise (honors most semesters), have had some good work internships, etc. etc., but that's really where the positives ended for me in college.

I spent the first 3 years high as a kite with the same group of friends I met during Freshman move in. They are good guys and we're still close, but now that I don't smoke (as much), I feel like I've just wasted so much of my college opportunity. I barely met anyone. I've only been to one party. Don't really have friends outside my tiny stoner friend group.

And they don't do anything. Just sit around playing video games all day. They're nearly as bad as me, socially speaking.
I have anxiety, and it's really difficult for me to be social and meet new people and not come off as weird. I've never had many friends as a result. I think when I discovered weed it kind of took over my life as a coping mechanism, and next thing I know 3 years are gone behind me, and I haven't progressed any as a person. I haven't done the things you do in college; I haven't hooked up with anyone, I haven't dated or partied, I haven't experienced clubs or new things.. Just basically go to class, get high all day, and sleep.
And now on the cusp of graduating, I am filled with near crippling feelings of shame and self loathing, and feeling like I didn't take advantage of all the great social things I could have experienced... Particularly when it comes to relationships/sex, everyone keeps saying ""it'll never be as easy as college""... and that scares me.

I'm just full of so much regret and anger at myself, yet at the same time I'm so socially un-developed I don't know where to begin. I have a hard time even just holding conversations with people I don't know extremely well. I'm not very fit or thin. I don't really have appearance going for me. I just always feel like a social outcast and don't know how to fix it. I want to have friends and girls interested in me. I want to be invited to things. I want to experience life."
2f6xj7,3,2014-09-01,There is nothing so bad as the guilt I feel for giving a mother I hate as a person control over my life.,seapancake123,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2f6xj7/there_is_nothing_so_bad_as_the_guilt_i_feel_for/,"There's a cycle that's set the course of my life--I destroy everything, and then my mother swoops in at the last minute, sees the mess I've made, and either blocks me from fixing it as best I can or overcompensates, but by then, the damage is done.

Because I was depressed and genuinely ill as an undergrad, I almost flunked out, lied to my parents, and my mother half wrote my final papers as a senior. The worst thing, though--she figured me out. I should have taken care of it without her knowing. I confessed because I needed help. It's really worse than getting in trouble; with parents, you're not really inviting help, but more judgment than one can imagine.

Then, after I graduated, even though I begged my father to defend me she made it a condition of living at home to go to grad school, hysterical over the sign up date. He said, go for a year. I was too depressed and fucked in the head to really look for work, to insist that I was going to look for a job. So I settled into the lull and did okay, but there's always one class, one assignment, one obstacle to drag any endeavor when I'm dog-paddling on a good day down. I flunked out by .045 GPA (kicked out with a 2.945 GPA after two warnings--I made up the work and it didn't matter) and went to a much, much worse school. Finally figured out how to be a good student when I should have been working. I have a 3.7 GPA in a school I would have known not to go to as a teen and a shitty resume; that's it. 

I wasted the last five fucking years in grad school BECAUSE I had no resume to speak of, didn't know how to write one, and failed to intern when it would have been appropriate or done good---I don't really have one now, just a technical one based on working for an old man. And I don't know what to do. I smile and try to be positive in job interviews and it means nothing. I am 28 going on 13, and every interviewer see it. I am finally ready to work, and it just doesn't matter. I ruined everything. I am garbage. There is no reason I myself would hire me over people that made good decisions as students and employees. There is no room in this economy for perpetual fuck-ups. 

No one has ever loved me and I wouldn't either; cystic acne keeping me from wanting to be around people and depression have made me a stupid, boring, sheltered, painfully self-conscious person. 

Basically the only reason I am alive is for a father that's a heart patient. He's 63. If he goes, that's it, I lose everything. By needing him to intervene for me--an adult--with a woman that would kick me out tomorrow, I drag him down and obligate him to deal with her and suffer too. 

I am now unemployed apart from babysitting part time. And it's not real work--it's enough that I have one work related reference now when I look for entry level jobs, but not real work.  I make $150 a week and can buy groceries. I am 100% financially dependent on my parents. I don't know how to be an adult. Every job interview for a position or temp makes me feel like hanging myself afterwards because I can smile and pretend and the truth is that the interviewer see a lazy, immature, stupid, totally useless person who might as well have been dead for five or six years. 

But the thing is this--there is absolutely nothing that isn't painful, humiliating, exhausting or frightening that my mother does not make worse; I have had a toxic relationship with her (passive, immature person yielding to overbearing, shrill mother) since I was a teenager and instead of being smart and knowing either to kill myself or learn how to fucking start earning some money right quick, I made decisions beyond my worst nightmares (like graduate school in a school so bad I'm ashamed to put it on a resume), short of going to prison. And there is not a single painful, humiliating moment with my mother I can't imagine other people not blaming me for. There is not a single interaction with her that does not fill me with defensive disgust. She's insects crawling over me. I hate her because I have only known her as the the a shrill, overbearing, overreaction, angry answer to my fearfulness as a person, and shame.  I hate her because she reminds me of the weak, stupid person I am finally hoping I won't be anymore, before it's too late, and she makes me hate myself for it. I feel ugly and afraid all the time because I'm depressed, but there's really nothing for producing self-hatred that tops anger. 

It's already too late, in many ways. It is. I should have worked on getting her out of my life and learning to build some self-worth five years ago--not now. Not now, when no one wants me or needs me, and I have nothing of real value to offer. 

When I think of her there is enough adrenaline to punch her across a room or kill myself. I am doing SO BADLY and am so afraid without her putting me in myself. She makes it all worse. 

And it's my fault, because I live here.

I have been too fucking stupid and too immature to do right by myself and protect myself, or just take care of my own happiness. This is my fault, but knowing that makes me feel more suicidal, not less. It also makes me react like a cornered animal with my mother.

I don't like how I feel about her, but I can't will it away. I think of what I'd like to do to be not-suicidal in the future to be a working, mostly stable person (or make an effort) and she makes life so hard. 

I hate myself so much, because I know at least part of this cycle of powerlessness is my fault. There is a reason my friends don't live like this. I know my feelings aren't valid and even if I could get to a place where I believed that--it does. not. matter. I don't really control my happiness; she does. I handed it away."

I've just finished my first internship and it seems that everything I loved about computer science is now completely gone. It's not as if it's justified, as the company I worked for had amazing people (no pressure at all, people were really nice), I always had work that would mather for the company and it was computer science related. It was seriously the best internship I could have hope to get, but after four months, working 8 hours a day, I just felt useless. Not useless for the company, but useless in a different way, as I could not imagine myself working all my life in computer science. I want to be something more, and feel that programming can't help me achieve that goal.

I did not felt challenged intellectually as I hoped. Staying in front of the computer all day long was not as easy as I thought it would (and I'm an avid gamer). The worst of all is that I felt that my work was just useless, that I was nobody. I never really cared about money, I always wanted to do what I loved, and I was sure it would be computer related. I now want to become a doctor, as I'm starting my third year of university in computer science :\

Has anybody else felt the same way after his first internship? Did it get away or did you change degree because of it?

The Sahana Software Foundation is holding its Software Development Internship Program again this year from 13th October 2014 until 13th March 2015. This is a virtual internship and is open to applicants from any country. This program was highly successful last year, with two of the interns, Arnav Sharma and Somay Jain going on to participant in the Google Summer of Code program with the Sahana Software Foundation. If you want to learn more about the Sahana Eden work on developing solutions which help people affected by disasters then this is your chance! During the internship you will be working on a variety of tasks such as supporting deployments, fixing bugs, writing tests, porting and refactoring code and your own small projects.

This internship is for people who are interested in getting more guidance and mentoring to help them. It is only available for existing contributors to Sahana Eden, so if you are not already contributing, please look at how to get started.

As the Sahana Software Foundation is based on the voluntary contributions of our community of members, these internships are unpaid. We do offer mentoring from experienced community members, flexible working schedules, future opportunities for paid work and the opportunity to contribute to a humanitarian cause which has impacts around the world. However do not want an individual’s financial situation to exclude them from an internship opportunity, so a limited scholarship fund may be made available on a case-by-case basis. The scholarship will vary based on the individual situation of each intern.

2f8t8g,5,2014-09-02,He knew,Myrania,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2f8t8g/he_knew/,"This happened a while ago, when I was in college. Even though my country isn't so big, the college I went to was about an hour and a half by train away from my home. Because of this I decided I would move to the city where my college was stationed, moving in with two of my close friends, all of us women. Our apartment was on the second floor, where we shared a bathroom, kitchen and living room but had separate bedrooms. I got lucky; my bedroom was the smallest, but directly attached to it was our large balcony, where I could have breakfast in the sun.

We were an odd mix at first sight. Mandy was always off partying, never taking school serious but still acing her classes. Carla did study at first, but lately she's spent more time on her boyfriend than on her school, making me wonder if she'll pass the year. I've never had a boyfriend and tended to focus on nothing but school, trying to get the highest grades and I was already planning my internship a year ahead.

That night was no different. Mandy was at a party, trying to get me to come along, but as I had a test in the morning I wanted to spend my night studying and getting a good night's rest. She told me to call her if I changed my mind, I promised I would, knowing I would not change my mind. Carla was at Brent's place, staying the night, so I was home alone. After a few hours of studying and softly singing along to my music, I decided to call in a night; it was about 10 P.M. by now, so I'd get about 9 hours of sleep; plenty to do well on my test. I texted Mandy I wasn't going to make it to the party, which resulted in getting a disappointed-looking selfie from her and fell asleep quickly.

It wasn't until about 11:30 P.M. that I woke up again. The sound I woke up from was the balcony door sliding open; it was a very distinct sound, but as the balcony was on the second floor I didn't know how it could've opened, until I saw him. A man of average height, light skin and gray hair, dressed in jeans and a black hoodie. He was standing in the middle of my room, looking my way. I immediately closed my eyes, wishing him away, trying not to move a muscle. I heard him walk through my bedroom, going through my stuff; he opened some drawers, rummaged through my purse and it sounded as if he put some things in his pockets. It sounded like he opened the door and moved to the other parts of the house to look for more valuables.

I was contemplating calling the police, but I was too scared. I didn't dare open my eyes, nor grab my phone; I was too afraid the light of my screen would alert him. As Mandy never returned before midnight, I knew I was home alone and helpless by myself. After what seemed like forever I heard him shuffle into my room again. The footsteps stopped close to me and I felt his breath on me as he assumably bent over me and whispered into my ear: ""I know you're awake..."" Even though I wanted to scream, I stayed quiet, still firmly holding my eyes closed as I heard him snicker to himself and going back out through the balcony door. When I was sure he would be gone, I opened my eyes to see the open balcony door. I ran to it, closed it and called Mandy, who came home straight away. We found some of our money was missing, but as we were broke students, we didn't have many valuables that were available for stealing. We called the police, who told us to come by the next day as he had left the apartment, to fill in the charges.

The day after my dad came to pick me up, as I refused to stay there any longer, and later that week we moved my stuff out. I decided to change colleges to one closer to my parents' place, so I didn't have to live by myself for the coming years. The man was never caught, but he never entered their apartment again either. The policy suspect he managed to get onto our balcony from the neighbour's balcony, but nothing is sure."

Hi all,


I'm turning here for some general job advice. I have a situation I have been dealing with for some time. I have regularly been told that it will get better, that I need to be patient, and that things will improve. After waiting for several years, I'm beginning to be very discouraged and frustrated at work, and this is beginning to spill into my personal life and just effect my attitude in general. I'm looking for some thoughts on how I should handle my situation, which is beginning to feel like a never ending cycle of chasing a proverbial carrot. I have several issues, which I will outline below.


Some background. I graduated in May 2012 with two degrees (Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Arts with a Poli Sci focus). I spent an extra year in school to complete the two degrees, and focused on the relationship between the public and private sector. My goal was to work in an industry where government and business interacted regularly, and find a position working with the two.


I attended school in a city away from home, and had every intention of returning home to pursue employment, however I was approached about the position in which I currently reside. The job offered was one with a smaller (but growing) company, where I would be working in a position that I likely wouldn't get at a larger company. The experience was great, the work was what I wanted, but I wouldn't be moving home. I deemed this trade off well worth it. I took the position.


**Issue #1: Salary**


Always an issue, for everyone, right. When I was learning about the job, it was mention to me how some employees receive raises as frequently as ""every six months"". During the interview process, I was asked what I expected to earn. Having previously worked in Oil and Gas as a work term student (making an annualized salary of $55,000) but also recognizing that the industry I was interviewing for (and wanted to enter) paid less, I informed them I would be willing to begin work for between $40,000 and $50,000, with hopes to re negotiate after they got to know me.


This number was not turned down, but I was asked to begin on a trial basis (a sort of ""internship"") for three months, so they could see how I worked and if I would be a fit. Since I had no previous experience in the industry, I agreed to a salary of $30,000 for the first three months (very, very low) and to be readdressed after the trial period. This began in June 2012.


After the three months, I waited for a meeting regarding my trial period, but nothing occurred. I went to my manager after four months, and requested a meeting to review. At the end of the fourth month, after several requests, I finally had a meeting. The trial period was a success, I was told, and my salary was to be raised to $35,000. This is still notably lower than the range I said I was willing to begin at, but when I protested, I was told I still had a lot to learn and after one year I would receive another review, as well as a raise that I would be much happier with. I should have seen the signs at this point, but I accepted, and carried on working my ass off.


At my one year anniversary I received another review from my manager, as well as the head of finance, and was informed that due to all my hard work I would receive another raise, this time to $40,000. They had the audacity to point out that I had received a 33% increase since I had started, and I ""shouldn't expect that every year."" This was in July 2013, and to this day I have not received a penny more for my salary. After taxes and my employee benefits, I am clearing about $2200 a month. 


I approached the general manager in June of this year and told my story (he didn't work for us at a time) and stated that my salary needed to be addressed due to being underpaid, and I hadn't been paid well since the start. I have also been using my personal vehicle for work (I have probably put 15 - 20K on it for work related travel since beginning the position. Compensation is $0.35 / km, well under the standard in Canada. I recently found out that many employees have different rates, I'm among the lowest). I mentioned all my issues, including the gas payment, and have stated that it simply can't continue. I was asked to wait until October, at which point my ""mind would be blown."" I don't really believe this, as we have been laying off a number of our (higher paid) employees, and I have been promised the world in the past. However, the new GM recognizes the issues I've dealt with, and he is a decent guy. I just question how much he can do. Do I wait? 


**Issue #2: Growing Workload** 


During all my salary issues, I have consistently gone above and beyond as much as I can. Since Day 1, it has been stressed how much going above and beyond is necessary, and gets noted. I have put in evenings and weekends, I have picked up for other people (including my manager(s), which I could write an entire post about) and I have developed new procedures in an attempt to improve a fairly dysfunctional organization. I have certainly been acknowledged for doing this, and my responsibilities have increased drastically. I have tried to mention that as my role changes I should get to renegotiate, but to no avail.


What was originally a research and government communication position has grown to include aspect of Human Resources, Project Management, Finance,  and IT. Everything that doesn't have a clear person to do, gets dumped on me. I manage all the IT of a multi-company organization and deal with our external contractors. I recently wrote our entire HR handbook (no HR department). I have been asked to draft proposals, work with the finance department, etc. If they need an extra set of hands, its on my plate.


Throughout all of this, the ""intern"" jobs that I figured I'd grow out of don't change. Just today, I was told I needed to get some oil changes completed on company vehicles (including my owners personal vehicle). I'm the go to pizza delivery guy. The list is extensive, and two and a half years in I resent it.


**Issue #3: Resistant to Change**


I'm not going to get into this at length, but there are a large number of issues that I have pointed out since I arrived, which directly effect the operations of the company (and ultimately result in issues that require extra time spent fixing them from yours truly). I have attempted to develop multiple procedure changes and get management to work on them with me. I can get people to agree to the issue. I can get people up in arms about the issue. I will get the green light to spend time to improve the issue. However, as soon as I attempt to implement something new, it gets ignored, and becomes obsolete a month later.


I've given up trying, but recently we had consultants in who couldn't believe some of our procedures. These guys were paid a lot of money to recommend the same things I had been pushing for a year earlier. 


**QUESTION FOR REDDIT**


I thank you for allowing me to rant, and I can continue at length on any of these points or many of the others. First, I think its clear I'm fed up with my current organization. My question related to searching for new jobs. There isn't an abundance of vacant positions where I live, and my experience post-University has been entirely through this group. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of every day when I show up for work, and it is beginning to negatively effect me outside of the office. I am incredibly frustrated on a day-to-day basis, and the first thought through my mind when I wake up is ""fuck"". Is it better for me to search while employed, knowing the nature of the position takes up so much time? Or will I be better suited quitting now (and foregoing any sort of severance / employment insurance) and having the time day in and day out to focus on finding a new position?


My second question is whether or not it is ever worth it to stay? Given my experience, I think I know the answer. However, despite my complaints I am frequently promised greatness in the future. Perhaps in October I WILL be given a number that will ""blow my mind"". Should I continue searching? 


Lastly, how risky is it to apply with direct competitors? The industry is small here, and I would worry about my employer finding out. That said, I do love the industry I work in, and I would not mind a lower-than-average salary if I worked in a fair organization that I felt I was treated with respect and had a clear job description.


Any advice Reddit can provide me on any points I raised would be incredibly appreciated.


TLDR: Took a job two and a half years ago that seemed like my dream position. I have consistently delivered everything that has been asked, but have suffered through poor-management and regular promises. I have seen nothing concrete to suggest my situation will improve, just years of promises."

I know it's hard landing a job being a administrative assistant or secretary when you're from out of state as there are willing locals,  and I have done my research on every company I apply to. I am aware of the special problems with being from out of state as a candidate. 

Some recruitment agencies suggest I lie about my address but that always fails when I can't be in for a interview the next day or when the company has government ties.

Office Support,  administrative assistant or secretary work job postings do not let you know who the hr person is so there goes any way of getting face time. If I do get a call back it is usually a mistake because they didn't see my current position status where my location is pretty obvious (I'm a state employee). I am also aware that my target position is sort of easy peasy and not a hot demand stem field or something, but I got years of full time experience, government internships while in college, and I am educated with a BA which is a rarity for office support staff.

I write personalized resumes and cover letters to all jobs apllied to and list my permanent moving situation as it is in the process. I'm just waiting for a job offer to move over. 

My LinkedIn is fully updated and detailed with a nice picture as well, just in case a recruiting person looks me up.

It just doesn't seem to be enough though,   I was wondering if any of you have any suggestions that aren't already given in general articles on the Internet about job searching in other states.

For the most part they were separate legal entities, but they shared some network resources and at one point some office space.  Each company had their own IT staff though, including developers, help desk, and admins.

My buddy was the lead developer so he was in charge of a few interns.  One of the interns proved to be completely useless within a couple weeks of onboarding; showed up late, left early, took long lunches, did less work than anyone else, etc.  They let him go on a Friday (as was customary).

Monday rolls around and Useless Intern is strolling down the hallway like nothing happened.  My buddy chases him down and tells him ""Dude, I fired you!  You can't be in the building, who let you in??""

""Oh, OtherCompany hired me back on because they needed help with this project .. ""

The IT Manager storms off to talk to management.  It turns out that the assistant to the COO saw the termination email go through HR and *without asking anyone* immediately rehired him under the other company.  They didn't know why he was fired and never asked.  Was he stealing from the company?  Did he assault someone?  Did the background check show he was a convicted felon?  ""Oh he seemed like a nice kid and we really needed help on this .. "" *facepalm*

So they kept Useless Intern around for a few more weeks so he could prove he was useless again.  Luckily he wasn't fired for anything horrible, but in any other company it would have been considered a massive security breach."

I successfully went through three interview stages, later was invited to on-site interview and was virtually accepted.
I have to stress that compared to the previous programming tests I did, the on-site interview went a bit further on what was expected from a mid-level programmer, but I did it well anyways.
A period of 4 moths came, a couple of e-mails confirming my candidacy, giving me hope for an official job offer, etc..
Today they finally contacted me:

""Thank you for your interest in our studios - XXX. While your credentials are impressive, we unfortunately will no longer be moving forward with your candidacy. Your resume will be kept on file and if an opportunity of mutual interest arises, you will be contacted.""
Yadda, yadda, yadda...

I guess the opportunity of mutual interest arises refers to the Apocalypsis.


The truth is: despite the fact I know I am good on what I do, I keep working on my own projects, I am very disciplined and am aware am NOT a genius but a hard worker.... my geographic situation is spoiling my chance to get into the industry.

At this point, I really wish I was born in some other of the preferred Countries.

I will certainly elaborate whatever you like, to get your advice on the game industry.
In terms of my age am not so young, I don't have too much time to wonder.

My situation is so annoying,  that I have tried applied to internships but I have too much experience!!!!!!!!!!

I (a guy) turned 19 a few days ago and wanted to talk to people about my situation since quite a while. 

-Since I was 8, I had the dream to become a Pilot for a Commercial Airline. I turned 12 and was able to attend grammar school (Gymnasium in German).
Shortly after turning 14 I missed out school, because I spend 10 days in hospital and thereafter I had to spend about a month at home to recover from a surgery.
Due to all of that, my grades started to become bad, I had a 'D' in Math, 'C' in German &amp; English, and so on...
(stupid me didn't think of the difference in required knowledge,  between primary school and grammar school)
At that time I realized, that my chances to fulfill my dream were becoming less and less.
Add to that the 'loss' of friends who'd been around me all my life, but then attended different schools. (Don't forget to add bullies for the extra flavor). 
The teachers weren't a help either, not literally, but some said things like: ""You're not worthy to be around us."" Yes, I'm not joking.

All of that made me feel very depressive, and I left school pretty much every week on Wednesday, because I was feeling ill or had nausea. 
This continued for a while, and when my pet (a budgie) died in February 2009 I felt completely lost.

I decided to not go to school anymore and put an end to my life, once I turn 18.
I told my parents about my plans, and all they did was sending my from psychologist to psychologist.
Half a year passed, I was 15 and was send to a school for 'special people'. 
I only had As and Bs without doing anything and soon they realized that it's not the right place for me.
When summer 2010 approached, I was send to a mental hospital for 10 days, and they as well tried to find out what was wrong with me. Keep in mind, all of this I did, because I couldn't see my friends that often anymore and (thought) I couldn't become a pilot anymore.
The 10 days were over and, you guessed it. Nothing, I was 'normal' OBVIOUSLY I did everything they wanted from me, to get out of there as soon as possible. 
Ever spend a few days in a locked down area with mentally handicapped people? (no offense, don't know how to write it in a more friendly way)
I told them next year I'd attend school again and that was my ticket back home.

Summer holidays were over and I didn't attend school. 
Now, my mom did always said, she'd send me to a protectory, if I wouldn't go to school. 
This time she wasn't joking.
One week in I had my sweet 16. Awesome, I was at home for like three/four hours and could spend my beautiful 16th birthday with the thought, that in a few hours you can't spend the night in your nice cozy bed, but have to go to that thing that you hate. 
When my dad came for a visit at  the same day, he stood in front of the wrong door of the apartment building. Might not sound like a big deal (everyone forgets things?!)
Yea, but for me it wasn't. I hadn't seen that man in a long time (my parents are divorced) and then he does that. At my birthday. ..and I thought might never coming back home was the worst thing. 
So I, turning 16, run away from home, crying, just wanting to die. Good job, everyone. (Yes, that includes me)

Six months I was there and able to go home only every two weeks. Also I had to attend the same school I was at in late 2009 (mentioned above) surprisingly nothing changed, same grades, same teachers, same people (almost) who'd only wanted to make trouble. I guess my ""intelligence"" was the only thing that protected me from bullying, and that I wasn't acting weird around them so I guess they just accepted me. 

Things worked out for me and I wanted to be around normal people again, also I wanted to go back home.
The headmaster was still thinking (like the people at the protectory) that I don't belong there. 
So thanks to them, and my effort in being a good student at the new school, that I was about to attend,
I could spend all holidays (autumn + winter) at home.

**-Winter 2011-**
From that time things went better, I was home, met new people, people that I'm still friends with, (all thanks to playing AVA (but that's another story) okay, well, the guy I sat next to, we had a lil' chat and it turned out we were playing the same online shooter. So without playing AVA, we might would have never found a connection.
Let's skip a few years into the future. I graduated, and was able to attend vocational school.

**-Summer 2013-**
In Germany there are three ways you can choose, when attending voc. school (Technical, Social, and economy/administration) I chose the first one.

Having an internship at an Aircraft Maintenance was a HUGE DEAL for me. Finally I was able to be around the things I like, could talk to people in the industry and actually work on airplanes. (okay, it was General Aviation, but who cares, as long as it flies?)
The love for the job soon turned into average doing, same planes, same things needed to be repaired and it turned into a ..somewhat boring work?
Next to that, spending 8 hours on a hot ramp/in hangars during summer, and having 3 hours of way from/to work from home. I needed a new internship. Luckily we had a local car-repairing company and I was able to continue there, and it was fun, well, until 3 months in the chief there decided I shouldn't work on cars anymore and I literally was only there to clean the garage and equipment.
After getting into a fight, because I sorted old brake-parts wrong, he insulted me with: ""Shut the f#ck up, and get the f#ck out!"" and kicked me out. I wanted to quit any way so I didn't really care.

After that I sank into self pity and thought about what I did wrong, and soon decided I'm gonna resign from vocational school, and continue next year, attending economy/admin.

**-Summer 2014-**
I was lazy, very lazy and always thought about why the hell I still continue.
All of us are going to die one day, so why doing the effort? Once you figure out, that nothing has a purpose, and everything we do is what we do, because we are told to or have dreams that let us fight for them, things really start to look dark.

I currently got a pending internship at a flight school, (that means, I don't know if they accept me or not. Had the interview today, actually)

So I got that going, but it's another year that is wasted, so much time. And no results, 
everyone has something they do because they love to do what they do. And for me, as stupid as it may sound, it's flying airplanes. It's like a virus that has gotten into me and next to my grandma, who to me, was the only person that has ever supported me, are the only reasons why I'm still on this thing we call earth. 
Since I was in kindergarten, she was always there for me, and every time when I think about suicide, I have to think of her and how sad she'd be, if I would go that far, and I know that she would think of how she could have saved my life. 
After all this trouble, and not knowing what to do, because there currently are so many ways for me (apprenticeship at my local airport, continuing vocational school, moving to Norway -even though I don't speak Norwegian, but to me it's a beautiful country; etc..) 


Edit:
Listening to music also helped me a lot, but made things sometimes even worse, deep bass music or music from /r/realdubstep really lets you sink deep down the sea sometimes..


Please excuse mistakes, I'm German.
Thanks for any kind of help.


Wasn't sure if /r/offmychest woud've been better but I figured it would be taken more serious here."

What do I tell recruiters as I'm applying for full-time positions?,noofferhelp,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2fb41o/didnt_receive_fulltime_offer_from_previous/,"**TL;DR Didn't get a full-time offer from company I interned at, which is very sought-after and seems to hire back most of their interns full-time. Scared to lie, but don't want to make recruiters question me. WHAT DO I DO** 

Hey everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I interned at a very well-known, sought-after company this past summer (let's call it Company A). Unfortunately, due to a variety of factors (I will elaborate below), I did not receive a full-time offer. 

I am applying to full-time positions this fall before graduating in December, and I know that every recruiter will ask me why I am not returning to Company A, especially because for many people, it is their dream company. And they are known to hire most of their interns back full-time. 

My question is: HOW DO I ANSWER THIS QUESTION? 

**Answering honestly** 

If I am honest, I am worried this will make them question my abilities. If you look at my resume or speak to me about my previous positions, you would think I'm a strong candidate (multiple internships, good GPA, many awards, major student org leadership). But knowing that I couldn't secure a full-time offer from a company known to hire back most of their interns suddenly makes me look much worse. 

I don't want to badmouth the company, because overall, there were a lot of things about the program that I was impressed with and I *do not* want to seem bitter/backstabbing. But there were a variety factors unique to my specific project/group that made it very difficult to succeed. I want to keep details vague, but I discussed it with a few people who are full-time in the industry who agree that there was poor management and the project was poorly suited for an intern (not because of technical difficulty, but because of the influence needed to get some of the things done). 

There were also several things I could have done better, and I can elaborate what I learned from the experience easily. I have always been very reflective and self-aware, and I can give a pretty good talk on what I learned over the summer and how I can apply that in the future. 

However, I don't want to badmouth the company, especially because it's so highly lauded. And I don't want to call my abilities into question when seemingly everyone else got full-time offers. (I don't know this for sure, but that's sort of what it seems like.)


**Saying I declined** 

I can explain good, convincing reasons for why I felt the company was a poor fit for me and declined the offer, but I'm wondering if it looks questionable that I would risk going into my last semester without an offer on my plate. 

Also, I will have to use different explanations for every company I interview at. Some of the weaknesses of working at at Company A are the same as those at Company B but not Company C and vice versa. It will be difficult to keep it up.


**Saying I'm just exploring my options**

I know that the company I interviewed at has been fairly generous with allowing their returning interns to interview elsewhere and compare offers, but I would also have to give a deadline for when I need an answer by, which would be yet another lie. 


**Getting caught lying**

I know the risk with not being 100% honest is that if I get caught, it looks even worse. If they speak to my former boss or if they happen to talk to any of the full-timers who worked closely with the interns over the past summer they could find out that I did not receive a full-time offer. 


**So what do I DO??**

Maybe I'm just freaking out over nothing, but this is seriously stressing me out. I think I am a very strong and unique candidate otherwise, and if it weren't for this issue, I would be entering Fall recruiting season VERY confidently. I've had no issues with getting interviews/offers before and my resume is stronger than ever. 

Is there a way to direct attention from my lack of an offer without outright lying? What do I do when I get directly asked about Company A? Has anyone been in a similar situation before? Please, I am so nervous about this.

2fbfro,2,2014-09-02,I feel like I missed out on certain parts of my life.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2fbfro/i_feel_like_i_missed_out_on_certain_parts_of_my/,"Let me give a little bit of background: (Edit while still typing this: Okay - that turned to be a bit more than a little bit...)

I've always been that person who does something impulsive; and now I feel like it's bit me in the ass a bit. I grew up spending the winter 6 months in the south, and the summer 6 months in the north (USA). For this reason, I was always leaving friends and schools - I always went back to the same school when I came back to either place though. So for this - I *knew* people, but wasn't able to make as much of a connection with them due to moving so often.

My last year of high school I opted to do post-secondary (Take college classes @ campus while still in High School). So basically, I just spent all this time growing up jumping places - and then my last year I finally stay in one area and then spend it not with High School kids.

I then made the mistake of always being focused on getting ahead. I had a year's worth of college done before anyone. I started working on side-projects. I started studying. I was always involved; just not with other people. I never made the effort to connect to people as I guess I was just more introverted, and I was okay with not having a huge social life. Unfortunately this also meant I didn't have any close friends that I could actually talk with.

Cue the next 2 years of my life. Now actually in college. I was commuting so I didn't live on campus. I kind of made friends in classes, but never once hung outside of classes with them. I met a few occasional people - but it never felt like a real friendship (At least, not looking back on it). Never joined any clubs. Honestly - just stuck to my classwork, drove home and played video games, and only went somewhere if someone invited me - which rarely happened.

I then had the opportunity to get an internship across the country where I was really interested. I had a friend that had just moved there that I had started meshing with just before he did and now I wanted to go. We had plans!

I took the gig, moved in with him, had a great time. Honestly, it's a blur. We definitely were friends. And I met a bunch of others - all ""friends"" but really only hung out occasionally, and I never made the effort. But had a ""social network"". And felt a lot more comfortable and social, comparatively. I eventually got a full-time offer (Which I was hoping for) even though I was only a sophomore in school. I took it and dropped out of college, staying in this new state. Then my roommate got married. Then I got my own place and started living alone.

Now - big part of my life. I started having doubts about my religion. I ended up leaving it. Huge identity crisis. Then realized how much of social network was comprised of this. Almost all of them dropped me as a friend, as that's the nature of the religion (Shout out to /r/exjw), and I now had virtually no one to rely on. I started smoking weed. Met a girl at work. Lost my virginity to her. Had an ongoing sexual relationship that kind-of was something more. Started socializing with people more that were her friend's and tried to become better. The thing is - normally people outside of my old religion are not considered good association, so I never branched out much into that before. Now I had this deeply-engrained thought that all people outside of the religion are bad people, and I found it hard to connect and trust them.

Then I had an even bigger identity crisis - complete mental breakdown in front of some old ""friends"" (Actually people I had hung out with less than a half-dozen times and always felt weird around them due to my anxiety due to my terrible socialness) from down south while I was visiting in the winter, as they had gone through something similar with the religion and I could kind of relate.

When I got back home to where my job was, I started thinking of life and all. Within a few months I had decided I wanted to quit my job and go backpack abroad for as long as I could. I had been securing a remote-work gig for the past year and it was finally getting to the point where it was bigger than something I just spent a couple hours a week on. I could take this abroad with me.

I backpacked, had a great time, and learned a *TON* about myself. Absolutely amazing. Met some truly great people. People I consider some of the best friends I've made in my life - I've made true connections with them and it all happened over such a short period of time as you're normally not visiting each city for very long. Great people. I became a lot more extroverted and now I'm a lot better at being social, *wanting* to be social, inviting people to things, and trying to make friends.

However. Now here's my issue.

I'm back home. My original home state in the north. I'm living at my parents as I just got back from backpacking about a month ago. I'm 23 and male. I don't know what the fuck to do with my life.

I'm in the process of getting my remote job back again (Had stopped partway through backpacking) so hopefully that will come and occupy some time soon. I'm trying to get into fitness and am hitting the gym. I'm trying to find some other new hobby (Piano, geocaching, beer brewing, something else, etc) but I haven't started yet. I'm always trying to find something to do and someone to hang out with. Thing is - I barely know anyone. I know people, and I'm starting to hang out with them more. But so far no proper ""hangouts"". Just meeting up for drinks, going to a party, whatever. I haven't felt like I've gone from ""guy who I hang out with occasionally"" to ""friend"" with most people.

I'm really making an effort to always fill up my social calendar. Look up events in the city. Look at specials at bars. Look for live music. Keep an ear open for parties. Etc.

I feel like I'm not getting anywhere. I hang out with people - But I still feel like I'm making **SO** much effort to try and make plans - because I know I'm not on anyone's short list and I'm not going to be thought of for an invite to something, so I need to try and inject myself into people's social lives.

Also though. I don't live on campus. I don't go to the University anymore. I feel like I'm just back in college again - except without any network, and on top of that I'm now REALIZING that I should have taken advantage of that network when I was actually there! Holy fuck, this is why I hated HS and College - because I never made an effort to be a part of the community. Sorry - off track revelation.

Anyways - I don't know what to do. I kind of want to be a part of campus life, hang out with people, live there so I can just walk over to someone's whenever I want, join clubs, go to events. But I also have no interest in the actual studying part of things; I'm good at what I do, and I'll find work. I see no reason to blow a bunch of money. I just want the network.

So - I don't really know what I'm asking. I probably have some questions in there.

**TL;DR:** Go read please. But - if you're still not ready for that wall of text. I grew up very anti-social due to religion and having moved around a lot. I was an introvert, impulsive, and didn't understand how to make friends. I then went through a life-changing backpack experience abroad. Now I'm much more extroverted (Although still very aware of my self at times and can be too introspective) and want a social network. I'm back home &amp; living at home as a 23 year old guy. I can work for myself. I'm trying to find things to occupy my time because I don't know what I'm interested in. I'm trying to make friends because I essentially know no one. And I completely feel like I missed out on a lot in life due to my history and how I grew up (Wasn't involved in HS or college and feel like I missed out on those huge experiences that everyone shares and can normally relate to)."

I switched my major to computer science pretty late and I can still graduate on time but it basically meant giving up my summers to take classes and catch up on my computer science degree. Taking an extra semester is out of the question because of finances and personal reasons (parents retiring at the end of the year and want to help support them). 

With all that said, I never got an internship and I really do not feel qualified to begin looking for a job. At the end of the semester, I'll have a few iOS apps developed as well as have a major database group project completed. I'm also trying to get some web development experience. But at the moment, my resume is looking pretty sparse and my GPA is just okay (~3.3). Most of my experience is from my previous field (healthcare). I really don't know what to do. Should I wait to apply for jobs? Should I try applying for internships instead of full time? I really don't feel qualified right now. I suck at technical interviews because algorithms has never been my strong point (PS: Steven Skiena was my professor and even he couldn't really get through to me very much).

I took a mix electrical engineering courses (power systems, analog, DSP, embedded systems, hardware engineering). I ended taking a job out of college with a consultant firm that does electrical distribution design work for the utility company. Title is ""electrical distribution engineer"". I pretty much design telephone and utility poles and power lines in neighborhoods. Most of the time I feel like I'm not being challenged and I find my self rubbing my temples in agony and boredom at times. I understand I'm only a year in so I shouldn't know much, but I feel like anyone with common sense could do my job at times.

The company itself is pretty good, its a large company with multiple divisions and decent benefits (matching 401k, health insurance, tuition  reimbursement). The only reason I was hired because I did an internship at a electric utility company. I've been told that the first 2 years at my position suck because I am starting out after all. But as I said before I'm not sure I want to stay in this field. Or at least continue doing what I'm currently doing at least. 

I've been contemplating searching and applying for a new job, but I've been told that staying in this industry is good, as all the engineers are currently old and getting ready to retire someday. But I find I'm more interested in doing something like software or hardware engineering. I did do a 3 month project/internship at NVIDIA, but it was more like simple scripting so they didn't give me a whole lot of responsibility, I just developed a set of simple testing scripts in Python and Bash. So I think I could get a reasonable software engineering job at least somewhere.

Should I stay at my current job and hope it gets better? Or take a leap and find a new job in a different engineering discipline?"

Any advice on where I should be heading for optimal pay/work experience?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fbzhy/i_have_a_weird_resume_any_advice_on_where_i/,"Graduating from Berkely L&amp;S with a degree in CS, going to be top of class or at least very close to it, very good academics all around.

My dilemma is that most of my ""real"" experience is all self-employed. I've done independent security auditing, started and ran a successful kickstarter and one man company, and released multiple iOS apps.

My only tangible experience is two summer internships, one for a well-known startup in Venice (i guarantee you know it), and one for a brand development and consulting firm (mainly in web development or web app security auditing). 

I'm not really sure how to present this experience on my resume. I really do have around 5 years of work experience as I am constantly doing web dev, netsec, or working on one of my apps or little kickstarter startup. 

I'm interested in going into a software engineering role, as my best languages/skills are definitely python &amp; C#. I'm versatile but other than those two I'm a jack of all trades/master of none. The main factor for me is maximizing pay/value of the work experience. I know, I know, I should be following my dreams but honestly I'm ready to do something financially lucrative.

Also (and lastly), what should I be looking at if I apply to a big 4 company? Do they value self-motivated work experience and treat it as prior industry experience?"
2fcd9f,6,2014-09-03,Sharepoint as monitor and self service portal?,pandaclear,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2fcd9f/sharepoint_as_monitor_and_self_service_portal/,"Hello,

I am an intern in a small IT department of a large company. I was tasked with evaluating Sharepoint as a tool for mainly 2 tasks:

* Monitoring IT assets, essentially combining data from Solarwinds, Bigfix, vCenter.. etc. Creating a thorough view of all available monitoring software

* Creating a self service portal for endusers, to create AD users, request shares or servers, request folder rights, etc. The end goal should essentially be for the admins to receive a single ticket, quickly verify the entered data, and start an automated workflow with a button. The vision of the admins is that they can afterwards just ""click together some workflows and forms"". I don't really think Sharepoint is the tool they want to use, but maybe I'm just mistaken.

Since I feel terribly overwhelmed by Sharepoint, and the only one in the office not on vacation is Citrix only, I ask you. If I am at the wrong place, please tell me. 

I believe Sharepoint simply can't be implemented ""as a side project, just clicking together some forms"", like they want to do, but I can't argue my point beyond ""I think it's way too complicated"". 

Please note that I don't want to ask you to do my work for me. What I need is pointers, links or books to read. I am eager to learn, but I very much dislike pointless work, especially when I could be writing Powershell, a thing I am actually good at, which would actually increase productivity in the office. 

Thank you"
2fd0lh,2,2014-09-03,"I've just started working as a financial advisor in training, and am already having doubts about my firm and the industry. Took the position because little else was hiring other than sales positions.",stickwithFA,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2fd0lh/ive_just_started_working_as_a_financial_advisor/,"Right now, I'm in the testing phase for a financial advising job (getting series 7, 66, or related securities and insurance licenses....) The job is straight commission with a bonus once you complete your testing to pay back all the expenses. 

70% commission comes right back to me, 20% to my mentor who does plenty of the training and plenty of work for me now that I'm experienced, 10% goes to the boss of the office who also helps on certain cases, helps with lead creation, teaches us sales, and runs the office. 

I pay a small fee each month (not yet, but I will) in order to be in the office and receive the support and mentorship program. From what I've researched, it's generally less in overhead costs than many other places and what Edward Jones seems to be after your base salary decreases and you have your own office. The office is young, cutting edge as far as philosophy goes, targets high net worth individuals almost exclusively, but I have my doubts about other things I'll get into later. 

I knew the industry had high turnover when I accepted the position. However, with a BA in Economics and Political Science (tried a internship in politics, politics was not for me) I found little other options as far as who would look at me for employment over business school students. 

**The thing is, I love parts of my job, and am kinda just tolerating the others because I'm new, but feel I could sour on them later. I love the financial planning side of my job. Once you get a client, figure out solutions for them and what can meet their goals while also generating commission for yourself. I'm researching asset management and other jobs that might have better base salaries with similar day to day activity that I like.** 

The sales part I'm still figuring out and trying to get into the mindset. The more I research the industry it seems like many of the companies are very ok with the high turnover and willing to watch a new financial advisor burn out and then just move on to the next one. I feel like the whole industry is like swimming with sharks that can bite you at any moment. 

My office seems to use the shotgun approach of hiring many new advisors and seeing which ones stick. I have a good mentor (I think from my limited experience) who I feel treats me well. The firm awards people who are the best producers new hires to help train, which means they can generate extra commission from that. However he's so busy that sometimes his schedule interferes with my ability to help clients, pissing them off or slighting them. The office wants to grow quickly but seems like it is still figuring out how to do it. I had two clients that I needed to call, but could not call them from my personal phone or using my personal email (I will be getting that when I start full time soon) and he failed to do it for basically two whole weeks until I just stopped in the office for something else I did it myself. I had potential to lose those two clients from this huge delay. While this situation sucks, I'm not sure I would have a better time somewhere else or a better mentor. I might just be running into different problems. 

**Lastly, a few weeks ago the whole office cancelled it's prospecting and put it on hold. We had basically been calling companies with shit 401K programs (the leads that my boss generates, apparently by paying outsourced call centers in India, who ring answering machines and write names and numbers down). I was hesitant about this, but leads and potential prospect clients did come in pretty easily for me in the first few weeks. Not a lot, but at least 2 or so for every 40 calls agreed to a second meeting, which is quite good for cold calling. Apparently we accidentally called a company that our sponsoring firm helps manage their 401k and retirement programs, and they became pretty pissed, it was a conflict of interest. Our firm wants people to take money out of their companies retirement options, our sponsoring company wants them to keep them in the ones they manage.** 

**I initially received pretty vague answers about this, and to ""stop leaving voicemails, because those can easily be recorded."" Our prospecting list, a shared document online where we logged our calls and activity disappeared. The office talked about compliance quite a bit. The financial advising industry is highly regulated, and this scared me and put some doubt in my bosses when they initially gave me iffy answers until I pushed them because I had heard chatter through the office. My mentor explained most of it in full a week later when I told him I was concerned. That got some of the trust back, but I still don't feel good about the whole situation.** 

I've been updating and reworking my resume over the weekend and have started sending it out to new companies, but I wanted to make sure I hit companies that worked outside the Financial advising and comission based structure. "

Currently I hold no certifications. It is something I plan to focus on more towards graduating. 

Right now I feel like after a whole year in school I have not learned a damn thing other than some basic programming skills and how to set up small business networks using different protocols. On this path I feel like when I graduate I will not have enough knowledge to present in an interview to land a decent job. 

I personally am not a huge fan of the programming end of IT but I can do it, however it is not a focus in my current degree path and I am not taking any programming classes currently nor do I even have to to get my degree. (I did in the beginning of my college life as stated above)

* So being in the RI and MA area what kind of jobs am I looking at right out of college with no certs. under my belt?

* Am I expected by employers to know and have extensive knowledge on how to do certain things right after graduating?

* How much is really expected in technical interviews?

* Should I be applying for internships now? (I currently work 20-25hrs/week in a huge retail giant that sells home improvement products so an internship may complicate things between full time school and work)

2ff4va,2,2014-09-03,Advice for a next step in therapy?,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2ff4va/advice_for_a_next_step_in_therapy/,"I've been in therapy for 18 years, and I'm still struggling with depression and other issues. I was hoping to get some suggestions for a next step or new direction in therapy, since I'm not improving. 

I had a very emotionally abusive childhood and always had low self esteem. At 22, I attempted suicide in a very serious way and nearly died. I started therapy then, as well as meds for mood disorders. I've gone through several doctors and therapists, with varying success. I've been through 6 or more antidepressants, and I'm on Cymbalta + Wellbutrin + Inderal now, for depression and anxiety. 

I've also had serious substance abuse problems. I started just ""partying"" in HS and college, but that evolved into self medicating every day. After a long disease and hospital stay, I got addicted to opiates for ~4 years, and went to rehab 4 years ago. I got manipulated into moving back home with my elderly parents that were so abusive to me as a kid after rehab. I left my whole life and moved across the country, back to the place I hate. I've completely isolated myself and the only thing I do is work and sleep now. 

I was seeing a psychiatrist for the last few years, but she was just an intern. She moved on, and I haven't been seeing anyone lately. She wasn't very much help anyway, because she basically just managed my meds and didn't do any real talk therapy. 

I'm mostly sober these days, but I'm severely depressed. I don't shower, I just eat junk food. I barely go outside. I hover just above suicidal most days. I feel hopeless. I'm completely isolated except for my elderly parents and one workmate. All I do is sleep and work. Money is a huge problem. My family enables it but also makes it worse with abusive attitudes.

I do have insurance. The first time I did CBT it was very effective. But after a couple of years I had a bad relationship and got depressed again. CBT did not seem to work very well that 2nd time, or since. I also did a little EMDR (for the trauma of shooting myself trying to suicide when 22), and it probably helped a little. I did some somatic therapy, and that gave me some good tools to use but I don't think it made me any better permanently. I did about 20 sessions of neurofeedback, and I have no idea if that helped or not.

I'm in a deep rut, and I have done nothing for 4 years. I've nearly given up completely on life, and I need to get help soon. But since CBT hasn't been doing much, I thought I should try something new. Maybe DBT? I'm almost ready to try ECT. 

Any ideas?"

Toakan here, with some tales that will probably leave you scratching your head and thinking 'What?!'

Some background for you, I am a recent IT Intern to a larger company, and I have the pleasure of working in their infrastructure side, so everything from reporting and monitoring to desktop support.
I was primarily involved in upgrading and rolling out W7 to all clients within a department and most of these stories are going to be from that little escapade.
 
Sorry for the long delay in posting but i've been too busy to actually sit and type!



This happened just yesterday, god help me...

----

Now I was sitting at my desk, headset on (which should give you the impression that i'm on a call) and typing away at an email.

Semi-competent user appears and starts asking me if i'm busy...


&gt; SCU : Hey Toakan, can you come and check my machine? I can't get the monitor to display anything.


She then starts mouthing to me, ""Are you busy?""

Can you seriously not see the ruddy headset?!

&gt; Me (To Call) : Two secs guys, got a user with urgent problem...

I mute the mic..

&gt; (To SCU) : Alright, i'll come down in a sec...

Back to the call.....

Anyway, 20 minutes later i take a wander down to the users station. Only to get the verbal jabber of a user who can't do their work...


&gt; SCU : I've tried restarting it, and i pushed all the cables in but nothings working!!!

&gt; Me : Yeah ok, gimme a sec.

So look at the machine briefly, then decide my first course of action, don't believe the user.

&gt;Pulls machine forward

&gt;Pushes DVI cable in firmly.

&gt;Screen flickers to life

&gt;I turn and smirk

Her face was totally worth the smirk.

&gt; SCU : OMG What did you do?!

&gt; Me : I pushed the monitor cable back in.

&gt; SCU : BUT I PUSHED THEM ALL IN!

&gt; Me : Well i guessed you missed one?

She rushes past me, sits down and starts working away.

Back to my desk, and the joys of server configurations..



I think i'll give you a follow up from the Supervisor next time, since he decided to annoy me recently.

So I installed skype for her.  
  
&gt;Lady: So, this is how you install skype?  
&gt;Me: Yes, here, try to log in yourself. (Going very slowly and easy.)  
&gt;Lady: Okay, so I can do this at home at my other computer?

&gt;Lady: I am happy there is still a real Dutch guy working here. I can't understand the others.  
&gt;Me, bit awkward: Oh, thanks.  
  
I continue to show her how to install skype, still leaving all the failed shortcuts from my co-worker behind. When she left with the PC she thanked me. I am just glad I never heard anything from her again. She wouldn't be happy my co-worker screwed up things.

2fgl74,1,2014-09-04,So some questions about career fairs (its that time again!),Inferno221,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2fgl74/so_some_questions_about_career_fairs_its_that/,"So this is my 4th career fair that I'll be attending. I'm a senior majoring in chemE. I had an internship at a small lab over the summer (actually I'm still working there on the weekends to finish an experiment, not sure if that counts as a co-op), so I guess that's a plus on my resume.

So I'm confident enough to approach them/talk about their company, my skills and what not, but I have 2 questions:

1) I want to list my major gpa instead of my normal gpa cause the major gpa is higher. Is this a good/bad idea? Or do I list both? The major is like 2.83, the regular is 2.5 something. I know leaving off the gpa is no good, cause they'll either ask or assume lower

2) How do I grab the employer's hand properly to give a strong-ass handshake so that they remember my face and smile? I want them to go to bed and dream about my strong grasp/handsome smile, as they wake the next morning to find their bed sheets ejaculated with their body fluids.

2fgmv3,85,2014-09-04,All of my internship applicants are overqualified,ButtfaceMcAssButt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2fgmv3/all_of_my_internship_applicants_are_overqualified/,"I'm trying to hire for a data analyst intern. This mostly includes pulling reports weekly, lots of report setup, and some mild analysis. Our last intern was great! He was a rising senior with barely any Excel skills, so he was able to take away a lot from the internship since he learned so much more about Excel, how companies operate, and general office/email/powerpoint etiquette. 

We are now hiring to fill the same internship and all my applicants are recent graduates or even MBAs - they are looking for full time jobs, they have experience and wouldn't gain as much from the position, **they are looking for full time jobs**. But based on where I work, everyone wants to 'break into the industry' and get a foot in the door. The work can be 'grunt work' but not as dumb as coffee runs or printing, and we got good feedback from our previous guy. 

I'm just not sure how to handle this situation. We don't have full time positions available and there is low probability the intern would be hired full time (unless they were truly exceptional). We just want an intern to do a lot of the tedious reporting and setup so our group can focus on the analysis part, but also give some good experience so they take somethign awway as well. The pay is on the high end for internships, so we're not looking for slave labor either. 

Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone had any feedback or opinions on this matter so I can think it through a bit more. Thanks!

Edit: Also, I've seen so many frustrated individuals turned away for being overqualified and can totally understand how they feel! How do I strike a balance between someone who is just too experienced and won't learn anything from the internship and someone who is just willing to do the job anyway?"

I am currently interning at Deloitte Consulting, Human Capital Advisory Services, HR Transformation. 
It is really fun working there, I like the team and culture. I am aiming to start working in Consulting after finishing my Masters degree. 
As I do quite well, I think HR T would be a possible starting point. 

However, I am wondering about a few things

a) Is Deloitte the right choice? 
b) Is HCAS - HR T the right chice? 

Ad a) 
This is my first internship at a Consulting firm. What differenced in culture and work are to be expected when comparing Deloitte to other firms? Would it be worth applying somewhere else? 

Ad b) 
Background wise I would fit better to Org &amp; Change Practice (studied organizational psychology) . I heard that the culture and job content is really different compared to HR T. Can anyone elaborate? Also, I am worried my profile would become too HR focused, thinking about an Exit Strategy. 

Sorry for Typos, writing from the Phone and non native speaker.

2fgvlw,5,2014-09-04,Computer Engineering Heart / Amazing Food Industry Resume,Brenglish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2fgvlw/computer_engineering_heart_amazing_food_industry/,"I'm currently working full-time at a Whole Foods making around 30k a year. I'm 21 years old, with barely enough credits to be considered a sophomore. I was raised by a single parent that dedicated a life to the food industry so much of her knowledge was passed on to me. Obtaining jobs revolving around food business had never been an issue for me, and I have always excelled and adapted very easily to every position I have worked for so far. Problem is this isn't something I want to do all my life. 

I am a very much a computer enthusiast and a technomania. I would love to pursue a career in this but feel I may be too behind in the race. 

I was raised in a very poor neighborhood, so my education wasn't the best. I graduated high school with a 3.0 GPA.  I felt very behind when attending courses my first year at a very expensive out of state college, and made the mistake of trying to balance being a full time engineering student/full time job my second year at a nearby community college so I barely passed many of my classes.

Since then I decided to take a break from school and ended up being stuck with 23k of student loans, and a couple of bills here and there, so being jobless is out of the question.

I have very little experience with coding, and nothing to put down a resume to show my interest for the field. I don't qualify for the internships offered in my area due to my low GPA with only a handful being offered around me.

I'm worried that I might get too comfortable with the jobs I can get now and never exceed to my dreams of reaching at least an 80k salary and having a career that I love by the time I'm 27. Any advice on where to start? "
2fh3z4,3,2014-09-04,Lost and alone,Anval,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2fh3z4/lost_and_alone/,"I am sorry for the quality of my English, I do not post often. I’m also sorry for the length of my post but I don’t know how to make it way shorter.

I posted here previously on another account and it helped a bit for a time. However, I do not know how to get through this anymore. My life is simply a mess and it’s getting worse every day. My biggest issue haunts me and I created a whole lot of smaller ones while I tried to distract myself from it.

It truly went downhill 3 years ago, when I was 22. I was a bit lost, having completed cégep (2 years of school between high school and college) in 3 years with less than good results. I threw away my initial plans of becoming either a psychologist or a teacher, the first one because I now know I could not be detached enough, the other one since my chances at getting a job as a history teacher are less than 10%. 6 months after cegep, I went to a private college to learn computer networking. I didn’t know if I was a good decision but I went anyway since the employment rate was great. It was a big mistake. 

Once I finished all the theoretical classes, I got an internship. I never felt so out of place. I did the same job as most people did there (1st level tech support) and was able to see how the higher ups worked. I was so depressed after each day that I spent my nights playing video games trying to forget about it. It went on for 2 months, after which they declared that I was now an employee. Few days later, I was rejected by the only girl I met that made me feel special and lost her as a friend in the process. One night, the last night of the first inscription round, I signed up for bachelor degree in history. The next morning, I declared to my boss that I had too many personal problems and that I needed time to sort them out so I was resigning (officially, I was employed as soon as I signed up for the internship. I had been there for 2 months and a half). He took it incredibly well. It was the first night in 2 months that I was able to sleep a bit more.
I never obtained my computer networking diploma. I didn’t finish it even if 95% of the requirements have been met. I was so sick of it I couldn’t do it. I am now greatly indebted and my parents think I finished it even though it’s not the case. I went on to college to do what I wanted to do the most; teach history. I didn’t care about the odds of getting the job anymore.

The first session went well even if my results were nothing out of the ordinary. When the second one began, it was another story. During holidays, my parents had a pretty big argument (nothing however that would cause a divorce but still). An old feeling also came back; loneliness. I had forgotten about it since college began and I met so many friends during holidays but it has always been there. 

Even though many girls fascinated me over the years, I never had a girlfriend. I never learned how to act around women. Every time one spoke to me back then, it was to laugh at me in some way. I can be friendly and be normal but I just don’t know how to approach someone by myself. I also don’t know where I could meet people. I hate bars like hell, I am shy most of the time and when there are too many people around, I become totally uncomfortable. 

To try to divert myself from how I feel, I bought stuff. I bought so much that I am in trouble financially, missing a few hundred to pay for college. I am in probation at said college since my results reflected my state of mind last session.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel too old for what I accomplished so far, have trouble sleeping every single night, stress easily, cry a lot and never felt so lonely in my life. I had a knife in hand last night and I considered stabbing myself a few times with it. Even now I am not sure it would have been a bad decision. I am not afraid to die young. I am afraid to grow old alone.

I have recently gotten an offer for a chemical company in houston for ~75k + 7.5k signing and ~3k in relocation. 401(k) and insurance benefits are good to better than average. 

I am getting my BS in EE this December.

I have been a fall co-op at the work location they want to hire me into in houston and also an intern at another plant. 

I would like to end up in a big city in texas so this is good but I wonder about the cost of living of Houston. 

One of my classmates (I wish he had not done this) told me his offer for the Baton Rouge plant and he has only done one internship and his offer is only 2k lower than mine.... He is getting same bonus and relo.


I already know I am going to negotiate for a 3rd week of vacation  but I also wonder how I should approach negotiating the rest of my salary.  While I think the base is pretty decent I kind of wish I had gotten more than the guy going to baton rouge. At least I think I deserve more than 2k not only for experience but also the cost of living between BR and Houston. 


Should I try to negotiate a higher base salary, bonus, or more relocation $$? 

Any advice is appreciated. I have researched several posts on this website and numerous web articles. It isn't like I got a terribly low-balled salary offer.

Should I just try to negotiate say 6% or so more? Or am I rushing the gun on this?

I spoke to my campus career center and they honestly were not much help. I may try to go in and get a different counselor...

Thanks, Let me know if you have any questions.

2fhsv6,1,2014-09-04,[need advice] Interview rescheduling frustrations,Python4fun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fhsv6/need_advice_interview_rescheduling_frustrations/,"I was contacted by an internal recruiter via email about an entry level position opening with a major outsourcing company.  The company has a contract with one of my local top 3 companies, and I happen to know that the contract requires 1 American citizen for every 5 outsourced personnel  (I am an American and have heard tha tthecontract is lacking in American personnel).  Also, the area where I live is very difficult for finding entry positions, and I don't even have an internship under my belt.  I do have a bachelors in computer engineering.

The initial interview was in person and upon my arrival I was unable to enter the building.  All three doors were key card locked.  the front door with the buzzer received no answer from within.  I contacted the interviewer directly and was told he would call me back as he was not in that office right now.  After finding a smoking employee to let me into the building, I was called by the ""interviewer"" and told that his cohort would be there shortly.  After another ten minutes of waiting, the cohort arrives and asks me to wait another ten minutes while he prepares for the interview (was supposed to be 2 interviews that day for me).  The interview was mostly puzzle questions with ""I can do this in 3 steps can you?"".

A week later I am supposed to interview via skype.  I arrive at McDonalds (as I have just moved and it would be 3 weeks until the internet would be connected) and then find an email from not an hour earlier telling me about a rescheduling for days later at a time i am not available.  I call and reschedule again.  the email comes in a day later for an hour different than we had established.  When the new day for the interview came, they tried to reschedule to the previous time i was not available for. I then receive a call at the time i had agreed upon and am asked if i am ready for the interviewer (who is now ready).  we reschedule again for another day (one when i dont have to work that night).  

It is now 40 minutes after the agreed upon time and I have had no contact despite the fact that I sent a confirmation request 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

I am so frustrated that I don't really even want to talk to them anymore.

what should I do?

tl;dr:

1. they made contact
1. couldn't have their people there on time (1st interview)
1. have rescheduled a dozen times
1. I wasn't contacted at the scheduled time.

Update:
So apparently the interim recruiter, the one filling in while the other was on vacation, was to blame for all the rescheduling as he hadn't actually scheduled the interview with an interviewer. The interviewer was out of town for a week, and the recruiting office is on the other side of the country. 

I gave them 1 last chance for an interview and met the guy I had been supposed to interview with before. It went well and I received an offer. When I tried to talk with my other prospects, they both said that they would prefer I get a year's experience first and to stay in touch, That they would love to have me. Further elaboration clarified that the frameworks they use are rather cumbersome to even the most experienced professionals, and that it would be better to learn in a less vertically curved environment. 

I'm gonna have to take the job since I have no experience. "
2fhtoj,0,2014-09-04,Recently got fired from unpaid internship - Now I have five interviews but am afraid of bad employment history check,jobthrowaway1101,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2fhtoj/recently_got_fired_from_unpaid_internship_now_i/,"Here's the gist of this story.

For the last 3 months I've been participating in an unpaid internship on a political campaign in the area. It was going really well, until Labor Day when they fired me. I never had any sort of disciplinary action taken against me before and this is the first time I've ever been fired for ANYTHING.

I feel like the firing was unjust and unfair (I was never consulted about their decision until they sat me down), but after trying to reason with the staff member I realized the decision was already made. I have no avenue of recourse because I was an unpaid worker. I asked about references and he said they'll only be able to tell ""the truth"" meaning they were going to give me a bad reference. 3 months of labor and nothing to show for it. Yes, it's hugely ironic that I was fired ON LABOR DAY from an unpaid internship by a pro-labor politician taking advantage of unpaid workers.

It really sucks, but since I was fired I have had FIVE interview offers. This is a big deal, and much better than working on a campaign for free. The issue that I'm having is that I have included this internship on all of the applications that I've received interviews for. I'm afraid if they attempt to check employment history that I might get screwed over with a bad reference from the campaign, potentially losing out on big job offers and a livable salaried income. 

I'm not sure what to do to protect myself and am looking for advice about how to move forward."

I turned 30 and knew I was unhappy with where I was at and felt like I didn't have many intimate relationships and knew I needed to change. People can't get to know you until you share who you are with them. Through podcasting, I learned who I am is okay, warts and all. It's one thing to share my inner thoughts and feel good about myself; it's a whole 'nother thing to share my family's. I was nervous and still am nervous.

I did try for some internships prior to starting summer semester (if I had gotten one I would have not done summer) but again, heard nothing back probably due to the fact I am not almost done with my degree. 

I am thinking of maybe taking a semester off to get a job more related to my field or even an internship. I'm unsure if this is a good move, or to continue doing my degree to finish it as soon as I can.

What I am looking for, with job experience, is to make my self a much more valuable candidate than those who have also graduated with the same degree as me. I also know that because I am young I also have some slight advantage.

I graduated about 2 years ago from a good University with a good GPA (3.5) with a degree in Computer Science. I took most of the coursework relevant for modern technology, but due to circumstances I never got an internship.

After school was over, I took a year off to be with my family, since I was gone away from home for the four years and my family is in no urgent need of my employment. 

Come a year or so later, I decide I should move into the software industry.

8 months+ later, I still have not a single offer.
For the first few interviews I had some faulty knowledge that I corrected but it's been months since then and I still haven't gotten a single offer. It's seriously depressing. I thought Computer Science was the major where all the jobs were? 

At each of the big companies they don't even consider me because no work experience. My friend referred me to Amazon and the recruiter was just like ""I don't think they will consider this resume...""

At the smaller places every manager is like ""What were you doing for employment since 2012?"" None of them are okay with me taking a year off after school ended it seems. :(

In terms of programming-related experience in the last year, I: - Worked on a game jam project with my friend.
Learned about data science and took some online courses (and made some connections through it).

How do I get a job? I feel screwed.

I'm just starting out in northern Los Angeles, Cali, USA (northridge) and I'm trying to get into residential property management. I'd love to live on site in a paid situation, but while I am seeing jobs I'm not getting much in the way of feedback, interview, etc.

My story: I have a 5 year lead animal trainer and animal specialist history at a pet chain store, where I supervised and educated employees, customers, etc. I planned and executed repairs, care, orders, supplies, etc. Pretty big gig. Before that, I worked IT and other retail things. I will be graduating this winter with a dual major in real estate and management from Cal state Northridge, and I'm looking into a brokers license as well.

My mom was a realtor but passed in April and I had promised her I'd graduate and make something of myself. Since then, my gf left and I nearly failed out of school. The stress of her passing has cleared and I've dealt with my demons on the subject and it's time to get my life together-not for the sake of the promise, but for me!

More about me: I don't drink/smoke, no tattoos, facial hair, but well groomed, professional, well dressed, well educated, confident, great sales skills. Just need an opportunity to learn the ropes and get myself comfortable in the field.

My issues are local jobs require ""2-5 years proven experience"" which I can't seem to get (even offered to intern free at some of these places just to get exp!).  And I can't really seem to find anyone interested in mentoring for the brokers license as from what I gather there is a test I am not sure I am prepared to take.

Does anyone have insight to the property management industry in LA? Maybe someone here is interested in taking a risk on a kid looking to learn and grow? I do need to complete an internship of 125 hours before December to graduate as well, which I would love to do soon!


Thank you in advance, folks!"

 I was primarily involved in upgrading and rolling out W7 to all clients within a department and most of these stories are going to be from that little escapade.


No supervisor this time,  just another user story for now, sorry guys!

User pops online to our internal VoIP application, which is mainly being used as a general help / general chat room.

User enters your channel...
&gt; User : Hey Toakan, you know that screen issue we were talking about?

&gt; Me : Er, yeah?

Gently reminding myself that the monitor in question is a repurposed monitor that was claimed to have power issues, yet in the 72 hours of use, it was running just fine..

&gt; User : Well the pictures all shifted to one side of it, and theres a massive black border on one side.

&gt; Me : Sounds weird, have you tried turning it of and on again?

&gt; User : No hang on..

User has disconnected from your channel.

Ahh, I guess that fixed it, oh well back to browsing reddit.

5 minutes later...

User enters your channel...

&gt; User : Hey Toakan, I tried what you said and it didn't work, you may have to come to my desk and help!

&gt; Me : Ok, can you send me a picture of the monitor and what it currently is displaying?

So I get a picture through which confirms what I was thinking, the monitor has somehow auto adjusted itself about 30% to the right.

&gt; Me : Alright no worries, i'll be right over.


Get to the desk, and take a quick look, deffinately adjusted too far. Manage to get into the display settings on the monitor, X and Y set to 50... 

Standard setup? Ok let's try the auto adjust.


User can see what i'm attempting and gives me this nugget of information.
&gt; User : Oh by the way, the monitors 'Ok' button doesn't work.

With that she dissapears off for some reason.

Great, so the control board is probably shot, I'll take it apart later since I don't have the tools now.

Maybe wiggling the button for a connecti....

Monitor blinks off.

**Expletive**

I hit the power button, Ok not too bad. Just turn it back on.

Monitor turns on, and the image is reset.

Er, what?


By this time the user has returned to see the monitor back to normal.

&gt; User : Hey you fixed it! What did you do?

&gt; Me : I turned the monitor off and on again...

&gt; User : Really??

&gt; Me : Yeah, like I asked you to do?

&gt; User : Oooh, I thought you meant to turn the computer off and back on.


Brilliant 



Get back to my desk, and casually tell my comrades what occured. Many chuckles were had, especially when the user came online to thank me.

TL;DR - The user turned the computer off to fix the screen...

I guess you do get the occasional user that listens too well.

2fjtfb,2,2014-09-05,Need advice on cutting some ties with parents,babyhermit,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2fjtfb/need_advice_on_cutting_some_ties_with_parents/,"Edit: I'm pretty new to reddit and didn't realize there was an entire subreddit for financial advice. I think I'm going to move my question over there. Thank you for the meaningful responses, especially since I was still a bit emotionally distraught when I wrote this post!

Not right now since I'm currently jobless and in an academic funk, but sometime while I'm still a student (now - 2018) it's necessary that I learn how to live on my own. My parents have supported me these past 3 years in college. I'm very inexperienced with money matters...not budgeting, but tax forms, loans, insurance, that kind of stuff.

Incoming rant. Tl;dr at bottom.

-

The problem is that I'm 21, and my mother constantly uses her financial support as a leverage against me. I have bitten the bullet up until now because I recognize that parental support is far less complicated than student loans and working to pay rent. But, here are two examples of how her behavior has crossed the line:

* She is That Helicopter Parent. Last night, I made the mistake of telling her that I dislike when she constantly gives me, my brother, and my dad advice that isn't relevant to the current situation or topic of conversation. She replied, ""I know the problem. It's that you're an adult now. But as long as you are a child under this roof, I will treat you as a child."" Essentially, she equates being a financially dependent adult with being a child in terms of emotion and development. ""As for how I talk to your father and your brother, if they have problems with how I speak to them they can talk to me themselves. So mind your own business."" Which brings me to the second point...

* Because of my financial situation and academic problems, I have apparently lost every right to ""interfere"" with her relationship with my dad and my brother. Yes, my brother is a kid and will try anyone's patience, but my mom never tries hard enough to curb her temper. The usual routine is, my brother will do something wrong and she will go lecture him a bit. No kid likes to be lectured, so my brother usually tries to defend himself. Because her mentality is, *Why is my son trying to argue against doing something that is clearly right?*, she often starts to yell and makes my brother cry. Then she'll say, ""Why are you crying? Have I done something wrong? Have I said something that you think is wrong?"" She also does this to me, but I (and my dad) discovered the nifty be-as-deaf-and-mute-as-a-stone strategy long ago. I don't want my brother to have to resort to this. 

I have made multiple attempts to calmly intervene and to make her understand that these episodes are not an effective way to change my brother's behavior. These attempts usually end with me being accused of ""being a bad example for your brother"", of ""making this family miserable"", and then running out of the house sobbing in bad weather a couple hours after I initially tried to speak with her. There is no way she doesn't recognize that she says nasty things to appease her temper and not with the intention of negatively reinforcing the undesired behavior. She actually has told us many times, ""I don't mean half the things I say when I'm angry. You and your brother also say rude things when you're angry, so cut me some slack."" Well, I am 21 and my brother is 12. She is 50, has made it clear that she is the experienced mother and matriarch (""so back off with the parenting advice""), and loses her patience with something at least once a day. So no, I can no longer cut her any slack. 

-

If I remain like this, I will never be able to have any meaningful presence in my brother's teenage years. I'm working on getting a job and considering a student loan for the rest of my tuition. (The job is a relatively small problem...I only quit my decent part-time job at the university so I would stop using it as an excuse to not pursue major-related internships. They would hire me back.) Details that come to mind are cell phone bills, gas, car insurance, health insurance after I'm 24. It's a bit overwhelming to think about whether I can financially cover even half of those small things and still stay in my academic program, and I'm sure I've forgotten a dozen other factors. I recognize that right now I can only take the smallest of steps toward breaking free. Any specific advice would be welcome. 

**tl;dr)** Extreme case of helicopter mom. I'm not allowed to have an opinion because I've made past mistakes and am financially dependent. Need advice on ways to gradually break free.

I have a B.Sc. in Physics, and I'm about to start a ""master"" in High Performance Computing. I write ""master"" between quotes because it's not an actual Master's Degree (M.Sc.), but rather a more practical course focusing on practical skills. It's also shorter than a M.Sc. (but not by much, it's 9 months courses + 6 to 9 for the thesis project). I'm worried that not doing a real M.Sc. will hinder my chances of finding a good job and making a decent career.

I'm also wondering what professional figures exist in the world of HPC, both in industry and in academia, and what title they have/need: what I've seen up to now is that they are mostly divided between engineers (who set up and manage machines) and scientists (who know how and for what applications to use them), but both these positions require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. I'd love to do scientific computing, because I love programming and I love science... but will I be able to do it with my curriculum? If not in academia, is there enough request in industry for non-M.Sc.s with practical experience? And will I have a decent career path or will I be stuck in junior positions for life because of my lack of titles?

Some notes in random order:
* I'd rather not become a sysadmin: first because I don't have the right education for it, and second because I don't think I'd like it. If I had to choose, I'd say ""scientific software developer"" would be my ideal job.
* I considered some M.Sc. programmes in Germany and Spain, and they're cool, but I'm too late to apply for this winter semester, so I'd have to wait at least 6 months to see IF they admit me, and meanwhile I would lose my place in this ""master"".
* I already had some experience with HPC during my Bachelor's thesis and with a 2-months internship at a research center; that's what made me like the field. The ""master"" will also involve a lot of hands-on work, and also a project thesis as I said, so I will have some experience under my belt after it.

I'm trying to decide what I want to do, but I'm a bit lost, so I'd like to know what my possibilities will be if I pursue this route vs. a real Master's Degree.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion."

I am a fairly avid PC builder and have probably completed about 15 or so builds and lots of troubleshooting in my lifetime.   I have an opportunity to intern with a very big name in my industry, and he has asked me to build him a computer for his business.  I am honored to say the least, but I want to make sure I take good care of him.  

This computer will be heavily used for day trading (java heavy think or swim and java heavy brokerage program) , streaming with Omnovia, and shooting videos on camtasta.    All these programs are on all day along with extensioned out Chrome, chat programs, and general other uses like music.  Also, the computer will have 4 1920x1080 monitors to start with, and potentially 2-4 more added later down the line.  

**The caveat here is that I have to pickup everything in person from San Diego Fry's Electronics**...  Now Fry's says they will price match places like Newegg and Tiger Direct, but I know they include the shipping costs in the price they will match.   

I want at least a 480GB SSD in there, I also think 16 GB of RAM and maybe a 4GB video card (in case of many monitors or potential 1440p later on).  Budget for everything (monitors, stand, and all) is about $2,000 +/-   Less is better but he trusts my judgement.      **I will VenMo $5 to a few of you if you put in good effort to help me with this! **

Now the Video Card I like Gigabyte but I am open to other options.  Maybe a R9 280(x) 3GB would work fine or better?  Again I like the 4GB to handle all the monitors and have some SLI future potential for 1440p.  No gaming on this machine.  I could price match the gigabyte down about $20.  

The Siig arm I have found for $149 to match.  The RAM  could maybe match down another $10.   Mobo and SSD may have a little price match potential.  


Alright well I **really appreciate** any input.  Let me know!

I have a B.Sc. in Physics, and I'm about to start a ""master"" in High Performance Computing. I write ""master"" between quotes because that's how they call it, but it's not an actual Master's Degree (M.Sc.); it's rather a more practical course focusing on practical skills. It's also shorter than a M.Sc. (but not by much, it's 9 months courses + 6 to 9 for the thesis project). I'm worried that not doing a real M.Sc. will hinder my chances of finding a good job and making a decent career.

I'm also wondering what professional figures exist in the world of HPC, both in industry and in academia, and what title they have/need: what I've seen up to now is that they are mostly divided between engineers (who set up and manage machines) and scientists (who know how and for what applications to use them), but both these positions require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. I'd love to do scientific computing, because I love programming and I love science... but will I be able to do it with my curriculum? If not in academia, is there enough request in industry for non-M.Sc.s with practical experience? And will I have a decent career path or will I be stuck in junior positions for life because of my lack of titles?

Some notes in random order:
* I'd rather not become a sysadmin: first because I don't have the right education for it, and second because I don't think I'd like it. If I had to choose, I'd say ""scientific software developer"" would be my ideal job.
* I considered some M.Sc. programmes in Germany and Spain, and they're cool, but I'm too late to apply for this winter semester, so I'd have to wait at least 6 months to see IF they admit me, and meanwhile I would lose my place in this ""master"".
* I already had some experience with HPC during my Bachelor's thesis and with a 2-months internship at a research center; that's what made me like the field. The ""master"" will also involve a lot of hands-on work, and also a project thesis as I said, so I will have some experience under my belt after it.

I'm trying to decide what I want to do, but I'm a bit lost, so I'd like to know what my possibilities will be if I pursue this route vs. a real Master's Degree.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion."

I work for a software company in Midtown that is looking to hire an IT intern.  We need someone that is comfortable with troubleshooting common issues with Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, or at least two of the three. There's a lot of room to grow in this position, and there's a good chance of it turning into a full-time position.

I've been working there for 2.5 years now, and I've really enjoyed it. I was an intern but just started full time, and we're looking to hire someone to fill my old spot. It's a small company, so you have flexibility in how you do your job, as well as the hours you work. It's a laid back environment, and you'll almost certainly have time to work on projects that interest you.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The end goal is to develop my professional skills in any of the languages/skills I've listed, add experience and projects to my growing resume; and, finally, to leave a satisfied client behind after the job is complete.

*****

##About Me:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My name is Alex, I am an engineering student (electrical engineering, planning to transfer into computer science) moving into my 3rd year at a university placed within the top 10 engineering schools in the world. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During my senior year of high school, and much of my time spent at university, I had *no* idea what sort of career path I would want to take - going down the path of engineering because I had very high scores in the math/science sector and generally being technologically savvy. However, I also had a great love of graphics/design; I can remember spending most of my time in elementary school drawing comics and distributing copies to other kids, they were huge hits, in fact I had several popular series circulating the classrooms!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ahem...getting back to the topic at hand, I'm here in /r/forhire for a second time (achieving limited success from my first attempt) due to the fact that I believe I've found something I'm truly passionate about/enjoy and wanted to be able to apply myself in the respective fields listed in the title in the hopes that I can learn something useful as well as growing professionally.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To put it bluntly, I am looking to take on/assist with any projects that involve either electrical-engineering components (circuits, electrical work, signal processing, etc.), computer science principles (coding in various languages, troubleshooting, debugging, etc.), or design (3-D modeling, web design, circuit layout, network architecture, etc.).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Most of this information, hopefully, gives a better idea of what kind of person I am, what sort of work ethic I possess, what I can contribute, and what I expect to gain from the experience.  

*****

##Experience 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As for my experiences, in the hope of maintaining this post to reasonable length I won't list specifics but will happily supply them to anyone interested. I will, however, list off some key points being:

- Designed the layout for a new production plant (industrial intern)

- Analyzed data for production (industrial intern) and theoretical (research assistant) processes.

- Ported, organized, manipulated data via excel with the use of scripts.

##Skills  
**Acquired:**
 
HTML(5)  
CSS(3)  
C++  
MATLAB  
CAD/3D Modeling  

**Acquiring:**  

C# (Including .NET framework)  
Javascript (Including jQuery/Bootstrap)  
Python  
Ruby (Including 'Rails)  
PHP  
MySQL

2fl40m,4,2014-09-05,Resume advice request for 38 year old in last year of CS degree.,throwaway84827364,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fl40m/resume_advice_request_for_38_year_old_in_last/,"I am 38 years old, getting a second undergraduate degree in CS from a top ten school (the first degree was a liberal arts degree) and I'm not sure what information I should include in my resume.

My GPA from my old undergraduate was about a 3.1 (from 15 years ago), but my GPA at my current school (and my major GPA) is a 4.0, bringing my cumulative GPA to ~3.4. I have only one CS internship, but quite a bit of previous work experience in an unrelated field.

My questions are as follows:
1) How should I present my GPA? Should it be like: Current School GPA 4.0...or would it be better to just list my major GPA and my cumulative GPA?
2) I think I'm going to leave off most of my prior unrelated work experience. I was self employed for a number of years before going back to school, so I think I will include that experience and leave everything else off. Is this the right thing to do?

3) Is there anything else I should consider?

Thank you very much for any thoughts you might have."

2fm5bh,0,2014-09-06,Is it just me or does getting an internship as a sophomore seem uncommon but necessary?,samalamma708,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fm5bh/is_it_just_me_or_does_getting_an_internship_as_a/,"I've read the FAQ topics about getting internships but I feel like I'm in a catch 22. I am a sophomore now and have a career fair coming up next week which will have over 220 companies. I've seen the importance of internships stressed a lot here, and I feel like I need to get one as soon as possible. The thing is, I don't really know why anyone would hire me for an internship if I have never had programming work experience and have not yet taken any incredibly involved CS classes. I'm currently in a data structures class, so I think I will be more prepared after this semester, but I feel like at this point I would not be able to pass a technical interview.

I believe myself to be fairly good at programming. In the classes I have taken and am taking, I have been the one to always help my friends who are in the same class. I've programmed since I was about 12 but it was mainly as a hobby making games using a program called GameMaker. I first learned C++ in a semester class sophomore year of high school, but didn't touch it again until last year for my programming class.

Basically, it boils down to this: I feel like I definitely will be able to be a considerably better (or at least more knowledgeable) programmer in a year or so. I think I have a knack for it, but I just haven't had the opportunity to learn many data structures/algorithms in my classes yet, which I realize are huge parts to being a successful programmer. 

If I don't get an internship this coming summer, I feel like I'm screwing myself over in the long run, but I don't really feel as if I am qualified for an internship. 

Am I overestimating how much experience companies expect of their interns? If so, what sort of level are they looking for? I'm just pretty stressed about the long term effects of missing out this year, but I really don't know where to proceed to change that. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I have been contemplating quitting my tech support job because well it is tech support.  The pros about me quitting is that I will have more time for school and develop my skills.  The cons is that I am worried about not having any income.  My average hourly is 22 hr for working two 12 hr days.  I also volunteer for all holidays where I get paid double.  It's been really nice to pay my way through school but I am getting resentful and I feel like I could be better off doing more productive things.

I am probably going to quit its just a matter of when.  Why haven't I quit, I have some bills that I need to take care of and I need at least 4 paychecks before quitting. I don't have anything lined except for interviews for internships which I am afraid I am not qualified for because of my limited time.  

My question is should I quit sooner so that I can improve my skills and be more marketable?

Also I have been really slacking off at work?  Does it matter for my next job? 


Other question is does it matter what I look like for job interviews? This is a serious question.  My first job was a receptionist, my boss would comment"" You know you are a very beautiful woman.""  I don't really think about this except at job interviews.  I consciously wear jeans mess up my hair by not brushing it , dump the contacts, find an old pair of glasses and wear no make up to get a job.  If I look even slightly polish I get offered an office job or sales.  Am I nuts?  I have gone to interviews where I feel very awkward when I look like my normal self.

2fnuls,25,2014-09-06,I find myself embarrassed in many social situations. Does this stem from my ADHD (impulsivity) or from my anxiety? (I'm just curious as to this subreddits' thoughts),fgt2lw,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2fnuls/i_find_myself_embarrassed_in_many_social/,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 and was diagnosed with GAD at age 15. I do not take medications because these conditions do not severely interfere with my daily life. They do affect my thoughts, anxiety level, and self-confidence though. I do go to great lengths sometimes to hide my anxiety, although most of the time I feel as though I can control it.

I never had issues in elementary, middle, or high school as far as speaking out and asking questions in class. Now I find myself afraid to talk in front of people. Whenever I answer questions in class I get too involved and answer too much sometimes. I know that sounds contradictory but the impulsivity is overwhelming and I'm burning to vomit the thoughts in my head. Then, in the next second, I'm incredibly embarrassed that I said anything at all. Sometimes, even mispronouncing a word or saying the wrong thing (like the wrong date or something) creates an intense embarrassed sensation. 

I obsess over conversations in my head. Even small ones. I over analyze and nit pick at every single thing I said, even if it was a great conversation or even with close friends and family that I trust. 

This worries me as I am trying to get a job and build a good rapport with those at my university so that I can help myself get internships and good references by the time I'm finished with my BA. 

I'm not asking if I need meds or if I should go see a Dr. If that was necessary I would do it. I'm trying to work this out and was wondering if anyone here who deals with anxiety along with their ADHD (which is common for those with ADHD, as I've been told by a professional) and if this sounds at all familiar to them. 

Does anyone else on here experience this? How do you deal with these feelings? Meds? Meditation? Video games? Any advice or tips?

TL;DR I'm having impulsivity/anxiety issues in social situations. Not taking meds, but can control my issues for the most part. I am having complex emotions and am worried about future endeavors.

Thank you!

2fnxrg,4,2014-09-06,Messed Up Interview after Internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fnxrg/messed_up_interview_after_internship/,"I had an internship at a Big 4 Company this summer.  At the end of the internship, this company has 2 interviews for interns hoping to transition to full time.  The first of my interviews went well, but the second one did not.

The second interview asked a question about writing a solver for a game.  The interviewer said, ""Write a solver assuming optimal play"".  I hadn't heard the term ""optimal play"" before, so I asked him to clarify.  He tried to explain, but his example confused me even more.  I only kind of understood what he wanted (now I fully do), but I was able to give a brute force solution. Then we talked about a system design question.

I think spending so much time discussing the definition of ""optimal play"" prevented me from really being able to show my ability to program.  I did a fizz-buzz type problem before this happened, and so he was only able to see that and my brute force solution to the more complicated problem.

Should I contact my recruiter and ask for an additional interview?  Is that justified?"

Any suggestions and/or comments are welcome!  Yes I know that 3000 might be a bit overkill for my first build, but I want something good and that can last me a while and be upgraded in the future.  Thank you in advance kind redditors!"
2foutp,2,2014-09-06,How do you change a .txt file into a .vcf file?,[deleted],bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/2foutp/how_do_you_change_a_txt_file_into_a_vcf_file/,"I just got my first undergrad internship in a bioinformatics lab, and all this new stuff is hitting me way too fast for me to understand. 


I tried googling stuff about VCF files, but all I found was this website http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/ . 


When I read stuff about VCF it just seems like it's a format style of how the document is organized. Would it just work to convert my .txt file and print out all my data in it the same way a .vcf file would have it? Or does it have to have the .vcf name, and how would I make my data in the .txt file a .vcf file??




edit: Thanks for all the answers, I ended up just writing my own script to convert my textfile into the vcf format. "

[I'm 18 and just started college and majoring in engineering, do you have any tips to help me reach my goal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb9o57?context=5)|Do the work. All of it. Help is ok but you need to learn it yourself.
 |Accept that it's hard and you won't get it all. Do your best to learn what you can.
 |Get a good study group that does not copy off each other but will help each other through the hard parts.
 |Go to fucking class. All of them if you can. Often lectures will build on the previous one and missing one can really hurt you.
 |Go have fun. Learning to communicate with others and working with others is a necessity you will absolutely need when you're done. Join a band, play some sports, be in a gaming club, whatever. Just make sure you have some social time so you can learn to work with people.
 |Ask for help when you need it. Your profs and lab assistants will help if you are smart enough to ask.
 |Learn to manage your time. Most classes will have weekly assignments, a lab, and a lecture. This can result in having up to a dozen things due every week for grades. If you push shit off to the last minute you will not get it done. Highschool will in no way prepare you for this. It'll come all at once and it's shocking. By 4th year you'll have it down.
 |Don't worry if you fail. It happens. I failed both 1st and 2nd year maths and had to retake all 4 classes but I got through it and didn't quit. Obviously try not to fail but if you do, it's ok. You can retake a class. If you're not failing at something in your life then you're not living. Learn from it, get better, move on.
 |One other thing. Try to get engineering summer jobs or internships. Many companies hire students for technical tasks and this experience will be vital to helping you get a job when you're done. Start looking in October. Seriously, October. By December summer jobs can all be gone.
 |Hope this helps and best of luck!
[Hello. I'm currently an engineering student. Thank you for doing this AMA. My questions are;  Any tips for a student like me? Like how to learn more/ understand more?   How did you land your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb55vb?context=5)|Ok I'll try to answer these in order: Tips: Study hard but not too hard. Unless you're going into grad studies your grades shouldn't matter much (Here in Canada anyway). Be social and learn some good people skills because you will need them more then math. I haven't done calculus since I graduated. Work in groups if you can but try not to copy. Keep in mind that you are learning the basics of engineering and you may not apply any of it in an actual job. In school you learn to learn and that is the skill you need.  I landed my first job because I knew someone high up in the company and I had a life outside of school. They were impressed that I played music and was involved in things other then studies. It showed I could be a people person who could work with others. This is where the interview process is important. You need to be professional but not a robot. People like to know you're human too. Don't expect much for the first few years. Just get a job and absorb absorb absorb. Opportunities open up pretty quick when you start getting some experience.
[Is working as an engineering really require all the physical stuff?  How are your working hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb55vb?context=5)|The pay is as good as it should be. Check with your professional association and you will get an idea of pay. Or if you like click here: [Link to www.apegs.ca](http://www.apegs.ca/Portal/Pages/salary-survey)  You can be a desk jockey or you can be a field guy. There are also R&amp;D jobs that are not physical or site related but you should still try to get out there and see what you're building. Seeing the end product of your work and how it's applied is very important experience and will help you make better decisions in your designs.  Working hours can vary quite a bit. I've worked 7days in/7 days out 12 hour days, Monday to friday 8-4, and 4x10hour days per week. There are jobs that require you to be there months as well (offshore drilling, remote mines etc). All in all, I have always enjoyed my shifts and never felt I was being abused.
[Thank you very much for responding, wow! I'm actually on my 2nd year and it's all just math for now. It's difficult but I get by.  My ideal job would be at the desk. I'm an industrial engineering student actually so I've read that there are many desk-job related work. Do you know anyone who's an industrial engineer? Is their job the same as yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb724p?context=5)|One of my old engineering managers was an industrial engineer who worked for ford. As far as I'm aware (Canadian slant) Industrial engineers deal more with manufacturing and less with the resource industry. It's really tough to nail down exactly what each kind of engineer can do because there is a lot of overlap. Follow your dreams and do what you love and you never know where you'll end up. For example, I no longer do any design but instead organize and run projects. 
[Hey, aspiring mechanical engineer here. What are some tips/advice to becoming a successful engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fo9tm/iama_mechanical_engineer_who_designs_and/ckb4mbm?context=5)|I would suggest that you try a lot of different things and learn what you love. In my career I have worked with operations at a mill keeping things running, as a construction manager running crews building stuff, and as a consultant working with a large team to generate construction drawings for the contractors. Try different things and go with your passion. You may not even end up doing engineering work in the end. For example, I am now a project manager and do no design at all. But my experience with the design and construction side of things really helps make that job a good fit for me. I love field work and I love working with trades.
 |Also, keep your damned mouth shut and ask a lot of questions. A lot of new engineers have the bad habit of thinking they know stuff. The reality is that a trades person with 20 years on the tools will hand you your ass at a lot of design stuff. Learn to respect the trades and ask them for advice when working on designs. Learn to get value out of everyone you work with no matter what their standing is in the company. The IT guy may not have your fancy degree but if you treat them with respect they will save your ass. Same goes for everyone else. Field work is a great way to see it all come together and to get a feel for what you're actually building. However, if hard hats and work boots aren't your thing, office work can be as fun if that's your thing. Really, you have to try a lot and be open to new things every step of the way. I will fully tell you that in my 10 years every single project and in fact every single day has something new to offer. Also, avoid putting in extra time as long as possible. You have the rest of your career to work weekends so don't do it right out of the gate if you don't have to. Once down the path to extra hours it's very hard to back off again.

2fp8iu,6,2014-09-07,Community College Student wants your opinion,SerpentSwells,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2fp8iu/community_college_student_wants_your_opinion/,"My question, essentially: Is Berkeley worth it? I'm currently a freshman at a California CC and am scouting out my options for transferring. (Yeah, I know it's too early in the process to be worrying about this, but alas, my favorite past-time is planning for the future. I know; I'm a very boring person.) 

Berkeley's definitely my favorite potential destination, but looking at the requirements for admission as compared to the mid-tier UCs, they're rather demanding. As arrogant as it sounds, I'm confident I'll eventually get into UCSB on GPA alone and be perfectly happy, whereas legitimately pursuing Berkeley will require me to take up some extra ECs. I don't wanna take up these ECs. The idea of doing these ECs that I seriously don't give a shit about, for the sole purpose of giving myself a mere *chance* at Berkeley, is absurd and obviously goes against what should be the actual purpose of doing said ECs.

But I don't know, maybe Berkeley's worth it? I'm passionate about what I wanna study and wanna learn about it at the highest level available to me. I know Berkeley is definitely the place to do that. (And before anyone suggests it, I hate my semi major-related internship; so no, an EC related to my major will not be more enjoyable for me. I don't really like the ""applied"" aspects of my major, just the conceptual/theoretical parts, or at least what little I know of those parts, at the moment).

So, does anyone have any insight or advice for me? I understand this entire post is sort of needy in a way (lol), but I figure it's a worth a shot. Thanks!

EDIT: Should've mentioned I'm an econ major."

Would love to hear some detailed information from redditors about which field of consulting they are in and what they work entails. If anyone can pinpoint me to good resources, (besides the usual mckinsey way &amp;amp; mind, case in point etc) that would be great! I enjoy reading about technology a lot and would love to start my own blog one day (currently lack of funds) but based on that I feel that I would be best suited to and enjoy tech consulting the most. Except, I keep hearing that even an internship in tech consulting can pigeonhole you and that exit ops aren't great. Would love to hear from current IT consultants if they regret their job and their experiences. I do remember a Deloitte partner telling me that most people are attracted to strategy due to its prestige but within Deloitte its not hard to move around. He worked in IT/public sector and in hindsight should have gotten his business card. Moreover, do you guys think it would be worthwhile to start cold calling and emailing? even though the recruitment season has already begun? I don't have a great resume and none of the MBB firms come to my uni but through Linkedin I did find alumni. Lastly, assuming that I don't get a consulting internship, would you recommend sending in applications to investment banks or should I try getting experience in a firm like Unilever etc. "
2fqqqq,5,2014-09-07,Going into a 6-month internship in HR. Need advice.,[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/2fqqqq/going_into_a_6month_internship_in_hr_need_advice/,"Hi!
Happy to have found this sub. 
First of all, I'm somewhere in Romania. 

I'm a newly Law School graduate, going to start a Masters degree in Business Law this October. I can't wait around for a career in Law anymore (I'm terribly poor), so I'm trying to break into HR. Started applying for jobs and internships the past month and I got accepted for a 6 month internship at a multinational HR company (after 3 interviews!). My plan is to get through it by working really hard, take a HR Management Course at Uni and go to whatever workshops and conferences I can find related to the field. I realize that even with such efforts, 6 month is not a long period to gain experience - I know I need at least 1 year, so is there anything else I can do that would make my resume stand up? If nothing else, I'm thinking of going for another internship at a large HR company after I finish this one, although I'll probably get tired of working without getting paid. 

Related to my first question - what would be the best plan for... making... the most... money? (*feeling awkward*) HR in a business company (maybe one of the Big Four), or in an IT company (something like Oracle, IBM etc.)? I know it's a shallow question, I'm just tired of being poor and not being able to help my family financially. 

Also, if you have some advice regarding my incoming internship, I would very much appreciate it. I have little to no idea of what to expect. 

Thanks a lot!"

2frhgn,186,2014-09-07,My mothers phone ended up in a unusual spot and I'm going to go retrieve it tomorrow morning.,Im_a_Cool_Cat,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2frhgn/my_mothers_phone_ended_up_in_a_unusual_spot_and/,"I've been a very average lurker on nosleep for almost a year now.  I love this place for many reasons.  I am very curious, analytical and I love mysteries; especially the crime and investigation type.  However, now that I have a situation on my own hands, I'm not sure if I've been wise to read all these stories this past year due to my paranoia I have about this seemingly harmless ordeal.  I apologize, I tend to ramble sometimes so why don't I begin.

First of all, I am a college student living with my parents.  I've been attending my local university earning plenty of credits in biological sciences.  I'm currently creating a résumé as I will be applying for a few medical schools when I finish my internship at the nearby emergency center.  In all of the chaos, I've ignored some pretty interesting occurrences that have been taking place around the house.

As I've already mentioned, I live with my mother and father and I love them both to death.  None of my ambitions and accomplishments would mean a thing without their support throughout my educational phase.  All is pretty calm and routine in our home; I goto to ""work"" (my internship) while they go out to eat and rest as any old and retired couple should.  But earlier today something quite disturbing happened.

At about 10 AM I woke up to my parents preparing breakfast.  As I walked down the stairs all I could think was, ""Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon!""  

As I grab a plate and start to pile on the beautifully prepared bacon and cheese omelets, blueberry muffins, and hash browns, my mother asked, ""Have you seen my phone?""  My parents are rather funny in a sense that they both cannot stand change.  My mother still uses one of those flip phone, Motorola Razers.  She loves it and, what can I say, it works just fine.  

""I haven't seen it. When was the last time you used it?""  

I can usually find stuff by retracing steps so this wasn't a unusual process for us.  

""Well, I called your sister on it yesterday, so I haven't lost it.""  My sweet mother explained.  

We decide to use the old routine and call it while she does a walk through of our house.  As I began ringing her phone I shouted up the stairs, ""It's ringing!"" and she begans opening doors.  

After about 2 more calls passed, she shouted down the stairs, ""I can hear it, but I can't pinpoint where it's at.""  I didn't respond and allowed her to keep searching.

After maybe 4 or 5 more calls the phone picked up.  Now this is where it begins to get strange.  The line was dead silent but was definitely answered.  I shouted up the stairs, ""Hey, did you find it?""

""No.""

I heard a faint echo through my phone, ""No.""

My immediate response was that something was that something was terribly wrong and that my precious mummy was in grieve danger.  Was some crazy mother fucker hiding, waiting for the perfect time to attack my saint of a mother, and make off with her 2007 Razer phone?  Pretty improbable, right? I pocketed my phone and sprinted up the stairs and into the grand bedroom.  

Now she was fine, but was startled by my reaction.  Thanks for the hellish paranoia, nosleep.  Anyways, fast forward about thirty minutes and we'd come to the conclusion that the phone was above us, in the attic.  This was rather unusual because we have not opened our attic in close to 4 years since a garage sell.  But we have had some issues recently with thumping in the roof which ended up being a tree that had scraped on the roof vent, creating a home for any versatile creature willing to climb up a tree and into our roof.

The most logical guess we could come up with was that my mother had dropped her phone in the front yard while exiting her car, which was then picked up by a squirrel or some other pest that preceded to climb into our attic with it.

My parents were satisfied with this answer, but me; not so much...

Anyways, since our attic vent issue needs to be addressed, we are going to go up tomorrow in the cool hours to check it all out.  My fathers currently at The Home Depot grabbing some materials and my mom doesn't think much of it, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to be confronted with a surprise tomorrow.  But it's probably just my nosleep mentality.

I'll keep you guys updated with anything I find.

The only problem is.... I just switched to cs from biology and I have nothing to show on my resume that is really related to CS. I have been a teaching assistant for a low level cs class for a year but that is my only thing on my resume that relates to computer science. Apart from that I have that i did research at a university in Spain (biology research), that i am VP of my sorority, that i worked in the main office of the engineering school, and that i am a tour guide. 

I don't know what to talk about with recruiters since this is my first semester taking classes for a cs major (i've only ever taken a lower level cs class before this semester), I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with a cs major when i graduate, and I've never done any work on projects. I also feel like my resume does not reflect my interest in cs at all because I so recently switched. 

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I need advice on how to talk to recruiters about how I want a job that will give me a lot of cs experience but how i dont really have any outside projects going on and also what kinds of questions recruiters are going to ask me

2frxmc,6,2014-09-07,Changing my career path from a math PhD to software engineering,Psych--,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2frxmc/changing_my_career_path_from_a_math_phd_to/,"Wall of text warning!

I'm a senior math major and my plan was to attend graduate school. If it means anything, my advisers and I think that a top 10 school is within my reach, so I think I have fair career chances as a mathematician. However, I love technology and can see myself working with programming. 

My dilemma, though, is that I would want to work on the most interesting problems with equally talented people. This leads me to be interested in working at one of the larger, more competitive software companies. However, it seems as though doing an internship at a major tech company is, if not required, very beneficial. 

Basically, I want to do a tech internship next summer to decide whether or not I am willing to give up so much quality of life pursuing a math PhD. 

My background: I have quite a bit of experience with Algorithms and Complexity from a mathematical perspective. I also am very well versed in the mathematics of Cryptology. For this I coded some hash functions and ciphers using MATLAB to run some computational experiments. This is all to say I am familiar with the theoretical aspects of computer science. However, I lack formal exposure to Data Structures and Algorithms. I will have completed a fairly extensive amount of coursework by the end of this year.

My questions:
* It seems as though now would be the time to apply for an internship. Should I apply even though I am still learning the requirements? I will be more than qualified by next summer (if I continue at my current rate much sooner than that).

* Can I apply for a meaningful internship a few months from now when I am more experienced?

* Can I do an internship as a current Senior? I'm considering taking a few CS courses next year to finish up a major because I have to stay in the area for my girlfriend, so I may or may not be done with school next summer.

* Is an internship even necessary for me? I'm mostly interested because I think it would give me the best idea of what to do.



Finally, if it helps, I installed Java for the first time 9 days ago and just completed this https://github.com/JeffSchreinerMcGraw/Chord-Diagrams. It's 800 lines of rough, mostly un-commented code because it's just for me, but it may be helpful evaluating my situation.

2fs6bl,6,2014-09-08,Graduated with a BS in Computer Science over a year ago... still have no clue what I want to do.,jeffersonbrown,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2fs6bl/graduated_with_a_bs_in_computer_science_over_a/,"As the title states, I graduated with a BS in Computer Science over a year ago. Unfortunately, almost immediately after graduating I had some medical problems arise again and haven't felt 100% until the last two months or so.  These same problems caused me to have to withdraw from my second semester at college and a few classes the two following semesters.

My problem lies with the fact that I've never held a job and have no idea what I really want to do.  My parents didn't really push me to find a job early in my life or during college, instead allowing me to focus on my studies.  However, I didn't take advantage of any form of internships or and job fairs during college.  Furthermore, I haven't felt 100% this past year and haven't felt like working on any of my own projects and feel like my programming knowledge is rusty.

Ultimately, I've looked at job listings on indeed.com and am pretty terrified of applying.  Not only do I have no former work experience, but I don't have any sort of portfolio that I'm really proud of.  Within the past six months, I have messed around with web development, but I have yet to finish a project because I'm pretty critical over how it looks (I basically feel like it looks like amateur work).  Also, at my University we focused mainly on programming in Java, so I don't feel comfortable stating I'm a proficient web developer.

Thinking about getting a job has been fairly stressful lately. I feel like with my degree I should focus on getting a Software Engineering job, but I'm not 100% confidient it is something I want to do. I also believe that I am capable of handling a variety of jobs just on my ability to quickly learn and understand things.  This is partly why I started messing around with web development, along with my enjoyment of graphic design.  Again, I'm not 100% sure on how to approach even finding or applying for a job given my lack of experience.  Any advice helps."

Career fairs are coming up and I wanted to ignite a discussion about the best internship for a current sophomore in Computer Science.

A lot of companies won't hire a freshmen/sophomores yet, but some companies have special programs just for underclassmen: Facebook's ""Facebook U"", Google's ""Engineering Practicum"".

Additionally, beyond the big names (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft), what are some other programs that would be great for a sophomore? 

Where have you worked (if you had an internship after sophomore year)? What was it like? What would you recommend?"

I will finish my degree in November 2015 and haven't had any internships or completed any notable side projects.


**1.**

**Company Industry:** Financial Institution

**Length:** 3 months - full time

**Paid:** Yes, enough to support myself.

**Offer:** Verbal

**Role:**  IT, unknown specifics.

**Start/End date:** End of November - Start of February

**Description:** HR is waiting on approval on how many interns they can hire. Role is ambiguous but involves at least some coding.


-----------------
**2.**

**Company Industry:** Media

**Length:** 6 months - full time


**Paid:** Yes, enough to support myself.

**Offer:** Official/Written Offer (waiting on me to advise start date)

**Role:**  Web Infrastructure Intern

**Start/End date:** Flexible starting date

**Description**: Role involves working with cloud computing, automation and testing, developing internal tools. 

----------------

I am leaning more towards the second internship as It is longer and I have a good idea of what I will be doing.

The first company has a graduate program that is ranked in the top 30  in the country. It was mentioned that most of the graduates come from the internship program.
The second company has only just started hiring graduates this year. 

The main reason I am unsure about the first offer is because I do not know exactly what I will be doing as it was not explicitly stated. As well as the fact that I do not have a confirmed offer.

My career goal at the moment is to become a software engineer but neither internships are solely focused on that field.  

I have asked the second company if I can begin after the first internship ends and they said that they I can start in either December or January.

Feel free to ask for more information if that will help you provide good advice. Thanks for your help."

I have a couple semesters of Java and have dabbled in web dev. This summer my goal is to be working for a company as a paid intern doing software development.

Summer is a long way from now, however, this means that I should be starting some projects.

Typically, what kind of projects can one learn and do on their own to impress recruiters?

If you were a recruiter, what kind of personal projects would you like to see in someones portfolio?

Thanks, any and all help is appreciated."
2fsnec,5,2014-09-08,"6 months in programming job, not knowing if I'm bad, the company sucks or what...",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fsnec/6_months_in_programming_job_not_knowing_if_im_bad/,"Hello! Long time user/lurker using throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've been worrying for a handful things the last months, and I'll try to summarize them as best as I can, so sorry if this is an uninteligible wall of text.

28 year old, male, the standard guy who entered into CS because he wanted to make games (And still), 6 months knee-deep into his first, real, programming job (Before that did an internship not related with programming, although I manage to create some stuff for the department).
I do enjoy coding, I like to ""create"" stuff, I even have some game related stuff around because I like it.

Crappy-ass contractor with what it seems to be standard coding conditions: No formation, no svn, no (useful) documentation, only ""wise"" coworkers who knows the project but usually don't have time to explain anything to you. My first project involved one meeting with our client and two months almost on my own as my contact left to, literally, the other side of the world due a more important project. And I didn't even have a testing environment.
It's the kind of place you stay for few years and change to other, bigger company. There's no chances of growing (Maybe team lead in the company, but that's all) or switching projects (there's only one big client), nor of being hired by our client (well, there is, but is almost playing lottery).
Yeah, yeah, I understand most of it is ""normal"" (I have no problem spending two days just reading other's code and drawing diagrams for myself). But it also sucks and is part of my problem.

I've noticing that my performance is sub-par. Maybe that's just imposter syndrome on steroids, but I'm having real trouble to follow explanations on how a specific functionality works, i (mostly) got shit done, but still, I think that maybe I couldn't do it faster, but everyone wants it faster. And well, I have zero knowledge of the code and everyone seems to think that I should already know a lot more of what I know.
And I don't see how can I learn anything about our (huge and only) application, as the job assignment is semi random, always focused in specific things and ""for yesterday"", so I just can't stop and watch the whole thing working.

No one in the company has told me anything about my performance (just a talk about something I just forgot the last week, which was half my fault and half the other guy explanation's fault), but my perception is that I have the Damocle's Sword over my head (There's also some stuff about workload in our company that could lead to people being fired and it's not making me feel comfortable at all. Also, I updated 3 days ago my CV in the online portal I used to find this job -to make it current- and got a visit... by my own company).

All the work I've done before on coding (both in uni, in my previous company -as an intern- and in side projects involving writing the code from scratch and (mostly) knowing all the design of the application, so I think I have there a major problem going on, as it seems I'm terrible at understanding not other's code, but other's design.

So, right now, I know that my company sucks, but I have the feeling that I'm also sucking at my work, and I don't know what can I do to improve (Or if I just can't improve and just this job is not for me). I could just leave to other job, but I'm actually scared of meeting the same problems with my performance I'm facing right now.

So basically I am a 20-year-old in his first year of a 4-year CS degree in UK, which means that I will graduate at the age of 24 instead of the usual 22. This is because the country where I was born school begins at the age of 7 and takes 12 years + 1 year of conscription in the military (yes, some European countries still have that).

I know that the CS industry is dominated by young people, and I would like to know your opinion on whether being 2 years older will make my job application look significantly less attractive. After all, at this age the typical CS grad will either already have 2 years worth of experience in the industry or be close to finishing their PhD, whereas the only thing I'll have is a master's degree with possible experience from summer internships."

2ftmqn,36,2014-09-08,Just got a new job!,TheDeathCard,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2ftmqn/just_got_a_new_job/,"So I decided to post about my new job after reading about /u/crankysysadmin turning down his new job offer.

   I currently work as the network/server/virtual engineer/admin/troubleshooter for a 25 bed critical access hospital in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming.

 I live 2 hours away and drive up to stay there 3 nights a week. I have worked here for two years now and would have moved here but the cost of living is outrageous due to the oil field boom. For example, a one bedroom apartment is going for 2700 dollars if you are lucky to find one, houses are about 100k more than the town I live in.

  I was offered the job by my friend, who is the CIO of the hospital. They had been without a network/server guy for 5 years, and you could tell that when you got there. Most of the domain building had been done by either the CIO or the intern over those 5 years. The network was in shambles, daisy-chained hubs, telnet everywhere, no security of any kind. No servers had been patched, no code upgrades on network gear, 100 meg ethernet uplinks to the core...the list goes on.

In my time here, I have rebuilt most of the virtual infrastructure, domains and domain controllers, all the GPO's and drive mappings, updated servers or migrated everything to 2008 server (which so far is all that is approved for some of the electronic medical record software), patched/fixed/rebuilt just about every server. Fixed the LDAP issues, implemented and scheduled/tested/tested backups, rebuilt the SAN, implemented and installed centralized antivirus, and compiled documentation for everything. I have also replaced switches, fixed spanning tree, upgraded code on every switch from the access layer to core, upgraded code and rebuilt every vpn on the firewall, implemented SSH across the board and have been in the middle of building a RADIUS server to provide another layer of protection.

  I have also designed and have been in the middle of a VOIP system install, core switch and firewall install, and installed and provided help on implementing a VDI solution for our clinics utilizing Citrix and Wyse thin clients.

  I have been making $25 dollars an hour, which had prompted me to ask for a raise and requested the ability to work from home a few days a month to alleviate all the driving and the cost of paying rent to stay at a house here in town. I pay 200 a month to rent a room and I have to cook for the lady that owns the house occasionally. The board turned down my bosses request for a raise as well as the remote work due to a hospital being a ""people based organization"". 

I recently got married as well, so all of the above started my look for a new job. I had very little luck, I got a call from my prior place of work and interviewed three times, but the manager who I had worked with prior ended up quitting after the second interview and I think that bombed my chances. A friend heard that I was looking and asked for my resume, and within 3 hours of me sending it to her I had an interview.
The new position is somewhat out of my normal skill set, it is primarily software support for the US Department of Agriculture, in a contract position.

 I normally wouldn't consider a contract position but they have held the contract for 9 years so far and it seems really steady. I think one of the reasons they wanted to hire me was due to being prior military, I have held security clearances and am pretty familiar with a wide variety of systems and can interface with the different teams they have.

The job has less time off, is within 30 min drive and I got a 9k raise. The time off is less but they get all federal holidays off as well, where the old job you had to take PTO to get those.

To those looking, persistence pays off, but taking the time to build contacts and stay in touch with people you work with can pay off more. If anyone has any other questions I would be happy to answer them. I realize this is a rather long post but I hope it gives some of you hope who have been looking for a while.  "
2ftqlv,46,2014-09-08,Never assume the client knows anything,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ftqlv/never_assume_the_client_knows_anything/,"Alright /r/talesfromtechsupport, this one came in just a few minutes ago while my office was having a lunch meeting. It took place on the phone, so I only heard half the conversation, but it's pretty obvious what was being said. Please forgive my story-telling, it's my first post.

So we're all eating Five Guys (Aww yiss, business lunch expenses) sitting around the conference table watching ESPN, when a call comes through. J has a laptop with him and a headset, just in case someone decides to interrupt our important meeting. About 3/4 through eating, we get a call. J picks up it ""(Business name) this is J)"".

He then glares at G and flips him off.

&gt; G: What'd I do?

&gt; J: It's Older Gentleman (OG)

So we continue on with our lunch while J tries to troubleshoot the problems OG is having

&gt; J: Ok, so your keyboard isn't working?

More back and forth. We mostly tune out until:

&gt; J: Wait, are there any green lights on your keyboard?

We all kind of smirk

&gt; J: No no, your *actual* keyboard

What else would he be trying?

&gt; J: Ok you're going to have to check if your keyboard is plugged in

Ohlawd.jpeg

&gt; J: That's your network cable. That allows you to have internet.

&gt; J: Just trace the cable from the keyboard, to the back of your computer. Make sure it's plugged in

&gt; J: No just take the keyboard, and find the other end of the cable.

J covers the mouthpiece on his headset and looks at us.

&gt; J: -Sighs- He just unplugged his power cable

After we all stop giggling, I (Being new to the company) ask ""This is the older guy from (Company), right?"". They tell me yes. I had met him a few times. We have 4 different regular techs, plus me, though I'm not exactly a tech. Every tech is J2 (Not J from the story, he's the helpdesk manager) to OG. Doesn't matter if you're taller, short, skinnier, whatever. If you're a tech, you're J2.

Anyways, I ask the table what that company does, as we manage something like 80 companies. Apparently they're recruitment consultants. Ok, that's cool. ""So what exactly does OG do for them?"" I get a ""We're not really sure yet"" followed by ""He just kind of shows up"". Well then.

I don't have too much interaction with the client's right now. I started as an intern, they liked me so I got hired on and I do quality control and monitor the helpdesk and dashboard while they train me in all things computers. Hopefully I will have more stories to come!"
2fu750,2,2014-09-08,Computer repair store / IT intern training,[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2fu750/computer_repair_store_it_intern_training/,"Hello to all I'm relatively new to reddit and just discovered /r/Startups to create this post so forgive me if I leave information out or the format is bad. 

Down to business!

I have a mall type location that will allow me to run a computer (electronics) repair shop out of it with no monthly overhead. The contract would be structured so that a percentage of the income goes to the mall. The other kicker here is that it wouldn't actually be a store but a kiosk whose size is up for debate. I lobbied for a store but lost out to franchises.

My questions here are (A) is this viable? with no store just (B) how secure can we make customers equipment? Once that issue is addressed (C) how small of a footprint can this be accomplished in while accommodating work bench requirements? 

But those are the easy/boring questions, this is where it gets weird. I would like to set this up as a non profit, outside of the initial equipment investment this won't cost me much. The reason being is I would like all of the employees to be interns. The idea here is to create a community where we can offer a service at an unbeatable price while giving people a chance to get experience or get back on their feet. We would pay the interns by paying for Certification exams and Training (also how much can we give back to the interns dollar wise? since there is no monthly overhead and I can't guarantee any pay personally but would like to comp interns somehow what are our options here).  Initially we would start as just computer/cell phone/tablet/video game repairs but eventually I would like to offer IT services to small businesses which is where getting the entry level experience is so difficult to obtain.

Finally if all of the above seems logical and I'm sure theres a million small details to hash out, is it possible to make this non-profit somehow owned by the Reddit community? The power of US is going to be infinitely stronger than just me and I honestly don't intend on staying around this project for too long. 

Thank you to all who read this and please do leave criticism/thoughts I would love to fine tune this and turn it into a living breathing organism that benefits people and allows them to get jobs."

But I didnt stop there, i needed an htpc for the living room so i got a hold of an old free computer with a core 2 duo, slapped in a power supply and had it set up for a while then i decided id like a little more horsepower to host a nas for the house as well as place some games so after christmas i bought a GTX760 from evga's b stock and put my old 650 in the htpc until spring break I saw a great deal on a motherboard, cpu and HDD over in /r/hardwareswap and decided to upgrade the htpc so i could really have some power. 

Here's the spec on my HTPC you'll notice that nothing in this build is new from the factory except the ram, I'm pretty conscious about my spending. Everything here either came from /r/hardwareswap or downgraded from my desktop(i found a good deal on the refurbed ssd on newegg one day).  I ended finding a sweet deal on an evga power supply on newegg, they're about the only thing i wont buy used or refurbished.

I dont have any pictures of my htpc because its uninspiring and its now in the same case as my desktop was

for my birthday I got a Corsair 200r and a Crucial 128gb solid state. and about the same time i found a 24"" benq on woot for about $150 and made the upgrade to 1080p

oh sweet jesus it was so fast i bought another ssd off Hardwareswap for $45, one of them pny drives, i have a dual boot linux/windows setup and my linux system was faster until i got a solid state and 128 aint big enough for the both of em. so two it is.

I had an intership this summer and made some good money to finance my now very expensive hobby, so i bought a H80i and CM Trigger Cherry mx Blue keyboard. I got some sleeved cables after my attempt at sleeving failed which is ironic because my internship was indirect contact with molex and i even had all the right tools but I'll be damned if i couldnt get the wires out of evga's implementation of the mini fit jr plugs.

I picked up a couple fans and started overclocking and hit 4.7ghz on my FX- 6300 stable at about 1.46Volts ran cool during games but the H80i isnt the best cooler out there, i know that now, looks good though...
just before school started i decided my two monitors werent doing to for me so i found another 24"" benq for $105 on ebay and bought a tripple monitor stand on amazon. and then today i got an 8350 and made the upgrade. I decided i needed a little more horse power for this year so i could procrastinate and reddit faster. 

and here it sits today

2fvtw8,0,2014-09-09,Engineering internship with fluctuating GPA (2.8-3.1) and no experience.,yxsilentxy,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2fvtw8/engineering_internship_with_fluctuating_gpa_2831/,"Hello all. First and foremost I'd like to thank you for your time in reading this. I realize this question has been asked many times and have been searching for many topics related to this and am trying to amalgamate every response to something related to me, but I want to ask this question from my personal perspective. Also am terribly sorry if this post is more relevant in another sub reddit. In that case can someone point me to a better reddit (askengineering/engineeringstudents maybe?)

I'm a 3rd year electrical engineering student at UCSD, and I will begin to apply to internships this fall in hopes of receiving one in the summer or some period before I graduate. The last two years I've been taking summer school to stay relevant in hopes of graduating in 4 years, but my GPA has been fluctuating around the 3.0 area (some quarters I received 3.3/3.4 and some quarters I've received 2.66 and even 2.4). I realize that college is one of the most important events I'll have in my life as it'll set me up from the rest of my life but I just am struggling to keep my GPA high. I've never received a C in high school but ever since college I feel like the importance I've put in college has dropped. It's not that I don't care, but I have a hard time studying and trying to grab that A (even though I've gotten a fair share of A/B in my engineering classes). I'm just worried that I'll be screwed for job outlooks because my GPA is so low. 

I have no work experience, but I am in the school's track team and most of my time goes towards training/competing. I'll hold a captain position this year/next year but I'm not sure if this is even relevant in the professional world. 

What can I do to attempt for an internship besides applying like crazy? I'm ready to explain why my GPA is so low as the GPA does not reflect my personal capabilities. I just don't want to be stuck as that kid that didn't fit in in college. 

Thanks."
2fvu1y,55,2014-09-09,I've been trying for almost two years to get into a side-project and start programming for fun but I haven't been able to get myself to do it. It's making me feel really bad about myself as a professional and inadequate because so many jobs want to hear about personal projects. Any advice?,sealite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fvu1y/ive_been_trying_for_almost_two_years_to_get_into/,"I picked up programming just under two years ago when I decided to major in CS. I like problem solving, computers and traveling, CS is a great field for me because I do enjoy most programming I do and also at some point in my career I can do free-lance work or work remotely and travel a bit.

I go to a school with a highly regarded CS program and I'm an above average student. I had an internship this past summer at Cisco and my manager had good things to say and was really pleased with the work I did. I feel like I won't be a ""true programmer"" until I have a few projects under my belt, at least this is the notion I get from job applications and some people I've talked to.

Since I decided to major in CS I've tried out a few different side projects. I've always enjoyed the time I spent working on them but eventually I just run out of steam and stop working on them, largely because I don't feel like programming in my free time when I do it all day for work or school.

Part of my problem is I'm interested in almost all areas of programming towards the application level and I can't ever decide on what I'm going to specialize in. I know I want it to be an area that's easier to find contracting work in.

I'm interested in working at start ups and more web-orientated companies like Yahoo, Salesforce, LinkedIn, ect. As I sort through applications for internships/coops most of the companies or startups I'm interested in want to see some personal projects so I really feel like I need to complete something.

Does anyone have any advice, or has anyone been here before? I want to figure out how to find what I should specialize in and how I can get myself to actually complete a project outside of work or school.

Thanks!"

I graduated from Michigan State University in 2012 with a degree in political science. I have had four internships now - government relations for Goodwill, a lobbying firm, campaigning for multiple congressional candidates, and campaigning for multiple state level candidates. I'm now tracking and analyzing political media spending for a very well respected political media firm. 

The problem that I'm having is that my current job is only until the election in November. After that, I have to find a new job. I had been unemployed for a while and hated every second of it so I don't want to go through that again. 

Since the campaign jobs will all be over, I'm struggling to figure out what to do next. I want to stay in politics but I am not entirely sure what options are out there for me. For anyone who works/has knowledge of politics, where should I be looking that I haven't thought of yet? Eventually I want to be a lobbyist but I'm only 24 and I know that it won't happen for a few more years at the least.

2fwrvn,3,2014-09-09,Any websites that show what percentage of the IT market is based on what ? Stats for recent ups and downs ?,kevhart,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2fwrvn/any_websites_that_show_what_percentage_of_the_it/,"Hiya, I am back again with another question....sorry if this is turning out to be a monthly thing.


I had been researching different IT fields lately. Both for my own curiosity, to be better informed, and to be able to help some of my siblings and cousins when they graduate in the near future.



I have been thinking that something like a website must exist somewhere that shows what IT field leads to where, from entry level to architecht/lead role/manager levels. 



It would be especially helpful for people like me who are getting out of college/just graduated  with Networking/IT/CS degrees and are trying to get a broader picture of the entire IT field. 


I had to look at Storage Admin jobs, Vmware Admin jobs and Database Admin jobs  ....and that was all just under the umbrella of Sysadmin job roles that I realized later had to be reached through a Jr. Sysadmin role... ..before realizing this I had no idea I had to start with HelpDesk positions and I was basically looking and applying at IT positions that are 2 years to 4/5 years (Storage Admin for example) away from my reach.

-- -

I still have QA (Quality Assurance), Business Analyst, Business Intelligence (Informatica/ Ab Initio) and Database Developer roles to look at and ""research"" how to get into, what paths are available to take for each of them etc.

- - - There were a couple companies at a career fair near where I live that were touting they can give training courses for the above listed IT fields at a reduced price. And I want to know more about all of these technologies before attempting them.


For some reason I had assumed most IT jobs had the same method of hiring, for example, a lot of my college friends got hired straight after their senior year as Software Developers, and they usually only had 6 months or 1 year of programming internships.


I think that gave me the impression that other IT fields also work the same way , so after graduation I had taken a course on SAN Storage...thinking I would become a Storage Admin within 3 months....  turns out without proper Sysadmin experience I am not hireable for this role. 

I want to avoid this kind of situations in the future, where I do something without proper research and am then disappointed that I cannot get into that field. 

- - - 

Surely there is a website somewhere that explains all these things with the latest updates on what IT field requires what kind of steps, certs and experience, and what field is booming and what is slumping ? I have mostly read Wikipedia and did other Google searches to read answers from forums. But there is no one website with comprehensive information that I found.


Anything with flowcharts, piecharts, other stats will also be very helpful.


Thanks for reading reddit, any useful information, links or comments will be greatly appreciated.



**TLDR** : any website that explains each IT field and sub-field properly, with current job trends in them.

2fxcq5,0,2014-09-09,"Recent (2014) 4year college graduate, was hired by a very special/unique Precious Metals Firm in LA, and 5 weeks later (yesterday) i was fired, was this me or them? and for no reason. (Finance/Investment Major) also secretly a hedgefund role as well...",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2fxcq5/recent_2014_4year_college_graduate_was_hired_by_a/,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I recently got fired from my first job out of college after 5 weeks. This actually happened a yesterday at 3pm, so I'm in the whole crying in bed phase. I do not want to get another job. I had over 30+ job offers after graduation. I moved to California because I was from the South born and raised and school. I was hired by the CEO of a company who is rated prestigiously, and was hired under special conditions. (1 indian guys and 1 white guy - both age 40+) I am 22 years old. I'm obviously sad, but I want to move on and learn from this nightmare.
 
Yesterday (Monday, exactly 5 full weeks, 25 days), the Sales Manager (someone the CEO told me not to listen to but obvious/common sense you listen to this guy as he is a really smart, badass, $$making machine) called me into his office, told me he has to let me go. I asked why, and he said it had to do with the 2 guys I was working with (Indian &amp; White dude), so I asked what is it that I have done, I can't be fired I was promised 60 days to prove myself, and I need a REAL reason. He said the two guys said its performance-related and the leads I have given the white guy (sits next to be everyday) have not  been good.

the CEO/founder (small business But Big $$$ wise (Gold and Silver firm) and commodities hedgefund startup which is what i was brought in for) called me into his office on the Friday of the first week, asked me how I was doing, and informed me that I will not be fired, not too worry, and I am here on a special path and I am not here for what any of the other guys in the room are here for. 

I was thrown into this sales role like no one could imagine. Literally wolf of wall street style - then thrown right back out. My assignments were 2 qualified leads a week for 1 month, and to bring in 100k by the 2nd month. (60 Days) or I was fired. 

They all 3 hired me ( CEO, indian, white, ) - they all know i knew about futures, trading, commodities, even more finance than them in my opinion. As I have a really good education from my school in finance. And I started day trading 6 months before graduation. So I have a lot for my age compared to most.

They told me they liked that I had never sold anything before, and they were going to train me for 4 weeks. And if I didn't perform They would fire me. I understood this deeply. The problem is after the 2nd week, I saw the Indian guy (who would bring me into conference room and make me take notes on a specific sales pitch to memorize &amp; rebuttles with calling people)

I told him that it was my first time working with sales, and yes, I had been a little confused, but it was all apart of the learning curve, and I've been getting more and more familiar with the script and by yesterday i've been so happy because I finally nailed it and got it down and can finally stop stuttering on the phone. I had dialed more than i have any day at work, even though i left 2 hours early as I was fired. I and white guy (guy I'm working for/with - my closer - i was a fronter). The closer - white guy - has told me positive things about my performance everyday, while also saying as long as you are trying there are no worries and stuff almost every single day... the indian guy (I have not seen or talked to in 2 weeks at minimum)

I've been on my own mostly for these last few weeks... debugging and backtracking any errors I had on my own. Anything that I did struggle with or needed help walking through, it was because it was my first time doing it... I had turned the corner...
 
We (me and the two other guys I started with) had a one week training, and then we started. Out of our cohort, I was the only one put on this special path this very first week (when I was fired by Sales Manager, I was told that ""(my name) the commodity broker business isn't for you)"". I just wish I was given a fair shake and had the opportunity to learn and get familiar like the other guys had. I was told by the CEO to ONLY LISTEN to the white &amp; indian guy. So i fought for my job back. Called the CEO and Sales Manager and they both said it was a decision already made and they weren't the ones deciding it was the 2 other guys. 

So i didn't have the indian guys # (He has been the biggest doucher to me, always saying i am so young and naive, and how i am not taking this seriously). Anyways I called the white guy - because obviously there is some confusion here, he texted me back and said I will call you tomorrow as they told me to wait when the Boss/Sales Manager both told me to talk to them. (White guy had to been talking shit behind my back, but the crazy part is we got along so well, so many similar interests, I know he had to of enjoyed sitting by me. I would call and learn from each mistake every single day working my ASS OFF. I was even there 1-2 hours early everyday making my work days 10-12 hour days. 
 
Looking back, sure I was asking some very basic questions (with hindsight), but it was my first time. They said I was slow picking up some of the concepts in training the first week... I personally thought training was overly simplified and we were going too fast (i.e. following the trainer without much thought of what we were doing). The other people that I talked to there... all agreed. 

I was just the only one that asked questions out loud, I asked others in the room for tips and what to say back for certain questions, all the other guys liked me, I just know this for a fact, they would always come talk to me ask how i was doing and sometimes tell me don't say ""you know"" or something like that on the last phone call. So basically, if I had kept my mouth shut and didn't ask any questions (other than to the other new guys), I'd still have a job. Maybe? - this is 1 theory
 
There was 1-2 weeks of training, But this was a 7am-8am meeting and then dial from 8am-5pm. They told me I was here to pick up these sales skills to become a broker by taking my Series 3 after 3 months and then joining a part of their HedgeFund. I had already made after 3 weeks it seems... I had 140k set up in appointments for MY CLOSER but they were all in september (this month). And the shit part is I have gotten so much better I have set up (90k) to be brought in the next week and two all from last week ONLY!!

 
The Sales Manager also said it had to do with the Draw/my paycheck - I have only 1 paycheck so far and it was $500 (Los Angeles, btw) minimum wage and i get paid on the 10th (tomorrow) for the same amount. They never included overtime because as soon as one of my deals are closed the draw or pay I was given would be paid back by my commission... I don't even get it these guys make 20k a month but couldn't let me stay for 3 more weeks to prove myself, AS PROMISED???
 
As far as I was concerned, I was doing a good job. I met all of my sprint deadlines. Yes, I was slow out of the gate, but I gotten over the hump and thought I was really understanding and picking things up.
 
I'm just in total disbelief. Being fired after 5 weeks is almost unheard of... especially if you are actually genuinely trying. I WAS TOLD THIS BY THE WHITE GUY EVEN - you will not be fired if you are dialing. AND THE CEO/OWNER - told me I WOULD NOT be fired because I was secretly going to move into the hedgefund as soon as I picked up these sales skills to help raise capital for the fund.....

 It'd take an attitude problem or sleeping on the job to be fired that quickly. I think about all of my friends and the jobs and internships they've had over the years. None of them were ever sent home after 5 weeks and made it through the entire duration (eh, maybe some confirmation bias). I'm having some doubts about myself, and that it may be me that's the problem.
 
During school projects, I'd have trouble starting projects because it took me a while to understand what it was asking, but after I fully understood the project specs, I was fine. I graduated not at the top of my class, but a 3.2GPA with the hardest major (known for business school too) not because I was overly smart but because I had good time management, worked very hard.
 
I want to accept some accountability, but wtf does this sound like? Or is this just the exception and I got unlucky? What kind of company invests all of this money in background checks and training lessons to fire them this quickly? I'm just searching for some answers.

Indian guy - said i had 60 days to bring in 100k
(I already have appts fronted totaling 240k) in total last 14 days. 
- was going to quiz me on week 3 (he never did)
-he was always in the back doing his trading commodities 
- never spoke to me again then was sick and out for a week
White guy - sits by me everyday and I always did exactly what he said
- told me I was progressing and he was always here for me
(He was a major part in my decision of being fired, so I don't get it) 
(He also is a scumbag though...I mean the whole room was....sleezy sales people)
 THESE 2 were the ONLY people related to the decision to FIRE ME. i just do not get it.


I secretly hope ""performance related"" was just a front, and they fired me for some other reason. It can't be over-hiring, because my friend/co-worker I became friends with came over after work and said 2 other guys got fired today too, this guy is my age (hired same day as me, I was told by white guy that is a poor kid trying to make money being a sleazy salesman and I was not on that path, I was here for a different reason and to listen to them 2 only. 

This is the company that hires &amp; fires all the time...But I was here to be brought into the hedgefund which he is initially in the process of really opening it or w/e making it bigger (currently only 3 traders/max 5 employees) He told me he would not bring in over 10 people to the fund.

I suffered so much, been having personal problems, but focused completely on what they said and dumped my whole life into this job. But the other reasons... that's me... that's my personality and learning styles. I can't just change that.
 
Give it to me straight. Is it me reddit?

Are they trying to prevent me from gaining my 240k I'm pulling in this month?? since i already shared them with the closer??

- what do i do now.

I'm in Los Angeles. 22 years old. I now have really amazing phone skills, which I am happy for, but it does not make sense, because I love the skills now, and I can still use them anywhere else in life, but what was the reason??

I needed to make money. I need to pay my rent, my car bills, credit cards,
- they told me i would be making 10k-15k by 60 days 
- they told me their goal was to have me go home at Xmas and tell my parents I was making money to support myself
- I have been able to achieve what the CEO/Owner told me took him 1 year to be able to front - in 1 month.

what the fuck. help me"

So, I've been working at Wal-Mart for the past year and absolutely hate it. I feel like I'm losing my time the more I'm in that place. I got my BA in Asian Studies last January and haven't been having much luck with finding a job.

I'm thinking of going back and getting my BS in Computer Science. I used to be a Computer Science major and took two semesters of classes before switching majors (my stupid reasoning was that I would graduate faster). I know I can do self-study (which I have been doing) and show off projects to potential employers, but the way I see it is either:

* Continue to slave away at Wal-Mart while I bend over backwards trying to convince employers that I'm worth hiring with a BA in a Liberal Arts field.

OR

* Go back to school and get a decent education, build up my network through classmates and professors, take an internship, and quit my job at Wal-Mart (since commuting from school to Wal-Mart will be out of the question).

I'm thinking of taking 5 courses a semester and also taking classes during the Winter and Summer breaks so I can graduate as quickly as possible. Since I already have the General Education requirements done, all I'd have to focus on are the CIS classes.

However, if there's an even faster way that involves me quitting my job at Wal-Mart, I'd love to hear it.

TL;DR: I have a BA in Asian Studies and hate my job at Wal-Mart. Should I go back for a BS (and quit my job) or is there a much faster route that'll also involve me quitting my job ASAP?"

I have had some web Dev  experience in highschool and in college java  , JavaScript,python and C. When I got to my first day he told me I would need to learn cold fusion (8) ad that its what they use to build applications on webpages. I have had a slightly hard time adjusting. Some of the things are really straightforward but there are almost no comments in the code base! I feel expected to know all their UDF s like the back of my hand in the first couple of weeks.  Combined with alot of odd syntax in cf and low pay (min. Wage) I am not sure I should continue. Also I have read the cf can pidegon hole you is this true ? Should I be concerned /  leave?
Tl;Dr I am feeling unsure about my first programming job in cold fusion."

My GPA is 2.556 at the moment, (it's actually been going up lately each semester). I'm hoping by the time I graduate it'll be at least 3.0, so I'm looking into two minors before I graduate as part of a resume 'buffer'. The two minors are...

Computer Science - I'm actually interested in this minor and want to learn more about it.

Math - Basically I have to take one additional class and this minor is already applied, so whatever.

Do minors in your opinion matter when looking for jobs? Do they work as resume fillers that show more discipline. Based on my earlier years and my poor GPA, I worry about job opportunities. If I graduate with a 3.0, the two minors, and hopefully one internship experience, will the two minors really do much if anything at all? I also don't work for any, I am self-employed. I have a business license and I do private tutoring, does the fact that I own/run my own 'business' look any better on a resume than if I worked for someone else and followed orders?"

Can you help me find a company that meets some of the following criteria:

* Near a big city, either in Ontario (GTA), British Columbia (Vancouver area), or somewhere in the United States (e.g. Houston in Texas)
* Involves programming/coding
* Does not involve doing fieldwork or visiting machine shops
* Traveling or being deployed to other countries is a big plus

I decided to go to my local community college and get an associates there before transferring back which I will have done by the end of this year(current GPA 3.5). Well I have a few questions regarding this field. 

* When should I start looking for an internship? 

* Does the college you major from have a high impact when it comes to hiring(as in would it be better to go to a school more known for their tech than lets say nursing etc)?

* Can I do anything with my associates degree(looking for an entry level job, etc)?

* Any tips that will help me prepare for it? 

I haven't really though about what I wanted to do with my degree once I get it, but I do know that if I get a job in the Computer Science field, that I will enjoy it.

Oh and I live in New Jersey, if there are any people that know of better colleges or can share their experience with other colleges they went to that would help as well. I dont have the money to go half way across the country but im reconsidering returning to Rutgers mainly because its not a school thats known for its computer science field but more for its research and pharmaceuticals.

I've always heard that you look for summer internships in the winter and first part of your spring semester, but recently I was told that *everyone* will be recruiting *now* and if I don't get on top of this career fair I *will not* be able to get an internship for the summer. This is so overwhelming, since I haven't been preparing at all...I don't have a good resume, I don't have a LinkedIn, I haven't done any side projects, I have no clue how to talk to recruiters, and I'm probably just a terrible candidate all around. I have no clue if I have the skills these people will be looking for – I've heard some very intimidating things. I've been trying and failing at dealing with depression and it's hard enough for me to get out of bed and to classes and be social most days, let alone be presentable and market myself and all that stuff.

How badly did I fuck this up? I don't think I have enough time to prepare, especially with schoolwork/other obligations, and since this is the last summer I have to do internships (especially a big tech company internship) I'm scared I'm already shooting myself in the foot for jobs after college *now*.

(Finance/Investment Major) also secretly a hedgefund role as well...",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2fyrog/recent_2014_4year_college_graduate_was_hired_by_a/,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I recently got fired from my first job out of college after 5 weeks. This actually happened a yesterday at 3pm, so I'm in the whole crying in bed phase. I do not want to get another job. I had over 30+ job offers after graduation. I moved to California because I was from the South born and raised and school. I was hired by the CEO of a company who is rated prestigiously, and was hired under special conditions. (1 indian guys and 1 white guy - both age 40+) I am 22 years old. I'm obviously sad, but I want to move on and learn from this nightmare.

(NO RACISM INTENDED - just being vague so I am not banned)

Yesterday (Monday, exactly 5 full weeks, 25 days), the Sales Manager (someone the CEO told me not to listen to but obvious/common sense you listen to this guy as he is a really smart, badass, $$making machine) called me into his office, told me he has to let me go. I asked why, and he said it had to do with the 2 guys I was working with (Indian &amp; White dude), so I asked what is it that I have done, I can't be fired I was promised 60 days to prove myself, and I need a REAL reason. He said the two guys said its performance-related and the leads I have given the white guy (sits next to be everyday) have not been good.


the CEO/founder (small business But Big $$$ wise (Gold and Silver firm) and commodities hedgefund startup which is what i was brought in for) called me into his office on the Friday of the first week, asked me how I was doing, and informed me that I will not be fired, not too worry, and I am here on a special path and I am not here for what any of the other guys in the room are here for.
I was thrown into this sales role like no one could imagine. Literally wolf of wall street style - then thrown right back out. My assignments were 2 qualified leads a week for 1 month, and to bring in 100k by the 2nd month. (60 Days) or I was fired.


They all 3 hired me ( CEO, indian, white, ) - they all know i knew about futures, trading, commodities, even more finance than them in my opinion. As I have a really good education from my school in finance. And I started day trading 6 months before graduation. So I have a lot for my age compared to most.
They told me they liked that I had never sold anything before, and they were going to train me for 4 weeks. And if I didn't perform They would fire me. I understood this deeply. The problem is after the 2nd week, I saw the Indian guy (who would bring me into conference room and make me take notes on a specific sales pitch to memorize &amp; rebuttles with calling people)


I told him that it was my first time working with sales, and yes, I had been a little confused, but it was all apart of the learning curve, and I've been getting more and more familiar with the script and by yesterday i've been so happy because I finally nailed it and got it down and can finally stop stuttering on the phone. I had dialed more than i have any day at work, even though i left 2 hours early as I was fired. I and white guy (guy I'm working for/with - my closer - i was a fronter). The closer - white guy - has told me positive things about my performance everyday, while also saying as long as you are trying there are no worries and stuff almost every single day... the indian guy (I have not seen or talked to in 2 weeks at minimum)


I've been on my own mostly for these last few weeks... debugging and backtracking any errors I had on my own. Anything that I did struggle with or needed help walking through, it was because it was my first time doing it... I had turned the corner...
We (me and the two other guys I started with) had a one week training, and then we started. Out of our cohort, I was the only one put on this special path this very first week (when I was fired by Sales Manager, I was told that ""(my name) the commodity broker business isn't for you)"". I just wish I was given a fair shake and had the opportunity to learn and get familiar like the other guys had. I was told by the CEO to ONLY LISTEN to the white &amp; indian guy. So i fought for my job back. Called the CEO and Sales Manager and they both said it was a decision already made and they weren't the ones deciding it was the 2 other guys.


So i didn't have the indian guys # (He has been the biggest doucher to me, always saying i am so young and naive, and how i am not taking this seriously). Anyways I called the white guy - because obviously there is some confusion here, he texted me back and said I will call you tomorrow as they told me to wait when the Boss/Sales Manager both told me to talk to them. (White guy had to been talking shit behind my back, but the crazy part is we got along so well, so many similar interests, I know he had to of enjoyed sitting by me. I would call and learn from each mistake every single day working my ASS OFF. I was even there 1-2 hours early everyday making my work days 10-12 hour days.


Looking back, sure I was asking some very basic questions (with hindsight), but it was my first time. They said I was slow picking up some of the concepts in training the first week... I personally thought training was overly simplified and we were going too fast (i.e. following the trainer without much thought of what we were doing). The other people that I talked to there... all agreed.


I was just the only one that asked questions out loud, I asked others in the room for tips and what to say back for certain questions, all the other guys liked me, I just know this for a fact, they would always come talk to me ask how i was doing and sometimes tell me don't say ""you know"" or something like that on the last phone call. So basically, if I had kept my mouth shut and didn't ask any questions (other than to the other new guys), I'd still have a job. Maybe? - this is 1 theory


There was 1-2 weeks of training, But this was a 7am-8am meeting and then dial from 8am-5pm. They told me I was here to pick up these sales skills to become a broker by taking my Series 3 after 3 months and then joining a part of their HedgeFund. I had already made after 3 weeks it seems... I had 140k set up in appointments for MY CLOSER but they were all in september (this month). And the shit part is I have gotten so much better I have set up (90k) to be brought in the next week and two all from last week ONLY!!


The Sales Manager also said it had to do with the Draw/my paycheck - I have only 1 paycheck so far and it was $500 (Los Angeles, btw) minimum wage and i get paid on the 10th (tomorrow) for the same amount. They never included overtime because as soon as one of my deals are closed the draw or pay I was given would be paid back by my commission... I don't even get it these guys make 20k a month but couldn't let me stay for 3 more weeks to prove myself, AS PROMISED???
As far as I was concerned, I was doing a good job. I met all of my sprint deadlines. Yes, I was slow out of the gate, but I gotten over the hump and thought I was really understanding and picking things up.
I'm just in total disbelief. Being fired after 5 weeks is almost unheard of... especially if you are actually genuinely trying. I WAS TOLD THIS BY THE WHITE GUY EVEN - you will not be fired if you are dialing. AND THE CEO/OWNER - told me I WOULD NOT be fired because I was secretly going to move into the hedgefund as soon as I picked up these sales skills to help raise capital for the fund.....
It'd take an attitude problem or sleeping on the job to be fired that quickly. I think about all of my friends and the jobs and internships they've had over the years. None of them were ever sent home after 5 weeks and made it through the entire duration (eh, maybe some confirmation bias). I'm having some doubts about myself, and that it may be me that's the problem.

During school projects, I'd have trouble starting projects because it took me a while to understand what it was asking, but after I fully understood the project specs, I was fine. I graduated not at the top of my class, but a 3.2GPA with the hardest major (known for business school too) not because I was overly smart but because I had good time management, worked very hard.
I want to accept some accountability, but wtf does this sound like? Or is this just the exception and I got unlucky? What kind of company invests all of this money in background checks and training lessons to fire them this quickly? I'm just searching for some answers.

Indian guy - said i had 60 days to bring in 100k (I already have appts fronted totaling 240k) in total last 14 days. - was going to quiz me on week 3 (he never did) -he was always in the back doing his trading commodities - never spoke to me again then was sick and out for a week White guy - sits by me everyday and I always did exactly what he said - told me I was progressing and he was always here for me (He was a major part in my decision of being fired, so I don't get it) (He also is a scumbag though...I mean the whole room was....sleezy sales people) THESE 2 were the ONLY people related to the decision to FIRE ME. i just do not get it.

I secretly hope ""performance related"" was just a front, and they fired me for some other reason. It can't be over-hiring, because my friend/co-worker I became friends with came over after work and said 2 other guys got fired today too, this guy is my age (hired same day as me, I was told by white guy that is a poor kid trying to make money being a sleazy salesman and I was not on that path, I was here for a different reason and to listen to them 2 only.

This is the company that hires &amp; fires all the time...But I was here to be brought into the hedgefund which he is initially in the process of really opening it or w/e making it bigger (currently only 3 traders/max 5 employees) He told me he would not bring in over 10 people to the fund.
I suffered so much, been having personal problems, but focused completely on what they said and dumped my whole life into this job. But the other reasons... that's me... that's my personality and learning styles. I can't just change that.

Give it to me straight. Is it me reddit?
Are they trying to prevent me from gaining my 240k I'm pulling in this month?? since i already shared them with the closer??
what do i do now.

I'm in LA. age22. I now have really amazing phone skills, which I am happy for, but it does not make sense, because I love the skills now, and I can still use them anywhere else in life, but what was the reason??

I needed to make money. I need to pay my rent, my car bills, credit cards, - they told me i would be making 10k-15k by 60 days - they told me their goal was to have me go home at Xmas and tell my parents I was making money to support myself - I have been able to achieve what the CEO/Owner told me took him 1 year to be able to front - in 1 month.

Currently I'm dealing with a couple of job offers and I'm trying to decide what to do. 

One offer I have is in a technology consulting role at a large company. This job pays slightly less than the software engineering offer (80k versus 90k in Silicon Valley) but it is with a team that I know and would be happy to work for. They do really interesting things and do rapid prototyping on new technologies. I would be programming for them and essentially doing software engineering with a mix of other things. My issue here is that I'm wondering if I take this job if I will have a hard time moving into a strictly software engineering job at another company later if I choose to. I'm not sure that I want to be in consulting, but I really like the team and the projects they work on and I think I would be happy working there. 

On the other hand, with the software engineering role (also at a large company) I wouldn't know what team I'd be working with until right before I get there next year. It is unlikely to be a very interesting role based on my experience in the engineering department at this company this past summer for an internship. But it would be in software engineering and that is what I've been planning on doing.

What I really want is more time to consider other opportunities, but right now I have a deadline of Sept. 28th for at least one of the offers.

Basically, will taking a technology consulting role (where I'll still be programming and working with cool technologies) limit my opportunities in terms of doing software engineering for a different company down the road?

Any opinions on this would be great!

Ok, so if that title was a little confusing, let me try and explain it better. In college, I received a BA in psychology from a 4 year accredited university. I graduated last May. Straight from college, I was able to get a full-time job with my local county government in their Transportation division (I worked there as an intern during school, to solely make money, which turned into a full-time job once I graduated). I took the job straight after graduating because I wanted to start making money ASAP, so I could move out, buy a house, start my adult life basically. 

Anyways, I want to take my career into a different direction and that being Cyber Security/ Information Security, etc. The thing is, I have no formal education in the matter and all I have is self taught knowledge, at the moment. I am studying to get my A+ certification, which I should have by the end of October of this year, and from there I will start looking into other certs (Network+, Security+, CEH, CISSP). Along with those certifications and self-teaching, I have joined multiple organizations based in the Cyber Security field in hopes to build connections and meet individuals in the industry. I have also planned to attend conventions and other events to help broaden my experience in the field. 

Now to the point of my post (sorry about that, lol) how do I angle my resume to help me get an IT job/cyber security job? I don't have any of the certifications YET, butttttt I am studying to get them in the future and I will not stop until I have them. I don't have any formal education either, so how do I put that on my resume? There is an IT job opening in my local county government that I want to apply for, but I need to tailor my resume so that it looks good for the job.

I would give you an example of my resume, but I am at work and Imgur.com is blocked sadly. I can provide one when I get home from work later on if anyone needs.

I love writing code, specifically I want to be a web developer but I have noticed that majoring in Computer Science, at least in my college, you are taught Java and courses mainly focus on the theory of Computer Science.

That aspect absolutely crushes me because I have practically no interest in field of Computer Science.

The last couple of days I have spent hours just thinking about dropping out and trying to start my career in web development. Perhaps find an institution that focuses on web development. 

This summer I had a great internship at a local company and got paid fairly well ($22/hour and they are interested in having me work part-time), and I have worked on a lot of personal projects and some of them have gotten pretty complex so I definitely know I enjoy web development.

I just can't stand learning something I have little interest in... What are my options?

**TL;DR:** Can't stand learning about Java and the theory of Computer Science when my main interest is web development."
2g1i05,37,2014-09-10,Why do people make it seem like getting a Software Development job is easy?,R0settaSt0ned,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2g1i05/why_do_people_make_it_seem_like_getting_a/,"I must live on different planet than everyone in /r/cscareerquestions. I see so many people saying things like, ""*Yea, just taught myself C++ for a couple months and then got a 85k/yr job*."" I comb all the major job boards every day and I've never seen a software development job that is open for people with such limited professional experience. 99% of SDE jobs I've seen explicitly require Mid- or Sr-level experience. The 1% that are Jr-level (in the real sense of the word ... I'm not talking about ""Jr"" positions that require 5+ years industry experience in an alphabet soup of languages/libraries/methodologies) are very selective, only take a realistic look at freshly minted CS grads from top-tier schools, with high GPAs and lucrative internship experience. 

I've been looking for a ""foot in the door"" for quite some time. I realize I'm not the most competitive candidate due to not having a CS degree (I have a Math degree), but I've really gone out of my way to work on personal projects and prime my brain for the classic programming interview questions. Heck, I had 2 interviews in the past 2 weeks, in which I ***nailed*** all the technical questions, however both companies have pulled a disappearing act on me. This all seems strange considering the oft-repeated mantra about the tremendous demand for software engineers and how companies are hiring in droves.

[Who is the girl on the front of the M O O N Ep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeqeas?context=5)|Ah, I knew this question would come up. The girl on the M O O N EP is a friend of mine from high school, Madison Mckenna. She's a really really good photographer, and one of her friends, another photographer named Drew Swantak, took that picture of her. I was putting out that EP and just asked if I could use it, they said yes, Mady edited it square and did the lettering, and that was that.
 |Fun fact, I was just going to be MOON until she put the  's in there. I really liked that.
 |I wish I knew their websites so I could link them. Google them. They're good.
[I think this might be her page in case anyone is interested. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeqxbd?context=5)|That's it!
[Hey I just wanted to say I'm big fan! Warehouse has been my jam for like 2  months. I just wanted to show my support here. Guess I have to ask a question so.. I remembered reading somewhere that you don't play any instrument, so I assume you just picked up some sort of software and started tinkering with it. Which was it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeunbq?context=5)|My first piece of software was a terrible program called mixcraft that I only had a trial for. with the trial I could do everything except export, so what I would do was make a loop with a headphone cable from the headphone jack of my pc into the mic jack. Then I would record with audacity while I played it in mixcraft.
 |I soon moved on to ableton live but if you listen to [this TERRIBLE remix of tiga that I did](https://soundcloud.com/moon_music/tiga) in the beginning you can hear two clicks, that's from using that cable to do that and my probably fucking with it. That's also why there's basically no bass in that song.
[What do your parents think of your music? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeujgj?context=5)|3) Both my parents are amazing and therefor pretend to like my music. My dad has both my records even though he doesn't own a record player. They also came to my boston shows which was fucking hilarious.
[You are from Boston, play any shows or any DJ gigs in the area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckervq2?context=5)|I played a couple terrible shows in boston before I moved to LA. I'm not sure if I would play going back. There's a lot of promoters out there I would not like to work with because of how they act and treat others in the community, which in boston is very small.
[Also, I may have heard an internet rumor somewhere that you were gonna do a track with Perturbator? Got a comment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckervq2?context=5)|I was going to hang with Perturbator when I was in paris but something came up unfortunately and he had to leave the city for a while. We still want to work together but the whole paris/LA commute is a bit of an inconvenience 
[I feel that. It seems like Boston clubs can never really get their shit together. How they can book great acts in the shittiest of venues is beyond my ken.  That sucks that those plans didn't come to, would love to hear that collaboration.  Either way, can't wait to hear what's next. Ever do, or consider doing a mixtape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckes9d5?context=5)|1) The city government hates nightlife. Boston is a fucking college town. There's so many kids who want to go out and spend money in the city and have a good time, but they can't because the bars close at 2. But wait, bars closing at 2 doesn't matter, because the trains stop running at 12:30. Couple that with the nearly impossible task of getting a liquor license and you've got a recipe for a bunch of sports bars catering to older folks and no growth.
 |It's incredibly frustrating. With over 50 colleges in the area there's so much talent and audience but no way to capitalize. Try convincing a bunch of 22 year olds to come all the way to fucking cambridge on a thursday when they have to either leave at midnight or pay $40 for a cab home.
[For what it's worth, it's changing a bit. The subway now runs till 3am.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeugo4?context=5)|It's just a trial period of a year though. like the city has to 'earn it' by not fucking it up. But that's true. and it only took years and years and a new mayor to get it!
[Such truth, glad that Marty Walsh (new younger mayor of Boston\) is trying to change that. He knows that young people don't want to stay in Boston after they graduate cause the nightlife sucks.  Also the venues in Boston suck, such a shame. Get me soma dat Mideast yo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckexa4e?context=5)|Marty walsh is doing good stuff, just look what he did with together boston this year. he gets it I think.
[I really dig your music, I was introduced through Hotline Miami.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeq5lu?context=5)|Influences: Daft Punk, Justice, LCD Soundsystem, Chic, Gesaffelstein,  Cybotron, James Blake, old disco, weird baleric stuff, joeFarr, Sound Pellegrino, Ed Banger Records, Tiga and Turbo Records, idk. Lots of stuff.
[What musicians influence you in your style, and who do you listen to currently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeq5lu?context=5)|The most relevant influences to a musician I think are the people closest to them. My friends that influence me directly are dudes like Thee Mike B, Pipes, Sage Caswell, Brodinski, Louisahhh, Sir DSS, and others in the LA scene.
[Weren't you LCD Soundsystems Nephew?  Also, #hipster, I remember you from /r/futurebeats before you made it big, man! I'm glad more people got to enjoy your awesome music though!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckewg5a?context=5)|SHOUTOUT TO MY /R/FUTUREBEATS FAM, STAY ENJOYING THINGS THAT ARE TIGHT.
[How many of those have you met on the top part of the list?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckezteg?context=5)|LCD (obviously), Justice, and Gesa briefly. I've met Busy P from Ed Banger.
[Will you meet me bby.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckezzvq?context=5)|SUS.
[Is it true your uncle is James Murphy?  When you guys gonna do a jam together? big fan of you both.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeqb8k?context=5)|Yep, he's one of my 9 uncles. I don't know if we'll ever work together. It would be amazing, but nepotism is something I try very hard to avoid. I don't talk about our relationship a lot, or try to use it to get ahead. I think that puts me in a horrible light.
[Are your aware that your M.O.O.N. EP vinyl has been sold for 100 euro, plus its for sale at 50 and 100 euro right now on Discogs? Also, do you plan on keeping your vinyls/t-shirts/whatevs limited and rare? Big up from Copenhagen!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/cker41o?context=5)|Yeah that shit is hilarious to me. Wrong Island Communications is going to repress it should we're going to flood the market relatively soon. They're going to be different though, probably no art on the sleeve. So those original pressings will probably still be sought after. I hope I get really famous and those are worth shit loads in 15 years, cause I'd sell one of my copies lol.
 |Copenhagen is tight as fuck. 
[Do you think that making hotline's OST made you too popular for that, as in other people know you really just for that or do you think it was a great decision and a big step up in your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeq3gy?context=5)|Honestly it can be a little frustrating that every single thing I post online gets a comment asking 'is this going to be in the sequel??' or some other reference to the game. But, because of the game I have opportunities very few people ever get, and it's exposed me to a great fanbase. Plus the devs and team behind the game are great dudes who I'm glad I get to work with.
[How do you come up with the names for your songs? Can you give us any examples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeqvib?context=5)|My last few songs I literally ask a friend for an interesting word and call it that. My friend Ashley gave me 'Quixotic', my friend Tim gave me 'Rubber', and my warehouse bud Johnny Mons gave me 'Chlorophyll'. Omar Doom named voices but that one wasn't random. It's in the song.
[I'm sorry in advance.  Rail.  Timestamp.  Location.  Fluid.  Blank.  Mirror.  Defeating.  Source.  Manipulated.  Heartvalve.  Eternal.  Vagina.  Trap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeyms0?context=5)|I might legit use timestamp

[Who do you feel needs some more attention, music wise? Like, who are you digging right now that we should all be listening to and have probably never heard of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckesrnu?context=5)|Honestly nothing gets me more excited than friends of mine making tight music. dudes like [Sage Caswell](https://soundcloud.com/scaswell) and [Doctor Jeep](https://soundcloud.com/drjeep) are absolutely slaying right now, every time they show me stuff I'm stoked on it. 
[Have you been requested to provide music for other games other than Hotline Miami? If so, do you have permission to share a few? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeq4kh?context=5)|I had one track in an iphone game called RGB Warped. [It was this track.](https://soundcloud.com/moon_music/rubber).
 |I met a dude at E3 who's making games for the oculus who I would love to work with but nothing is real until contracts are signed.
[Do you do contracts every time you work with someone? And what would the contract entail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckf2m4k?context=5)|Yes, it's the only way to be protected. I recently didn't do one right away and got fucked out of $250 which I won't recover without a court battle. Which I would win, but would cost more than the amount.
 |Don't ever work with the Revera Corporation.
[I was introduced to your music through Hotline Miami (and I've heard that you are involved in HM2\), do you have any other plans to produce music for videogames?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeq2iu?context=5)|I don't know. I didn't set out to make music for videogames, in fact I've never technically done that. All the tracks in HLM and HLM2 were made separate from the game and then licensed. I think if I were to do a soundtrack I would want to be involved from the start and do the WHOLE score.
[Yo MOON! big fan here. I was just wondering, any idea when you're gonna have some more merchandise in stock on your website? I've been meaning to buy a shirt or anything else to support you, but I have never seen it in stock.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g1gx3/i_am_moon_an_electronic_musician_you_probably/ckeqhue?context=5)|Haha I have like 20 shirts in my apartment, I took them off the website cause too many people were ordering them and I was doing all the shipping. I'm very lazy. Now I just give them to people if they want one and come over. Very rare and exclusive limited edition.
 |I'll do more merch if I ever get an intern or someone to do it for me.

I am an electrical engineering student from a top school in the US and I got a 5 session Co-op with a global Fortune 500 company working in their computer department.

I sit on reddit all day doing nothing.  Some other interns are working on software but everything I have been given is trivial at best.  Talk to him, find this information, make these labels.  I am not learning anything.

Now, this is the first session and its only been 3 weeks.  Am I being an ungrateful brat?  Should I go to HR for more relevant work with a more active team?  Should I suck it up and just use this as a wallet and resume boost?

I do believe I have some fairly valuable experience for recruiters to look at with the internship and my current IT Consulting position at the school.

I have an interest in a consulting internship (obviously, hence I'm here :) ) and was just hoping for advice when discussing myself to recruiters or just speaking to them in general.

Some background - I'm a CS student entering my fourth (and hopefully final) year. I interned at a company near my school this past summer. The work was moderately interesting and I wouldn't mind continuing with the company full-time after I graduate. However, I also wouldn't mind exploring other options. I was given an offer to continue my internship part-time (15-20 hours/week) during the school year. However, I am worried this would cut into my time for schoolwork/personal coding/exploring the job market.

I'm wondering for anyone with prior experience interning part-time concurrently as a full-time student:

* Were you able to balance both work and school without burning out?
* How much better does a longer internship (6-12 months) look compared to a short summer internship (3 months) look on a resume?

Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you!"

I have some social anxiety. It's not debilitating or anything, I can give presentations with little or no issues. I interviewed and got a great internship this year, and feel like I'm competent at least. I just get nervous about going to places or being in situations where I'm not comfortable. I over analyze situations and dwell on the ""what ifs"".


Now, I stand a very good chance of going back to my internship for a second summer, but of course, I want to have options in case it falls through. So, I should naturally be going to career fairs, getting some networking going and all that. The problem is, I've not been to one. It's the anxiety and self consciousness that comes with going that I've just managed to avoid them entirely. I know I need to buck up and go, but every time I think about going, I make myself an excuse. Oh I'm not feeling good... oh I need to study.


Seriously, we're all engineering students here. A lot of us have our social issues or quirks. I'm sure someone is/has been in the same position I am in right now. Any advice?

2g2q3x,9,2014-09-11,Going through a mental breakdown over my future. Please give me some advice,cs_throwaway2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2g2q3x/going_through_a_mental_breakdown_over_my_future/,"I'm a CS/Math student and I just started my last year at a well known Canadian university. Starting as a Math major, in my first semester, I completely bombed everything, failing multiple courses and ended up with a 1.2 GPA. I eventually switched into CS/Math and over the next 3 years I managed to bring it back up to a 3.04 by acing the introductory CS courses (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Software Systems), taking lighter course loads, etc... This made me decide that I wanted a career in programming.

However, bringing my GPA to where it is has cost me multiple summer times. I don't have any internships to show for it, my portfolio is empty and I'm already entering my final year.

As I look through the threads on this subreddit, I only feel myself feeling more and more unqualified, and I can only worry about not getting a job when I graduate. Even though I score higher than the class average in theoretical CS classes like Data Structures and Algorithms, I feel like I suck at coding compared to the rest of my peers. I'm a complete failure...

As time winds down, I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do in my final year. Should I continue focusing on school, trying to ace my last 9 courses and learn as much as I can from them? I can theoretically bring my GPA up to a 3.3 by the end of the year, but that requires me getting an A in bunch of higher level CS courses like Databases, OS, Functional Programming which will probably take complete dedication to school with no time to spare (or at least for the first half of the year since I'm taking 5 courses this semester, but only 4 in my last one). Or should I just try to maintain a 3.0 and focus on trying to complete one or two projects before I graduate? (I don't even know where I'd start to be honest...) I'm terrified I won't have a job coming out of Uni, I just want to make the most of my last year and try to become as employable as possible. Please give me some advice...

**TL;DR** Fucked up my first semester of school, got 1.2 GPA. Got it back up to 3.04 at the cost of having no internships or projects/portfolio. What do I do in my last year of school? What do I do to become more employable?"

What I am worried about is whether my background in Sociology will affect my chances of getting a PM role in the US. 

My interviews to get these internships were all design and thinking questions, I didn't have to answer any real technical questions. I am aware that there was some luck involved with getting these internships.

Do you guys think there may be an issue? "

I'm following ICT and I'm on internship right now. The problem is really weird to the point that I and my college's can't even solve it. I've tried multiple forums, but non of them should even know the cause.

When I'm using Skype or any other VoIP program (Steam VoIP, TeamSpeak, etc) others say that I'm hissing, noisy, humming(?) and that they can't always hear me clearly.

I did some troubleshooting to the point that I sadly wasted money. The issue doesn't lie in the microphone of my Roccat Kave 5.1. I know this because I've tested it on 4 other computers, with each of them resulting in a clear voice.

I went ahead and bought a Xonar DG from ASUS, thinking it lied with my on-board audio-chip. The delivery man arrived with my package. I installed the soundcard and even got ahead and disabled the on-board audio to stop any interference. The card didn't help a bit and the issue was still there, exactly the same.

I wasted 60 dollars on the soundcard, which I sold a couple of weeks later for 20 dollar. I stopped looking for a fix, and in the months I bought a new PC Case, a Obsidian 650D. Seeing it may have lied with a grounding issue in my older case, I went ahead and tried again, but it was still there.

I went overboard and completely took apart my PC and run the parts on a table. I removed all unnecessary peripherals, including the souncard, GPU, Mouse, Keyboard, yet it is still there.

Lastly I unplugged my PSU and went upstairs to retrieve my older PSU. I plugged it in and I still got the noise/hum. I've even tried plugged my PC in on 6 other locations, including my own home and at my friends house.

I'm pretty done with solving this annoyance, so I really hope /r/Techsupport can do miracles. I've seen the live-chat do it ones before.

The other night we had some friends over, and after they left I noticed my rm had a lot on his mind, pacing up and down the living room talking a mile a minute.  The next morning I was upstairs drinking coffee, and he walked in complaining that he hadn't been able to sleep and was worried that there were rumors about him and that people had been talking about him.  A couple hours later I'm at the gym and get calls from his gf and parents, who tell me he has been calling them saying bizarre things.  I get back and he kept saying ""I'm so close to figuring it out!"", and not being responsive to anything I would say to him.  I tried to get him to watch a movie to divert his attention, but all he would do is stare up at the ceiling obviously thinking hard about something, letting out the occasional ""ohhhh"" as if he had realized something.  He eventually calmed down and was able to sleep.  The next day he was able to converse and act normally, but he kept talking about how he thought the way he was studying (he's a 4.0 student) was unethical and talked to a counselor.  That afternoon we played basketball, and he was talking about how the other interns that worked with him the past summer were spying on him for the company, making sure he was a good employee and could handle stress.  

Its probably worth noting, this guy has had a great childhood, one of the smartest people I know, and has always been very social.  He also started smoking pot a lot more recently.  

I've talked to his parents and we have agreed that he needs professional help, and he's going back home this weekend.  Its really hard to see something like this happen to someone that really had everything going for him.  Do you guys think my suspicions are grounded?"

I appreciate all feedback/advice, positive and negative. Hopefully some more people can benefit from this post that are in the same boat as me. I graduated from a pretty respectable liberal arts school with a degree in Finance. In my 4 years there, I did the minimum to get by in most of my classes. I spent all my time playing poker and video games, going to the gym/playing sports, and drinking and partying.

My problem is I pretty much have nothing to put on my resume. The only on campus activities I participated in at school were intramural sports. I didn't apply for any internships, and my GPA is nothing to brag about (sub 2.5). The past four summers I've been working as a caddy at a golf course near my house, and I used to be a tennis instructor in high school. I have an eBay account with 150 feedback score of 100%. That's pretty much it. In other words, nothing to really brag about or separate me from the pack.

Ideally, I would like to work as some type of credit/market analyst. I'm good with computers, and very capable of learning how to use excel, outlook, etc. more in-depth. I just don't know where to start. I live right outside of NYC. I just want the opportunity to be able to shadow a current analyst / join some type of training program. I'm just looking for suggestions of what to do in the mean time while I'm working as a caddy for the next two months, that can help increase my chances of finding some type of work in the near future. Does anyone know of any books or online videos that will prepare me for this type of work?

I know I screwed up, but I knowingly put myself in this situation and I need to start doing something about it. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks."

I'm a sophomore EE and this semester I've been trying to get more involved with engineering organizations. My freshman year I was honestly too shy to get involved in anything, so all I really did was classes and that was pretty much it. This year I want to do more. My goals are to get involved in engineering projects through organizations, get a research position, maybe get some sort of leadership position in an engineering organization, and finally (my biggest goal) get an internship over the summer with a good company. 

While all of these goals are great, I have a problem: I'm a REALLY shy/awkward guy. I'm the type of person who's a general wallflower and I  suck at talking to people, especially ""important people"". The past week I've been going to organization meetings and for the most part all I can do is awkwardly talk to one officer about a project the club is doing and then bail. I just feel like I don't know how to form a conversation with these guys. 

With professors I'm even worse. The entire time I've been at school I haven't talked to a single one of my professors. No e-mails, no talking at the beginning or end of class, or even office hours. Honestly, I just don't know what to say. I imagine most people go to office hours to ask questions about class material or hw, but in every single class I've had so far I've pretty much understood everything or at least figured it out on my own without talking to the professor. I know it's important, not just to do well in class but to make contacts and find research opportunities, but I feel like I genuinely have no clue how to talk to my professors. 

As far as recruiters go, I don't really have much of any experience. My school hosts a bi-yearly career fair and I plan on going for the first time this semester. At this point I have near nothing on my resume, so this time around is more about training myself for talking to recruiters than shooting for an internship. For recruiters coming with conversation topics shouldn't be too difficult since the conversations should be short and I'd do my research beforehand, but I fear that I'm going to come off as very awkward. The recruiters that come to our career fairs are usually the same every semester, so I'd really like to be able to make a good first impression so that I can be remembered for the next semester. 

I know this is kind of a strange topic to put on an engineering forum, but I think many engineering student have had to deal with learning how to communicate so they can get research/leadership/internship positions. Any advice on any of these topics would be seriously appreciated. 

TL;DR I'm an awkward/shy engineering student. How can I be less awkward/shy so that I can succeed more in engineering?"

I am extremely confused about my future in the Industry. Its my family's dream that I get a job in Germany after achieving a Master's degree, also I am ready to do whatever it takes to get a good job in Germany or somewhere in Europe. Ready to learn a new language.

I researched a lot about my course, Informatics, still I am not sure what is the scope of it, what kind of jobs can I apply for on completion, is there a demand in the industry for this specialization.

Also I plan to work on my skills along with my studies in the next two years, but I am not sure what should I work on. Should I study SAP, since its in demand ? Do I have to be able to code or this specialization is not about coding ? Which extra courses should I do ? 

According what I hear, students are provided with internship opportunities, I am looking forward to those since I am a complete fresher going for a Master's degree. Will the internships help in finding a job in the future ?

I am a 26 year old professional with ~50 months of work experience under my belt as a mechanical engineer. I'm not unhappy where I am, but I'm beginning to realize that I want more. I would like to make a difference somewhere with a career 

I have a BSME from West Virginia University (~100 on the US News for Engineering). I graduated with a 3.2 GPA in 4 years on a full ride academic scholarship (the reason I attended).

I have one internship that I worked prior to obtaining full time employment. I currently work at a major US diesel engine manufacturer located in the Midwest. I'm working on my 3rd promotion and have had 3 direct reports for the last 13 months, I'm the youngest employee in my business unit to have direct reports. I have developed both processes and products as well as worked as a data analyst. Outside of my regular work duties, I also coordinate offsite activities for my organization, a yearly all-day canoe event with catering and entertainment as well as a yearly kickball tournament.

I'm currently looking to jump start my career and, more than likely, completely change my profession. I want to move on from my current position and take full advantage of the MBA. My current company does not offer any sort of incentives for obtaining an MBA, they'll help pay (~7k/yr) but the general consensus is that you have to leave, and I'm fine with that.

Post-MBA I would like to move into role where I would be able to use my engineering background. Eventually I would love to be a CTO of a tech company. To get myself started towards that path I think program management, technical strategy development, etc. Something where I can be involved in identifying potential markets, working with customers to identify their needs, designing the solutions to meet their needs. Most of my experience is engineering for an engine manufacturer and I'm not averse to working in that field, but I'm also intrigued by companies that work in the communications field. 

I would like to quit my job and go to a top school full-time since I am hoping to change careers, but University of Chicago's Booth and Northwestern's Kellogg weekend programs would be doable for me, as well as a night school program at the Kelley School of Business at  IU. Other schools I'm interested in are UPenn's Wharton, Harvard, MIT, UT Austin, University of Michigan, Duke. I just want to make sure that school I go to if I decide to quit my job allows me to get a good ROI. I probably will not apply to all schools, I will look at my GMAT scores and choose afterwards based on where I think I could get in and then take one reach at a school that could possibly be out of my league.

I have not taken my GMAT yet, I'm just beginning my studying, so I'm probably 3-6 months away from taking it (how long do people usually study, should I take a practice exam before I start my studies?) Do you have any advice for studying, the guide I purchased was the 2015 Official Guide for GMAT Review based off of information via Google-Fu.

Do any of you have any advice on how I can better set myself up to be able to get into the target schools I listed or things to do outside of work? I also have the opportunity to take a jump in work whenever I want as I have fulfilled my time obligation for my current role. My options are vast, I can basically get into any field I want at my current company via an internal move, but I would like for it to align with where I'd like to go in order to help my get into a great school.

I'm also nervous about taking the quit my job approach as I have a young son, 2 mos. old, and a wife who I support with my salary, although if we moved we would sell a vehicle, defer current student loans, sell our house, etc and move to where the school is. We could likely survive on my wife's pay and since she works online she is extremely flexible. I'm sure many of you have done this, however, it scares the crap out of me. I would definitely need to apply for as much financial aid as possible to lighten the burden on my family. How have you done this?

This is long. Its my first post here. I want to take the step as soon as I can. I have no idea if my aspirations are achievable  or really where to start outside of studying hard, taking the GMAT and then evaluating after that.

Thank you."

COVER LETTER:

Dear Head Honcho,

Please find my CV attached to the email for the junior reporter position at [newspaper].

My time spent studying MSc Journalism at [some university] has fine-tuned my ability to excel in the field of journalism, adding a broad base of skills to my determination. It involved plenty of independent work, with dedication, tenacity and creativity, to complete all the assignments. My ability to succeed in these tasks can be seen in my NCTJ results. The Digital Journalism in Practice module required commitment to find the stories that matter to a small community and delivering them on a new website. I found this the most enjoyable aspect of the degree.

I have proven myself to be a flexible and tenacious writer. Working on a local radio station as well as on the editorial team of my student newspaper shows my ability to learn and excel on different platforms. I would be extremely excited to begin working as a junior reporter and to be given the responsibility of finding the stories that matter to your community.

My desire to begin my career at a company that provides multi-media platforms has led me to your publication. I am always looking to find a new story and produce it in the best way – my drive to deliver is relentless. [Newspaper] would give me the best chance to hit the ground running and grow professionally. I am available to start within a week of being offered the job.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely

Conor Riordan

So my thinking process isn't the best (it's probably the main reason I become depressed), but I'm working on it. I'm a Junior CS major, signed up for four classes - Algorithms, Operating Systems, Mathematical Logic, and Technical Writing, and my free days right now are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I love to learn stuff, anything at all, and I work hard during Monday - Thursday and go to office hours regularly. However, when I'm in the weekend I feel guilty about not studying or not doing any projects. I'm by no means a procrastinator, if something needs to be done I'll do it. I'm feeling guilty that I'm not as good a programmer as I want to be because I'm not spending all of my time coding or learning something new. I feel as if I'm wasting time and if I'm not spending more time programming during the weekend I'll be behind other people in my class. So my question is how do you guys deal with the issue of work-leisure and competency?

Also a side question, how do I find out my Visa information? I'm applying for a hackathon and they're asking for my Visa type and certain dates.

Another side question: do I need a lot on my resume to be eligible for internships? Because I don't have that much on my github at all other than a C# project that reads assembly language code."

[Day Seven](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2g4g0b/day_seven_of_internship_sketchy_behavior/)


Today was weird.

Overworked texted me a few minutes before Fourth hour started.

Overworked:
&gt;Meet me at the front doors.

Class let out and I headed for the doors. There was no sign of Overworked, but my principal (Tim) was standing there, waiting for me.

Me:
&gt;Hey Tim, have you seen Overworked?

Tim:
&gt;There's been a slight change of plans. Overworked won't be here today.

Me:
&gt;Oh....did he quit or something?

Tim:
&gt;I can't comment on that. But, I printed out some tickets for you to take care of today. On Monday I want you to study for the CompTIA A+ test. You'll be taking it and we expect you to pass with flying colors, as we're paying for it at our cost.

Me:
&gt;Thank you, so much. I'll start studying up ASAP. I'll take care of those tickets, too. Bye Tim.

Tim:
&gt;Good luck, Xunderground.

Most of the tickets were boring. Switch out EndPoint for Avast, update Chrome, but one in particular stuck out.

&gt;Ticket filed by: ThinksShe'sSmart
&gt;
&gt;Reason: Everything's broken. Please fix. No power, no boot, weird &gt;smell.
&gt;
&gt;Priority: High.

Oh. Lovely.

I walk into ThinksShe'sSmart's class and instantly smell the smell of fried electronics, I head towards her computer and see a horrible sight.

Me:
&gt;Uhh. ThinksShe'sSmart, did you notice any heat coming from your PC?

TSS:
&gt;No. Why?

Me:
&gt;Take a look *points at PSU* Do you see how the cord is melted? That's....not supposed to happen.

TSS:
&gt;Well, can you fix it?

Me:
&gt;Unfortunately, Overworked has asked that any PCs that have actual fried components be put away in the supply closet, so he can check on the hardware. I'll just go grab one of the new machines for you.

TSS:
&gt;No.

Me:
&gt;No?

TSS:
&gt;No! I like my machine. I'm used to it and it's served me well.

Me:
&gt;The new one is better in every way. You're already running Windows 7 so the operating system won't change, but these machines have triple the amount of RAM and a much better CPU, not to mention they have a Solid State Drive, which I remember you asked for last year.

TSS:
&gt;No.

Me:
&gt;Well, there's nothing I can do...

TSS:
&gt;YOU CAN FIX MINE. I AM NOT GETTING AN UPGRADE. I WANT MINE! *stomps feet* YOU CAN'T MAKE ME UPGRADE. OVERWORKED ALWAYS LET ME KEEP ME COMPUTER!

Me:
&gt;Know what? *I'm not Overworked.* No. I don't care what you want. There are procedures put in place by Overworked and I'm going to do things right and follow through with them. Use a laptop for now and I'll get your machine prepared. If you want to complain, you can just use the laptop. End of story.

I walked out carrying her fried desktop and unlocked the supply closet. Placed it in there and stepped out, only to be greeted by Tim.

Tim:
&gt;ThinksShe'sSmart doesn't look too happy.

Me:
&gt;No, no she does not.

Tim:
&gt;I assume her computer fried? You'll be fixing it, right?

Me:
&gt;Actually, no. She's due for an upgrade anyway and this computer needs to be overlooked by Overworked.

Tim:
&gt;You mean.....you actually got her to agree to an upgrade?

Me:
&gt;No. I told her she was getting an upgrade whether she liked it or not, because we no longer have any more of these machines, and this one is fried.

Tim:
&gt;Wow...

Me:
&gt;What? I'm just following protocol.

Tim:
&gt;Overworked usually just gave in when she started screaming.

Me:
&gt;That's not how I do things. Not saying I always do everything by the book with no exceptions, but the policy that Overworked put in place seems logical, so I'm following through with it.

Tim:
&gt;Hmm. You might actually be able to handle it after all.

Me:
&gt;Handle what?

Tim:
&gt;Oh, nothing! Forget I said anything. Anyway, you should go get lunch. 

I turned and walked away to lunch, and to think about where Overworked has gone, and what it meant for the future of my internship."

I'm a senior in the Honors Engineeirng program here at ASU. I was wondering what Cards/credit advice I could get from someone who's been through it. 

I've got exceptional grades (3.87), two minors (w/4.00 avg), and I have also started work on my masters so that I could finish in one extra year. (ASU's 4+1). Needless to say, I'm fairly busy. I do have internship experience w/Gates Co up in Denver, but I really don't have time for an extra job during the year. I've tried. 

I'm not too worried about finding a job after graduation (already applying to companies again, going to all career fairs, etc) but in the mean time, I really need some extra liquidity...some way to transfer my current expenses to whatever decent job I can get after graduation. To boot, I'm getting engaged soon and we are thinking about getting married after I graduate. 

I'm acutely aware of the expenses of all that. I've recently considered low-APR credit cards as a one-month solution near end-semester until the stipend comes through the next month. I have relatively few student loans, since my tuition and some living expense is covered by Scholarship/grants. But, it's just not enough. Any advice on how to make it through until I graduate? 

I can upload a resume if it would help, get an idea of my position.

Thanks for making it through the wall of text. Good luck to all as career fair season starts up once more!"

I got the job due to my marketing major and high GPA - my work experience is only two previous market and financial analyst internships. Also I live in a very suburban area and they were looking for local interns which probably disqualified most MBA candidates.

After the internship ended I was offered a part time position where I was given the chance to pick my own job title. My new job description states I'm in charge of market expansion and non traditional markets, I also advice the CEO and CFO on market expansion. 

My friends and family think I should go with ""Senior Market Research Analyst"" which the CEO was fine with but I'm afraid that title might negatively affect me in the future. I have a senior level position without the work history and I feel that may turn off future potential employers. While I love the job and company it doesn't pay well and I'm hoping to get a new job after a year.

My question is am I overthinking it and should I use the new title or keep the old title despite the new position. It's a small company which I feel might be important."
2g8t53,1,2014-09-12,"Understanding OAuth, HTTP, and APIs",recheej,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2g8t53/understanding_oauth_http_and_apis/,"Hi guys. You guys might know me from the my ""i just got fired from my programming internship"" post not too long ago. Any ways. I'm trying to do little side projects here and there and spotify's iOS SDK has me interested. However I'm not understanding some things.

I'm going through the beginner tutorial and I have to authenticate my application to access spotify using OAuth. I read up on OAuth and I thought I understood the flow but in the [SDK Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/tutorial/) says I have to run a ""token exhange"" service written in ruby.

I don't understand why I have to use a ruby to get the token. Couldn't I request the token directly in Objective-C? I also saw a token service written in python somewhere. I think I'm just misunderstanding how OAuth works along with HTTP.

I understand that my application has to present the user with a page that allows them to authenticate my application and then I should receive the token via a response. I think have to exchange that token for the access token which then allows me to access the user's resources.

**tl;dr**
Can some one help me understand how to access APIs using OAuth? I'm trying to use the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/tutorial/#tokenexchange). Or at least point me towards some resources on learning OAuth and using APIs.

2g9biu,1,2014-09-12,We Watched A Movie At Work Today,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2g9biu/we_watched_a_movie_at_work_today/,"Some really weird and fucked shit happened to me after work today. I work at a law firm as a junior lawyer. I'm not going to say the name or the city because that would put me in all kinds of legal trouble. I shouldn't even be posting this but I've read a lot of the posts on here and it seems like the only logical place to write about what I saw.  

Quick intro. My name is Paul. The firm I work at is a big one that has several different departments (ie. Criminal, civil, land dispute, etc). I work in what's called the heritage department. It's a fancy way of saying last wills and testaments. I work under a full time partner named Matt, who had a promising career in the criminal defense area but since he says “fuck” like a comma, it didn't last. He doesn't mind the change though. (His words not mine) “The dead don't mind if you call them fuck-tards”. Also, there is a lot of money to be had if you know what   you're doing. You'd be amazed at the coin the one percent will drop in order to keep their millions out of the hands of botoxed ex-wives or drug addict kids (I know I sound cynical but that's because I am. Really hard to stay in the law field and not be).   

Everyone wanted to work with Matt. He didn't bullshit, he didn't cheat, and had no problem telling a client to fuck off. When I was an intern I drank too much at a Christmas party and told off one of my co-workers. I don't remember what I said but I do remember Matt, standing on a chair and screaming, “Whose dick I gotta suck to get that guy on my team?”. A week later I was made a junior partner. His secretary Claire, is almost as bad as him. She has a sweet side and can make anyone laugh but a really short fuse. She's beautiful like a 1920's madame and also a lipstick lesbian. You want to keep your money away from assholes, we're the three people you talk to.  

We had one client about two days ago. An old guy with a really thick accent and a USB drive. One of the services we offer is the confidential video will. You sign a paper saying the video is official and as long as it's legal, whatever's on it is considered your final wishes (No “I want that son of a bitch John dead”). It's especially useful for immigrants since there's usually family outside the US that want a piece of the pie and have no problems getting their own lawyers. Since a video will is practically the word of god in a courtroom, it's a great way for foreigners to make sure their resources go were they want.   

Anyway, that guy didn't standout that much apart from his accent. We did some quick paperwork, notarized it, and by the end of the day we had a new paycheck coming. What was weird is what happened this morning. Mr. Bowler, as he was known, was found dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.   

So after work we set up in the conference room to watch his video will and see what we could and could not do for him. It's a pretty stereotypical room with a long table, a mini bar, and a flat screen TV. Claire was sitting on one side taking notes. I was across from her as a witness. And Matt sat in front as the lead. He put the USB into the side of the television and the menu came up. There were a lot of random documents on the USB but we were only interested in the video marked, “Last Will and Testament”.  

The video began and Mr. Bowler walked in and sat behind a desk. He began to speak a language I did not understand. Claire groaned and Matt said sarcastically, “The German...Speaks German”. Mr. Bowler went on and finally said in English, “My name is Colonel Philip Bauer, and this is my confession”.  

The video switched to that grey color that passed as black in old black and white films. The word “Vertraulich” popped up on the screen in white letters above an eagle with spread wings. The screen went away and there on the television...I really can't believe I'm typing this. This is so fucked....There was Mr. Bowler, a young version of him, in a grey Nazi uniform. He began to speak German as I heard the clatter of Claire's pen dropping on the table. Matt just leaned forward and said, “Ladies and Gentleman. We have a game changer”. The screen switched to a bunch of people in white coats walking around a lab (The entire video had a voice over by Mr. Bowler but I didn't know what he was saying. I'm only typing out what I saw). There were some other filler video of labs and mice before it got to the disturbing part. The video showed two different groups of people wearing striped clothing. One group had the subtitle “Juden” and the other said “Keine Juden”. This is where the video gets fucked.   

The video showed half of the groups getting an injection followed by each of them going into a concrete cell with one of the others who hadn't been injected. It was a time lapse that showed each subject but there were two the video focused on. Keine Judens. A pretty dark haired woman and a dark haired man of maybe 30. The movie showed the two of them walking into a cell before the camera angle switched so it was above them like it was being shot from a walkway.      

The film jumped forward in time to a scene of the two sitting in the cell. Below the picture were the words, “5 Stunden”. The woman began to cough. A little at first. At “6 Stunden”, it turned into a full blown fit. At “9 Studen”, the woman was lying in bed rolling slightly back and forth while her cell mate tried to comfort her. Then it happened. The woman shot up like a jack-in-the-box. Dark tears came from her eyes. She had a violent coughing fit and blood/snot shot out of her nose onto her striped shirt. She fell onto the bed and arched her   back. I thank God the video didn't have sound. Her mouth opened in a silent scream before blood fountained out. The man ran terrified to the other side of the cell and began frantically clawing at the walls.   

The woman laid flat on the bed and it was over as fast as it started. The video continued. The woman lying flat. The man was sobbing. Then he stopped. And he started to cough. The next time it showed the man it was with the caption “15 Studen”. Blood covered his shirt. Dark and clear mixed out of the streams coming from his nose and mouth. Gory tears covered his cheeks. The woman still laid dead with a few flies gathering on her. Unlike her, the man stood, staring at the back wall. He stood still. Completely..still... Then he began to walk. He walked slowly towards the back wall until he went into it. He kept moving with his hands by his sides like he expected to just go straight through. Then he stopped. He turned around and paced to the other side of the cell until he hit the metal door. This went on for another few minutes.   

The video then showed several of the other inmates. A Juden sprawled out on the concrete while another man rocked back and forth. A Keine Juden spinning in a circle while his partner laid in a puddle of blood and vomit. A dead Keine Juden woman tearing her face to ribbons while her Juden partner continuously lifted and put down his right leg.   

Then the video switched. It showed a pretty blonde woman with a man with light hair. During the 24 “Studens”, The two talked, laughed, and hugged. Eventually their cell door was opened and the final frames of the film was filled with that fucker Mr. Bowler's voice and triumphant music. Along with shots of the pair sitting inside a cafe drinking coffee, kissing in a field and holding a baby. The caption below them said, “1943 Heiratete”.  
The movie showed thee others who had lived. One was also “1943 Heiratete” with a smiling brunette woman. Another was a man working on a farm, also smiling ear to ear for the camera. As the music swelled up it showed one more survivor. A Juden. Marching in Berlin shoulder to shoulder with other men in Nazi uniforms. The screen faded to grey as the eagle appeared again.   

The film ended and we sat in stunned silence. Matt stood up and took the USB drive out. He knew a private detective he used when he interned at the divorce department who spoke several different languages. He told us not to say a word to anyone until he showed it to him and knew what it  exactly was we had just watched. We agreed and left with his promise he'd call us. I got home and typed this because I had to tell someone and I feel like this is the only place that might believe me. My girlfriend is in the other room painting. As soon as I post this I'm going to go kiss her and tell her I love her. If you were kind enough to read my story, I suggest you call your loved ones and do the same. God knows what the fuck I just watched.

I don't remember what I said but I do remember Matt, standing on a chair and screaming, “Whose dick I gotta suck to get that guy on my team?”. A week later I was made a junior partner. His secretary Claire, is almost as bad as him. She has a sweet side and can make anyone laugh but a really short fuse. She's beautiful like a 1920's madame and also a lipstick lesbian. You want to keep your money away from assholes, we're the three people you talk to.  

We had one client about two days ago. An old guy with a really thick accent and a USB drive. One of the services we offer is the confidential video will. You sign a paper saying the video is official and as long as it's legal, whatever's on it is considered your final wishes (No “I want that son of a bitch John dead”). It's especially useful for immigrants since there's usually family outside the US that want a piece of the pie and have no problems getting their own lawyers. Since a video will is practically the word of god in a courtroom, it's a great way for foreigners to make sure their resources go were they want.   

Anyway, that guy didn't standout that much apart from his accent. We did some quick paperwork, notarized it, and by the end of the day we had a new paycheck coming. What was weird is what happened this morning. Mr. Bowler, as he was known, was found dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.   

So after work we set up in the conference room to watch his video will and see what we could and could not do for him. It's a pretty stereotypical room with a long table, a mini bar, and a flat screen TV. Claire was sitting on one side taking notes. I was across from her as a witness. And Matt sat in front as the lead. He put the USB into the side of the television and the menu came up. There were a lot of random documents on the USB but we were only interested in the video marked, “Last Will and Testament”.  

The video began and Mr. Bowler walked in and sat behind a desk. He began to speak a language I did not understand. Claire groaned and Matt said sarcastically, “The German...Speaks German”. Mr. Bowler went on and finally said in English, “My name is Colonel Philip Bauer, and this is my confession”.  

The video switched to that grey color that passed as black in old black and white films. The word “Vertraulich” popped up on the screen in white letters above an eagle with spread wings. The screen went away and there on the television...I really can't believe I'm typing this. This is so fucked....There was Mr. Bowler, a young version of him, in a grey Nazi uniform. He began to speak German as I heard the clatter of Claire's pen dropping on the table. Matt just leaned forward and said, “Ladies and Gentleman. We have a game changer”. The screen switched to a bunch of people in white coats walking around a lab (The entire video had a voice over by Mr. Bowler but I didn't know what he was saying. I'm only typing out what I saw). There were some other filler video of labs and mice before it got to the disturbing part. The video showed two different groups of people wearing striped clothing. One group had the subtitle “Juden” and the other said “Keine Juden”. This is where the video gets fucked.   

The video showed half of the groups getting an injection followed by each of them going into a concrete cell with one of the others who hadn't been injected. It was a time lapse that showed each subject but there were two the video focused on. Keine Judens. A pretty dark haired woman and a dark haired man of maybe 30. The movie showed the two of them walking into a cell before the camera angle switched so it was above them like it was being shot from a walkway.      

The film jumped forward in time to a scene of the two sitting in the cell. Below the picture were the words, “5 Stunden”. The woman began to cough. A little at first. At “6 Stunden”, it turned into a full blown fit. At “9 Studen”, the woman was lying in bed rolling slightly back and forth while her cell mate tried to comfort her. Then it happened. The woman shot up like a jack-in-the-box. Dark tears came from her eyes. She had a violent coughing fit and blood/snot shot out of her nose onto her striped shirt. She fell onto the bed and arched her   back. I thank God the video didn't have sound. Her mouth opened in a silent scream before blood fountained out. The man ran terrified to the other side of the cell and began frantically clawing at the walls.   

The woman laid flat on the bed and it was over as fast as it started. The video continued. The woman lying flat. The man was sobbing. Then he stopped. And he started to cough. The next time it showed the man it was with the caption “15 Studen”. Blood covered his shirt. Dark and clear mixed out of the streams coming from his nose and mouth. Gory tears covered his cheeks. The woman still laid dead with a few flies gathering on her. Unlike her, the man stood, staring at the back wall. He stood still. Completely..still... Then he began to walk. He walked slowly towards the back wall until he went into it. He kept moving with his hands by his sides like he expected to just go straight through. Then he stopped. He turned around and paced to the other side of the cell until he hit the metal door. This went on for another few minutes.   

The video then showed several of the other inmates. A Juden sprawled out on the concrete while another man rocked back and forth. A Keine Juden spinning in a circle while his partner laid in a puddle of blood and vomit. A dead Keine Juden woman tearing her face to ribbons while her Juden partner continuously lifted and put down his right leg.   

Then the video switched. It showed a pretty blonde woman with a man with light hair. During the 24 “Studens”, The two talked, laughed, and hugged. Eventually their cell door was opened and the final frames of the film was filled with that fucker Mr. Bowler's voice and triumphant music. Along with shots of the pair sitting inside a cafe drinking coffee, kissing in a field and holding a baby. The caption below them said, “1943 Heiratete”.  
The movie showed thee others who had lived. One was also “1943 Heiratete” with a smiling brunette woman. Another was a man working on a farm, also smiling ear to ear for the camera. As the music swelled up it showed one more survivor. A Juden. Marching in Berlin shoulder to shoulder with other men in Nazi uniforms. The screen faded to grey as the eagle appeared again.   

The film ended and we sat in stunned silence. Matt stood up and took the USB drive out. He knew a private detective he used when he interned at the divorce department who spoke several different languages. He told us not to say a word to anyone until he showed it to him and knew what it  exactly was we had just watched. We agreed and left with his promise he'd call us. I got home and typed this because I had to tell someone and I feel like this is the only place that might believe me. My girlfriend is in the other room painting. As soon as I post this I'm going to go kiss her and tell her I love her. If you were kind enough to read my story, I suggest you call your loved ones and do the same. God knows what the fuck I just watched.

Hi everyone!

Thanks to your wiki, posts and other links, I've managed to build my first computer for gaming!

This was a real pleasure to build, plugging everything, trying to fit the cables behind the case, mounting everything, it was a great experience and I can't wait to do this again!

So my goal was to get me a cheap gaming PC with my low paid internship and it was a great success. I already had a screen and a 1TB drive around so it helped lower the costs for sure.

I made a mistake though and ordered the wrong type of motherboard (got the ATX model instead of the mATX one) but got it delivered next day.

So I'm pretty satisfied with everything, it runs smoothly, boot super fast (under 2 seconds) and yup, that's it. The thing I'll buy though is replacement fans, the CPU fan is a bit noisy and I'd like to overclock that G3258 if possible. Oh, and a new keyboard, the Apple one is a bit annoying with Windows (surprise!).

Thanks you for making me a happy PC builder !

As I look  through job postings i see that all these jobs want you to know all these different frameworks. While I'm good with a few languages but I don't know many of the frameworks and I wouldn't  know what to learn first. 

I don't wanna spend 6 months learning all these frameworks  and technologies since  the money I saved for relocating is whats going to keep my afloat for a while. There is zero chance of me finding a developer job in my area so I more than willing to move.

I just don't know what I should focus on: Knowing syntax or Knowing concepts . Most local recruiters that call  all say i need more experience  in X language which is a catch 22 since they  say the jobs are entry level.I'm good with concepts it seems like I never get a chance to be asked those quest due to lack of work experience.

I have lurked for a long time and was hoping to get some answers with this throwaway. I know salary varies greatly location to location. 

I recently graduated with a CS degree and accepted my first job, shortly after graduation, with company as a Junior C# developer (an internship elsewhere is my only previous experience). I have been here 6 months and just wonder if I am underpaid. The company is completely remote and so far has been very relaxed. The stress level is minimal, work can be interesting and work schedule is basically 8hrs a day (no set time frame).

Salary is 52k/yr with health, 4% 401k match. The vacation policy is take it as needed (within reason).

I am located on the west coast but not in CA nor a major city. There are some jobs here but scarce. I would have to move to a larger city to find another job. This would come with about a  minimum of 10% increase in cost of living (mainly housing not including adding commuting/transportation). 

I know you can always make more but considering the wages and benefits is this a fair wage or did I sell myself short by a lot? 

Thanks for reading and replying!

I didn't prepare at all, because I did not know it would be as technical as it was - so I bombed it horribly.

I'm currently learning C++ and I'm done with my Java series in school. I've taken assembly but I am not really confident with it and get confused with registers and what they actually do, stuff like that. I know basic data structures, like linked lists, queues, stacks, heaps, trees, etc. (But I need to refresh my memory by studying)

I know basic sorts, like quicksort, bubble sort, insertion sort, etc. and how they work conceptually. I've written them in programs, but like I said, I need to refresh myself on these.

I am currently learning javascript/SQL and D3 to help with my analysis skills.

I am pretty good with excel, I know html and CSS and have experience with Tableau and QlikSense.

I am good at telling a story and have a background in film making. I am also proficient with the full adobe suite. I have been given free reign to work with data for the next 6 months.

I am looking for something around 40-50k next summer. I realise 30k is more realistic. 
Really what I want is to work remotely as I love to travel and find that I work better alone. 

My company has this option but it's pretty much frowned upon.

How feasible is this and what steps can I take to improve my chances of landing a role like this? Could I work freelance? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I have been more and more frustrated with the state of r/compsci as a subreddit. Let me quote the description of the subreddit again:

&gt; Welcome Computer Science researchers, students, and enthusiasts. The aim of this subreddit is to share interesting papers, blog posts, and questions about topics such as algorithms, formal languages, automata, information theory, cryptography, machine learning, computational complexity, programming language theory, etc...
&gt;
&gt; If you are new to Computer Science please read our FAQ before posting. Your question might have already been answered!
&gt;
&gt; Do not post questions such as ""should I study computer science?"", ""how do I get an internship?"", ""what sort of job can I get after school?"", etc... There have been too many of these threads; they bore the regulars and scare away experts. If you have a question like this, please consider posting on cscareerquestions or askcomputerscience. 

Does anyone believe that this description still corresponds to how this subreddit is used? I just did a quick measurement: of the 23 items I counted on my webpages, 9 could pass as relevant to this description (being very lenient), and 14 are irrelevant (mostly help about university courses on programming, or career advice). This means that **a strict majority of r/compsci content is out of topic**.

I think the disconnect between the description and the reality is a problem. Please, r/compsci users, could we discuss it and fix it?

I see basically two families of solutions:

1. make r/compsci closer to its description by being thougher on out-of-topic posts (for example, I noticed that ""self"" posts are almost always out of topic, we could remove the ability to post ""self"" posts)

2. admit that r/compsci is what people see in the name, rather than what the description says; change the description to be closer to reality, and possibly create another subreddit that corresponds to compsci's description. Any advice on the name this should have?

Am I the only one that is disturbed by this disconnect? What do you expect of r/compsci?

I think the solution (2) is the one that is most likely to succeed in practice. (1) looks like an unending spiral of policing, negativity and frustration."

Last summer I interned with a company in my hometown. I got the internship mainly because I have a family member working there. Over the summer I really impressed them with work ethic and how quickly I picked up the material. 

This company is in a field of engineering that not many people go into (engineering for architecture). As a result the company has a very rough time getting recruits from top universities in the state of Florida. Many of the full time employees have little to no college education aside from the PEs (professional engineers). So I feel like they had low expectations. 

Anyways, I will be moving to a different city soon, meaning it wouldn't be likely that I would return to the same division of the company. My family member working there told me that my boss was ""freaking out"" that I wouldn't be returning this summer. 

I'm not very interested in a repeat internship with this company. I am more interested in software (and may even change to computer engineering), but I would like to have this opportunity as a fallback in case I can't find a software internship. How do I decline this internship without burning bridges? "

I have been learning web development for a bit now, I am still working on projects to show off but I was wondering if anyone would be able to point myself and some others in a similar situation as me in the right direction of companies in North America (or world wide too) that take on junior developers and/or interns?

The only one I have seen is HootSuite in Canada and every so often I see some positions at Shopify (also in Canada), but I think they filled them all.

Background:
I am a senior who will be graduating from college in the Tri State area next fall. I am looking for a internship this summer that will position me strongly for an entry level position the following fall.

Although my gpa isn't great, I've racked up a formidable resume. I've competed in three university-wide business case competitions, placing 1st in one from one of the top consulting companies, top six in Johnson &amp; Johnson, and top four in a competition from a university club.

Other experience I have includes serving as an advisor to a non-profit, chapter member of a public speaking club. Finally, my professional experience includes working at a start up and an association management company.



The Situation:
However, because of my gpa(2.8), I am barred from applying to internships where the majority ask for &gt;3.0 gpa. I'm not even applying to any internship that has a gpa requirement.


Some of the advice I will use going forward:

1)Messaging company recruiters directly.
2)Go to more networking events.


What type of advice would you give to someone looking for a summer internship with a comparable gpa?

anyway i overestimated how much free time i'd have per week, so i started looking for another internship and i got an interview for an unpaid internship for a government agency. they require more hours but it is much closer to my train station and well i'm more interested in it.

while theoretically i could complete both in a week (i'm only taking 6 credit hours in the morning), one of my classes is an internship course. i am a research assistant. that requires 8 hours a week, and i need to be available for that. so in addition to class + research assistant internship + regular internship i also have 3 hr daily commute to and from school, and i have regular meetings with mentors and university personnel as well.

tl;dr given my very full schedule w/ lots of commuting and school-related commitments, if i am offered a position at said government agency for an unpaid position, how screwed would i be if i reneged on the other unpaid position at the small non profit? i have no internship experience and i could use all the experience i could get but i just don't have time for everything."

 1) Google Search. Yielded one first year opportunity. Most postings, even for field, require that one have completed second year.

2) Career services/second years. Both tell me that it doesn't usually happen and provide no advice beyond that.

3) Network. Potentially one here as my Dad went to school with a recruiter for an energy firm and is good friends with him. However, most of my family is in investing, so very little energy except for companies they buy and sell.

4) Scouring online postings for those which don't explicitly state they don't want a first year. Found a few, but am not that hopeful regarding these.

2gj53s,3,2014-09-16,Currently in my second week of my first internship/co-op experience. I have a few questions,ubccompscistudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gj53s/currently_in_my_second_week_of_my_first/,"My first question is about what I should be learning/reading on the side in my free time (and before some of you say I need to get a hobby, or relax, or go outside, see friends and family, yadda yadda, don't worry, I got that covered. I still have some time that I want to devote to learning new technologies). My internship is completely Java based, so I originally assumed I would be learning so much Java during the day that I could venture off at night/weekends and learn some Node.js. 

The problem is that I feel quite a bit rushed at my internship. I'm used to school, where, when I get a project, I devote the first 80% of my time to learning the ins and outs of how the technology works before designing and coding it. I've usually been commended for my well designed programs by professors.

Now the company I'm working for is great. They don't expect overtime, there's a very positive atmosphere in the office, and I don't really feel the stress of deadlines (at least, as of yet), but it doesn't seem like my method of reading as much as I can before I touch the code is not appreciated here. I've been given a relatively simple assignment of updating some soon-to-be deprecated Google APIS that also involved learning OAuth2.0, and a lot of it was so overwhelming and confusing that (a) my supervisor had to help quite a bit (which he was happy to do), but I didn't learn much while he was filling in the blanks and (b) the end result was code that somehow managed to work yet, to me, looked like a train wreck of bugs that I patched with duct tape.

I even made a joking comment along the lines of ""it works!... but why?"" and my supervisor looked at me like I was weird and said the code looked great and was pretty happy about it. 

So my second big question would be if this is a normal feeling? To go from having absolute control over a project to messily patching up a massive existing system? It's a very stressful feeling, so it would be nice to have some validation that this is normal.

And back to my first question about whether to learn Node. I thought I would be learning Java a lot more intimately, but I feel as though I'm just kind of applying what I already know about the language and when I get really stuck, my supervisor deus-ex-machinas my code up.

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm learning a lot by reading new APIs and coding with new technologies like OAuth (and it's only been a week and a half!), but now I'm not sure if I should be doing something different and interesting (like Node) on the side, or if I should be reading up on books like Clean Code, Effective Java, Java in Concurrency and the like to actually get better at the code I'm writing in the day.

I didn't realize I was about to write this wall of text so thanks for making it through! Here's a TLDR to sum it up: 

**TLDR: new internship and I feel more out of control than I'm used to, is this normal? And should I be trying to improve job related skills in my spare time or should I learn a new technology that I've been interested in.**

Some background for you, I am a recent IT Intern to a larger company, and I have the pleasure of working in their infrastructure side, so everything from reporting and monitoring to desktop support.

I was primarily involved in upgrading and rolling out W7 to all clients within a department and most of these stories are going to be from that little escapade.

The idiotic supervisor makes an appearance!

----

So I heard from a couple of colleagues that they were having a problem with a program that wouldn't run in Windows 7, but obviously ran in XP, and the SUP needed it NOW...

So I asked ITM what was happening, and if I could take a look.

So he obligingly sends me a copy, time to dig in.

Without the boring details, I ended up having to symlink the C:\ to the temp folder. And change the output flag of the terminal program.

Doesn't sound too hard right? 

So I send the working program back to the ITM and this is the following conversation.

&gt; ITM : Oy Toakan, does this work?!

&gt; Me : Aye, why?

&gt; ITM : It can't work, we've been working on it for 6 months with the developer to fix it!

Allmywut

&gt; Me : Really? 6 months?

Bearing in mind we started the rollout 6 months ago and we finished up about a month ago.

ITM then sends me this email chain from the Developer (Dev) and himself.

&gt; Dear Sirs,
&gt; It is not possible to rewrite our prgram in the way that you wish i would suggest that you continue to use the program on the supported software.

Great... So even though this software is sold to us for use on Windows Xp AND Windows 7, it only works on the former?

Ruddy lieing developers...

Then the ITM tells me to 'accompany' him down to the users desk to ensure it works. 

He also stops by the printer, to grab a copy of the documentation I sent to accompany my 'fix'.


Upon arriving at our destination, ITM asks the User to grab a coffee whilst we double check the problem, and possibly fix it.

ITM, walks through the steps, installs the fix and it works.

SUP is watching...

&gt;SUP : Oh wow! You got it working, only took you six months!

&gt;ITM : Thats because we didn't have Toakan working the problem..

&gt;SUP : Well maybe he should work all our problems then!


Whilst this was happening, I noticed the TV was displaying the Callers in a strange theme.

It's XP..

Here we go again.

----
I don't know whether to take that last comment from ITM as a compliment or a verbal shot at his current team. We work with windows all the time, and i've now had to explain what a Symlink is to the entire team as the concept is mind boggling...


If this DEV is you, or someone you know. Please mildy berate them for me...

As always, let me know what you think!

Monday I was sick. So there's not much for that day besides some dialog with Overworked. I shot Overworked a text at 8AM, so he wouldn't be waiting for me when I wasn't going to show up.

Me:
&gt;Hey, Overworked. I apologize but I won't be able to make it in today. 

Overworked:
&gt;Oh, hello Xunderground. That's fine. Also, sorry I haven't been around as much. It's not that I forgot about you, I've just been busy with some of the more mundane tasks that I didn't want to bother you with. Meet me tomorrow, we have a lot to discuss.

I read his text, then passed out. Gotta love being sick.

****Day Ten****

Woke up, felt better. Went to school and finished up the last of the computers I needed to work on before school even started. Bang, boom, done. Simple.

Fourth hour rolled around, and I met Overworked at our usual spot. He seemed unusually cheery.

Overworked:
&gt;Hey! How's it hanging Xunderground?

Me:
&gt;By a single thread, as usual. What's on the agenda for today?

Overworked:
&gt;Well, you're going to go into the depths of a full on war, declare a victor, and carry the victor's spoils out of the loser's territory, all without dying.

Me:
&gt;Huh? What do you mean?

Overworked:
&gt;There's been a dispute between CouldLearnToWalk and HasReasonableExpectations. CLTW stole HRE's printer without me knowing, and had it set up in her room. You're going to go in there, tell CLTW that HRE's printer is going back, and that she can use the counseling office printer if she needs to print.

Me:
&gt;Oh. That should be pretty easy. I better go get a start on that.

I walked to CLTW's office and prepared for the worst.

Me:
&gt;Hey, CLTW, we need to talk. You got a sec?

CLTW:
&gt;Actually, I'm kind of bu-

Me:
&gt;Overworked has told me that you swiped a printer from HRE. I'm here to tell you that printer's going back, and that you can use the counseling office printer if you need to print.

CLTW:
&gt;No. This is my printer. It's from my old office. I'm keeping it.

Me:
&gt;Nope. This is school property, being moved back to HRE's office, and you're going to deal with it. 

CLTW:
&gt;Well, there's a running print job right now, so you're just going to have to wait.

Me:
&gt;Ahh, no problem. Did you save the document?

CLTW:
&gt;Yes, I did. She can have the printer once---HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

I unplugged the power strip that had CLTW's computer and printer plugged into it. Data corruption wasn't an issue, because school policy is to save everything to network drives, and if it needed reimaged, I'd be the one to be doing that anyway.

Me:
&gt;Now, move. I need that printer. Once I take it out of your room and set it down, I'll plug in your computer and you can re-start the print job, using the counseling office printer. Got it?

CLTW gave me a death stare, but moved aside. I took the printer out, and plugged back in the power strip.

Me:
&gt;You have a *wonderful* day, CLTW.

CLTW:
&gt;Hmph.

I proceeded to take the printer up to HRE's room. She moved aside, had everything prepared for me (even saved all of her work, logged out, AND typed in my user name for me!). I installed the printer, printed a test page, and set it as default. HRE thanked me, and I asked if she had anything else that needed to be done.

HRE:
&gt;Actually, there is one thing...

Me:
&gt;Yes?

HRE:
&gt;I want Spotify, and I want iTunes.

Me:
&gt;You know I can't do that, school policy.

HRE:
&gt;It was worth a try I guess. Have a good day Xunderground!

I went to step out of the room, but I couldn't do it. I was feeling too generous.

Me:
&gt;Step aside really quick.....I'll get you those programs.

I installed Spotify and iTunes for her. What harm could it do? Overworked broke policies all the time, and this machine had decent enough specs where iTunes wouldn't bring it to a halt.

I walked out of her room, and went to talk to Overworked.

Overworked:
&gt;How did it go?

Me:
&gt;Perfectly. HRE has her printer, CLTW is set up with the counseling office printer, and only one of them is grumpy.

Overworked:
&gt;Nice work. Now, come here. I want to show you something.

Overworked led me into a room that was marked ""Faculty Access Only"". which led to another room that was simply an unmarked door. He used his key to open the door, and led me in, with the lights off. I noticed that the room was hot, and noisy.

Overworked:
&gt;You ready?

Me:
&gt;Always.

Overworked turned on the lights, and what was revealed before me relieved a lot of pent up anxiety. It was a server room. A *real* server room. Nothing extravagant, but definitely ****not**** an old inspiron.

Overworked:
&gt;This is our server room. It's not the greatest, but it works. And sooner or later, this will be someone else's server room to handle.

Me:
&gt;What do you mean Overworked?

Overworked:
&gt;I'm retiring soon, Xunderground. Not this year, not next year, but soon. And maybe, just *maybe*, you could be my replacement.

Me:
&gt;Me? I don't even know anything about networking yet...

Overworked:
&gt;The beautiful thing about knowledge is that it can be shared. And that's what I intend to do. After you take the CompTIA A+ certification exam, I intend to teach you more about networking and real world experience. IF the school will let me. I only have you one semester, for one hour, right now. I'm going to see if I can continue the internship after you graduate, if you'd like.

Me:
&gt;That would be amazing.

Overworked:
&gt;Now, I'm not sure what will happen when I retire. That isn't under my control. But I figure that if we can have you around, show that you can handle all of my responsibilities, and train you on our setup, maybe the school will see that you're a good replacement. Pay's not amazing, but not many people can start off with a job like this. Anyway, it's time for you to go to lunch, Xunderground. Take care of yourself.

Me:
&gt;Thank you, Overworked."
2gkwlh,9,2014-09-16,So how important is assembly language?,TheJavaDoc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gkwlh/so_how_important_is_assembly_language/,"In terms of landing an internship or job?

I'm a computer science major, and we are required to take a couple of Computer Engineering classes.

I took a basic class dealing with programming bits/bytes to a board and learning about basic logic gates, multiplexers, etc.

Then I took my first assembly language course - it was 8051, and we were taught how to move bits and bytes from registers and into memory.

Now I am taking another class dealing with the MIPS architecture, doing much of what we did in the 8051 class.

Now, I do not really understand a lot of what we are learning. I am learning enough to get by, I know how to manipulate certain bits and write assembly code that mirrors a loop.. But I don't really understand the big picture of it! Why are we required to learn these subjects? I feel like the time would be much better spent for a CS major to actually be programming large projects rather than spending a lot of my time finding out how to use these specific instructions.

It does give me an idea about how a computer actually works and how memory works, but I feel like we are going way too in depth for it to be of much use. Is assembly or the concepts of CE used a lot for those who majors in CS? I'm assuming jobs like Western Digital or other embedded companies would use it a lot?

So how important is it? Should I be studying this material harder, because I've just been getting by with a bare understanding of it all. I know what some instructions do, but it is all so complex to me that I can't imagine using it unless I am given pretty specific instructions on what to do. For example, I know that a register is something you can store data in, and there are different types of these registers for different tasks depending on your architecture. But I don't really see how I would use that information outside of class assignments or projects. :("

Is money the dealbreaker for you? What would you accept lesser pay for? 

I lucked out and found a full time job with benefits, retirement, etc. at over $40k. But the more I work there the more I realize this particular job isn't right for me, even though the general industry is. I recently interviewed for a dream job where:

1. I interned for almost a year a few years ago (usually interns stay 3 months - I was working full time *as well* to support myself)
2. I had great relationships with the staff 
3. It was one of the best internships/jobs I've ever had

BUT I am well aware that the pay grade is a lot less than what I make now. It's closer to $22k-$26k. Which is a huge cut from where I'm at now. 

In my interview, the employer tried to make it clear that she could be generous and go above that (probably) but that I still may make less than where I'm currently at - she basically wanted to make sure that wasn't the biggest factor for me. So I made it clear that it wasn't.

But it's a significant drop in pay. I'm wondering - would you do it, if you felt you'd be happier at work? Doing something more geared towards your goals and ambitions? Doing something that you're already familiar with because you interned there and LOVED IT and are now finally getting the opportunity to be paid to love it? 

I just want to know what everyone's opinion is on this...in what scenario would you accept a salary reduction for a new job? "

My goal is moving to Germany once I have more experience, but ironically it's *harder* to find a job here if you have a degree. I've been unemployed for months.

**Question #1** Would it be pointless or too hard to look for a job in Germany right now, due to not having a lot of experience?

**Content:**

My name is Nicholas Zaharias, I’m a junior programmer at Dreamgate Studios based in Canberra Australia and we just recently launched our first title for mobile.

[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/light-in-the-dark/id857454465?mt=8) | [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgatestudios.lightinthedark) | [WinPhone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/light-in-the-dark/3d2a9e2f-c507-446c-aa4f-19a39bafcaa3)

Whilst I was studying I was always curious about what it would be like to be developing games, so I figured It might would do a post to:

a) Answer any questions people might have for someone who just made the leap from studying to developing.

b) Promote the first released game I’ve ever worked on.

-----

A little bit about myself; I’ve been studying programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment here in Canberra for the past two years and three months ago I landed an internship at Dreamgate Studios. After being with the company for two months they offered myself and the other interns the roles of junior programmers/artists within the studio to work on their game Light in the Dark which we just released on the 15th.

I came into the studio near completion of the game with the task of working with the other interns to create a content pack to be released after the games launch. This involved prototyping new mechanics, creating new levels and re-theming the art and animations. In addition to this I have been doing testing, bug fixing and level designing to help get the main game out the door for its release.

So far the experience has been amazing and has helped confirm that I want to develop games for a living as I was always a bit nervous that I might get into a studio and end up hating it. I’ll say that the most rewarding things to have come out of it from a programmers perspective are; having code reviews, working on an existing code base and tracking down and fixing bugs.

I’ll be available to answer any questions you have. I also have available the other juniors who said they would be happy to answer questions as well.

I've learned a lot, on the entire stack. I know my way around PHP+MySQL, Node.js + MongoDB, as well as the front-end. I've also been exposed minimally to app development(ios).
Although I like web-development, my concern is that I haven't gotten exposed to other fields enough, to where I can say, ""Yes, I definitely want to stay in web development"". There are so many other areas I'd like to at least try in the industry, like game-programming, systems programming (and all that it includes, like OS, security, etc), Application development in C++ (like browsers and more), and much more... I know I can easily get into App Dev for iOS and Android, but that's not that interesting to me.

So, after 2 years, how hard is it to switch into any field? I got into web development by starting to learn it myself, and then finding an internship while in school, but there's no way I can afford that route again. Do employers train, and provide good pay (after you graduate)? What's expected from an entry-level position employee?

My school decided to focus on C and Java, and I know my way around both, but not C++. I've also ventured into Python, LISP, Scheme(Racket), Haskell, and I'm currently taking a Grad Course on ML, which is a lot of fun (, but I'm not planning on getting my Masters).

What other areas are out there that you have enjoyed, and are approachable.

I'm starting research this coming year, and plan on doing research the summer of 2015 as well (either at my university or an REU if I get one).

I'm not worried about grades or GRE, and I should have two solid research-based letters assuming I do something over summer (and a third from a professor I tutor for).

How fatal is it that I'll only have a single year of research when I apply? I can also do a 5 years combined Masters program to give myself an extra year to have a more competitive application, but I'm doing my undergrad on a scholarship and I'd prefer to not have to pay for school.

What if I had a publication? Would that help?

Edit: Maybe some extra info about myself is needed. I'm usually a really good student, except my first quarter when I had a 3.38. I've since brought it up to a 3.90. I go to a pretty good CS school (Top ~15) on a full engineering scholarship, but I didn't really consider a PhD/research until this summer. I also tutor. I definitely plan on taking graduate courses, but I probably won't be able to start until my fourth year. I'm also a math minor (stats) hoping to get into an AI program.

I applied through the formal process, wrote a VERY specific cover letter that had a scanned copy of my signature, and didn't personally know anyone at the organization.

Sorry for all the exclamation marks...I am really happy and excited!!!!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT: Wow I didn't know this would get so many upvotes! Ahh! Thanks for all the kind words everyone. Also, just a note, I AM A WOMAN! Why does everyone assume I am a man? This bugs me.** 

Anyways, since Everyone is asking what I studied and how I went about the process, here it is:

**School/Background** I just finished my Masters, which was a policy degree focused on international issues. In terms of past experience, I had no full time work experience. I did an internship at the UN last year, and 3 consulting projects for real clients as part of my coursework. Since the job asked for 1-2 years of work experience (which I don't have), I think the internship and these projects counted for something when they made their decision. I finished classes in April, graduated in June, and was looking for a job for around 5 months and just got my first offer, which I accepted. 

**Networking** This was a key part of the process for me. I paid for LinkedIn premium so that I could send Inmails to people not in my network. I met many people this way, most were receptive and helpful. I'd introduce myself briefly and say I'm interested in the place they are working at, and would like to meet for a 20-30 minute coffee sometime in the next two weeks. Or I would stalk people on the websites of companies and email them asking to meet. Then I would ask THEM to introduce me to other people to go on more coffees with. WHen I applied to a job, I would look up the hiring manager and try to write to their personal email or LinkedIn to introduce myself (I got an interview by doing this). After these networking meetings, I would send a handwritten thank you card to their workplace telling them how I appreciate their time and look forward to keeping in touch. And then of course, I did regular job apps too. I ended up getting this job just randomly, it was a position I applied to off of a job board and they liked my app enough to interview me. 

**Cover Letter/Resumes:** I would always address it to a real human being (used internet to stalk who the hiring manager or HR was). I would also include an address before my letter started (like a normal letter format, but no one does this), and write the title of the person, their department, and the FULL address. Content-wise, I used one or two examples to show how I have the skills they want (and I used exactly what is in the job ad), and tried to include a line about why that job/subject matter in particular drew me to the position. I ended the letter with a signed copy of my signature to show that I went the extra mile. Under the ""Skills/Qualifications"" header in my resume, I would mimick what's in the job posting to show I catered my resume to the job. 

**Interview** went great, I prepared like crazy and read past reports to reference, which showed I was prepared. I smiled a lot, tried not to be nervous, and for everything they asked me I had stories/examples prepared. I went in with a typed out list of questions that I had for them (4-5), which were specific to the job duties (i.e. clarifying something in the job ad), or more big-picture questions about the future plans of the organization. They said at the end of my interview that I had strong presentation skills and had good questions for them. 

**After the interview**, I mailed a handwritten thank you card to each of the two people who interviewed me, even though they both work in the same room. 

A week or so later, they asked for references, and the day after I got this offer! Woo! "

I'm a soon-to-be 2nd year in my uni's Computer Game Science program, and the past school year was entirely centered on learning Python. I loved it, and while Python is great, I wanted to learn a language that I could use to get an internship at some point in the next few years.

Since June, I have been reading through a C++ book (Absolute C++). This is the first game that I've written in the language after doing a few sample problems throughout my reading. I'd appreciate any constructive criticism that you may have! I really hope to keep going strong and once I get through most of this book, I want to start using SFML or SDL to program games with graphics and other features.

I'm just a little overwhelmed because there's all these CMS platforms, different mark up languages, and the whole topic of SEO/Analytics/Marketing/Social media. 

So what's the standard procedure with this career? Obviously learn HTML and CSS like a pro? Should I focus efforts on any one thing in specific like Drupal or WordPress or just straight development, or everything? If everything, where should I start? 

I did an internship working with WordPress and learned quite a lot about installing, configuring, plugins, linking to social media, etc, etc. It was very cool. Lately I've been using XAMPP to mess with local Drupal installs to see how it compares to WordPress. 

Well, thanks a lot. Sorry if this question has been asked a million times, but I'd really appreciate opening it as a discussion in this thread so I can build on people's responses.

2gotq3,1,2014-09-17,Workplace verbal and/or physical abuse: Is it normal or okay?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2gotq3/workplace_verbal_andor_physical_abuse_is_it/,"I have been out of work for almost a year, and I thought I had a job at a place that stated I was an unpaid intern and refused to pay anyone the minimum wage. I got one of the officers to walk out and blow the whistle because I worked there for four months with zero pay.

I blew the whistle to DOL.

I also took a job at a store in which the manager, who was a 23 year old from East Africa and had parents in NY cursed me out the day I filled out my I-9 and W-4 forms, being cursed at, he screamed 'Jesus F Christ and Hurry the F up after calling me in on my off day and demanding I spend two hours with no compensation filling out a second copy of federal forms I had already filled out in front of the owner.


I walked out and refused to work for them since they would not compensate me and I refuse to be cursed at by a African immigrant who thinks its okay to cuss at people all day and use Jesus Christ in his expletives, calling me stupid. After I walked out, they called and said they 'no longer needed me like I hadn't just basically quit by walking out without asking first.'

Then I got hired by a Bank, strictly a new bank in this area I just moved to. 

There was a 19 year old girl who talked about getting drunk every day. She was mean and nasty and insulted me when I was asked about my kids during lunch. She tried to find out about my personal life and I asked her to stop asking me questions about my disabled child. Coincidentally, this girl also has family in NY.

She is Puerto Rican, and decided to call me a bitch, saying fuck this and fuck that to me and screaming at me for refusing to tell her about my personal life.

I reported it to the Bank and for the second time this year I am again reporting abuse and retaliation to DOL. I moved to get away from the scandal and now here is the problem again, loud and clear.

This happened in TRAINING mind you, the branch personell were awesome. But I won't be joining them and I feel used and discriminated against.

Mark my words. I am super glad Santander Bank doesn't want me, because I refuse to be abused in the workplace. I also do not want to get set up by vindictive, criminal employees. The girl that got me fired also stated she 'wanted to stab her Marine boyfriend's face out' out loud and everyone thought the statement was dangerous. 

I am angry and I have 3 W-2's from 3 different financial workplaces. I am scared because I don't know what's wrong. I was also laid off from my Family's Firm because my stepfather slapped me at work and my unemployment is long ran out. I need a job where I can be safe and not treated like dirt by abusive people from other countries.

Is it normal to be cursed at and abused at work?


Am I somehow attracting this abuse?


I am a grown adult, I just want a job to be able to support my family and not be screamed at, cussed at, or abused at work. Since the incident with my family it seems like I am caught working with mean, violent young people who drink and do drugs.

Mind you, NEITHER of these companies ever did a drug screen. 

BOTH told me I must be on direct deposit but I don't have any accounts.

I had to pass an FBI background check to get this job and I spent a lot of money in commutes that I will not get reimbursed. I am horrified and shocked at how I was treated, and about how there's no cameras on the employees, only the patrons.


I am beginning to think if I want work I must learn to take being cursed out, cussed at, etc.

Mind you I am not going to work for a bank who places employees in danger and punishes the reporting process like Santander. I can see why their ex-CEO left.

It seems like feeling comfortable in my own skin is a luxury that I might never be able to afford.  Even though I have health insurance, it does not pay for anything related to gender dysphoria.  Not even psychotherapy.  I can go to a gender psychologist for ""depression,"" which I actually do have, but there seem to be no psychologists within a two-hour driving distance who take my insurance and treat both conditions.  This is crazy.  

I'm spending what little money I do have to go to a local technical college because I'm worried that I won't have any health insurance at all three years from now.  The unemployment rate in my city is so high that it's like we're stuck in the recession.  My girlfriend has had an associate's degree in pharmacy technology for half a year now, and she's looked everywhere locally for a job in her field.  All she's been able to get are a couple of stressful waitressing jobs that have driven her to suicidal ideation each time.

I, myself, have looked for local internship jobs in my field (engineering technology).  Nothing.  I'm worried that I've chosen the wrong major, but it was so hard to find a major at my technical college that actually might not make me miserable for the rest of my life.  Should I just hang onto this major and hope for the best?  Should I switch to something miserable for the money? 
 
My school presents me with various problems.  They waited five weeks into the school year to give me my financial aid, which is less than what they told me I was getting.  I had to borrow money from my mom, who didn't communicate to me until we got into a crisis situation that she needed the money for bills.  Why she's that bad at communication is beyond my comprehension.  If I had known, I wouldn't have accepted the money.  Of course, during the crisis situation, she blamed our financial problems on me.

My new public speaking teacher is mind-blowingly incompetent and possibly discriminatory.  If I drop his class, I will lose my financial aid.  If I lose my financial aid, I won't have health insurance three years from now.  I can't tell if this guy is stupid or evil; I'm guessing it's a mix of both.  He only answers some of my emails, and he answers them poorly.  If I ask two questions, for example, he might only answer one.  Some of his answers are cryptic, some of them repeat what I already said I did, and sometimes he flat-out ignores my messages.  He promised me an appointment at his office today and didn't show up.  He also has terrible grammar, leaves careless errors in his assignments, and forced us to buy two textbooks that he wrote with the same carelessness.  He also believes that stress isn't real because it's the result of personal irresponsibility.  Two of my cisgender male friends told me that he answers their emails clearly and on time.  One of them showed me an example response, and now I have have a suspicion that this guy has it out for one of the demographics that I belong to.  His reviews on ratemyprofessor.com are polarized, with some people saying that he was helpful and responsive and others mentioning everything I'm experiencing.  I'm worried that if I report my professor for anything, he'll retaliate. 

Because I'm so dysphoric, I find maintaining a normal social life to be impossible.  Because this place is socially conservative and transgender people are only brought up in cruel jokes, I feel subhuman.  Because it takes money to move and more money to stay there, I feel trapped in this city.  Because my bad teacher is the only public speaking teacher at my school, I have to stick with him.  Because I have to stick with him until December, I feel like I'm renting out my soul to the devil.  

Did I mention that I have an anxiety attack every speech day because of my anxiety disorder?

When I meet people with comparatively easy lives who take it all for granted, it makes me want to show them what pain is.

I don't know how to adequately express the depths of my suffering.  I've been under so much stress lately that I feel as though my heart is encased in white plaque.  A word that sometimes repeats itself in my head is ""relief.""  Relief, relief, relief, relief.  I want relief so badly.  Sometimes I wonder where my relief will come from.  Will it come from getting the psychological and medical treatment I need years from now, or will it come from me relieving myself with death?"
2gp9wg,13,2014-09-17,Recently graduated and need help deciding what to do with my life...,FunkyMonk92,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2gp9wg/recently_graduated_and_need_help_deciding_what_to/,"Hey guys,

I'm writing here because like a lot of people on this subreddit, I'm not sure what to do with my life right now. Let me start by saying that I graduated in May with a B.S. degree in biomedical engineering. However, during my time in college I gained practically no real world experience in the field. I never did an engineering-related internship or co-op. I realize now that that was a big mistake. Once I graduated and started applying for jobs, I found it difficult to even find an entry-level job in the biomedical field. I'm from Iowa and my options are fairly limited in the biotech/biomedical industry, so I also started applying to jobs in surrounding states. For months I've been applying to anything that could be entry-level and related to biology or engineering. Fast forward to September and I am still jobless, teetering on depressed.

I really don't know what to do at this point. It's frustrating to have spent so much time on an expensive degree and not be able to secure a job after graduation. I'm angry at myself for not getting an internship before graduating. This whole experience has me almost reconsidering whether or not I ever really wanted to be biomedical engineer. There was a time during my sophomore year that I actually considered switching my major but I never did it. I wonder now if maybe I made the wrong move by staying in it. I have some interest in computer programming (C++, Java) which I discovered during some of my engineering courses, though my skills are probably at a beginner level right now.

 I just really don't know where my passion is or what I'm truly interested in anymore. What if I wasted 4 years of my life doing something that will never pay off? Whenever I try and think about what I want to do, I just know that I want to do something that has a positive effect on other people's lives. For biomedical engineering that could be helping to design a medical device that doctors can use to treat their patients with. For a software developer it could be developing the newest groundbreaking app that transforms how people interact with one another. I want to have an effect on the world. I just don't know how or why. 

Sorry for rambling on but I'm just not sure what to do right now. I hope someone sees this and can give me some advice. Thanks!

Unimpressive GPA,JDLY,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gpd21/resumecover_letter_question_unimpressive_gpa/,"Background info: I'm currently in the start of my 4th year at college studying Aerospace Engineering, with plans to graduate after a total of 4.5 years. I was one of those people who skated through high school and wound up in college without ever really developing study skills, and of course my grades suffered. I've been getting better, but my last semester wasn't great and I currently have a GPA of 2.24.

There's a Career Fair coming up, and ideally I'd be looking for an internship next summer, ideally at Rockwell Collins, due to location.

My questions are: is there anything I can do to improve my resume, given my lackluster GPA? And should I attempt to explain, perhaps in a cover letter, a reason for my low GPA, or would that seem to much like making excuses?

My work experience, in short:

Nearly 7 years (started at age 14) experience at a local grocery store stocking shelves, bagging groceries, and taking them to customers' cars. So working with a wide variety of people, including customers; so lots of development of interpersonal skills.

And just about 7 months experience working at a Campus IT center at my university, taking calls and working with people over the phone, repairing computers either remotely or in-house."

I've done two internships, 

I did my first unpaid internship (bad idea, I know) last summer at a local, mediocre web development startup with a manager who knew nothing about coding and a lead programmer who was a student like me. I wrote little PHP and JavaScript, learned very little, and spent most of my time having to do HTML, CSS, and working on unfinished projects.

I recently finished an internship with a sizable web hosting provider doing ""Dev Support"" which has mostly consisted of navigating around UNIX servers with Putty, and writing a bunch of SQL statements to fix errors (and sometimes looking at/editing Perl scripts). Not much programming though.

Most of my personal projects have been web applications, so I feel that's kind of the environment I'm most comfortable with and the one I'd be more likely to apply to.

Anyways, here's my resume: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9161585/Blank%20Resume%20Sep2014.pdf

However, I have a few questions and apprehensions about it. 

I've read a lot about how getting a job as a programmer is a living nightmare. Is it true? Is it really that bad?

One of the main reasons I wanted to become a programmer/web developer in the first place was having a remote job. I want to be able to have flexibility about my location, whether it's just travelling, vacation, actual living, whatever. It makes sense to me that of all jobs, working with computers all day on a global network (internet) would allow this, but to be honest I don't know if that's common in the CS industry. How feasible would it be for me to get a remote job as a programmer/web developer? 

I know in some industries, having a bachelor's degree isn't really enough to get you a job. Is it the same with CS? Should I try to get an internship before I graduate? Should I assemble a portfolio? Do I need a master's degree? What extra steps do I need to take to get a good job? 

Lastly, I feel the need to mention that the only programming experience I have is on my own -- no formal education. I feel like I got decently far for someone completely on their own from ground zero, but I have little way of knowing, really. I remember being incredibly frustrated, and most of the time my hands-on experience just involved me trying to figure out what the problem was with what little code I could construct on my own. I don't know if I just suck, or that's just pretty much how it goes with programming. 

**TL;DR**: Is programming/web development in the real world really hell on earth? What are the chances of getting a remote job as a programmer/web developer? How important is an internship/lab experience with a career in computer science? "

Basically my project is a reprogrammable combination lock using a number pad. A 5 digit password is set in one location and each digit is saved in its own line of data stored in a memory bank using t flip-flops. At another location is another number pad, this one used to open a locked door. The password entered at this location is saved into a similar memory bank. Then each bit of data is compared to its corresponding bit from the original memory bank using Xnor gates. Each output is then ran through AND gates.

2gpvw0,7,2014-09-17,"24, still studying, struggling to get career started",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2gpvw0/24_still_studying_struggling_to_get_career_started/,"Really could use some advice, getting disheartened with strings of interviews that don't amount to much, heres the rundown:

* Left school wanting to join the military
* Mental health issues popped up (anxiety, depression) etc which basically left me housebound for 4 years.
* Started distance studying toward an IT/Business degree (the University is held in fairly high regard by employers as it shows a lot of self motivation), 1 year left of study, predicted a 2:1 which I'll be trying to push to a 1st
* Finally got an unpaid internship at a tech startup doing primarily digital marketing, lasted 6 months, and now we're at today

I'm now 24, have a year left of study to do which I plan to do while working full time. I can't really afford to spend another 6 months doing an unpaid internship, as intern turnover in marketing/business development in the tech startup industry seems to be massive. Paid on the other hand would allow me to relocate to the city (1 hour commute, current city of residence is a dead-end unless I want to do insurance), and show a decent level of investment in me on the company's behalf. I've interviewed for some decent, well established companies (marketing agencies and such), but my lack of experience seems to boil down to a no. I feel as though I interview well and come across confidently (or so I've been told), but when I have to sit there and try to explain why I've had no major longterm work, and I'm 24, I'm sure alarm bells ring.

My goals are pretty wide open right now, I love digital marketing, and the small amount of business development I've gotten to do, and would be happy to get my foot in the door of either role. The problems are, when asked about my job history, I have to blag about travelling and what not (hardly going to say ""I was a complete mess for 4 years and was heavily medicated""), I also don't have a traditional CV (UK so, A levels -&gt; brick uni -&gt; grad scheme is the norm) and only have about 9 months relevant work experience in marketing/biz dev.

I've had a fair few interviews, some even seemed genuinely more interested in me because of my non-traditional CV, but tying anything down is tough, I suspect because I'm not a safe option. But right now my choices are, find paid work/internship in the areas I'm interested in, or find paid work just to keep my head afloat which severely limits any jobhunting/interviewing/networking I can do. I'm desperate to get into full time work and start my career, but I'm also reluctant to take intern positions that don't pay, as financially it would be a dangerous move and also I find it hard to believe that half the companies who want unpaid interns with claims there are potential jobs at the end of it, really do have any intention of hiring an intern?"

2gqat9,1,2014-09-17,Could I realistically get into one of these 'big named' tech companies?,cscquestion1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gqat9/could_i_realistically_get_into_one_of_these_big/,"Hey There

I'll try to make my backstory brief.  I graduated in December of 2012 from a state school in Illinois with a Bachelor's in Business Administration.  After graduation I started a job as a technical recruiter.  That's what originally gained my interest in computer science.  

I enrolled this fall in an associates program for Web Software Development from a small-town technical college.  It's a two year program.  Before you ask why I didn't simply pursue a Masters, 1) 50K is heaps more than the 7K total I'll be paying for this, and 2) I didn't have a computer science background, so I would have to take some prerequisites that would delay the process.  I'm 26, I need to get this show on the road.

My question to you is, if I get good grades, have impeccable soft skills, and partake in some 'self study' projects to put on my resume, do I have a shot at getting an internship next summer at one of those big name companies that this subreddit loves so much?  Also- do you think having my previous experience (for the last 1.5 years) as a technical recruiter will make other recruiters not willing to call me?"
2gqfdz,4,2014-09-18,I've been a 'programmer analyst' for about 6 months and I hate it. Am I not cut out for any CS related job at all?,narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gqfdz/ive_been_a_programmer_analyst_for_about_6_months/,"TL:DR: I'm a 24 year old programmer analyst. I feel useless at work because I don't know enough about the proprietary language used and the constant repairs that have no end in sight. Is this what being a developer is all about?

--

I'm 24 years old and this is the second job I've held. I had plans to stick with this job for a year but I think the final nail has been driven into the coffin. I'll explain why. Hopefully you can give me some insight because this situation depresses me to no end. I go to work sad and I leave angry. I believe it has to do more with me than the job itself, but I'll get to explaining.

I've been working in a credit union as a programmer analyst for about 6 months now. I was unemployed after completing a 6 month internship as a software testing engineer. I was in this stint for 4 months, then I landed my current job for 48k a year. I know that's on the low end of a CS-related career, but I guess I was desperate since other places looking for developers would interview me but reject me later on in the interview process.

My job entails the following:

1) I work with proprietary code nobody has heard of before to fix bugs in this particular piece of software made for tellers. I also receive 'change requests' to add features or to modify established features. All of this is done in the proprietary code and ghetto 'window maker' GUI that reminds me of a horrid knockoff of Photoshop.

2) I receive tickets from the help desk about folks having issues with the software, and I'm expected to find and resolve said issues. I am provided logs of what the software was doing. The problem I run into reading these logs is that, even after 6 months, I have little idea on how to solve any of these problems, and it doesn't help the proprietary language has a strange restriction requiring all variables never exceeding 8 characters. Because of this, there are acronyms everywhere and no reference aside from asking a coworker about it.

3) Generate SQL reports or create SQL scripts. This is my favorite part of the job because it's something I'm somewhat familiar with when everything else seems so foreign to me after this whole time. It makes me happy I can google some issues I run into and dig though stackoverflow for leads. If my whole job was this, I wouldn't mind at all.

4) Kind of a business-related thing, but I have to help out when branches have cash outages. I'm still lost about what to do when these happen, and there's a handy script someone wrote to help out, however it doesn't work all the time and asking more experienced coworkers about it ends up with them explaining to me the most arcane stuff about the credit union that I'm more lost than I was before I asked for help.

If I ever had an inferiority complex, it's rearing its head at this job. I feel so useless and forced to work on software that the higher ups keep bickering about what they want changed about it. This makes my team upset, so they curse amongst themselves, and I'm left confused and wondering why folks care so much about the software when it's supposed to be liquid and constantly changing. Granted, I dislike the idea of working on such software, but I'm nowhere near as impassioned about it as my coworkers. This makes me sad because I feel I'm too apathetic.

Of course, my apathy stems from being confused about what I should be doing to begin with. The team leader assigns me 'easy' issues, but they end up being 30 + hour ordeals that, just now, make me wonder what am I working toward by staying in such a place?

I heard working in the finance sector was at the lower end of the totem pole of CS jobs, but I figured I needed the experience. My optimism died over time and now I want out.

I'm upset because i feel what I'm learning is useless outside of where I work (and this is the truth). As a 6'2"" black man, I feel out of place with my coworkers who are all short and white. This becomes more jarring when one of them gets angry at another group. I think to myself how folks would react if I got mad. Someone would probably call the cops.....

Another thing that bothers me is how much of a cog I feel like in a bigger machine. Because the software constantly needs to be changed or updated, I'm here for that and I suppose that means job security. However, even after 6 months, I don't feel like I'm good enough to do some of these things by myself aside from writing SQL scripts. The Proprietary language makes me want to smash my computer. Reading the legacy code and being expected to fix or change something in it makes me lose my mind. Seeing something like NINS1 or DDADNA2 or XPRNTLOY makes things far more convoluted than what they need to be.

Then I'm given bugs and more bugs to look at. Regardless of how they may seem easy to the team leader, who isn't a programmer at all, they're not to me and I have to say I feel borderline incompetent at admitting that.

This job is basically me given tons of bugs, and sitting in my cubicle. My coworkers seem to enjoy it, but I picture myself putting a bullet in my head literally. I lack the near-decade experience or the straight up enthusiasm for the tasks.

Now I'm looking for jobs. Someone at a recruiting agency contacted me for a web developer position in another city down the highway about 15-20 minutes away. I went along with the application process and now I'm waiting to be contacted. And I'll admit I'm nervous since this new opportunity apparently leads to me being trained to be an expert Rails developer.

It's about 1 AM and I'm falling asleep, but if anyone has any advice on whether or not I should keep searching for jobs, or suck it up and potentially smashing my computer with a baseball bat, I'm all ears. This issue is real and  I absolutely hate it and myself."

The problem is back in the late 80's most of their standard details were drawn in some software that predates AutoCAD, and then everything was transferred to AutoCAD at some point in the 90's. That now unknown program, or perhaps the transfer process, set all text to 5/64"". 

To me, it just looks off. They don't match the text size from architects we work with. I was taught 3/32"" was the proper standard text size for drawings in college, and every internship and job I've had has conformed to that. I have most viewport size conversions memorized for 3/32"". I realize we're talking 1/64"", but it is actually 16% bigger, which is surprisingly noticeable.

However, despite all the internet research I've done, I can't actually find any official industry standards to support this. I've read a lot of AutoCAD forums and such that agree, but nothing I can hand my boss and say please, let me fix our 30 year old standards, which would be a couple days work, tops.

Anyone have any evidence or just thoughts on the issue? Much appreciated."

[I saw from your answer in another thread how you work with pudding.  What does your job entail?  Pudding, for me, starts at the factory and ends in a snack pack.  What else goes into that process?  How much research is involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/ckl7tr6?context=5)|The company I work for does a dry pudding mix, like the Jell-O boxes you see in the store.
 |I'll give you a rundown of a typical day. Partner and I enter the lab, login, and look last session's notes and samples. At the end of each session we evaluate the prototypes and decide if we are satisfied with the results. If we are, we look at the next area of improvement. Flavor is good? Great, now how do we get it to not look like baby poop. If not, we guesstimate why it isn't where we want it to be and how we might get there. It still has that off-flavor. Why does it still have the off-flavor? Is it the milk? Is the starch? This can involve calling up supply companies, the client, and professors to try and understand what's happening and why. Supply companies are one of the greatest resources for someone working in product development. They are the experts when it comes to ingredients and how the perform with other ingredients.
 |Once we know the goal for the day, make it not look like poop, we try to figure out what might be causing the undesirable quality, or produce the desirable quality. Color comes from cocoa powder used, try different cocoa powders and try adding colors. If we don't have what we need, call up suppliers and order samples.
 |Now that we've decided to try adding coloring agents, it's time to make some dry-mixes. We print out formulations for the original product, our current lab standard, and however many prototypes we're going to try. For the colors we'll do a batch at the recommended level, provided by the supplier or research. Then it's time to weight everything out, dry-blend, and mix. We evaluate the batches during blending, mixing, immediately after, and at recommended eating.
 |Evaluating means seeing how they mix, their consistency, flavor, after-taste, appearance, etc. It's important to check everything, because .005g of a color in a 200g batch doesn't seem like a lot, and it makes it look rich and not poopy, but then you taste it and get a nasty chemical aftertaste.
 |Then cycle repeats itself. We keep the prototypes for a day or two to see how they hold up under refrigeration. Some formulas work great while mixing and 15 minutes after, but by the next day things have started to separate and you have a layer of water on your pudding. Ich. Or the new flavor has appeared/disappeared.
 |So, mostly my work consists of making educated guesses, getting other to make educated guess, mixing up a lot of pudding, and then badgering the other labs and random passerby's to try it. While they try our five new puddings, we sit there and take notes on their reactions and what they say.
 |Once we have something that we and the client both like, we send it to a sensory lab for a consumer panel. Basically invite a bunch, 50-100, people from the target demographic to try some free food and give them a few bucks for their time. Then the lab collects the data into a understandable format and sends it to us. We and the client have a meeting and they say 'Yes. We are satisfied with this.' or 'Hmm, maybe it could be a little bit... you know... something.' Either way, we go back to the bench-top to do more on that project or they hand us a new one. Like chocolate cake mix. That's going to be our next project.
 |Though it's mostly hands on, there is a lot of research that goes into ordering samples. There are so many possible ingredients you need a basic understanding of how they will interact so you can narrow your orders down. You also need to research the suppliers. What are their prices? How reliable are they? Where do they source from? Is that source reliable? Any regional conflicts that may disrupt the supply? What experiences have other companies had with them? A lot of this involves calling people, friends, old class-mates, etc. It's actually rather gossipy.
 |Hope that answered some of your question.
[Very enlightening!  Is it safe to say that every processed food has a few food scientists who perfected it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cklakrf?context=5)|Probably. The cookies and other baked items you see in the store from a local place likely haven't, but if it's canned, boxed, frozen, or bottled we've had our hand in it somewhere. If nothing else double-checking the recipe and packaging to make sure it's legal. Lot of small companies get in trouble for not labeling allergens correctly, and it costs them big time. 
[Reminds me of Breaking Bad during the Gale phase.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cklejmr?context=5)|I haven't actually watch it...
 |I know, shun the unbeliever, shunnn!
[Isn't it pretty true that if you change the formula to make it look less ""poopy"" that you would change or worsen the desired taste?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cko0u2v?context=5)|Potentially. Or it could make it even better, or you might not notice at all and then someone else tells you it tastes horrible. That's way it takes so many prototypes to get 'right'. Any change to one part of the system has the potential to change other parts.
 |In our case the poop problem turnout out to be pretty easy, use a different cocoa, and it improved the taste too. 
[Not necessarily. Even local shops often buy mixes, very much similar to those boxed cake mixes, just packaged in larger bags. Scratch bakeries are few and far between.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cklflg0?context=5)|You are right, many do. It's really on a company by company basis. In my area, the local bakeries are scratch bakeries, at least the ones that I know enough to know one way or the other. 
[Whenever you get around to it, it's very good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cklg8gv?context=5)|The biggest barrier is that it seems a bit dark for my tastes. I'm more of a Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, My Little Pony sort of guy. 
[I've got to know what you wanted to be when you were growing up? And how you ended up being a pudding doctor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/ckllkiy?context=5)|Not doctor yet. One day. For now I am satisfied with my lab title Eternal King of Pudding! (My name's Eric)
 |Growing up I wanted to run Madagascar, because it was obviously the coolest country ever! It's name is mad-a-gas-car! Also, it has monkeys and stuff.
 |Then I wanted to be a marine biologist, because the Newport Aquarium in Oregon is super cool.
 |Then I wanted to be in the Foreign Service, but realized I hated upper level political theory classes and politics makes me sad and there are no jobs for B.S. in International Relations. Doing a paper I learned about our university's Food Science program's work with increasing food safety and stability in South America, and thought it was cool. Did some more looking around and realized that food is super international and there are plenty of good paying jobs for Food Scientists, so I switched from poli-sci to food science, and the first day of class, before the change went through, my organic chemistry professor asked who the poli-sci major was and if I was sure I was in the right building.
 |From there I studied, and studied, and got an internship with a company. While there they we doing some in-house evaluation and decided that they didn't like their chocolate pudding. I mentioned that a formulation improvement would make an awesome capstone for my program and they could hire a fully-equipped set of labs and a whole team of students with faculty support for cheap, and we'd do the work for them. Thus the great pudding project began. After the first round of development the client, current/former boss, said, 'Tis good, but needs more... deliciousness. Continue minions.' Thus, new minions were hired to replace those who were lost, because summer, and I initiated them into the mysteries of pudding. Another round of tests was conducted, and the client said 'It is good, but we've got this vanilla pudding, and cake mix, and hot cocoa, and we'd like to use the same ingredients in as many as possible, and while you're at it...'
 |And so it came to pass that mission creep happened, and a single semester project did turn into nine months. I'm planning on re-taking the Foreign Service Exam soon and hope to one day work on the agricultural portion of free-trade agreements. 
[How likely is it that a company could/would falsify calorie content or other nutritional data? Could you cover it up with science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/ckldyut?context=5)|Not sure how likely it would be to intentionally falsify information, but I know it happens unintentionally all the time. Testing costs money, so companies rely on publications from companies that list the average nutrient content of an ingredient. A program called Genesis is frequently used for this. Company plugs ingredients into program, program spits out best guess. Company says, 'close enough.' I've yet to use Genesis and have it give an accurate estimate.
 |Now, the FDA is supposed to regulate companies and conduct testing to verify claims, but they are overwhelmed and so it's basically an honor system. You said this is what's in there, we'll believe you until evidence shows us otherwise. If you do get called on though, by government or another company, you better have ironclad paperwork showing you did due diligence in testing and labeling accurately or they can assume you misled them intentionally. Most companies require suppliers to supply certificates of analysis proving that the product has what it claims it have. That way if if something happens, responsibility can be bumped to the supplier.
 |You can't cover it up if some else tests your product and finds that you're wrong/lying. They had your product and these are the results they got. You can generate paperwork showing that you regularly tested the product and everything was fine, but that doesn't negate outside tests, just means there has to be more investigation.
 |A rather troubling example of how inaccurate labels can be in the US. A grad student, who was a TA of mine at the time, was doing some testing of powdered milk. She tested the Vitamin A, I believe, could have been B, levels of different brands and batches. Vitamin levels were anything from 30%-300%+ of the listed value. How much of this was due to batch variances, misinformation, or degradation over time, who can say. Trouble is, it was still there.
 |Now, for an example of obviously dangerous adulteration and covering it up, I direct you too [Chinese Milk Scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal_) China's food industry is still something of a wild west. 
[How did u get a job like that? Food science major here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2goy0p/i_am_a_food_scientist_ama/cklq34i?context=5)|Someone asked me a similiar question elsewhere, hope you don't mind me reusing the answer.
 |Spring of 2013 I was looking for an internship. I sent resumes in for 127 positions that I qualified for. I heard back from 3, and they were no's. I spent the entire summer looking for work and got nothing in my field. It was really discouraging.
 |Then, at the end of august, one of my professors sent out an email about a company needing an intern. Professors, especially if they've worked in industry are a great resource. I sent my resume and called them up. I was working two days later. The internship turned into my capstone project, which turned into a job with a lab on campus working for the internship company, and an offer of full-time employment with a mutual supplier.
 |Lesson from this, use connections. The food industry is very interconnected. Labs, producers, and suppliers all know and talk to each other. Find your local [ift](http://www.ift.org/) chapter and get plugged in. People hire people they know and friends of people they know. Most openings aren't advertised, and if they are, it is often a formality so they can show they searched, but they already have their person.
 |This isn't to say without connections you're sunk, but they help, a lot.

Yet when a tech gets to the printer the problem is gone and so is the person that had the problem. Hence the person that had the problem did several things that are known to be impossible. 

First of all they read the error message, and then fixed said problem without disassembling or destroying the printer in the process. I just don't understand how this is happening.

Any advice on working well and showing off? I'm a likable guy and am sociable etc so I hopefully should work ok.

Any other advice?

Thanks for your help - this sub is great"

I have no relevant work experience apart from some Clerical Assistant work I did at a university, which involved me basically formatting SQL code. 

I have one project on the go using the Riot API which I can use, but I have unfortunately spent most the summer on a project with a friend, which ended being partially good/elegant code (my part) but otherwise really redundant and poor code (his part). I'm talking reducing his 1800+ lines of code to ~300 lines of code. I don't really want to show anyone this project outside the small group of users.

I did however finish my first year with a *1st* (88.9% average for the year), but that doesn't really matter as much - most internships look for being on track for a *2.1*.

University is starting again in a week, and I want to start applying to internships soon. Should I dish out some more small projects? Any advice on what would be the best course of action?

Thanks in advance!"

How much misery is normal? I am a second-year student in a STEM Ph.D. program and I am very chronically unhappy. I am having trouble deciding how to proceed.

Reasons to leave:

(1) I absolutely hate my current research project. While I was promised a different project by my advisor when I began the program and this work was meant to be short summer project to get my feet wet, it has dragged on for over a year and a half I have still not begun my main thesis research (actually, this has morphed into my thesis research, but is only vaguely related to what we initially agreed upon).

(2) My advisor will not let me move on to the other project until I publish this research. However, I am not interested in this research (actually, I loathe it) and I think it has serious flaws which she does not acknowledge. It has already been rejected by one journal; I am doing major revisions for another. In fairness, the reviews have not been scathing.

(3)This project lies far outside her ordinary research scope and involves a method that is extremely intricate and technical. I am forced to fumble around in the dark and am berated for doing so, yet she will not provide technical assistance. (I have contacted others outside the department for occasional assistance and clarification.) Her solution to all of my proposed problems/issues is simply to work harder and do more experiments. However, my concerns about the method and the problems I have uncovered are never addressed. I am simply told I have a bad attitude (which is probably true at this point) and that ""no method is perfect."" 

(3)My advisor has a Jekyll and Hyde academic persona. One week I meet with her and I should do “X”. The next week I am berated for having wasted time doing “X”. It does not matter if the instruction to do “X” is in writing in an email; she simply says, “Well that is clearly not what I meant.” One week I am an excellent student; the next my work is “worthless.”

(4) I am miserable every day and have been diagnosed by the university health center with depression and anxiety. (I am no longer being actively treated for these things because the treatments were not effective and had unpleasant side effects.)

(5) I don’t even think I want a career in this field anymore.

(6)There is not another advisor that I could work with and retain my funding.

Reasons to stay:

(1) I have landed an extremely prestigious and well-paying external fellowship with paid summer internships at a government agency for the duration of my program. This is an amazing opportunity that I do not wish to forfeit.

(2) I passed my written comprehensive exam. That was a trying endeavor. Why let all that misery go to waste?

(3) I have completed all of my required coursework and will only be working on research. Maybe if I can finish this terrible project, I will move on to something more fulfilling.

(4) I feel extremely guilty for accepting fellowship money and my advisor's grant money and not finishing the program. 

(5) I have already left a Ph.D. program with an M.S. before in a vaguely related field, after transferring from another school. I will feel like an irrevocable failure if I cannot complete what I started this time. Also, I may not even be able to finish the M.S. in this program if I leave now.

(6)I don’t know what I want to do career-wise. If I leave I will face an uncertain job market. I have a decently well-paying fellowship right now. I might end up in an even more stressful situation.

I talked to my parents recently, and they're almost dead set in getting me to graduate (I'm an ME) by May 2016 because of financial reasons.

They don't seem to understand that I (we all) need to get experience to get a full time offer.


Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for their support. I just don't want to graduate with not enough experience. I am active in Engineers Without Borders also.

My questions:

1) IF I only get a co-op offer and no internship offer, would it be better in the long run to turn it down in order to graduate on time given the financial considerations? 

2) Would it be better to take out more student loans for an extra semester so I could do another co-op?

3) Would design team experience and only one co-op be sufficient for a full time offer after graduation assuming I don't delay graduation any more?


I know I'm sounding paranoid; I'd like to graduate sooner than later and get an internship over the summer. However, many of the job postings are for co-ops that would set me back in graduation. 


I know I should be dealing with this issue with my parents directly, but I'd like to get some opinions here also. Thoughts?"

My school only offered advanced placement in math, so naturally as a result since I was ""smart"" (compare to the rest of my redneck degenerate classmates) I ended up taking the year ahead of me and doing the honors classes.  Now while I was able to do them, and get decent grades at them, I never liked math.  Fucking hated it to be exact.  The classes I liked were ones like history and english.  But I always saw these as the ""easy"" classes and never took them too seriously.  

Once college hit I had no idea what I wanted to do, I was also a student athlete on scholarship to pay my way through college (could never have done it otherwise) and that consumed so much of my time, energy, and focus that I never gave much thought to what i wanted to do as a career.  I naturally went into computer science because I was generally good (or so I thought) with computers, math, it looked like the jobs paid well and I loved video games... so it was the only one that made sense to me.

Well I pretty much fucking absolutely hated every single class I took in college that pertained to my major. I wish I would have gotten out early but it got to a point where I was so far in I just decided to suck it up and tough it out to graduation, and maybe jobs in the field would be different.

I ended up getting an internship during my final year where I was doing application support engineering at a company, and I just transitioned that to be my main job.  It wasn't so bad at first, but I never found myself very motivated to do much studying outside what was required of my work (in other words, it's not at all in my list of hobbies to be programming on the side or reading technical documents or studying up on the latest APIs and such).  I just sort of did the job and did it well, but was never really able to advance my career much.  

Since then I've had a few jobs that are all pretty different in what my responsibilities were, but they were all in the computer science realm... and  I just can't fucking stand it anymore.  It's been becoming very relevant to me that the only type of people that can do well in this industry are people that thoroughly enjoy the subject matter, and just happen to know exactly how every little thing works in the IT world.

I can't stand any part of the job anymore - I hate the 24/7 on-call responsibilities, I hate all the clever little acronyms that are used, I hate having to call off plans because some server goes down, I hate having to massage every shitty ticketing systems just to make some fat cat execs happy, I hate having to deal with sociopathic clients who care about nothing other than another million dollars going into their pocket books, but most of all, I can't fucking stand computers anymore.  Anything to do with them, at all.  Networks, looking through code, troubleshooting different certs, blah blah blah.

I'm just so god damn burned out, and I'm at a point where I realize that I used to have such a passion and drive to work hard, but I just can't gather up the energy to do it anymore in a field I have absolutely zero passion for.

Unfortunately everything I'm interested in doesn't really make money.  I'm somewhere between the INFP and ISFP personality type, and the subjects that most interest me are writing, psychology, sociology, history, and music.  Unfortunately I just don't know what the fuck to do.  I've saved up maybe enough to get through half an undergraduate degree, but beyond that I'm a bit lost in what to do.  

Honestly I want to quit work so bad, I do feel like killing myself quite often with how much I hate going to work every day (and I work at the very least 9.5 hours a day 5 days a week, which has been true of pretty much every job in this shitty field).  I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.  Spending the majority of each day working jobs I absolutely despise.

I'm just looking for any sort of stories of people who were in similar situations and were able to start all over and be successful at it.  I want to know that it's possible and I'd love to know how you went about doing it.  Inspire me please, I haven't been inspired in many years :("

I waited in line for about 30-40 minutes to speak with a Northrop Grumman guy - he looked at my resume and said it looked fine since I had some experience in Java and C++.

He asked me if I had won the lottery and could have any job - what would my dream job look like? I responded with developing code I am truly interested in or video games. He then explained to me what programmers at NG do, comparing it to a video game, saying that they develop algorithms for stealth bombers to avoid detection.

He took my resume and asked for a second copy to show someone else, then he said they will be interviewing students next month and gave me an exact date to save. Also, he said if I can't make it that day it is okay and they can reschedule. I was also the very last student to talk to him since they were closing their booth. They said they would contact me through e-mail in a few weeks.

So a couple questions:

-Do you guys think I made a good impression? Or do you think they basically interview most candidates?

-Does anyone have experience getting an internship or working at NG? What was it like, and how difficult was the interview?

-Anything I should know about working for a company like them? I've been searching around reddit and people have usually been saying negative things about working for them."
2gu4yw,1129,2014-09-19,The Divorce Papers,Clobbersaurus7,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gu4yw/the_divorce_papers/,"I had kicked my coffee habit weeks before.  It had been a ritual, with coworkers - a way to socialize and an excuse to get out of the office for a few minutes.  The jokes about ""needing a fix"" were always met with understanding laughs, and it felt strangely comforting to be in a socially accepted club of addicts at 10am on a Tuesday.  Then, my company was restructured and I was replaced by some fucking 21 year old intern, a junior at the local university.  

For awhile, I'd sit and nurse a coffee at my old joint while I surfed Craigslist for jobs and wrote cover letters, but every sip felt bitter and desperate.  You don't deserve to drink a $5 latte when you're unemployed.  

I had just hand-delivered a resume at a local publishing company.  I managed to catch one of the hiring managers, and what resulted was essentially a pre-interview.  He seemed impressed by my experience and promised to call me later that day to get a formal meeting on the books.  I was elated - I actually fist-pumped into the air as I exited the revolving door.  As I made my way to my bus stop, I noticed my old coffee joint a block up.  Fuck yeah, I thought.  It's too early for a beer - I'm going to celebrate with an Americano.

The line was about 8 people deep, and I realized how long that feels when you don't have coworkers to chat with while you wait.  I started gazing around, observing the other patrons who were mostly hunched behind laptops, their charging cords snaked around the overstuffed chairs to the few outlets available.  

I noticed one man in particular - even from a distance, I could see the frosted, swollen eyes of someone who hadn't cried tears that were brimming at the surface.  Seeing him brought down my mood - I looked away and admired the barista, with a beautiful and intricate up-do.  Total overkill for a minimum wage coffee gig - I figured her for an aspiring actress.  

There were only two people left in front of me when I overheard someone say, ""Greg?""  I looked over to see a disheveled looking hipster addressing the forelorn fellow I had noticed earlier.

""Yeah, Greg.  Greg Bannister.   You are...?""

""I'm a courier, sir.  These are your divorce papers.""

He was gone in an instant.

Suddenly, the line in front of me had disappeared.  I shuffled in front of the barista to place my order, a little distracted.  I must've kept glancing over at Greg, because as she handed me my change she said quietly, ""It's really sad.  He used to come in here with his wife nearly every day and read the paper together.  Suddenly he started coming alone.  I guess now I know why.""  She must have overheard as well - it was a small coffee shop after all.

As I waited for my tall Americano, I found I couldn't avert my gaze from Greg.  Something about him...

His eyes caught mine, and instantly widened in recognition, then narrowed in confusion.

""Tall Americano with room - have a great day!""

I grabbed my coffee, and saw Greg cautiously waving me towards him.  I walked towards him with similar caution.  I felt every follicle on my body stand up.

A terse laugh of disbelief accompanied his slowly shaking head.  ""This is going to sound crazy, but I had a dream about you last night.  Do I know you from anywhere?""

I suddenly understood the cliche of a getting a chill up your spine - I could feel it travel all the way to my scalp.  ""I don't think so...""
He shook his head as if to jumble something beyond recognition.  He paused and stuttured for a second, still shaking his head.  ""Maybe I'm crazy, but you should avoid crossing Everett Street at 2nd.""

I don't really remember walking away, I'm certain I seemed quite rude.  As I approached Everett and 3rd, I started walking more slowly.  My bus stop was at Everett and 2nd, on the opposite side.  Superstition got the best of me and I turned around to cross at 3rd.  I noticed a sharply dressed young man - couldn't have been older than 21 - step into the intersection at 2nd, talking on his cell phone.  I continued to look at him as I stepped off the curb on 3rd - much like I had been with Greg, I was mesmerized by him.

That's when I heard the screeching tires.  

The bus was skidding sideways through the intersection when its back tire made contact.  After a flash of shiny, sickly beautiful scarlet ribbons splashing through the air, a severed arm lay on the pavement as people began shrieking.

That would have been me - if it weren't for Greg.

I spent the next two weeks having horrifically vivid dreams about what happened that day.  I understood the look in Greg's eyes when he warned me of his prophetic vision - he had seen what I had that day.  I slept maybe 2 hours a night, and only when I was exhausted to the point of delusion.  I couldn't bear to keep seeing the carnage over and over, knowing that if I hadn't stopped for that coffee it would be my body splattered across the intersection.

Finally one night, I drifted off and dreamed of something else.  I dreamed of Greg.

I saw him vividly, in a cold, white and sterile clinical setting.  He was in a hospital gown, and had the same look of tempered anguish that drew my eye to him that fateful day in the coffee shop.  There was a voice speaking to Greg, but I couldn't see where it was coming from.  I could only see Greg.

""Stage three colon cancer... terminal... hopefully a couple months...""

Greg's eyes brimmed over with tears, and I awoke.

The next morning, I knew I had to find Greg.  He had saved my life, and clearly I now had an obligation to save his.  I never believed in any voodoo, mystic bullshit but something told me that Greg and I had some weird cosmic connection.  I owed him my life.

I walked into the coffee shop where I had first encountered him, and my eyes flew directly to him - in the same overstuffed chair he had been sitting in the last time I'd seen him.  He caught my gaze as I approached him, and his eyes widened in recognition and shock once again.  His mouth gaped open as if to speak, but he was silent.

""Greg.  Go to the doctor, as soon as possible.  I think you may have colon cancer.""

I noticed a couple of other patrons turn and look in our direction.  Perhaps I should have been more discreet.  

He peered at me through narrow eyes, folded his newspaper without breaking my gaze, and stood up to leave.  He walked slowly to the door with his head bowed, as if walking a plank.  Did I just save his life, or deliver his death sentence?

I wasn't sure I'd ever see Greg again.

Several weeks passed, and the dreams stopped.  I no longer dreamed of Greg, or the sharply dressed gentleman crossing Everett and 2nd.  My life started to get back to normal.  I even landed the publishing gig, at a higher salary than the job I was laid off from.  I had plenty of productive distractions, and my strange connection with Greg continued to dim.  

One night, after a prolonged Friday night happy hour with my new coworkers, I had another vivid dream.  This time, however, it wasn't Greg or the man in the intersection.   It was a woman, perhaps in her early fifties, dressed impeccably.  She didn't have a hair out of place, and her makeup looked soft and welcoming.  I could tell she had been beautiful, and was aging well - although I could see every fold and crease in her skin.  I notice a wall of white coffee mugs behind her, all arranged with their handles perfectly aligned.  She turns to me and smiles cautiously, until suddenly her eyes narrow and she shakes her head quickly, in urgent disbelief.  

Suddenly - much like the sharply dressed gentleman in the intersection - she is reduced to a splash of scarlet, as shrieks fill the air.

I had this dream several times, and it was cutting my sleep back to a couple hours a night - much like after witnessing the bus accident.  I just couldn't bear to fall asleep, only to see her beautiful face reduced to a pulp over and over again.

I needed coffee more than ever to get through my day.

I should have known better by then.  I should have found a new coffee shop.  But old habits die hard, and I found myself wandering in to the same old shop at about 9:30 that Tuesday morning.  The same cute barista was working, her hair in a perfect bun.  She smiled and welcomed me, and I took my place in line behind a half dozen people.  
As they seemingly tend to do, my eyes locked on Greg's gaze.  This time, they widened with recognition and pleasant surprise.  I vacated my place in line as he waved me over.

""Stage one - came out of surgery just fine.  Cancer free - doc said we caught it just in time.""

I'm sure I said something, but I don't recall what.  All I remember is Greg's eyes widening again with recognition, looking over my shoulder.  They narrowed, never looking at me but fixated on something or someone behind me as he said, ""You should get outta here, kid.  Trust me.""

I had learned to trust Greg's premonitions.  That same chill rushed up my spine through my scalp and all my follicles stood on end as I turned to leave.  That's when I saw her.

I caught her gaze.  ""Ma'am!  Ma'am!""  I shouted.  Her face opened up into what had become a familiar and welcoming smile.  Impeccably dressed, not a hair out of place.

My ears throbbed when the shots rang out.  When I looked up, sickly beautiful ribbons of scarlet were slowly dripping down the perfectly arranged display of white coffee mugs as the shrieks filled the air.

My head seemed to spin on its axis until I saw Greg.  His eyes wide with recognition and pleasant satisfaction, he looked forward unblinking.

""No.  I won't sign the divorce papers."""

First off, my impression is that the CS classes here are a lot better structured/organized are require more effort than the CS classes I took at my home university. A lot more emphasis is put on hands-on coding, which I found rather lacking in the courses back home. As a result, I feel that although I may have taken the same courses as someone in the US, I still wouldn't be quite on the same level. My having to take a bunch of EE classes in my first two years doesn't help much either. Second, internships. I've always thought of internships as a bonus, not a necessity back when I was in Taiwan. The majority of students there don't have any sort of meaningful internships that don't only involve menial work. Here, I get the vibe that internships are practically a must if you want to land a job. I've considered putting off school for a semester so I can find a spring internship here, but after browsing listings for an entire night,  I keep getting the feeling that I'll never be good enough. Most of them require ""side projects"" or ""proficiency in X"" but I have no idea whether I can meet any of those requirements. I have a few school projects I can come up with, but nothing really special I can showcase. As for proficiency in languages, I don't even know what it means to be proficient in a language. Sure, I know the syntax/paradigms and can make things run, but to be actually type code without googling or getting quizzed on details of said language? Probably not.

I've started thinking of  some side projects recently in hopes of building up a portfolio, but I'm not sure how long it'll take before I have something completed in code. Might also look into some Open Source projects that I can contribute to, but the sheer size of the projects is rather daunting. So I'm really kind of lost here, any advice on what I should do next? Should I just get my bachelor's back in taiwan, apply for grad school in the US and then re-evaluate my options? Or should I stay the extra semester as an exchange student and try to find an internship? Anything else I should do in the meantime?

Sorry for the long post, any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thx"

I studied experimental psychology and was looking to go for a PhD in forensic psychology. But the past year, my interests have switched and I've felt more of a pull towards user experience/market research (more along the lines of industrial psychology).

I'm currently applying for grad schools, but figured I could maybe get my foot in the door at a small market/consumer research firm, so I started emailing either owners of small firms or HR of bigger firms. 

I WILL ADMIT, my email was very generic. It was just a little description that I recently graduated with my degree and am looking for a job opportunity. It wasn't tailored to every company, although I did research the people of the company. I figured they're very busy and don't want to hear a big blurb/cover-letter esque introductory email about why I want a job with their company.

She wrote back:

&gt; Below is a redacted email I received a month ago.  I gave this person an information interview that led to an internship with a prestigious organization within a month.  I hope this helps you in your search.  You’ll see that the writer had the sense to think about how she could be an asset to the company.  Many specifics in her email convinced me that she was seriously interested in this type of research and that she had been acquiring skills.  She had clearly read some of our website and made reference to key points that would capture my interest.  Qualities that are important in qualitative research came through clearly in this email.  She followed the primary rule: wiifm.  She also used flattery but in a way that wasn’t repugnant.  Clever woman.

I think she's right and made some good points. This is solid advice, although I think it might be hit/miss depending on who owns the company. However, calling someone ""clueless"" because they inquired about a job is a little rude. 

So far I've sent out about 200 emails (sent them out last night) and received about 30+ emails since this morning. She was the only one I've ran into a problem with. Many of them aren't hiring at the moment, but a few said that they are and I'll be forwarding my resume to the owners personally.

I am having trouble figuring out what to do here... I started an internship a couple of weeks ago and have been given the task of figuring out how to automatically run end to end tests at least once a day for a particular web app we are developing. 

Essentially the steps I need to do are:

1. Fetch the latest code from git
2. Run the protractor end-to-end tests on this latest code
3. Save the results somewhere for later review

What I have implemented seems to not want to work, so I am reaching out to you guys to see what other solutions I could use for this problem.

This is the basic idea of what I have implemented that is not working:

1. Wrote a python script that makes system calls to run terminal commands
 * These commands include fetching the latest code from git and writing results to text files
2. Wrote two different shell scripts
 * one runs ""python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080"" to host the site on localhost
 * the other one runs ""webdriver-manager start"" which is required to run the protractor tests using Chrome.
3. To wrap it up, these files are set up as cron jobs to run once a day on some remote linux server.

I feel as if the above approach is not the best way to solve this problem and/or I am on the right track but I am missing some key detail that is making this not work.

How would you approach this problem if you were in my shoes?

Also have a month long trip planned",EngineeringIntern6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2gwkyb/received_job_offer_contract_waiting_for_other/,"Hey guys, I'm sort of new to the CS career scene so I was hoping you could help me out in my current situation. I did a lot of searching and I read the FAQ, but this situation seems very specific to me.

I'm a new grad (Spring 2014) that just had an internship this summer which ended about a month ago. About two weeks ago, I started applying to jobs. After several interviews and test questions, I received my first offer just today.

The offer was a 2 month contract for about $31/hr, which they say can turn in to full-time. He wants me to start ASAP.

I also received numerous other phone calls, one of which is of keen interest to me (A confidential smaller section of a bigger company like Google/Amazon/Facebook). 

This is the one that I am most excited about. But the thing is that I've only just started contact with this company. The product seems very promising and technologies used are exactly the ones I'm most interested in. 

Of course, my top choice would be to work for this company that seems to match my interests in every way, but there are some things that complicate it.

Things to note: 

1. I'm not a CS major. I actually majored in another area of engineering and all the CS I've learned was self-taught and only related to web development.

2. I have already bought tickets to travel around the world for a month. The soonest I can start is after my trip which is around early November.

3. I'm a junior engineer/developer. I don't have most of the formal CS knowledge like data structures/algorithms, although I am self learning the latter right now.

4. I told the company who gave me an offer that I would need some time to decide and I would email him. He replied with something along the lines of ""It would only make sense for you to take this offer if you were serious and committed/excited about our product and team. If you're not, and it wouldn't make sense for us to continue."" This was after he made the offer and this was all said over the phone. I replied with ""I'm just not sure if the ticket purchase has been processed yet. I can get back to you as soon as I find that out."" This was just to buy more time so I could get some opinion on this.

5. Other than the resume and the quick chat, the bigger company has not really talked with me yet. They know that I am a fresh grad and just out of an internship, but they do not know about my upcoming trip. 

6. I had told the bigger company that I was in the early/late stages of interviewing, but no offer yet. They told me to contact them if things move forward with other companies. The offer from the smaller company actually called me right after I talked with the bigger company. 


**TL;DR**  I would really love to work for the second company who just contacted me and their stack and product seems really great. But I just received an offer from another company and they want me to start ASAP in their contract position. I also have a trip planned and the tickets were already bought. I won't be able to start until early November unless I cancel my trip.

What's the best way to deal with this?

Many thanks for your help!"

A diverse team of City Apprentices (Urban Youth, College Interns, Women, and Veterans) led by a senior programmer or designer will complete your design, coding, or IT project. You will receive a great price on your work with a guarantee, the team will receive pay and apprentice style training, and the trainer will supplement their income by leading a motivated team of apprentices in making a great product.  We are in the prebeta stage and we need some help with the following.

1. We need jobs: We have a few Graphic Designers and Experienced programmers that have apprentices assigned to them. If you have a programming job or design job(RoR, Apps, Wordpress, Logos, Ads, etc), we would love to talk to you about it and possibly give a quote. If you have any work you would like to outsource, no matter how small we are interested. It would be good training for the apprentices.

2. We need advice: I am currently attending Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, so I am working with my colleagues on this startup. But I also would like to hear from programmers and designers to get information from their perspective.

3. We need more experienced Programmers and Designers: If you would be interested in leading a pre trained City Apprentice Team please reach out.

4. We need apprentices: We have a heavy focus on the underrepresented(Blacks, Latinos, Women, Vets) but we are not underrepresentated exclusive. There will never be a time where there are all ""Women"" or all ""Blacks"" , so we want to teach the skills but we also want ensure that we teach people how to work together in a professional enviroment.

There are also many posts about people new to CS who have dozens of project ideas which is why they want to start learning.

I feel like I'm a complete opposite to these people. I have plenty of time on my hands (outside of class) because I'm not currently in an internship. I would love to utilize that time to work on a personal project, but my creativity is barren.

I know that you shouldn't do a project solely for the sake of doing a project. However, I love programming. It's just really disheartening that the only time I get to do it is for class assignments. I would love to be able to program something on my own, but nothing comes to mind when I try to come up with something I can potentially make.

Almost all of my classes have been on Java, so that is what I am best with.

Does anyone in the USA have experience working shorter (20-30 hour) work weeks? Not for an internship, but a ""real"" job. I graduated with a CS degree in May and recently started my first full-time software development job. The company I'm working for is pretty rigid with its vacation/time-off policy: 2 weeks a year + holidays and a small amount of sick time. Uncompensated time-off doesn't really fly with them unless there's a medical reason or something (FMLA, maternity leave, etc.). 

There's nothing wrong with the work itself - I love programming. However, I tend to value my free time pretty highly and money isn't terribly important to me. Barring major life events (health issues, having kids, whatever), I feel that I could live very comfortably on my new grad salary for the rest of my life. I only work 40-45 hours a week, but it's like, I have all this money now, but no free time. Don't get me wrong, I've worked 20+ hours a week on top of going to school since I was 15, but it was always in support of getting my degree. Now that I've got that, I feel like I'm working for the sake of working. Sure, I can save up for retirement, but working for 40 years straight in order to have (optimistically) 20 off isn't super appealing. If I could halve my hours at the cost of half of my salary, I'd jump at the opportunity. 

Is this something that exists? I'm afraid of burning out at my job. I only feel productive for about half of the day anyways, so it may even be more cost-effective for a company to hire me this way (though I feel like I'd have a hard time explaining that). 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Do I just need a swift kick back to reality? Any and all advice is appreciated."

Some information about me, I'm a 21 year old American and in my final year attending university in NYC - majoring in Economics with minors in Politics and History. I moved abroad from the US when I was 10 to Stockholm, Sweden (lived for three years) then Hong Kong (lived for three and a half years). Somewhat of a TCK (third culture kid) but unfortunately I'm only a US passport holder and not viable for EU citizenship!


Languages: I have forgotten most of my Swedish but still know the basics and feel comfortable with re-learning. I speak/read/write conversational Mandarin (Chinese). Fluent in English. Willing to put the time and energy into learning a new language!


Work experience: I have held four internships during my undergraduate studies - in a range of companies (finance, start up, consultancy and law firm). My expertise is in research and analysis with an interest in working for an international focused consulting firm. Intending to also intern this semester for a political risk consultancy so similar post-graduate work would be desirable. I have a decent GPA, 3.4 and some extra-curricular activities.


Why: I want to get out of the US because I don't agree with a lot of the national policies/priorities/values here and would prefer to live somewhere more closely aligned with my lifestyle choices and with general higher quality of life! I enjoy the outdoors (hiking/snowboarding), have a respect for the environment (renewable energy/recycling), socially conscious (social-democratic) and very liberal by US standards. 


Where: From my research and experience most Scandinavian countries would fit this criteria (Sweden, Norway, Denmark) as well as Germany. I'm flexible about which of these first countries I first go to in Europe and then later worry about deciding which would be most ideal.


How: I would like to first go to one of these countries in a limited capacity to effectively gain a snapshot of the country/culture in an international setting so that I have a support network. My conclusion is that attending grad school (directly after undergraduate!) would be the best method as I could be amongst other international students and ideally have a better opportunity to secure a temporary residency permit or a visa sponsor from a local company.


In terms of masters programs I'm still learning about the various options, styles, ranking and costs. From my understanding:

- Norway is free,
- Sweden is mostly free,
- Denmark and Germany are more expensive.

BUT needless to say all three Scandinavian countries are very high cost of living while Germany is more affordable (comparatively). As I will be on a student budget it is likely I will need to avoid studying in Denmark given both the high cost of living and non-free tuition. 

I am still unsure about what degree to pursue a masters in and this will definitely help narrow the search process. Options are:

Masters in Economics (not interested in econometrics or micro economics)

- Political Economy
- International/Global Economics
- Economics/Business join program
 

Masters in Business Admin. (do European business schools require same level of work experience (2-3 years) as US business schools?)

- International Business
- Entrepreneurship
 

I would be open to studying in the capitals of all the countries listed (Stockholm, Olso, Copenhagen, Berlin) as well as Munich and open to other suggestions.

My questions for you:

- Are there any other countries/cities you would recommend?

- While I know there are better Masters programs in the UK (more costly) and the Netherlands especially for economics/business , would this be worthwhile even if I had no desire to live in these countries long term?

- Is attending graduate school the most effective way for me to initially gain access to Europe (in terms of living, securing temporary residency and/or work visa)

- Is applying to EU masters programs as a foreigner challenging / would my qualifications make me a strong candidate?

- Does anyone have knowledge/experience with Masters in Economics specifically Germany?

- Does my plan sound viable/smart?

Please feel free to ask any questions, voice any concerns about my ideas, or want further clarification on something. 

I know this is A LOT of information so those of you have read this far - I thank you immensely! Looking forward to the responses :)"

*First a little backstory:* I'm currently attending community college and intend to transfer to a UC(likely Berkeley or San Diego) next year making me a **sophomore in college**. Last year, I started doing freelance web dev, simple stuff really, and landed an internship at a **small company** over the summer. I was really glad to have it and accepted the offer of $10/hr. 

School has begun, I'm still working there. It's been about **5 months** and I'm actively contributing, but I still need help from time to time. The issue is with school and other commitments, my time is sparse to say the least. I feel that $10/hr is a little low but again, I'm new, I'm not sure how these things typically start off. I do however commute ~45 minutes downtown each day and work hard. 

**When is it appropriate to ask for a raise/promotion?** I want to keep working and I like what I do, just not for $10/hr. I feel like that's low, even for an intern. I'm starting to feel I need more incentive to work as hard as I do and I don't want to be taken advantage of.

**What should I ask for?** I know this is a difficult question but I'd really appreciate any insight. It's just web development mostly. HTML, CSS, PHP, JS. **What's a typical entry level web-dev hourly rate look like?**

**How do I ask?** What's the best way to phrase this? I've never asked for a raise before.

2h2mu6,3,2014-09-21,Trying to escape a humanities PhD and land a CS job and looking for some advice,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h2mu6/trying_to_escape_a_humanities_phd_and_land_a_cs/,"I'm currently midway through a humanities PhD at a top 5 school. Certain issues (among them the lack of humanities job prospects and intellectual rigor) have led me to teach myself basic CS over the past couple of years. Although I don't regret my time studying the humanities, I don't think it's a sustainable lifestyle. I'd like to focus on computer science, for which I have an equally strong passion. Before I switched tracks to the humanities, I was a math major (ended up with a minor), so I have a little bit of background there.

Fast-forwarding to the present, I'm currently taking some junior- and senior-level CS classes, and will continue to do so until I graduate. I will be able to take more than an undergrad degree's worth of upper-division CS classes before my PhD funding runs out.

I will be able to incorporate a small handful of CS into my dissertation (the Digital Humanities movement is becoming increasingly popular), but certainly nowhere near the level of even a CS Master's thesis. In order to let me focus on acquiring a CS education, this dissertation would likely just meet the minimum requirements .

I'm currently puzzling over how I should plan for the future. What would you guys suggest that my action plan for the future should be?

Would it be possible to get an internship like this? I don't have any job experience whatsoever (went straight from undergrad to PhD). Looking at applications for any internship/job, pretty much all of them require a CS degree. Might it make sense to try for a CS Master's after I finish this PhD? I don't want to give up the PhD, as the funding allows me to take undergrad classes à la carte, and I still enough passion in my original subject to sustain research for a dissertation. A second PhD might be too much, since a large portion of a PhD teaches one how to independently learn and research (which I'd be getting in *this* PhD); a Master's, on the other hand, is more tailored to imparting domain-specific knowledge.

My strongest CS interests at the moment are machine learning, computer vision, AI, and algorithm design. I'm not as interested in ""straight up"" software development or web development."
2h2n5n,3,2014-09-21,New project: data-driven mapping application; want to learn a new framework; any suggestions?,volfort,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2h2n5n/new_project_datadriven_mapping_application_want/,"Hi all -- ""long time reader, first time poster"".

I'm a university student studying computer science with a very strong interest in data-driven web development. I was recently hired on for a new research project in an Arts &amp; Sciences department to help model data geographically by creating a mapping and trend analysis portal, and I want to learn a new framework or development pattern that I can apply to this project and add to my tool belt. 

I won't get too specific about the project because research and academia and such, but here's an overview: They have several decades worth of data, about 6000 records, concerning ""incidents"" all over the world. Geographical location is vital to this information, so I will be mapping the incidents and providing tools for: 1) Filtering on about a dozen different attributes. 2) Creating graphical analyses of the incident occurrences in comparison to various statistics (Incidents vs. GDP over X years would be an example).

Through internships and independent projects I have gained web development experience with: ASP.NET MVC, MVVM Framework/Pattern, Java Spring MVC Framework, standard PHP and the FuelPHP Framework, as well as a lot of work in SQL databases. 

As much as I don't love Microsoft, I must say that I feel very comfortable in C# and in their .NET environment. I like Java a lot as well, but it does seem overly cumbersome at times. I haven't really ""enjoyed"" my time developing in PHP. It was my first ""programming"" language, but it has fallen short in many scenarios where .NET and Java would have been better. I'm also comfortable with JavaScript, but only have experience using it on the front-end.

I am already pretty set on using MySQL for the database and the Leaflet.js framework for the mapping functionality. I researched some nosql databases, but the data is already very tabular, doesn't need to be very flexible in terms of schema, and I can see it working very well in a relational database. I'm still researching some js graphing libraries for creating the trend analyses. 

So what I really need is something new and useful that I can learn and use for retrieving the data from the MySQL database and serving it to my javascript-driven front-end. My considerations so far:

1) Play Framework using Java. The idea of a strongly typed language and framework without the repetitive compilation of the entire project is very appealing. I feel very comfortable writing back-end code in Java, and I know there are a lot of other students around campus who know the language and could pick it up quickly when I leave the project.
2) A node.js framework like Sails or Mean.io. There's no question that javascript is the cool, new full-stack language, and I kind of want to see what all the buzz is all about. But the examples I've seen so far have been fairly data-light, so I'm unsure as to how practical a javascript stack will be for a very data-heavy application. I'm also unsure how exactly node.js handles database queries. 


Some considerations: I'm very comfortable writing SQL queries, and I really disliked the restrictiveness of most of the ORMs I've come across in newer frameworks recently. If I have to use an ORM, I want a good medium between generating repetitive, simple CRUD queries easily, and allowing me flexibility in writing more complex queries. Also, this project will be hosted on the universities unix servers, so any Microsoft .NET options are pretty much out.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

tl;dr Developing a data-driven mapping and trend analysis web app. MySQL back-end, javascript on the front-end, need something cool and new for retrieving/serving lots of data."

2h379o,8,2014-09-21,I'm employed as a student programmer at my university and feeling really dissatisfied with my job. Should I find a different position or just deal with it until I graduate in a few years?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h379o/im_employed_as_a_student_programmer_at_my/,"**tl;dr:** Feeling poorly managed at my job, but I'll be doing internships this coming year and graduating out of my position in a couple years, so I don't have a strong motivation to change what I'm doing. Other jobs are tempting, but I don't know how to tell if they'd be any better and I like the flexibility my current job provides. Questions at the end of the post.

My current job is really frustrating for a lot of reasons. Management is very hands-off and disorganized, our project doesn’t have docs or a spec, our architecture is a mess, and our deploy date has been delayed by over two years at this point. I’ve found it very difficult to keep myself motivated, mainly because the project isn’t that interesting to me and my manager just doesn’t hold us accountable for reaching deadlines or goals. In the recent past, he’s said things to the effect of, “I don’t care what you’re doing or how long it takes as long as you’re working on something.” Personally, I find it hard to care about things unless someone is explicitly telling me, “Feature X with requirements A, B, C must be completed by MM/DD/YYYY at HH:MM” with the expectation that it will happen, and the project itself is not very interesting so it's hard to keep myself motivated when working. That’s something that I’ve been working on getting better at, but I can’t help but feel that I would be more productive with a stricter management style. There are other on-campus programming jobs I could look at, but I’ve even considered getting a job in retail or something just to have the experience of working fixed hours and being accountable for getting things done. Still, I feel like that would look bad on my resume/CV, I’d get paid less, and I would just rather be programming.

At the same time, my job is extremely laid-back, super flexible, apparently impossible to get fired from (I’m pretty sure I would have to get caught rolling blunts on my desk at work to even get reprimanded), pays really well, and allows me to work whenever and wherever I want. I’ve been tempted to look for other programming jobs on campus, but I don’t know if they would be any better managed or help improve my skills any more. I also have to admit that I’ve become very accustomed to how laid back my current job is, and I’m worried about starting a more demanding job while also taking some really demanding courses.

The backdrop to this little story is that I’m a junior with at least six months of internships planned for the coming year, so regardless of what happens I’ll be getting some experience programming in a different environment and graduating a year or two after that. Given this, my incentive to jump ship is pretty low, because I'll be past this job in a few years anyway. Still, it feels like I could be improving more elsewhere.

**Questions:** Based on this information, would it be good to start looking at other jobs? If so, what kinds of questions should I ask when interviewing to probe an employer’s management style? Are there things I can be doing at my current job to make my experience more productive?"

I truly feel saddened by the fact that a great friendship has soured and come down to me seeking legal advise but I no longer feel that I am doing something wrong. There is quite a bit of information and details which I will add in hopes that someone can suggest what to add, remove, or emphasize in a possible case.This story goes back more than a year ago so I will keep it short.

  Fresh out of the military, I returned to my small, home town in Texas. I had been on leave and never broken contact with my good friend, Dan. (Let's call him that)

 I lived on savings deciding to take a small break before I seeked employment. I hung out with Dan almost daily. We drank often but never got wild. We ate out a bit and enjoyed being young adults with no real priorities.

 Dan was the front man of a local metal band that was getting more exposure than a lot of local bands. They had endorsements and even a small record label. I as well Dan were convinced that he was well on his way to a decent musical career if he kept up his work.

  Months go by and the vicious cycle of drinking and blowing money is getting old to me. Slowly but surely, it begins to dawn on me that Dan is no longer covering any expenses. It doesn't bother me too much. I've known Dan for years and trust him to cover me whenever he gets the chance. 

  I become more cautious of spending and hang out with Dan mostly at my house. We do simple activities but still manage to keep entertained. However, Dan is frequently insistent about going out to bars. By this point, I have the feeling it is implied that he is willing to go so long I pay for drinks. I always avoided going but one night, I decide to. Dan orders food and drink and after a few beers begins to tell me how he got fired about a month ago. He had never mentioned this before and I felt like an ass for even thinking about how he never caught bills anymore. 

  Even after this point, me and Dan would see each other everyday. We were best friends, after all. But i began to realize that Dan would show up to my house, often verbally uninvited. Now Dan had always been welcomed into my home, even if he didn't call ahead, but the frequencyOf his visits was now becoming rude (before showers, bed, going out, etc.) On top of that, I would come home to him eating fast food that he would ask other family members to buy so long he went to pick it up. 

  It bothered me a little more, now. He no longer spoke of finding employment. His main focus had become his band. While I had come home to his band having a  moderate chance of success, those days were far from over. Dan had become a complete, intolerant, arrogant, musician with a false sense of accomplishment. He had ruined his reputation (more events unrelated but truly embarrassing) as well as the accountability of his band.

  Regardless, I stuck by Dan and defended him frequently as others often asked me why I still hung out with him. I knew some of the horrible things Dan had done but I saw through all of that.

  One day, Dan tells me why he got fired and couldn't hold a job. He had essentially wrote in a tip for himself after a customer was unhappy with his service as a waiter and left him a single cent on the receipt. I came to hear later that Dan was no stranger to gestures indicating horrible service.

  I was began slipping into a deep depression as I came to realize that the life I left had remained exactly the same and those I once held on a pedestal were nothing more than kids that trapped themselves in a small town.

  With this, I began to distance myself from Dan but did my best to not make it so obvious. 

  Sorry for the Long story, I just wanted to give you a clear history before the events leading to the owed money come to play.

  One day, I get a phone call from Dan and he sounds stressed. Dan does something he has never done before and ask openly for money. 300 dollars of it. 

  Dan explained how he had more than a few warrants in almost all the near by counties and how one of them had been calling him frequently threatening an arrest at his home. 

  I didn't hesitate. I looked past all of Dan's mistakes and am hopeful that this is his wake up call to get hos act together.

  We verbally agree that he would pay me back as soon as he could and we drive to the court house and I pay off one warrant for him. 

  On the way home, he is extremely thankful. I decide to be a bit more serious and explain to him the fault in his actions and how he needs to begin to be a little more professional. Mind you, I have attempted this talk before and it ended in a argument with him calling me a bad friend for thinking he was shitty with money.
 
This car ride ended the same way.

  I legitimately felt bad for bringing it up. Me and Dan didn't talk for some time and after that experience, our future encounters were just never the same.

  I will add that I did still hang out with Dan and he occasionally pulled off the ordering food with no intent to pay, but what bothered me was his enthusiasm to spend money he didn't have when he already owed me plenty. (Not to mention warrants, and the countless other people that would ask me to remind him about the money he owed them.)
 
  I begin to purposely lose touch with Dan and ignore his invites.

  Now I can't tell how relevant this next part is to establishing a case, but I am here for the advise regardless. This was an extremely difficult time in my life which I am just now coming out of. (With an incredible new outlook) I will keep it brief and not too personal. (I'm sure you, nor the judge have a care to give)

  As mentioned before, I was in a deep depression coming to face the realities of finding employment. I came to find that my family was mentally abusive and incredibly wasteful as Dan was and that those habits were growing on me. 

  With the shirt on my back, I left my abusive family, I quit drinking, and moved to Austin, TX. 

  I invested all my remaining money to work wiring with a contractor.This left me with virtually no remaining money. I devised a small budget with the minimal amount I expected to make  as I had realized financial responsibility was something I had never practiced. 

  In the first week of work, my vehicle breaks down. I spend a couple of weeks paying coworkers I just recently met to take me to work which was an hour away. 

  I was in the situation of not having a vehicle meant I couldn't work. Not working meant i couldn't pay for my vehicle to get fixed.

  The price to fix my vehicle set my budget plan way back. I had already taken 10 steps back after two forward. 

 I finally went to pick up my vehicle. 

On the way back, I was so relieved seeing as that I was getting back on track after what I had thought to have been a major set back.

Well, life gets far worse. 

  Being new to a large city, I was unfamiliar with traffic laws (downtown Austin especially) and believed I was in a turning lane. I collide with a vehicle and my jeep is only totaled at the Axel. 

  In one day, I lost everything I had invested in. My job. My vehicle. As well as put myself in debt for the first time. I now owed the dealership, and had never had tickets before. 

  Here's where my life changed forever.

  The guys I was staying with Were both in the field of business. One being the landlord (a semi famous redditor in men's fashion), was kind enough to let me stay until there other housemate returned from a internship. 

  This gave me three months to get my act together. 

I was no longer 10 steps back. It seemed after trying to change my life for the better, I had been punished for it and now stood miles from the initial two steps forward.

  My housemates loved my new enthusiasm and gave me plenty of flashy hand-me-downs (both from the men's fashion subreddit) as well as revamped my resume. Of course they only guided me and expected me to do all the work myself. 

  All summer, I worked odd jobs to just be able to eat or offer items or anything really to my housemates who I felt in dept to. 

  The Texas summer heat is relentless, but there I was handing out resumes to countless businesses. 

  I was lucky enough to get on board with a local high-end business which has been a true blessing. 

  With court dates approaching, a wrecked vehicle, the fact that I'm staying In a house I should be paying for, all resting on my shoulders, I developed a new budget to ensure that I can pay for everything to include my current rent. I now juggle 3 jobs to get myself out of debt sooner. 

In the months that this has been going on, Dan is frequently posting on various social media sites all the festivals and bars he goes to. He is also, more than ever, focusing on his band. His band as well as himself are now seen as jokes of the town. (I get frequently asked if I still talk to him, with a barrage of embarrassing storied followed by my ""No."") He frequently has failed fundraising events to pay for ""studio"" time and other things. 

  As I was job hunting, I asked Dan politely to please pay me even a little since I now had legal issues of my own. He was always sincere but would insist how he would be unable to pay me since he had no money.

  It was always my belief that Dan would pay me within a few months and now it has been more than a year. I have tried to explain to him that i am willing to settle for payments even if they are not scheduled so long he keeps me updated. 

  The last time I brought it up, Dan flipped out and began to throw a fit over the keyboard (all these talks have been via Facebook messages)

  He tried to be sentimental as to how we were once ""brothers"" but it always ends with an insult and once again, a promise to pay me.

  Now, I ran away from a small town in hopes of a better life. I lost everything. I worked my ass off with no vehicle to find a job where I can also work my ass off. I found it, and rather than stop there with one job, I am in working more than ever to be sure I can pay off all debt I am in so I can proceed with my new plans to go to school. 

  While I am not fond of the idea of taking a former best friend to court, it certainly would help me and despite my best efforts to not make it a ordeal with tension. He has solely been the aggressor when it comes to payment. 

  If I have worked this hard to become financially stable again and pay off my tickets, why can't he? 

  I understand the world isn't fair but I now see that he has no real excuse.

  I am more motivated now than ever to go to school. I have seen the finer things here in Austin and am thankful for everyone I have met in this great city. 

  My personal side of the story gets really emotional but I am not the same person I once was. I have learned to forgive everyone and no longer hold onto anger. I have suffered long enough. To take Dan to court seems contradicting to my new Outlook, but while I have enough money for my own battles, a extra 300 would really do me some good. 

  Some final notes would be that the warrant paid was not for the county we lived in, as well as the fact that he lives in my old town and I now live here. Which court would I have to go about filling a small claim and do I have enough of a case to possibly be the victor? I have many screenshots of him partying or talking about it. (A point that he is getting money from somewhere?) This seems odd but i know social media is public information. Also, the fact that I work just about everyday. 

Once again, sorry about making this a story about me if it came off as such and any advice is greatly appreciated!

I have been lucky to have a lot of good internship experiences on my resume, including IT work, software development, and systems engineering. 

I'm slightly averse to diving into a software development role (as most of my classmates are doing) because I'm afraid of getting bogged down and pegged as a ""code monkey,"" separated from both the customer and any real decision making. I feel that I have an inquisitive mind and also relate well with people, which combined with my youthful ambitiousness, has led me to highly consider tech consulting at a firm like Deloitte, PwC, or Accenture. In my mind it seems like a great career track in terms of wide market exposure and quick career growth, as well as being an asset on my resume.

2h3zg9,4,2014-09-22,TIFU by trusting my co-worker/manager,Itsmurphy,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2h3zg9/tifu_by_trusting_my_coworkermanager/,"So I guess I'll start with some context.


I am working two jobs and am going to college currently. I have had one job (A) for about 2 years and picked up the other one (B) when I was looking for more hours during the summer. When I am going to college I am also in a student group that usually has it's meetings on weekends.


I have talked to my manager at job A into putting my two weeks in and she has started to look for a replacement for me. As I am going to be going into an internship at a business for school soon and job A is nowhere near as flexible with hours as job B is.


I have been working at job B for about a year now.Over that year I learned something about the managers there, they cannot communicate worth a damn. Say if person A would be out of town the next week and couldn't work that Thursday and talked to manager A about it and manager A says they will figure it out, then that Thursday would come and manager B would be working and would call person A and ask why they're not at work. Person A explains why they are not at work and that they talked to manager A about it. Turns out manager A never told manager B that person A couldn't work that day and never changed the schedule.


The Day Of:


The day of the fuck up I was working at job B and happened to noticed that the schedule was put up earlier than it normally was. So I go to look when I work and see that it is my normal Fri. night shift and my normal Sat. opening shift, Which for me starts at 10 A.M. 


This week also being the first week my group started up the president of the group sent out an e-mail letting the members know the first group meeting was going to be next Sat. at 8 A.M. Knowing that the first meeting takes an ungodly amount of time, due to the fact that this meeting is when we discuss a plethora of topics, there was no way I could make the meeting and go to work that same day.


So before I was sent home that day I talked to the manager, Let's say Bill, that was working, who is also in charge of the schedule, that I wouldn't be able to be in at 10 that next Saturday due to the meeting. He told me if I found someone to cover my 10-5 hours then I would only need to be their from 5-9. 


One of my co-workers, Bob for the sake of the story, didn't mind covering hours for people. I go to Bob and ask him if he could cover my 10-5 that day, he said to check his schedule and if he wasn't already working an opening shift that he would cover mine. So I go to the schedule again check when Bob works next Sat. and see he doesn't open. I tell Bob this and he says that he will cover for me. I let the manager know this before I clock out and everything appears to be good.


The Week After:


So Sat. arrives and I wake up way to early for it being Sat. and get ready to go to the meeting. I get to the meeting at about 8 A.M. and sit down turn my phone on vibrate at get ready to listen to people talk for 4 hours. Halfway through the meeting my phone starts vibrating. I ignored it the first time, then it vibrated again. I checked to see who it was and it was Bob, so I try to pick it up but miss the call just barely. 


After about 30 mins. he calls back, so I excuse myself to take the call. When I leave the room and answer Bob immediately hung up on me. So I tried to call him back but he sent me straight to voice mail twice. So I go back and sit through the rest of the meeting.


Now sometime in the week Bill changed the schedule so that Bob was working that Sat. morning and couldn't cover my shift. However I neither received a call or text during that week from Bob saying he couldn't cover for me, nor from Bill or any of the other managers saying that the schedule had been changed.


Time flies and 5 was approaching so I got ready and headed off to work. When I get to work I clock in and head toward the front counter and meet Bill on my way there. Bill asks me ""Where were you this morning? You were scheduled to work at 10."" 


I told him that I thought Bob was covering my hours and Bill said that he wasn't supposed to. I just stood their confused as all hell. Bill told me to go home and that we would talk later. So I went home frustrated and confused.


Today:


While working at my other job, one of my co-workers from job B stops by and asks me what the hell was going on. I told him what happened. He said he was just wondering cause apparently Bill had told some of the other employees there that I usually work with that ""Murphy isn't working with us anymore.""



Tl;DR: I trusted a co-worker would cover my hours, manager/co-worker never contacted me saying he couldn't, got fired.

p.s. This is my first post on reddit, so it probably sucks."
2h45e3,120,2014-09-22,Meet the 19-year-old iOS developer so successful he turned down an Apple job offer,SuperbCrew,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2h45e3/meet_the_19yearold_ios_developer_so_successful_he/,"Source: **[Business Insider](http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/21/this-19-year-old-developer-is-so-successful-he-turned-down-apple/)**  
  
&gt; Last week, 19-year-old John Meyer dropped out of a prestigious university computer science program to work full-time on his tech startup, Fresco News.

&gt; His parents weren’t happy at first. He was attending NYU where his mom is a professor, he told Business Insider.

&gt; But they eventually came around to support him, because they had to admit: Meyer is already a successful independent computer programmer. He’s been writing apps since his freshman year in high school, 2008, after teaching himself the programming language Objective C.

&gt; And he’s been making money at it since his sophomore year of high school, he says.

&gt; “Money-wise, I’ve been pretty fortunate. I’ve been able to support myself since just a year after I got started,” he said.

&gt;He’s making so much money writing iPhone apps that during his first year of college he could afford to live alone, pay NYU tuition while bootstrapping Fresco, he told Business Insider. Fresco News is a sort of intersection between Instagram, Twitter and Flipboard that turns photos from ordinary people on the scene of big news events into news stories.

&gt;We pressed him to reveal his income but promised not to share it. Let’s just say it’s on par with what software engineers earn at some of the best tech companies.

&gt;Despite his young age, Meyer’s app portfolio is impressive. He’s written about 40 apps, mostly through his app company TapMedia, he says.

&gt;This includes the popular iPhone 4 flashlight app Just Light (which may have been the very first flashlight app). It went nuts, downloaded about two million times, he said. Apple now includes a flashlight app with the iPhone.

&gt;He’s just had another huge hit called Perfect Shot, too, released about a year ago for iOS 7. It was downloaded 60,000 times in the first four days and is now at over one million, he says. 

&gt;It uses the smile and eye detection features in the iPhone camera for taking the perfect group photo. Hold the phone up and wait. The app takes the shot in the perfect millisecond when everyone is smiling, no one is blinking. A very smart idea.

&gt;So smart that Meyer nabbed the attention of Apple. The company asked him to become an intern, he says. That’s a dream come true for most students. And it pays. Apple interns can make $5,723 a month.

&gt;But he turned Apple down.

&gt;“I get emails from recruiters all the time, and this past summer an offer to intern at Apple,” he says. But, he explains,”I am, at heart, an entrepreneur. I won’t be happy working for someone else.”

&gt;He’s not worried about missing the chance of a lifetime. “If I wanted to, I’m sure they would offer me another internship,” he says.

&gt;That’s not just the bravado of being 19. “I’ve been close with a lot of people at Apple, from going to Apple’s developer conference every year,” he says. “I’m in a field where I’ve done a lot of things already, an expansive portfolio of projects I’ve worked on.”

&gt;He’s actually been attending the developer’s conference since he was 16, sneaking in the first time with his dad’s help. His dad flew him to San Francisco, registered himself for the conference, then handed the pass to his son to attend.

&gt;“I was 16 and anyone under 18 wasn’t allowed. It was right after the successful flashlight app. My dad got the ticket from Apple, flew back home and left me in San Francisco,” he laughs.

&gt;Since then, Apple has created a teen program at the conference, he says. It’s been great for meeting other programmers his age, he says.

&gt;If all that wasn’t impressive enough, Meyer was also a finalist in the Thiel Fellowship, he says. That’s a program by billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel in which gifted young people drop out of school to start companies. Only 40 people become finalists, flown to the Valley for mingling. Twenty are accepted, and Meyer wasn’t one of them.

&gt;That doesn’t bother him at all. He’s focused on turning Fresco into a money maker, talking to potential clients for it like New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

&gt;And he hasn’t ruled going back to college some day. But for now, he’s writing apps for fun and profit."

2h5sj2,1,2014-09-22,At what point can a male coworker legitimately goto HR for harassment claims,Rockman507,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2h5sj2/at_what_point_can_a_male_coworker_legitimately/,"A little bit of background about my work. I work in a lab that is closed off from the rest of the building, we are the only place in the building that can have open lasers and the equipment I'm working on deals with that. The group went from 1 tech (whom I went to school with so knew for awhile) to 2 (me being the new guy). We are temp contract workers so not employed by the company itself. Last spring he gets an offer for a consulting company to our company full time. We replace him with this female that I knew who she did research with before and asked around, no red flags. 

During this time they decide to move the equipment she was assigned to into the lab due to space constraints. So I'm stuck in there with her. She is a life sucking drain of ineptitude. I probably waste 10-15 hours a week teaching her things or doing unnecessary work, and the time I'm not doing something for her she has one of the managers/engineers in doing stuff for her. I finally have enough and put up a wall (laser curtain) and avoid talking to her.

Each summer we get interns. This summer we only got one, this female from the northwest that isn't old enough to drink. She is to be my minion (literally, the managers assigned her to do all my grunt work so I can concentrate on finishing up new code and documentation). Things are a little weird for some reason, so instead of being overly friendly I switch over to professional mode, thinking nothing of it. One day the coworker comes over with intern in tow and starts telling me how she is going to setup this randomization experiment on my machine. Not what was discussed with the managers as it was supposed to be a learning experience for the intern to do that and the coworker is an idiot ('why does it matter if the roll of the dice makes all the same material runs done back to back?' type of idiot in regards to blind random studies). I said it wasn't what was discussed, it's the intern's job anyhow. She starts yelling at me (remember isolated room). So I said fuck it, do whatever you want since you guys obviously know better, the college freshmen and BS in biology versus the double BS math and physics with MS in biology and the manager with a phd in physics and second MS in experimental design (some weird stats program at northwestern I think). 

Next day my direct manager calls me in for a private meeting with the previously mentioned manager. I'm told there have been complaints brought up in the lab against me, some in a vague sexual manner. Turns out the coworker went to my direct manager and told her the intern was feeling 'uncomfortable' around me. I almost get fired, fuck her. Then she takes the intern under her wing, I send an email to the intern about something, the coworker and intern read my email together, giggle, walk out of the room to the break room, and 2 hours later I'd get an elaborate email back obviously written by the coworker, etc. Whatever, the intern leaves at the end of the summer, the end is in sight. Although I knew better since the problem starter was still in the lab.

Side rant: I left for a month for a conference and a wedding. The end of the summer presentations from the interns happen during me being out. The intern that has used all my data, I ran half her runs for her, wrote all the code, explained the analysis, etc dropped my name from the presentation. She put the coworkers name in it though....

Now we are caught up to this week. The direct manager has moved to another group. The big boss has told me one more outburst from me and I'm canned. Old direct manager sends an email to a few people including the two of us in the black lab about wanting a spare high end computer for a run someone in her new group needs. Coworker walks over to my side, unhooks some stuff I was working on, powers on this dinky little pc that's the same size as a dvd player, reads the harddrive space, walks back to the computer and types. So I don't see a response from her, I ask her about it. She decided to respond but drop my name from the reply all. Won't tell me what she said.

So I goto the old manager, tell her we don't have a spare high end the person wanted. Asked about what the coworker said. Now get this, the person needed a i7 level pc with 12-16Gb and decent video card. What she said was this little i5 (can't remember the exact number but it's a 2 core with hyperthreading so not even a true quad core) integrated graphics but had 250GB harddrive. This is what she sent off as a response from our lab. Cute. So she won't say anything, I write a short email just saying ""We don't have a spare XXX computer, and HDD space isn't the same thing as RAM"".

Now she is having a private meeting with my big manager and looks over her shoulder whenever she is typing on the computer. She makes sure when she gets up even to go get something from the cabinet in the lab she locks her computer. I fully believe she is starting a complain that I'm sneaking onto her computer to read her emails.

What should I do about her? I feel like I'm in a hostile work environment where one small thing I do wrong is going to break loose hell upon me since it's male vs female. And let's face it, the actions that have occurred made it clear that's how the situation is being seen, not two coworker's having a spat."

A little over two years back, I made a subnetting console application for my exam in programming.

I have since then messed around with programming here and there, nothing too serious. However, starting up soon on an internship where programming experience might give me some huge plusses, I'm starting to feel it up again.

I have touched Pascal, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Ruby, and various scripting languages, although I am by far more experienced in Java.

I have primarily only ever done console applications, unless working with a program specific API.

So, I downloaded Visual Studio to try and get a feel of WPF and while I understand the basics, I can't seem to get it into my head how I convert my console code, into a working WPF application.

I apologise for the mess of text, was merely trying to put it out the best way I could.

Here is a pastebin link for my code: http://pastebin.com/sZ5FmDTt

If anyone want to maybe skype/teamviewer/whatnot me through it also, or give pointers and tips, I'm gladly recieving.


EDIT: I believe Windows Forms application was maybe the thing I was looking for. Dont know how to change the title though. Am open to both, however!"

2h6geh,12,2014-09-22,"Terrible at ""coding problems""",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h6geh/terrible_at_coding_problems/,"I'm a student right now trying to get an internship for the upcoming summer.

To prepare for job hunting, I learn basic algorithms and data structures and it helps but I'm still really bad at coding problems.

I've always been terrible at puzzles, riddles, etc. Anything that requires that an insight come to you instead of just logically working through an issue. I'm also bad at coding problems because most of them seem to require that insight at some point to solve them.

An example is a problem from codility to check if brackets are correct. ""{}({})"" is correct but ""{(})"" is not. What I thought was a simple solution was to add opening brackets to a stack anytime an opening bracket is read and if a closing bracket is read, check if it's opposite is on top of the stack. If not, then the brackets are incorrect.

In my head, this makes perfect sense but apparently it's not quite right because codility told me I failed a bunch of tests. 

This wasn't a difficult problem at all but this pattern of not being able to solve fairly simple problems is common in my experience.

I find things like OOP and other ways to organize large systems very intuitive compared to these stupid coding problems.  Are there parts of software engineering I should focus on more? It's probably better to just focus on my strengths and leave the puzzles/problems to others who are actually good at them.

Actual question: I am not good at coding problems. I probably cannot improve much. What other areas of software engineering can I focus on so I get more out of my strengths? "

I only transferred in with 4 credits (Rhet 105). So far on my resume, I have very little technical experience. I'm on the executive board for Illini Pride and I worked at a waterpark over the summer but I really want a technical summer internship this summer.

I'm interested in software development even though I only know basic C. I'm going to try to learn Python over winter break and Java over Winter Break. I realize that computer science may have been a better major for me but I realize that if I try to transfer I'll probably get denied because my GPA isn't high enough and also my credit for ECE 110, JL, and KL, would go to waste requiring me to take CS 125 and there's no way I would graduate on time.

I went to expo and I wen't to ECE/CS After Hours today and many software development companies said they are only looking for CS majors and also people who know Java (Which I barely know as I didn't take CS 125 as I am a CE).

2h6ys2,84,2014-09-22,"Some advice from a ""Big 4"" university recruiter...",big4recruiter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h6ys2/some_advice_from_a_big_4_university_recruiter/,"I recently spent some time on a university campus doing some recruiting for one of the ""Big 4"". I participated in career fairs, info sessions, and other things along those lines. I thought I'd share some of my insights with you folks here. Hopefully someone finds them helpful.

 * Be prepared. And that means more than ""have a resume"". Especially in a career fair setting, my time to talk to you is very limited. You want to use that time to sell yourself to me as thoroughly as possible. But if your opening line is ""What positions do you have available?"", then we're going to spend most of our time together with me talking about things you could easily find online. Then you'll hand me your resume and you'll disappear into the sea of applicants that we receive that day. Which leads me to...

 * Have something prepared to make yourself stand out. I shook hundreds of hands and saw hundreds of resumes, and after a while they all started to blend together. But if you have a really cool side project or an awesome internship, then I'll probably remember you. And when it comes to resume sorting, you want to be remembered.

 * Be aware of your body. This one may sound insensitive, but it's true. If you have bad breath, chew some gum. If you have BO, lather on the deodorant. If you have sweaty hands, carry around a towel (or use your pants, I don't really care). The easiest way to hurry along our conversation is to suffer from one of these problems without addressing it.

 * Spend some time on your resume. It doesn't have to be the best resume in the world. You don't have to go crazy with the formatting. But if you hand me 2 pieces of paper stapled together, with a bulleted list of every class you've taken and tons of whitespace... then let's just say that it doesn't reflect well on your organization skills. As a general rule, stick to one page. Use as much white space as possible without creating clutter. Use bullets to describe experiences. Leave out relevant courses (unless you aren't a CS related major). Don't worry about an objective (we don't read it).

 * Relax! I much prefer talking to real people than robots. Having an elevator pitch is great, but don't memorize it to the point of monotony. Don't be afraid to smile. Show your passion. It's something we look for in employees.

 * Know what you're going to say. One of the worst things you can do after waiting in line and finally getting to a recruiter is hand them your resume and just wait. It's awkward. It reflects poorly on your communication skills. So please have some sort of opening line or elevator pitch prepared and ready to go.

 * This one actually came as a surprise to me... Don't ask me if I have any questions for you. If I have questions, I'll ask. I'm not the one looking for a job. And being asked if I have any questions makes me feel like I'm the one being interviewed. It makes you seem pretentious. 

And that's all I've got at the moment. I'll add more if I think of it. Also feel free to ask any questions, and I'll do my best to respond! I hope this helps!

**Edit to add:** I'm getting some hate in the comments (which was not completely unexpected), so let me try and clear some things up.

 * I really am a nice guy. I get along with everyone that I meet. If we met in person, I bet we'd have a great conversation. So let's try and keep personal attacks out of this.

 * I wrote this post trying to be as honest as possible. The fact of the matter is we receive significantly more solid applicants than we have open positions. So yes, we get to be picky. Call it an ego if you want, but that won't change the fact that our ""no"" pile of resumes is much larger than our ""yes"" pile at the end of the day. And my pointers above are geared towards pushing you into the yes pile when you might have otherwise ended up in the no pile.

 * If anything I've said offends you, then I do truly apologize. That was not my intention. But I also will not sugar-coat the fact that our application process is very competitive, and most applicants will not be hired. So yes, you will probably have to work to make yourself more appealing to us. If you don't like that, then I'm sorry. But that's reality.

 * And lastly, let me attempt to answer the question of my purpose in attending the career fair. Is it to collect resumes and sort them into piles? Or is it to actively seek the best and brightest, the diamonds in the rough, and the future of my company? The answer is both. The former is a means of achieving the latter. Every applicant that I talk to, I'm looking for a reason to hire them. For the brief time we spend together, I am your biggest advocate in the hiring process. I want you to be the next big thing. That's my goal. So I will read your resume, and I'll ask about your experience and projects. I will give my best effort to selling you to my company. But then you leave and I do the same for the next person in line. And the person after them, and so on. So it is in your best interests to *help me help you*. And that is what I was trying to do with this post."

What is the point?

I am not sure what to do with my life at all like most 19 year olds. i thought i wanted to go into the military but i slacked and became a shut in for 3 months. I got a IT internship and was soon hired.I still wanted to go into the military at the time. It will be a year in November. I have come to terms i do not want to go into the military or do anything else. Be it IT Consultant, college student, gas station employee. I have little things that i want to do. From time to time i will find joy from playing video games. Other than that i play video games as a time passer till i go to bed and wake up for Work and college. none of the people i called friends contact me unless i contact them first so i have no one to go out with. A few weeks ago i even asked some girl out and got turned down. I was no surprise by that being that last girl that i was about to date basically used me. I do not even talk to my family because i do not like them. To be honest i find no reason for life. Do not get me wrong i am not suicidal. I guess i want to live but do not want to live. AKA i am not going to end my life. I happen to live at home with my mother like 90% of kids my age. i just do not find joy in many things. I have thought about seeking Pro help for this, but i am unsure on how i will pay. I need a car because my sister is starting to drive so i can no longer use my mothers. thus i got a second job on the week ends. So i have part-time/fulltime job during the week, School at night, and now a part time job taking up some of my time. When i started school i thought to my self this will be nice. Ill have something to look forward to, but that turned for the worse when i found out i am not enjoying that classes. Intro to programming was fun until we stopped making programs. i learn from doing so its almost pointless for me to take notes. once i do something Right 2-3 times i got it done. Then Pre-Calc came along and now i can not do math like i use to. It annoys me that something i did love to do i can no longer do it. To the point it makes me want to drop the class. it almost pisses me off. I even got a  tutor to teach me again after the class is done. So what is the point? What can i do to spice up my life? Why do i have no friends?

I plan on doing a bachelor's in computer science after. I work at an IT help desk right now and I plan on getting my bachelor's out of state so the longest I will be at this job would be until the end of 2015 or possibly summer of 2016. There is no opportunity for me to advance at my current job because they have a strict rule that you need a bachelor's degree to move to any other department. 
Some other information about me, I currently own a house that I plan on selling once I get my associates. So my worry is that if I take the summer internship, the worst case would be that when I finish my internship I will not have a job and have a few months of having to pay my mortgage without a job and if I also my house may not sell soon either. 
My current job pays $15/hr with no benefits and I have been here for 6 months, so I will be here for a little over a year if I quit for a summer internship. 
Taking a leave of absence is not offered by my company so I cant work the internship then come back.
Im 25 so I would like to get as much experience as I can as soon as possible because I'm hoping I can get past being an entry level employee by time I'm 30. 
There are 2 main worries that I have about leaving my job is the possibility of not being able to find work after finishing the internship and also the possibility the no learning anything from the internship / doing more in IT at my current job
Thanks for any opinions.

I am now President of the investment club on campus and held a fixed income analyst position at a regional company two summers ago. This past summer I took a finance seminar in London instead of getting an internship.

With that being said I could really use some help. In the future I would love to work as a trader for a buy-side fund but realize I have to get some practical experience under my belt. What kind of jobs should I be applying for? Should I try and become a research analyst for a large firm or should I target smaller funds and asset management companies?  With my credentials I know I stand very little chance of getting an offer from a Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan so what should I do? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated, as you may be able to tell I am going through a bit of a crisis right now."

2h7rxw,2,2014-09-23,I'm at a crutial point in my professional life and I'm utterly lost,DrunkenBeard,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2h7rxw/im_at_a_crutial_point_in_my_professional_life_and/,"Hello,

I'm just going to drop it all here. I'm not sure I expect any advice, I feel like I know what I want to do, but I'm scared of actually doing it. That being said any advice would be extremely welcome.

First my current situation. I've been working in this company for 3 years, straight out of university. When I started I was very motivated and we did some pretty cool stuff. Then a very important manager left. He was my mentor and I loved working with him. This was around 2 years ago. After he left I was pushed to take his responsabilities. I say pushed because I had no training whatsoever in that kind of work, mainly planning and managing, and I was still expected to do my previous work (I'm a software engineer) in parallel. It was hell. I hated every second of it. I didn't even have a job description, I was just supposed to do anything and everything. In the meantime my salary was becoming irregular as the company stuggled to produce anything of value. To this day I still have 5 months of due salary and I'm not sure I'm going to get paid at the end of this month. Suffice it to say I'm ready to leave. I want to leave.

Last week the boss came to me. He told me that we're having a team building event next Friday (so at the end of this week) and I'm supposed to present my strategy for my team as I'm now in charge of the engineering ""department"" (a web developer, a software engineer who hates the company and wants to leave too, myself and any interns we might get). He told me how we made mistakes in the past and that it's time to fix stuff and all managers are asked to present their vision for their departments. That's cool and all, and I actually do have a concrete vision for my team, but I also have 0 faith in this company and I still want to leave (I didn't tell him this).

Now comes my first problem. I basically have two alternatives: End it here and now, tell the guy that I'm leaving the company and that he can't count on me for this. The reason I don't want to do this is that I'm scared of leaving a ""stable"" work and entering the ""looking for a job"" market, I've never had to do that and I would much prefer to first find a job and then quit. My second alternative is to do just that, roll with it until I find a job. But although this seems like a safe solution it really isn't once you actually start doing it: it's hard to find a job when you're working, it's hard to find the motivation, it's hard to tell a future employer that ""I have a month of leave notice until I can actually come work for you"". It's also hard to come to work everyday and do stuff that you have no faith in, just going through the motions with a heavy heart and the impression that you're wasting your time.

My second problem is that if I leave I'm not sure that I want to work somewhere else. I have ideas. I want to work for myself. I want to start working on those ideas and bring them to life. But is this the right moment? Should I just quit and start working for my own? I'm scared of wasting my time. I'm scared of losing my hard earned money on projects that may fail. I would like to work on these projects in parallel of a ""stable"" work, but I'm not sure it's really feasible.

So that's basically it. I don't know what to do and I'm never in the mood to even think about it. I'm constantly stressed about this. I find it hard to make a decision. What I want to do? The romantic side of me says leave, go away, rent a place in the big city (I live with my parents), start working on my own project. I have enough money to live comfortably for a year at least until I can start hopefully making money. My pragmatic side says: stay, find a stable job in parallel, guarantee a comfortable income then think about your own project. My compromising side says: leave, you still have a month of notice where you get full pay, use the month to either find a new job or kickstart my new project.

Thanks for reading! Any advice/encouragement/answer/whatever would be appreciated."
2h8ey5,6,2014-09-23,"PLEASE HELP I feel like my lawyer is screwing me over....am I crazy? (Covington, KY)",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2h8ey5/please_help_i_feel_like_my_lawyer_is_screwing_me/,"So I have a trial date coming from for a DUI charge in Kentucky I was charged with back in early April. I was on my back to South Carolina from a long weekend in Dayton, Ohio when I was pulled over going 15 mph over the speed limit by a state trooper. I had a very small amount of marijuana in the car with me at the time, about a half gram, and no paraphernalia of any kind (not papers nothing). Once I got pulled over I became extremely nervous about going to jail for the marijuana. I did not know anybody for hundreds of miles and had school the next day. I am/was a 21 year old college student who has never had any run ins with the law so the idea was extremely frightening. The officer was extremely intimidating (gave me run down on how state cops don't mess around) and could tell I was nervous so he asked me to step out of the car. I did also have bloodshot eyes however I attest this to my fatigue from having such a long weekend partying with my friend I hadn't seen in a year. Needless to say I failed the field sobriety test he gave me horribly, but honest to god it was because of the anxiety brought on by the entire situation. At this point the officer placed me under arrest and I was taken to jail. He searched my car and found the bag of marijuana and I was charged with possession and DUI. I took both a breathalyzer and a drug test to show that I was not under the influence of any drugs of any kind. The only drug that came up in my drug test was marijuana which I smoke from time to time and used the weekend prior. 

The next day when I was finally back in South Carolina my anxiety was at an all time high and the only thing I could focus on was getting a lawyer to take care of this for me. I hired one I found via some online referral website. It was 2 grand up front and she led me to believe she would be able to get the charge knocked down to a reckless driving. From the time I hired her on April 2nd, I did not receive one phone call from her. I was calling her the entire time to check in, see how the case was going, if there was anything I personally could do to assist with making the case easier. From the onset she seemed to have the mentality of getting the case over with as quickly as possible, which was somewhat distressing to me. She seemed to resist the idea of pushing back the first court date due to my internship I had this past summer but when I stood firm it worked out fine and the judge pushed the date back. 

When the discovery was sent to me I realized the police had included pictures of evidence that were not even mine! There was a massive pipe that did not belong to me, as well as a grinder, and a different bag of marijuana that contained much more then I had on me. I immediately notified her office of this and she spoke to me over the phone not long after assuring me not to worry about this. 

I called my lawyer yesterday just checking in to see where we stood as the trial date is now a month away. She told me she got my speeding ticket reduced from 15 mph over to 9 mph over but outside of that hardly anything else. As part of the plea deal I will plead guilty to DUI and will have to meet the terms of a conditional discharge for the marijuana charge. When I asked about any other options she replied it was accept the plea deal or ""go to trial and lose and go to jail for 7 days"".  I was extremely upset when I heard this. Not once beyond the initial call in which she was recruiting me to hire her did she call me and ask for my side of the story. When I asked her about why we had no shot in trial she mentioned the photographs in the Discovery as part of the large amount of evidence against me even though I had mentioned to her 2 months prior these photos were illegitimate. 

I feel like this case is not as big of a slam dunk for the prosecution as she has led me to believe. I have seen a psychiatrist for over 9 years now for both ADHD and anxiety. There is mental illness on both sides of my family and I have thought for some time now that I may have borderline personality disorder. The fact that I have been diagnosed with ADHD and spoken with my psychiatrists regularly about anxiety I think helps my case, especially given the intense nature of the officer. The fact that the police included these photographs of items that were not even in my belonging I believe makes the prosecutions case less legitimate. I am just finding it hard to accept a better plea deal could not of been reached. I really feel most the effort this lawyer put forward in my case was recruiting me as a client to get the $2500 check I wrote her as a broke college student.

After hearing this I am extremely worried about my future employment opportunities as a college student about to graduate. I am thinking about possibly looking into hiring another lawyer for this case. So tell me reddit am I being biased towards myself, should I listen to her advice and accept the deal? Or do I have a legitimate reason to be upset?"

After a few months I was asked to help with coordination instead (taking the tickets via phone or email and assigning them out to the techs), as one of the two people had to take a leave. 

I was later told that they felt that I wasn't working as a tech, but that the coordination position was becoming permanently open. I was interviewed formally for the position, along with several other people, and they ended up deciding to go with one of the other candidates. They asked if I wanted to stay on until the new person starts in the middle of next month, and being worried about being broke, I accepted, while obviously looking for other jobs. 

I should note that the operations manager who made this decision is not the one who hired me, as the one who hired me left, and since he came on, 4 or 5 other people (out of a company of about 20-25) from various departments in the company have left for reasons I'm not aware of. 

I have an interview today and I'm curious how I should answer the inevitable question about any I'm leaving my current company. "
2h8s5x,4,2014-09-23,"How should I act to a hostile coworker, should I talk to HR?",Rockman507,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/2h8s5x/how_should_i_act_to_a_hostile_coworker_should_i/,"Sorry this is a little long and ranty.

A little bit of background about my work. I work in a lab that is closed off from the rest of the building, we are the only place in the building that can have open lasers and the equipment I'm working on deals with that. The group went from 1 tech (whom I went to school with so knew for awhile) to 2 (me being the new guy). We are temp contract workers so not employed by the company itself. Last spring he gets an offer for a consulting company to our company full time. We replace him with this female that I knew who she did research with before and asked around, no red flags. 

During this time they decide to move the equipment she was assigned to into the lab due to space constraints. So I'm stuck in there with her. She is a life sucking drain of ineptitude. I probably waste 10-15 hours a week teaching her things or doing unnecessary work, and the time I'm not doing something for her she has one of the managers/engineers in doing stuff for her. I finally have enough and put up a wall (laser curtain) and avoid talking to her.

Each summer we get interns. This summer we only got one, this female from the northwest that isn't old enough to drink. She is to be my minion (literally, the managers assigned her to do all my grunt work so I can concentrate on finishing up new code and documentation). Things are a little weird for some reason, so instead of being overly friendly I switch over to professional mode, thinking nothing of it. One day the coworker comes over with intern in tow and starts telling me how she is going to setup this randomization experiment on my machine. Not what was discussed with the managers as it was supposed to be a learning experience for the intern to do that and the coworker is an idiot ('why does it matter if the roll of the dice makes all the same material runs done back to back?' type of idiot in regards to blind random studies). I said it wasn't what was discussed, it's the intern's job anyhow. She starts yelling at me (remember isolated room). So I said fuck it, do whatever you want since you guys obviously know better, the college freshmen and BS in biology versus the double BS math and physics with MS in biology and the manager with a phd in physics and second MS in experimental design (some weird stats program at northwestern I think). 

Next day my direct manager calls me in for a private meeting with the previously mentioned manager. I'm told there have been complaints brought up in the lab against me, some in a vague sexual manner. Turns out the coworker went to my direct manager and told her the intern was feeling 'uncomfortable' around me. I almost get fired, fuck her. Then she takes the intern under her wing, I send an email to the intern about something, the coworker and intern read my email together, giggle, walk out of the room to the break room, and 2 hours later I'd get an elaborate email back obviously written by the coworker, etc. Whatever, the intern leaves at the end of the summer, the end is in sight. Although I knew better since the problem starter was still in the lab.

Side rant: I left for a month for a conference and a wedding. The end of the summer presentations from the interns happen during me being out. The intern that has used all my data, I ran half her runs for her, wrote all the code, explained the analysis, etc dropped my name from the presentation. She put the coworkers name in it though....

Now we are caught up to this week. The direct manager has moved to another group. The big boss has told me one more outburst from me and I'm canned. Old direct manager sends an email to a few people including the two of us in the black lab about wanting a spare high end computer for a run someone in her new group needs. Coworker walks over to my side, unhooks some stuff I was working on, powers on this dinky little pc that's the same size as a dvd player, reads the harddrive space, walks back to the computer and types. So I don't see a response from her, I ask her about it. She decided to respond but drop my name from the reply all. Won't tell me what she said.

So I goto the old manager, tell her we don't have a spare high end the person wanted. Asked about what the coworker said. Now get this, the person needed a i7 level pc with 12-16Gb and decent video card. What she said was this little i5 (can't remember the exact number but it's a 2 core with hyperthreading so not even a true quad core) integrated graphics but had 250GB harddrive. This is what she sent off as a response from our lab. Cute. So she won't say anything, I write a short email just saying ""We don't have a spare XXX computer, and HDD space isn't the same thing as RAM"".

Now she is having a private meeting with my big manager and looks over her shoulder whenever she is typing on the computer. She makes sure when she gets up even to go get something from the cabinet in the lab she locks her computer. I fully believe she is starting a complain that I'm sneaking onto her computer to read her emails.

What should I do about her? I feel like I'm in a hostile work environment where one small thing I do wrong is going to break loose hell upon me since it's male vs female. And let's face it, the actions that have occurred made it clear that's how the situation is being seen, not two coworker's having a spat."

2h9ak7,17,2014-09-23,I want to leave,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2h9ak7/i_want_to_leave/,"I don't know where else to post this so I'm posting it here because I know you guys' brain works like mine. 

So right now I'm a 20 year old junior mechanical engineering student. My grades aren't fantastic but they aren't terrible and if I continue to work hard I will definitely be able to push through till I graduate. I have a good paying co-op (basically a 3 semester (non-sequencial) paid internship) that pretty much guarantees me a job upon graduation.

So as long as I graduate I'm pretty much guaranteed a cushy spot in life as far as I can tell. I'll go to work every day and get paid every Friday and I'll work my way up the ladder until I have a higher paying job at this company then I'll find a wife somewhere along the way and have kids then I'll get old and fucking die. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking and reading about death and life and historical figures leading amazing lives and all this amazing stuff and I look at the life in front of me and it looks terrible. I mean I'm majoring in engineering because I like math and science and shit but I made made that decision when I was 17 and I needed to pick a college major so I could move on from high school. I don't think I want to do this shit until I die. 

Classes are stressful and every day is a struggle in engineering school. I need to get X amount of work done every day and if something happens on a Tuesday and I can't get that amount of work done then Thursday, when everything is due on Friday, is filled with 10+ hours of straight homework and studying. And if a test is coming up I better study my ass off or I will fail.


So right now my life is stressful but the reward is a high paying job. Except the high paying job doesn't seem like much of a reward to me anymore.


I just want to leave it all and go somewhere else and enjoy my life.


Is this normal? Does everyone dream of this before reality settles in and they realize that they can't just leave everything? I'm just so tired of my life and my future but I feel as though I've already committed myself to it. 

I just don't want to wake up one day and realize that I hate where my life ended up."

I did all my own work in everything from the design, Photoshop work, SEO, writing content, social media promotion and every other responsibility that comes along with that. I made a pretty good living, although inconsistent.  When a salary job with great insurance in a different field came along, it was hard to pass it up.  After years of soul wrenching misery in a job I took only for the money, coupled with working 60-hour weeks on 40-hour salary and zero room for promotion until my manager's 20 year retirement was up, I decided to leave.  

I left the job with a decent savings that was eviscerated by the sometimes cruel randomness of life and find myself job hunting earlier than I had hoped. I wanted to be able to spend this year and some of next sharpening my skills as a Front End Web Developer while getting some light skills with Back End stuff as well.  

I'm located in North Carolina, available any hour of the day, 7 days a week. I have setup more Wordpress sites than I can count since 2008. With a little bit of cheating from Google, I can make a decent looking website with HTML5, CSS3 that is responsive, use a little jQuery and can use PHP to retrieve data from a MySQL database. I know how to template out the files to separate all the code from each other. I don't consider myself an expert in these areas yet.  

I'm a fast learner and glued to this computer all day, so I'm sure I can be of value to someone. If there are any paid internships available or someone willing to give me some time to learn on the job, I'm a dedicated and loyal employee. I have experience working remotely with a big company doing multimedia editing for sporting events but the hours are very limited and it's my only current source of income.  I'm not asking for much money, but I need the rent, cell phone and internet paid.

This past summer I was offered a research internship by my professor to work with my college's Chemistry department. One of the professors there needed a programmer to write a program to help them with their 3D printer project. I've never worked on a real project before (other than your typical class projects), so I was a bit intimidated. But I worked on it and delivered a working product. Only problem is that I don't really know if it's good code or if I adhered to good programming practices. I'll be graduating eventually, and I want to include this project on my portfolio, but I'm a bit worried a potential employer might look at it and think it's amateurish. 

I committed the project to a git hub repo. This is my first time using github, so I'm not sure if it's proper to include the entire project like I did. The README in the repo details what the program was required to do.  Basically, it's a program to give the user control over four different pieces of hardware used in this 3D printing project, allowing the user to automate the printing process. It monitors voltage from a voltmeter and force from a load cell to move this small stage up and down in microns. The microplotter is set up with a certain printing pattern and the Z stage moves up and down, touching the printing tips dipped in the ink. 

Basically, I just want to be able to add this to my portfolio and show it to potential employers in the near future and be confident that it's presentable. Did I comment properly, is my code structured properly, is there a better way to present the code on github, and so on. I plan on writing up a full documentation for the project to go along with the code. The README I wrote on the github is just temporary.

What should I do?",IamEng,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2h9thk/i_am_confused_depressed_and_poor_what_should_i_do/,"I know this isn't a personal support group but I was hoping to get some help with my situation. I am currently a third year student in Chemical Engineering at a reputable university in Canada.

I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I initially chose to do CHE because I was interested in creating artificial kidneys, organs etc. However, I have lost my enthusiasm and am completely lost. I continue to work hard in order to pass but don't know what my end goal is. I'm also a bit scared of my job prospects as CHE's aren't doing too well at this moment. I have applied for 100s of intern ship positions, emailed companies offering my services for free to no avail.

My family is struggling financially and all I hear at home is constant arguing about bills and how we can't afford them. I am trying to live off ramen noodles and have lost 20lbs doing so as I am afraid to ask my parents for money since they are already stressed about finances. As a child, I never felt poor despite having very little. I remember I used to search the big garbage containers next to my house for old worn out toys that I could play with.  Although our situation has improved, I feel a lot poorer. I feel horrible about feeling this way as I know there are people that are living off less than a $1 a day. 

I can't help but feel like a loser while all my friends are driving their BMW's to school. A lot of my friends are in computer science and make a lot more money than I do during their co-ops. So far all I have been able to get is an unpaid research position with a prof. This makes me think, I should switch to computer science or electrical engineering as the job prospects look a lot better, at least from my angle. I hate programming but at least it'll pay the bills, right? I can't even concentrate on my studies because I feel like I should be contributing to my family's income.

I know I am very lucky to be able to attend university as most of my cousins back home don't even have this privilege. I'm just burn out from constantly working and studying. 

I apologize for the shitty rant but I am really confused and don't know what I should do. The question I wanted to ask was, should I switch to computer science (will be 2 years behind) or should I continue with CHE and finish? I really don't want to stay at university for 7 years but I feel like CHE might be dead and CS is my only option if I want to make any money in this life. 


EDIT: Thanks a lot for the support guys. I have decided to stay in CHE as being set 2 years back will be too much of a financial burden (University is too expensive) :(. I've picked up a part time job at one of the campus food stores so that should help with the cost of food as well. 

I realized, I was being a cry baby and apologize for complaining. I was just down in the dumps yesterday and needed an outlet. I feel blessed to be allowed to live in a country with so many opportunities. If desolate people in India and China can rise up and become millionaires, what the fuck is my excuse?

Thanks again for the helpful comments. Good luck with the upcoming midterms :)"

- - - - -

Ah, the new school year. Time for the children to return to their books and classes, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to learn and imbibe a metric assload of knowledge in their wonderful little private school.

HA HA, YEAH, NO.

Of course, tablets got deployed again this year, except this time, they were updated to Windows 8.1, and per administrative directives, the users got local admin. I removed the stock Microsoft (cr)apps from my master image, installed Office with a 2000-activation MAK, considered installing a few useful tools (MalwareBytes, Temp File Cleaner, WinDirStat), but had licensing to hammer my head against, so I just had my minions image them and push them out.

Sure enough, students thought that they'd do clever things with their tablets, and we disabused them of their notions rather quickly, but one incident sticks out rather clearly in my (alcohol-muddled) mind.

- - - - -

It was a calm Friday morning in September. Austin had just received a massive rainstorm, and the entire town was saturated in condensation. Roads were slick, people were driving worse than normal (and for Austin, that's saying something).

I, of course, was sitting at my desk, full of piss and vinegar, absolutely brimming with loathing and rage, and of course, the one thing that could set my ire off occurred - our pfSense at one of the schools I administered dinged with an alert. I opened the e-mail containing the alert, sipping at my coffee with nary a grimace at the bitter taste of Robusta beans made in the manner of Boy Scout Coffee with just a hint of hatred and uncontrollable loathing. Of course, this coffee would have the same effect as Fentanyl on someone not inured to the substance's family (e.g. a heroin addict); fortunately, at this point, I may have had a bezoar for a liver, so I just got a mild buzz.

""Well, well, well. A student's trying to use BitTorrent on school grounds?"" I chuckled and sipped at my coffee. ""Naughty, naughty. He KNOWS he can't do that.""

The campus tech looked over at me from his desk nearby. ""Seriously? Someone's doing that?""

""Yep, and from the look of it, they're trying to download the Winter Soldier."" I snorted in derision. ""They can do this crap at home, not at school."" I fired up the state monitor on the pfSense, and set it to look at his states. Sure enough, there were multiple SSL connections outbound, and each one to a private tracker.

I chuckled and killed them all, then remoted to the domain controller and edited the student's account to have a slightly different login script consisting of the following.

&gt;shutdown -r -t 60 -f -c ""BitTorrent and piracy are not allowed on school grounds. Please contact your network administrator to have your account unlocked.""
	
Once I did that, I rebooted his machine, called the building principal, and informed her of what I'd done and why. She chuckled and replied, ""After last year? Oh, you've got carte blanche for this.""

I modified his script one more time, but didn't hit save. I locked my RDP session to the domain controller, then hopped in my car and drove over to the high school. En route, I clipped my old [Derp Squad badge](http://i.imgur.com/evhdqEB.jpg) onto my belt, threw on aviator sunglasses, and smirked at my attire. After about a thirty-minute drive, I pulled up into the parking lot, got out of my car, and leaned against it before flicking out my HTC One to call the teacher who I knew would have that kid that period - specifically, have him in front of a computer - and made the call.

""Yeah, you need to tell him that he needs to look out the window. Someone's there for him.""

She, of course, being briefed in advance via phone by the principal, knew what was going on, and she directed him towards the window. You, gentle reader, can only imagine the youth's shock when he saw one of [these bastards](http://imgur.com/a/QtljQ), one of which I'd purchased a week before from a dealer in New Braunfels to replace my totaled Mazda 3, parked very visibly outside in the parking lot, and a guy in a light blue button down, black slacks, and aviators leaning up against it with a Blackinton B296 badge on his waist.

A fully loaded Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (as in with the partition separating the front from the rear, gun racks, ram guard, spotlight, laptop stand - with the little red LED light! - cop locks, and performance mods too) will scare the hell out of most drivers on the road; seeing one invariably causes the icy grip of fear to come across your heart if you're driving, and you'll try to stay under the radar a LOT more if you see one, regardless of if it's a cop or not.

Needless to say, the kid broke down into histrionics in front of his entire class, whimpering and crying and begging not to be arrested and sent to a PMITA prison. He was, of course, frogmarched down to the principal's office by the school resource officer (school cop), and met with his parents there. 

Of course, by this time, the badge was off my waist, and my sunglasses were tucked in my glasses case in my pocket next to it.

The student was offered the same choice as the miscreant from the year prior (who, incidentally, is doing quite well at A&amp;M these days; he reads these and got a HUGE laugh out of them), and he and his parents chose the internship route.

As I got back into my car, I sighed to myself and started thinking out loud.

""It's so ridiculously hard to have people not want to break things, or help make things better, these days. You used to have kids who'd volunteer; people like me who simply wanted to understand how things worked and make them better for everyone. Nowadays, it's only those who get caught doing bad stuff, and they're sentenced to punitive measures.""

I sighed, raising and lowering my shoulders with an exhalation of air.

""Is it really that bad? Are they irredeemable, these kids?""

I smirked and hopped into the car.

""Not if I have anything to say about it.""

I patched my phone into the audio system, which, funny enough, blasts outside the car (it's amazing what they'll leave in a Crown Vic Police Interceptor when it's sold off to civvies), and fired up the Naked Gun theme on loop for my drive back.

I've been building up my resume and have come across an issue. A lot of my experience comes from the first school and is way more than what your typical freshman (again, what i'm listed under at this new school) would know about CS. I'm hesitant to list the first school because my grades were not impressive (C's) and I had to retake a class, but I would still like to include it because it's where I learned most of my things and the name would look good. Also, despite my poor performance at the first school I still feel like I learned and understood the material well enough to be able to use it in practice. I'm applying for a research assistant position and will be applying to different companies for an internship in the summer, so I feel like something like this can have a serious effect on my chances of getting offers. Not listing it would leave a big ol' gap between my high school graduation and my ""first"" (second) year of college.

It feels pretty good to come up with an elegant and/or efficient solution to a difficult problem. But, after I've coded all week for my assignments (for the school year case) or 40 hours all week for my internship (for the summer case), I'd much rather do something like go outside and be active. Or spend time with other people. If I had a life-mandated version of something like Google's 20% time, I suppose I would work on a personal side project. My main interest is machine learning (currently taking that Coursera course), and there are lots of interesting nuts to crack in that field. I could build my own classifier, or work on a Kaggle challenge. It would be cool. But doing those things seems to be mutually exclusive with things like having a social life or being healthy and active right now at this point in my life. At this point, if I chose to try to do a side project, it would just be another timesuck in my life, and I would be doing it just to have it on my resume and to impress a recruiter - which I know is definitely the wrong reason to do a side project. If I *actually* had some solid free time, I would probably enjoy doing one. At this point, though...I really don't want to sacrifice any more time for work-related things. I already put in over 40 hours as a student working on assignments and applying for things for next summer.

I'm a junior with a 3.64/4.33 GPA (major GPA 3.78) at a top 20 university with a well-known CS department. I've had two internships, but only my most recent one was related to CS. I wrote code for the marketing division at a large semiconductor company. It certainly wasn't a typical ""software development"" position like I'm looking for right now for next summer, but it was technical, and I used things I'd learned in school and learned some more things along the way. I have an onsite interview coming up in two weeks with a certain large software company in Redmond, WA. The only other place I've applied to that I've heard back from at this point is Square, who said no the day after I completed their code challenge (which I solved; not sure why I got rejected even before a phone interview if I solved the code challenge and even applied through a friend).

I guess my point is - with the things I currently have going for me, is it really that bad to have no side projects? I'm talking zero. My GitHub only has the code I wrote last summer on it, nothing else. I'm doing a significant, coherent, semester-long Java project in a class right now that I can't push out there because of honor code reasons (students in future years could steal my code), but I could show it to a future employer. I have good credentials on my resume, and I think I interview well (we'll see how my first few ""real"" technical interviews go).

I have just finished the job hunt for a Software Engineering position when I complete my undergrad in a few months, and since most of the knowledge I have on the matter has been accrued from other peoples stories posted on advice forums like this, I figured I will make my own contribution back as well. Hopefully some of you may benefit from it in some way or another. It may get a little lengthy so I’ll try and be succinct (go ahead and message me if you have any questions on omitted details, interview question clarification, etc.) One minor note: if this comes off as arrogant at all, I apologize. I’m trying to keep it as honest as possible, through my perspective, which I think is the most valuable way of putting it for other CS job seekers. 

I got into CS randomly about 2 - 2.5 years ago (sophomore year at an off-brand university). Around last year this time I hadn’t had an internship yet so I started searching for the following summer. I ended up giving my resume to a Microsoft recruiter, who was collecting them in bulk at my school in early November. I got a callback and had a pretty simple in person interview with an engineer later that week at my school. The questions I remember (QIR) are: find the parity of the length of a linked list. I did pretty well (not saying much with that question), and they had me schedule a date in Redmond WA for a final round of interviews for the internship. I set that for early December of last year.

The final interview was an all day affair with four engineers. At this point I don’t remember every question, but I’ll do my best to recall them. QIR from the first one: reverse the words in a sentence delimited by spaces. QIR from the third one: convert a string to an integer. QIR from the fourth one: given a number n, output all integers from 1 to n cubed, without using built-in multiplication. I actually did pretty well on the questions, and with building rapport with the interviewers (I don’t think anyone should underestimate this, even in tech). I got a call a week later with news that I had gotten the internship. They offered $6800 a month for the three months, plus a generous amount of other benefits. 

I also got a call out of the blue from Amazon a few weeks later, also for a summer internship interview. This would be a phone interview with two engineers. QIR from the 1st: design a car rental service, system; describe pros/cons of using arrays vs linked lists. QIR from the 2nd: given an integer n, prune a binary search tree of all values less than n. In my opinion, this interview did not go anywhere close to as well as the Microsoft interview. 

Of course phone interviews are always a little awkward, but it can get really bad if you have trouble understanding your interviewers (english was a second language for both of mine). And the design questions were tough because as for any of those open ended questions (no right answer bullshit, etc), you probably are just going to be at the mercy of your interviewers subjectivity. 

But the coding questions were a real problem because they wanted working code, but we didn’t have a shared document or anything. So this meant for transmitting my code I had to describe it, character for character. I chose to code in python, and it was a pain in the ass describing all the indentations, open parens, colons, etc, over a phone (though I have to imagine that would be much worse with Java/C++). On top of that, I actually spent 10 - 15 minutes doing the wrong problem in the second interview: I thought he wanted me to prune an arbitrary “Binary Tree” not a “Binary Search Tree”, which is a little more difficult. Yea, things did not go very smoothly.

So I was pretty surprised when they called me the next week and ended up making me an offer. Maybe the interviewers had given me the benefit of the doubt over the communication issues. For their summer internship, I think they were offering close to $7500, but with less benefits than Microsoft. Ultimately, I decided to go with the MS offer for this summer though, mainly because I was more interested in them as a company. And that about does it for my internship hunting experience. Though by last Spring, I was already looking for a full time position for after graduation. 

In April, my friend referred me to a Google recruiter at my campus, who set me up with a phone interview in exchange for a resume. The interview was with one engineer, and we did have a shared document for this one. QIR: given a string of letters, and a dictionary of valid words, decompose the string into a list of valid words, or return false if no such decomposition exists. This was a great question, and I enjoyed solving it by brute-force, then by dynamic programming in O(n^3). The optimal solution is actually O(n^2) with memoization, which I didn’t end up getting in the 45 minutes. But he said I did well enough and I was recommended for a full in-person interview in Mountain View, CA.

Now normally I don’t study for interviews; I think paying attention in algorithm classes, and playing around with Project-Euler/Google-Code-Jam is plenty. However I did buy two books for the upcoming Google interview to cherry pick: “Cracking the Coding Interview” (naturally) was the first, and since there’s already enough reviews out for it, I’ll just say: this book is a great jack of all trades for preparation, and I highly recommend it. The second was “Elements of Programming Interviews”, a lesser known book I think. In comparison to Cracking, it is not as well written, and doesn’t have much advice outside of the questions. But it is absolutely chock full of technical problems, far outstripping Cracking in both Breadth and Depth of questions. So if you’re also going to get a second book after Cracking, consider Elements a great extension of where Cracking might come up shallow (in terms of # of questions and difficulty). I read about an .5 - 1 hours a night every night on average for the month leading up to the interview.

By the time I flew down there for the interview in July, I was already halfway into my Microsoft summer internship. I had five interviews for the Google affair. QIR from 1: implement a stack that has a getmin() operation; Given an array of integers, representing heights of hills on a landscape, how much water can fit in between all the hills. First interview went well enough. I don’t remember the second interview, but it was intense, and it involved implementing binary search. QIR from 3: given a perfect binary tree with the following two properties: leaves are either 0 or 1, and all other nodes are 1 if both children are 1, else 0 (parent is logical &amp;&amp; of children, essentially), implement a function to update a leaf and maintain the properties of the tree. This was followed by an average case analysis of the run time. QIR from 4: Given a collection of numbers, spread across a distributed system, and you are only allowed a constant amount of memory per system, find the median. Binary search works well here. QIR from 5: given a list of lists containing strings, output all combinations of sentences formed from single elements from each list. Overall I didn’t think the interviews went too terrible.

While I was waiting to hear back from Google, Amazon actually reached out to me out of the blue (again), and quickly set up a full time interview later that week (I have no idea where they got my info, probably the internship). The interview with Amazon ended up not being a very typical interview, and since I have no inhibitions at this point, I’ll be descriptive and a little critical. It went down like this: there were about 24 of us in the same room, and we were placed randomly into a group of 3. There were 3 coding problems the group had to divide between the members, and then solve individually the rest of the day. It was pretty fucking stupid actually, since the only group work was fighting over which problem you’d like to do. The problems descriptions were hidden in a bunch of irrelevant story, so there was a fair amount of sifting to do to get to it. Almost everybody needed clarification of the problems requirements.

After ironing out the problem details, we basically had the entire day to work on it. So yea, Amazon had us code for 5 hours in a closed room. There were two 1v1’s with during the day with engineers, that basically was just talking about how the problem was coming along. I felt these went fairly well. By the end of the day I ended up implementing a solution a couple of different ways (with different time/space complexities, different optimizations etc.). The problem I was working on was something like this: given a list of spots on a web page with time intervals, and a collection of content with different availability, return a schedule of content for the web page. The optimization here is that different content was weighted more than others, so some schedules were more effective than others.  

Funnily enough, Amazon wasted no time in rejecting me for an offer this time around. I admit, I was pretty surprised (again) because as far as I know I nailed the coding, and it even seemed like many others were struggling to even finish their problems. However, coding may not be everything evaluated by Amazon: I was acting like a bit of an asshole during the interview, and not even bothering with the gushy enthusiasm my peers radiated with little shame, or maybe failing to hide my apathy during the half an hour they devoted just to hyping up Seattle (I grew up there, it was all bullshit). Maybe they wanted to get back at me for that internship I turned down. Or maybe I really did stink at the coding. I did meet some cool people working there, but frankly most (especially the proctors) didn’t seem to have much of a sense of humor. Oh well.

Back on the Google front, they requested some supplementary code samples, so I sent over a Dynamic Hash Table implementation I wrote in C# for kicks. And that seemed to do the trick; Google made me an offer not long after. (feel free to PM me if you’re interested in checking it out.)

At this point it was late in the summer, and I was into the latter phase of my internship at Microsoft. I let Microsoft know where I was with Google, and I learned that Microsoft was also interested in bringing me on full time. They pushed out their offer to me as well. So now with two offers on my plate, I had two weeks to decide where I would want to end up. And it was not an easy decision.

After a fair amount of back and forth with the two companies, I was able to beef up both their offers significantly. I’ll not disclose these numbers or the deltas in the post, but if you’d like to know I won’t be ashamed to tell you in a PM. I think having two offers at the same time gave me a significant amount of leverage. The recruiters working with me on both sides were fantastic, answering my questions, offering invaluable advice for my best self interest, and also going to bat for me over the compensation. I have no complaints about the process towards either company. 

As far as making a decision between the two, it was extremely tough. The offers should always come second to job quality. It sounds like most of you respect Google’s job quality well enough, so there’s not much to be said there, but working at Microsoft as an intern has also been great. And declining the Microsoft offer would mean saying goodbye to a team I felt like I had a good chemistry with. Moreover, it seems like getting plugged into the Google machine you could really end up anywhere, and I think that your personal preferences will only hold so much influence. In the end, I did decide to go with Google though, because all the free food will help me get swoll as shit. Just kidding; I went with Google because I wanted to be in California for personal reasons, and I have a thing for them as a company. It was tough saying goodbye to Microsoft though, and I hope that internship won’t be the last chance I have to work there.

And that’s about it. It has been an exciting year all things considered. Everyones experience is different, but I hope mine will help some of you in some way. If for nothing else, there’s a few more questions you can study up on. As far as programming languages go, I pretty much coded in Python, but a handful of the questions I was told to do in C++ and Java. Again, feel free to PM me if there’s more you’d like to know. And if you recognize me form this post, you’re probably one of the ones who knew me well, so thanks again for your help. 

Now I’ve just got to figure out how to find an affordable house in Mountain View. Any advice?

- Graduating with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Math and Biology from a Big Ten School. 

- GPA will be ~ 3.1- 3.2 

**Experience upon graduation:**

2 years in a bioinformatics lab (no pub)

1 year in another bioinformatics lab (currently working here)

2 years president of a computational biology club

2 years tutoring 

0.5 year secretary for my fraternity

**Skills:**

Python

Java

I do not want to go into bioinformatics due to low pay. 

The type of job I want is the typical 9-5, 5 days a week, where I come into work in a suit, sit in my cubicle, drink some coffee, crunch some numbers, maybe go to a corporate meeting, and then go home and relax. 

I'm not sure if I'm even qualified for this type of job or any programming jobs.

The only experience that I have is the programming I did in the labs that I have worked in and I don't think that counts as the real world experience that internships provide that employers are looking for.

What is my next move? 

Is my lack of internship experience, no portfolio (unless you count my python scripts), and my gpa going to ruin my chances of getting a job? 

Am I toast?

I have until the end of this year, pretty much when I graduate.

Here's some info about myself:

- This will be my first quarter as a transfer student studying undergraduate math at a very decent university.

- My intention is to go to graduate school, either for math or for something more employable, such as computer science or engineering. I really love math, but I've heard a lot of scary stuff about a math phD's employability. Between undergraduate and graduate school, I will probably apply for some jobs on the off chance I get some great employment opportunity.  

- I am interested in the actuarial profession, I could see myself working in computer science, and am open to working in finance. I am also interested in cryptology, but I can't even see how I would get my foot in the door to that field. 

- As this is my first quarter, I am thinking of holding off on pursuing internships so i can have some time to adjust to university level schoolwork.  I will probably begin next quarter. Do you guys think this is okay, or should i start looking now?

I am very apprehensive for life after college, and I want to make the most of the time I have now so that I can afford a fairly comfortable life later on.

Some backstory:

I'm 24 years old. Graduated college early with a 3.5 GPA at 21. After a successful year and a half internship doing networking support and obtaining my CCNA, I decided it was time to make a switch in the IT field.

I was always interested in programming, and needed to get my foot in the door. I landed a job at one of the big four accounting firms doing Quality Assurance on their largest product. This gave me great experience to how the field worked. I was able to witness the Software Development + Test Life-cycle, and I was extremely motivated to further my career. Unfortunately, I wasn't making too much money as a QA contractor ($18.XX /hr with 5 hours avg. OT per week).

After expressing interest in programming, they started throwing me small projects to build such as test tools and some data driven automation scripts. I did this for about 6 months and finally mustered up the courage to ask for a raise. They wouldn't budge. 

I needed leverage.. I knew what my worth was to the team I was on. So I started putting my resume out for other recruiters and companies to see. The response was amazing. I had too many calls coming in that I needed to stop answering some. 

So I met up with a recruiter for a full-time, permanent position. It was for a Junior development position! Exactly what I was looking for. There was one catch.. they said I would be working in quality assurance for 4-6 months while I learned the application that I would be working on. This seemed fair to me, since the application was fairly complicated. This is also where I made my biggest mistake.

The recruiter won me over when he took me out to lunch and said, very sternly, ""Do **NOT** express any interest in staying in QA long-term. You won't get the job. They are looking for someone to train and make a senior developer in 1-2 years."" Just what I wanted. So I interviewed with the company and did great. They called me back and offered me a position with a starting salary in the mid $50k's.

I accepted the job and started in QA.. only I wasn't testing the product I was going to be working on. Soon enough, they found out from my internship experience, I had a lot of IT experience. So they made me a backup sysadmin and it instantly doubled my workload. Months went by and I kept asking, ""When am I going to be transitioned over?"" They kept telling me, ""soon."" So I waited.

My test manager quit right around 6 months of me being at my job. He was the only one fighting to get me my development position anymore. He came clean with me and told me that because of the people I associated with at work (the main IT guy), who was not liked by our CTO (the boss at my location), I was no longer going to be moved to development. 

A few months later, I asked my 'now acting' manager if I was still going to be moved to the position, after my former manager had quit. She said ""Not any time in the foreseeable future."" So here I am. Stuck. I bought a house because I had so much faith in this job, in an area where other jobs in my field are not in high commodity. I now get to use my computer engineering degree to write hundred(s) of page long word documents that we use as test plans. I also get to watch other developers a little older than I am without much experience get hired in to positions that I could easily fill. 

Its been a 1 year and 5 months. The only jobs I'm able to find offering me anything are more QA positions, since that's what my resume is loaded up with now. I have no idea what to do. Moral of the story to others starting out in the field.. stay away from companies who promise you other positions without a very STRICT plan laid out on how you're going to get there. Also ask for an exact time frame. Get it in writing. 

**TL;DR** - I was hired in to a Jr. Dev position but was told I would be in QA 4-6 months. 1yr.5mos. later and there is no dev position here for me, and probably never will be.

I went to college for Information Technology, initially planning to concentrate on Networking. My school required that I get an internship during my last semester, and I was able to get one with my dad's employer writing some pretty simple programs in Microsoft Access. After college, they let me come on full-time and I kept on programming. 

Unfortunately, I've stuck around this place way too long because it was comfortable, I think. I've moved on to working in Visual Studio writing in VB. I've never really had a mentor or other programmers to learn from, so I just write code the best I can Googling all the while. I'm not sure I'm doing it the ""right"" way, I guess...

Question Time:
I want to really get onto track with making a career of this, and I'm not going to get anywhere at this job (been here for over 2 years and I know there's no chance of improving my lot). I want to know what kind of job I should start looking for. I've been thinking about getting into C#. My beginner/intermediate programming classes in college were taught in it and I've been thinking about getting a Microsoft certification (98-361 Software Development Fundamentals) for C#. Is this a good idea, or is there something I should do instead? What kind of job titles should I be looking for? What should I do to make myself look more desirable? 

I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but I really have no guidance as far as my career goes. Thanks for any help/advice."

Anyway, I screwed up my sophomore year GPA-wise, and I haven't been doing much outside of school, (like extra curricular, clubs, etc.) and these are the things colleges look for. I really regret not doing anything about this sooner, because colleges focus on sophomore and junior year, and now half of my opportunities are gone... I'm pretty sure I want to pursue Computer Science/Engineering or software development as a major and career. If I do well junior year, I can probably recover from the dip in GPA during sophomore year, but I don't really know what else I can do that will help my chances. 

I know that the status of universities they graduated from often does help people land better jobs with higher pay, so this problem is becoming of the utmost importance to me. 

What kind of things would you suggest I do to help my chances of being accepted? I have been thinking -if I get good enough- that I can get an internship in comp sci. somewhere, and maybe I can participate in hackathons or something...? I have seen many suggestions to work on open-source projects, but what exactly does that mean? Would anyone be able to refer me to a few projects that a person with mastery of the basics could work on? Would kind of thinks should I focus my time on?

I know this post wasn't very to-the-point, so If clearing anything up would help you answer my question, I will gladly do so.

I intend to graduate next spring, but I'm taking 6 classes (19 credits) this semester, and will have to do the same next semester to meet all of my degree (Csci) requirements. They're all upper division classes; there are plenty of grad students in them. Thus, I'm being held to a bit of a higher standard than I'm used to. 

None of the classes I need would be offered in the summer, so another semester would delay graduation by about 7 months. 7 months where I could be making a good salary, instead of an intern's.

My school has a policy where 13+ credits are required per semester, but anything beyond that is free. Which is a huge incentive to pile on credits; but I'm always behind, and just working on whatever is most immediate. 

I have a math class that is just 4 tests and a final. That means I don't do any work for it, because there are always more pressing issues. Now, I have my first test on Friday, and I literally haven't studied once.

Add on to that, I need to work at least 25-30hrs/week at my internship to pay rent and other living costs. 

And I'm moving house this weekend. Which involves paying October's rent and a security deposit...AND I have to pay for October at my current apartment, because I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to read a lease and didn't give the contractual 90 day notice (I gave 60).

I haven't seen my friends in about two weeks. 

This summer I was working out 4-5 days a week, and running about 15 miles. That stopped September 2nd.

I don't know if I can do this, but I have to try. It all reminds me though of my most recent semester from hell (last fall). Around finals, I just wanted to curl up in bed and cry. I felt both numb and a huge weight in my chest. Now I feel like that everyday, and I've still got 3 months left...And then another 4 after winter break. 

Fuck, I need to get on Adderall immediately."

- Chase my years old dream, and get into the navy for a technical function.

- Chase my new-found love for programming and go to HBO (college)

My personal cons for joining the navy; I don't really know yet what my career chances are when I get out of the navy, and how long I can work there, and if I can still go to college/ get a college degree career if I won't work there long enough.

2hfb6m,36,2014-09-25,Experience at career fair,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hfb6m/experience_at_career_fair/,"Is this subreddit full of bs? Have you ever wondered? Curious about all those recruiter's tips on how to approach them and sell yourself? 

Fear not as I delve into these questions for science.

Recently I attended a career fair and armed myself with the advice and wisdom from this subreddit and various threads posted. Some examples include:  
-Formatting my resume: http://imgur.com/Hq3qIsu  
-smiling and showing enthusiasm  
-doing research on the company (allocated 5mins per company)

I am a computer engineer major and the type of person who suffers from the imposter syndrome and honestly I went in there thinking I wouldn't get a single glance from any of the recruiters due to my lackluster resume. But I decided to trudge forward and see where it goes.

The first company was bit of a dud as they only offered as testing position and was one of those companies that would hire anybody. Not to say this is terrible as I have a OPTION but not the best. 

Second company went better. A lot better. They specialized doing contract works with the military and had some really cool stuff and credentials (NSA accredited testing facility). I talked to the recruiter and he apparently absolutely loved the resume. He especially loved the android (as this was on their listing) and the window environment with c/c++ (I was really surprised to hear him praise that portion). We talked and laughed. I made sure to smile and put energy behind my voice to not sound monotone and told him my interest of the security topic relaying my experience of looking up the history of MD5 and sha hashes (afterwards he tells me they were working on an encryption project so I lucked out I feel). My absolute mission was to avoid that pitfall of having a poker face throughout the discussion. Ultimately the guy really liked me (even mentioned that it was nice to see someone with enthusiasm)  and gave me his card to contact further. Sweet.

After that I decided why the hell not and shoot for the Microsoft booth. That really sucked for a bit as they had only two guys while there was at least 30 of us students waiting (wait time was at least a good 30min+). To be fair, they spent a good 5-10 mins talking with EVERYBODY going over the resume quite meticulously and even making notes on the back of the resume after (which was interesting as I didn't notice any other companies doing this). When I finally approached the guy, we introduced and again I tried to have a good pitch and smile. As we went over the resume, he really liked the fact that I had android experience and liked the resume overall (even stating that this is what they like to see). Majority of the conversation was about what the 12 week internship entails. However he did mention that internally they were changing on their stance of the azure cloud and are going full on with the microsoft azure cloud computing. He advised that I become familiar with it and mention about it on the phone interview (Hint??). When he got to the school project portion I did mention that I had originally more but stuck to the one page format and omitted the others out. I told him how I figured it would be more fun to read about the Craps game instead of the other project and he AGREED (also stating that was good I kept it one page). Good experience and crossing fingers. 

During my wait in the Microsoft line, I was standing next to a buddy of mine and noticed he held a pamphlet. I was curious and asked about it. Apparently, according to him, he was walking around finding more booths to go to and one of the recruiters for the said company noticed his name tag and major (computer science) and SPECIFICALLY pointed/pulled him out of the crowd. So naturally after I was done with Microsoft I head straight there. The guy liked the fact I was computer engineer and proceeded to SELL ME the positions. That felt so empowering to know they wanted me haha. Again kept a cheering personality going and sold it (hopefully). 

I went to other various companies but they weren't too eventful to describe. There was another big name company I tried to apply which went great (again recruiter mentioned how she loved my enthusiasm) but once I talked to their other recruiter it went downhill after I told him my gpa was below 3.0 (only company so far to ask for gpa). As soon as I said that he looked right at me and made that ""you are dead to me"" look. It was very disheartening at that instance. It is worth mentioning the lady recruiter, who loved my personality, was telling me how they were holding a little meeting/interview(?) later tonight and advised me to talk to the other recruiter (male) to get more info. After my discussion with the guy I mentioned about tonight's meeting and, its hilarious in retrospect, he completely dodges the question and states that to ""look"" out for an email. BS alert! But w.e I am not going to let one uptight company bring me down. 

So overall I think it went great and I think it is safe to say that the people here on this subreddit knows what they are talking about (not a bunch of 14 year old trolls). I do want to thank everyone here and am really excited about it all. 

And so here is the advice to follow along:  
-Keep your resume ONE PAGE long. Not two. One. I saw too many people have stapled resume. Unless you won the Turing medal or were a nominee, then keep it one. 

-Got no experience like me? Have a side project of whatever. I chose android specifically because of how quick you can learn it and deploy an application so quickly with relative ease. Also it is one of the most popular OS in the market. Even Microsoft is allowing integration of Android on their cloud which is smart cause why the hell are you going to compete with the biggest player in the market. That's like trying to make a new play-doh and going to the market competing against...Play-doh...

-SMILE AND SHOW ENTHUSIASM. I know this is a bit of a vague description but it is what it is. I saw WAY too many candidates carry a poker face throughout the fair and discussions with the recruiters. WTF. That is boring and you have to understand those people (recruiters) are talking to multiple people in a hour and in quick succession. You don't want to be known as the student. You want to be the guy. Try smiling and sound boring at the same time. It's hard. Break out a smile and laugh a little with them. Use hand gestures. Don't sit there with a blank face. It is awkward. This tip alone will make you beat half the pack already. I made all my recruiters smile and laugh as this was my mission. I think I made a little impact as I have seen too many recruiters sit there with a bored face scrutinizing the hundredth resume.

-be genuine (goes with above).

-do research on the company. Not only does it impress the recruiters (noticed a lot of them perk up with attention as soon as I mention I have looked at their website) but it also gives you material to use in your ""elevator"" speech. I go something along the lines of: ""Hi, My name is blah. I am a computer engineering major and have experience in blargh (mention your skillset that overlaps their interest in the job listing). I was looking at your website and noticed you guys do blah blah blah and I would really like this opportunity and think I would make a great addition... (or w.e closure you want to insert/replace). Again, differentiate from the pack. 

If any actual recruiters want to edit or advise against I say here then please comment here and help the brothers and sisters out.

What I want to do is android development. I wish to work as an android developer. I am not attending college. I am working a couple of bs jobs to pay the rent. In my spare time I am working on android development. I am about to finish my first app.  At the very least I have motivation and a strong work ethic.

My next step is to get an internship. I have a couple of leads. Which means I have obtained a couple of business cards of people that I have spoken with that are open to giving internships. I currently want nothing more than to get an internship.

I am great at interviewing but in order for me to do that with getting an android internship I need to know what assets I have and what I should 
seek.

Can I reasonably expect to find a paid internship? Is there anything I should look for in obtaining an internship? Am I ready for an internship, or how do I gauge if I am ready? I am still a beginner is my largest asset my drive and motivation? 

At the least I must reach out to my few leads before too much time passes. I would be most grateful for any input.

Thanks"
2hfz6p,1,2014-09-25,"My University tells us we need to research all the companies we are going to meet at the career fair, and that intimidated me. Should I avoid a career fair that I haven't ""prepared for""? And as an undergrad, is it too soon to start talking to recruiters?",Ntopper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hfz6p/my_university_tells_us_we_need_to_research_all/,"There is a pretty significant career fair at my university on Monday, and I just found out about it. Iv'e got a pretty good project list for an undergraduate, and even one first author position on a real publication related to one of them (I made a new method for synchronizing video from a camcorder with physiological data recorded on an acquisition machine, wrote a software implementation, and now it's pending publication). But everything I have done has been solo, so I'm not sure how that looks. Also, I was looking at my github, and realized that some of my older projects have some novice-ish decisions that I wouldn't make anymore, and I sort of want to fix them.     
    
There are a few companies at the fair who I want to do an internship for, and if asked ""when do you graduate"" my answer to some of them would be ""eventually, but the degree isn't that important to me because I know I would learn more in my first few weeks of working than the rest of my education"".  So I think I'm ready to start talking to them but I'm just not sure.    
    
The department hosting the career fair said that we should be researching the companies we are going to talk to, and it makes me think I would look like a fool unless I had spent a few weeks learning about every little consulting firm or whatever that is going to be there. Is that true? Wouldn't a career fair involve dialog? What would I talk about to these people if I already knew everything about their company? And what else is there to know about Google/MS/Amazon that isn't already common knowledge to anyone who is into tech? 
    
Also, I'm really intimidated by the thought of standing in line to hand a resume to the big giants who are going to be there (I.E. Google). Iv'e always aspired to work for someone like Google, and part of me thinks I should skip this one, so I can actually prepare a portfolio and also get on some non-solo projects that look more like something that would be seen in the professional world?    
    
If my resume goes into the ""meh"" pile, does my name go on a ""meh"" list forever? Or am I just forgotten until the next time I have an opportunity to speak with them? "

2hgwww,1,2014-09-25,"Just got home after almost 15 months of treatment, living with my parents and they don't trust me at all",DreamwingTheDruid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2hgwww/just_got_home_after_almost_15_months_of_treatment/,"Edit: I'm an 18-year-old gay male.
Edit: Treatment for anxiety and depression, not drugs.

Rewriting this cause the first draft was so long I didn't think anyone would read it.

It all stems from an incident last year, before treatment. I had just started coming out and being more comfortable with my sexuality. We were in California, I was talking with a guy on Grindr , he came to the hotel and picked me up, he took me to his house, he banged, and he dropped me off back at the hotel. He was 37 and I was 17. When I left, everyone had been of doing their own thing, but when I got back, they asked questions and I bullshitted about where I had been. I'm not good at lying and don't like to do so, and when my sister took my phone while I was in the shower and started snooping around, she found Grindr and the texts and blah blah blah. My parents confronted me and I told them everything. They were livid, but not too much came from it since I went to treatment less than two weeks later.   
  
I admit it is not a good idea to have a stranger take you to his house out of state and not tell anyone where you are going. My penis clouded my judgment. Though I was very cautious and if I had noticed anything suspicious I would have immediately broke off contact while talking, not met up with him, or left without a word etc. I insisted on condoms and refused poppers. I did minimize risks a bit. I thought thing would have changed after all the good work I did over the past 15 months: learned to manage anxiety and depression, lived in an apartment with two roommates, completed high school, held an internship, got off my meds, further honed my emotional abilities, became much more patient, preparing to go to college, etc.  
 
But they hover more than ever. If my phone vibrates, my mom asks who I am talking to. If I leave the house, if I don't tell her exactly what I'm doing and how long it will take, she starts asking who I am going to meet. If I'm in the bathroom and I don't pick up the home phone when she calls, she texts me asking where I am and who I am with. She constantly tries to see what I'm doing on my phone or computer. She won't leave me at home for over an hour and even when I am home she constantly checks in on me. My dad isn't nearly as overt, but he supports her. My brother took my car for the winter since I was gone and I have to be taken everywhere by my parents. My town is small and nothing is in walking distance. I have no friends. My mom says I need to leave the house more, but still acts like the gatekeeper. I am taking classes at the local college, and yet I have to be dropped off by my mom. I just feel so unbelievably trapped, especially since I had just been living in an apartment in Puerto Rico and had so much freedom. 
 
But the hardest part is that I can't just tell them that I won't meet up with any guys (and normally it is just to meet or a mini-date, not NSA sex), because I'm not good at lying. And all I want, more than anything in the world right now, is to feel the embrace of another man. A hand on my chest or shoulder fills me with electricity that I can't experience anywhere else. I have felt as though my heart is ash, and my veins are filled only with cold sand for all my life. I desire that warmth. It fills my every waking thought. 
 
When I said to my parents a few days ago that I was going on a date with someone, we started to have a conversation/argument. To break it down, they think it's inappropriate to have a relationship with anyone who is not 18 (my age), that men are too dangerous, it's too risky to meet anyone you haven't met in person, etc. They are pretty conservative, and I can hear from the way they speak and craft their sentences and the words etched in their faces that they are trying to be accepting of their son, but they don't want him to be with another man. 
  
My therapists and life coaches always told me ""it gets better."" And I know this. But that doesn't help me in the now, where the pain takes place. I have no support network. I feel caged and as though my wings have been clipped. This is all so much harder when you're alone and I don't know what to do.

Thank you if you got this far, I appreciate it immensely."

I'm a sophomore in CS and in the past two days I just went through 3 rounds of interviewing for a software engineering internship for the summer of 2015. The first two were purely technical, and the third was with senior management and was partially technical, but was mostly focused on my background, interests, and the company. I'm feeling great about the interviews, but I need to put the icing on the cake with some follow up emails.

Unfortunately, I didn't think to get business cards from my interviewers, so now my only contact is with HR. Would it be acceptable to send an email to HR to forward just to senior management, or should I send another email for my technical interviewers as well? Any advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
2hh6np,11,2014-09-25,Graduated from VT and now I'm working at a call center for a bank....where did I go wrong?,hokiegrad2012,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2hh6np/graduated_from_vt_and_now_im_working_at_a_call/,"At one of those points where everything just hit me and I'm sitting here like, ""woah, where did I go wrong?"" I could certainly use some advice.

Let's start from the beginning...

I graduated in December 2012, a semester earlier than expected from Virginia Tech. I studied Communication and Political Science, double major, (I know, might have been my first mistake) but at the time, I thought it was a great fit. I loved to write, loved the idea of marketing (but sucked at math to major in it), and I was hopeful and ambitious. I did my fair share of internships: writing press releases for a campus departmental office, summers at a small PR agency, running the college newspaper and their respective social media pages. After graduating, I jumped into the first opportunity: moving back home to work at the PR agency where I had interned at the previous summer. It was a small place, no big name clients but I loved the boss (she was a real go-getter, powerful woman and I idolized her) and they felt confident in me, helped me learn. After a few months, I might have gotten too comfortable and made a few mistakes (submitted a press release without the clients approval) and I was let go from my very first big girl job. (Side note: Pay was $12 an hour, no overtime, no benefits).

I searched and searched for another PR opportunity but all the interviews came out same result: not enough experience. I wasn't going to go through another round of being an unpaid intern. After two or three months of no luck, I looked in other directions. Living in my home state of Delaware, we are the corporate home of all the big banks. I picked among them and applied for a few customer service rep opportunities. After I submitted my application, I received notification I wasn't qualified. WHAT? There was some type of prescreening questionnaire and I figured that had to be what was causing this absurdity. After a few more tries, I received an invite to interview for ""Customer Sales Associate."" Interview was very relaxed, I was offered the job the next day. Pay: $15.13 an hour, plus benefits and opportunity to earn incentive each month. 

My first day impression: where did they find these people? My hiring class was 20+ people, all ages and backgrounds. There were a few more mature employees: coming from different career paths, looking for another opportunity. Yet, the majority of these people were 25-35 years old with no bank experience, just retail or food industries. There was even an 19 year old who just graduated high school. I was the only one who had graduated from college recently. Yikes. Luckily, I was great at the job. It involves answering customer service calls, servicing the customer and then soliciting a balance transfer or another sale. I ranked in the top 5 associates my first month and received an $800 incentive. After three months, they asked me to be a coach for the next new hire class and I jumped at the opportunity to get off the phones (boy, it is rough). 

I was a coach for three months and they told me I did a great job but that was the maximum they allowed someone to be off the phone so I went back at it. I was told while I excelled, I would have to wait until my one-year anniversary to start to look at other opportunities in the bank. I was discouraged....I felt like I hit my plateau and did all I could do for the department and I was back at square one: taking calls everyday. I started to network and look to see what else the bank offered, there was endless opportunities: fraud, credit, operations, collections, everything under the sun and my dream....marketing. Ah yes, finally a way I can express my creative and writing sensibilities. I reached out to my new contacts and got to meet a few executives in the marketing department. I received my good feedback from there and I came back to my department feeling confident and hopeful.

After months of waiting, my year was here and coincidentally a marketing opportunity opened as well. I applied, a month later, I interviewed, another month later, I found out they chose to go with someone who had worked in the role as a vendor and they felt they were more experienced with the role. Ah, of course. These opportunities don't arise often, maybe one role every 6 months and competition is tough. I feel confident I'd rock at the job but this waiting game will be the death of me. 

Meanwhile, I continue to take calls day in and day out and it's a huge drag. I'm gaining no skill and I'm bored to death. I need to express my creativity, I want to be busy again!!! I need the chaos. I feel like I'm in a major career slump and I understand that starting your career takes time but almost 2 years after graduating, I feel I've made no progress to where I want to be. 

What good did going to college do for me? The majority of people who I work with never went and I could have obtained this same role 5 years ago when I graduated high school. What a major fail.

Aside from my daughter, my family consists of just me, my brother and parents, no other relatives are alive or in the area that we talk to. I have a decent job and I’ve been living either with friends or alone for about 12 years, and I’ve had weekend custody of my daughter her whole life, but that's about to change to full custody. My brother (34) has been living primarily with my dad for the majority of his adult life. Living off my dad, I should say, as my dad has been paying for all of his, often lavish, living expenses. I think the best way to get this down might be to break my family up into groups.

.

**My daughter and her mother:** My daughter and I are close, she is the highlight of my life and she is smart, sweet, and wonderful. I met her mother at my job when I was 19, and aside from ending up with a daughter that I love, getting involved with the mother was a huge mistake. I was young and naive. She's what a lot of people would call a ""ghetto hood rat."" She has a great personality in a lot of ways, but more than anything she is chaotic, prone to losing her temper, and prone to making bad decisions. My daughter was living with her mother for the first 7 years of her life, and the two moved in with my daughter's mother's mother about four years ago. I had a verbal agreement of getting my daughter on the weekends (her mother and I couldn't make the relationship work, having tried and failed several times). Daughter's mother was mostly unemployed, living off child support and welfare, but had also gotten involved with someone who made money through a fake charity fraud, and was living off that as well.

.

Perhaps no surprise, she had also become an addict. She took Norcos, a high strength form of Vicodin, at first for back problems but soon recreationally. She was open about taking them for her back, but soon it became obvious that she was taking more and more. She would create ""emergencies"" and use my daughter as a way of getting me to give her much more than the $600 per month I paid in child support, saying things like we're out of food, I need gas money/ bus money or I’ll miss this job interview, ect. These emergencies became increasingly frequent and her behavior was getting increasing erratic and hostile, and she was already a pretty erratic and hostile person, with me at least. 

.

After discussing the situation with people and putting some thought into it, I decided that I should stop giving her additional money, as I was clearly just enabling her drug habit. Meanwhile, I was saving to eventually hire a lawyer to attempt to get increased or full custody, though I was beginning to realize that a father getting full custody is extremely difficult in California, not to mention extremely expensive. Part of my plan, honestly, was also to wait for her to make a huge mistake and end up in jail or something, likely by getting into a fight with a friend or boyfriend. Despite her chaos, she was always pretty good with our daughter though. She was warm and nurturing with her, hadn’t lost her temper or hit her or anything, and hadn't yet put her in any risk or danger through negligence. 

.

Then one day she called me with one of her typical emergency situations. It was on a Saturday evening during my daughter’s winter break from school. I had my daughter and was scheduled to bring her back that night and then go to work (I work graveyard shift). It was 11th hour and she told me that she needed $100 for food for the week, otherwise I would need to keep my daughter for the rest of the week, knowing that that would be really hard to manage on short notice. I went back and forth with her for a while about it (I make sure my daughter doesn’t overhear these conversations), and eventually called the grandmother and told her about the situation. She told me to just bring my daughter there, said there was plenty of food in the house and she could look after her. The grandmother’s a lot more reasonable and knows all about her daughter’s tendencies. 

.

A little while after bringing my daughter there, I got a call from my daughter’s mother, who was furious. She told me that she had picked my daughter up and brought her to her friend’s house down the street (where she was now crashing at about half the time). She said her mother couldn’t watch her, and said that if I didn’t wire her money or pick my daughter up immediately she was going to drive my daughter to a park somewhere and leave her there. She told me this on the phone and via text messages, and at this point I had installed a call recording app as means to get more evidence for custody, so I decided to call in sick to work and go there and get the police involved. Immediately after emailing work I got a text from her saying that she’d just kicked my daughter out of the house and sent her walking. I called the grandmother who was already on the phone with the police. My daughter had run to her house screaming and crying. I drove there immediately and picked my daughter up. 

.

Her grandmother and I then went through the long process of getting CPS involved, who took about a month to even get the ball rolling on anything. I told the grandmother that I didn’t want to bring my daughter back to her school until it was illegal for her mother to come get her, so I worked it out with my parents to keep her with me over at their places for about a month. This actually proved to be a pretty wise decision, because the principal later told me that my daughter’s mother had been going there almost daily looking for her, and legally they would have had to let her take her.  

.

After many meetings with CPS, they decided to place my daughter into temporary foster care custody with her grandmother, and would give re-unification programs to both me and her mother, though mine would be much easier and have many less requirements. I was OK with temporary custody for the grandmother, as I was living with roommates and needed a little time to move out, not to mention change my shift at work, but CPS’s justification for not giving me immediate full custody was that they believed that I didn’t do enough to protect my daughter from her mother and try to contact authorities or get custody. I strongly disagree with that decision, as before this incident I didn’t have any hard proof that she was on drugs, I had no smoking guns for a custody case, and any attempt to gain custody would have likely backfired and resulted in minimal custody (weekends, which I already had) and caused retaliation from the mother. 

.

This is getting to be an incredibly long post, so to finalize this part, I’ve now moved out and I am in the process of moving in with my dad, as it’s the only way to make full custody work immediately with my graveyard schedule and CPS’s requirements. I currently take my daughter there about 4 days a week and should be getting full custody within 6 months. My brother is moving out of my dad’s and into my mom’s garage, and right now the two of us are sort of living at both parent’s houses.

.

**My brother and dad:** My brother is 34, he’s an art major and has a degree, but has mostly been unemployed his entire adult life and has mostly been living at my dad’s. He and my dad have a codependent relationship, they are both pretty socially isolated and in some ways socially inept. My dad is 73 and is still working, mainly just to support my brother. Neither my dad, nor my brother really have any friends, and it’s me and my mom’s suspicion that my dad wants my brother to remain dependent on him out of fear of being alone. I see my dad about once a week, bringing my daughter there, though now it’s gone up to 3 or 4 days a week. My mom sees him about once a week, though the two of them are divorced and get into fights on a pretty regular basis, mainly due to my mom’s personality issues really. My brother’s pretty immature for a 34 year old, and he’s also obsessive about a lot of things. He spends a ton of time looking in the mirror and obsessing about his appearance. He had a nose job when he was younger and he tells me, on and off, that he’s going to get another one because they didn’t make it small enough. More than anything, he’s extremely scattered. He loses things all the time, misses appointments, and can’t manage bills. 

.

He started taking Adderall for his ADHD a few years ago, and it was around that time that he decided that he was going to launch his own startup company and make an a children’s storybook app. This involved renting out an office by my dad’s house (while unemployed), taking questionably legal advantage of free interns via craigslist ads, and for over a year costing my dad at least twice of what he normally costs him, which is a lot. My brother has since stopped taking the Adderall and the startup company has since mostly fallen apart, though he’s still saying that he’s going to release this app soon. 

.

The app, like many other aspects of my brother’s life, reminds me of that door in the Shining that kept getting further away the more the woman ran towards it. It’s been “just about finished” for maybe two years now, and before the app even, my brother had been telling me for years that he’s just going to work on (fill in the blank) for a little while longer, and if that doesn’t work out he’s going to just get a job and work on a career. 

.

One reason I think moving into my dad’s will be good is that it might break the codependency that he and my brother have. My brother has been staying in my mom’s garage pretty much since I moved out. I have been there a lot because it is closer to my job than my dad’s, and because I am fixing up the garage, trying to entice my brother into staying there. I have made the garage extremely comfortable, having moved in my 70 inch TV, a mini-fridge, internet, etc, and my brother found himself a full time job at minimum wage about 5 minutes away from my mom’s. My mom is on board with having her garage taken over and wants my brother to live there for the same reasons I do. 

.

But as I’m seeing my dad and brother more, I have realized the crazy extent of my brother’s mooching. In the past week, I’ve seen that my brother has called my dad at least five times, each time asking him to wire at least $100 into his account for one reason or another, and each time my dad’s done it. I would probably estimate that my brother costs my dad at least $2,000 dollars a month. I’ve talked to my dad before about the possibility of cutting my brother off or least having a small set amount that he gives him each month. My dad says that he’s planning to eventually do that but won’t simply cut him off immediately, because he thinks that my brother would end up homeless. He’s also told me that if it weren’t for my brother’s costs he would be retired now. This is frustrating to know, especially seeing the way my brother frivolously spends. He wastes tons of gas, buys tons of trivial toys that he clearly doesn’t need, he’s even adopting a child in some third world country at $80 a month. Don’t get me wrong, that’s a great thing to do, but not when it’s someone else’s money you’re spending. My dad often talks about his own budget concerns and I doubt he would do that himself. The other day my brother was over and couldn’t find his pen for his Wacom tablet, and after looking around for it for about 15 minutes he decided that the dog must have gotten it and so he called my dad saying that he needed $100 to buy a new one, and my dad wired him money for it. 15 minutes tops he looked around for that thing and I’m willing to bet the dog didn’t take it.

.

**My mother:** My mother is smart and has several very good qualities, but she has some odd emotional issues and a definite drinking problem. She can get high strung, often has very low patience, and at certain times is pretty much impossible to avoid getting into an argument with. I have a much better, or at least calmer relationship with her than my brother does, and don’t argue much with her these days, but I think that’s partly because I’ve learned how to deal with her. She doesn’t really get outright hostile, but often is very passive aggressive and talks to people in a very insulting, sarcastic tone of voice. She was adopted into a family that neglected her, and she can’t really seem to get along with anybody for a long period of time without fighting with them and thinking that they’re being abusive or manipulative in some way, when usually that person is simply responding to her defensiveness. She’s pretty quick to get very, very defensive over nothing. She’s also pretty intrusive and controlling. It’s hard to fully relax in her presence because she’s always liable to start commanding you around in a very bossy tone. She also has a tendency to over worry, and she treats her children like children, often referring to me or my brother as “my little baby” or something along those lines, talking to us in the tone that a mother would be talking to her infant child, and I think that’s kind of weird

.

Anyway, that’s about all I have to say about all that."
2hi35f,8,2014-09-26,Recent grad feeling like driftwood. How does one get direction in life?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2hi35f/recent_grad_feeling_like_driftwood_how_does_one/,"Recent college grad here with a BA in Economics. Gotta start paying off student loans soon, so I need to find work soon. No job or internship experience, which I recently found out would be detrimental to my job search. Now I know. Definitely not going to grad school because I can't afford the additional debt. 

Right now, I'm living at my parents' house, looking for jobs online. I graduated from college not knowing what I wanted to do with my life and with nothing to show for except for my degree LOL

The following is my Action Plan (**and please give me feedback on the particulars**):
1. Keep researching econ-related jobs (Financial Analyst, Underwriter, etc.)

2. Keep applying to econ-related jobs (the ones I don't absolutely hate, but don't be picky)

3. If no replies from employers after 1 more week, seek out the help of temp agencies (hopefully land a temp position and show my worth as hard worker)

4. If no replies from temp agencies, fall back to non-econ-related jobs

5. If no replies from employers after 4 months, work on an oil rig or something

**How did you figure out what your career would be? What's your story?** My parents don't have any useful connections, and I don't either. All I got is the Internet. I have a long list of econ-related jobs, but it still isn't really helpful as you would imagine.

**Are there any entry-level positions or burgeoning industries out there that don't require experience?** If it's related to my degree, that'd be preferred, but it's cool if it's not! In my mind, I think having an unconventional job that is unrelated to or doesn't even require a college degree is better than being unemployed. The last thing I want to do is sit idly by and mooch off of my parents.

**After you've figured out your career, how do you effectively and efficiently get a job (other than the obvious answer of networking like crazy)?** I plan to send out resumes to Indeed, Monster, company websites, etc. I have a LinkedIn account, but it's pretty empty because I have no experience nor any connections. Maybe, I can also hit up my alumni association.

First off, I hope this post didn't come off as negative or whiny. I just don't know what the hell to do when it comes to this stuff. I'm a humble and mostly positive guy, and I don't expect the world especially when I haven't worked a day in my life. Obviously, when I find gainful employment, I got to work my butt off and prove my worth to see any progress. All in all, I'm nervous and excited for the future. **Please tell me if I'm missing anything or if you'd like to give me some words of wisdom.** I know it's going to be hard to give me any feedback especially since you don't know my particular talents and/or inclinations, but I don't feel like I really know myself either. Please give me your honest, unfiltered feedback. I'm running out of time. And aren't we all?"

I've been thinking about dropping to 9 credits each semester because it's all I really need to graduate next year. Would this hurt my chances when applying for full time jobs? I guess more generally, are the companies I apply to even going to ask for a transcript and find out about it?

I'm looking at applying mostly to larger companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Dropbox, etc...

I've been studying software engineering for about 5 years, and a few days ago I sent my resume to Microsoft for an internship. 

I started reading the book Cracking the coding interview, which tells you about the interview on big software companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. As soon as I started reading the coding questions, I noticed one thing: I'm a mediocre developer.

I've made several programs and apps, BUT the issue is that I rely on Google 100%. I don't know anything about design, or structures or basically anything. 

The book shows you sample questions. I haven't been able to solve anything. Not even the most basic questions. I feel like shit, honestly. 

So, I really want to be a good developer. And also I really want to enter in the internship. I have like 1 week to learn the essentials and pass the first filter. Then more time to get better.

The question is: How can I be good enough in this short amount of time to pass the first filter? What do I do, what do I read? I really, REALLY need some good advice. 

Thanks guys.

Wow guys, this was a great response that I totally didn't expect! Thank you :) I'll probably get in touch with any of you who have offered to help in a couple of weeks :) thanks a lot everyone :)


Hi there guys!

Can I start by saying this is one of my favourite subreddits. Having been in the games industry for just over a year, I'm still pretty new to this so you guys have helped me learn a lot, which I'm greatful for.

To cut to the chase, I've spent the last year as a production intern at a developers who use scrum. I'm now back at my final year of university, and I've gt a dissertation to write! I noticed whilst working that there were certain parts of scrum that we didn't bother with, when maybe we should have. I started to think about other developers, and wondered if they too decided to pick and choose what elements of scrum suited them, and if there was any correlation between what was dropped, and why was that the case?

I'm therefore looking for people experienced in scrum to be awesome and let me interview them. I've still got a bit of research to do before I start interviewing, it'll be a month or two yet but I'd appreciate if anyone who was interested in helping could comment or send me a message, so I can guage interest and get intouch with you at a later date.

Apologies for the long post, I'm strangely really excited about this project!

Thanks in advance :)"

The plan:

1. I have been, and intend to continue, taking CS MOOCs from various universities, some big names, some not so much, some self-paced, some on a schedule. I have about six months to do this full-time, and then I'll need to balance it with a job again. I also have a big library of texts on best practices.

2. I have connected with a women's tech career group and an alternative education center in town, and I want to create study groups and/or teach beginning programming skills myself through these organizations. I have experience in education and I do not expect or need to get paid.

3. During this time, I will work on small open-source projects of my own and contribute to others' larger open-source projects. I have a GitHub account to share my work on, and while my early efforts have been pretty pathetic, I intend to keep refactoring through my level-ups. When my six months are up, I'll probably decrease my MOOC workload by a lot and focus on learning through projects and building up a portfolio.

4. I'd like to leverage the connections and reputation I've hopefully made for myself by this time to seek one or more internships in my own town with the small but successful tech ventures actually located here. It would be awfully nice if I got paid for this.

5. When I feel prepared to get the most out of it, and when I'm able to take time away from my home, I want (so badly) to apply for Hacker School in NYC until I am accepted, with a grant for my living expenses while there. I want to take that time not only to improve my craft, but to show other participants and program heads that I have the determination and the humility to try ambitious things and fail.

6. I could get recruited from Hacker School. That is how they fund themselves. Or, if I do a good job at my internship and the culture is a fit, maybe I could turn that into something more permanent. I'd like to have the option to work remotely wherever I end up. If I am unable to do either of those things, maybe teaching beginners the basics is a better fit for me. tl;dr ... Profit(?)

7. 10 years later, I want to be working either for myself or an organization that is awesome on a Fog Creek scale, specifically doing things that make the world a better place for people who really need it.

Am I a narcissist? Are my expectations too high? Do I need more time? Do I sound like I'm just looking for a pat on the back here, ""nice plan""? Am I setting myself up for disappointment? Halllp.

I'm honestly pondering ideas, and frankly you have to think that over time several thousand, if not hundreds of thousands of Humans are still lost in space. How bad do you really think it could get?

~~~~

Contingency 
A Story from the Jenkins-verse 
Prologue: What if? 

Granth scowled, his black eyes narrowing on his grey skin, the Corti reexamined the information presented In front of him. The intel he had hacked from Trig's systems had been horrifying to say the least. It was only the latest in an ever growing stack of information related to the Human species he had aggregated. The small grey figure shook his head, the actions taken to quarantine the system for the time being wouldn't help. He was certain that even the rumors of the system being indefinitely interdicted would eventually amount to nothing.  
They needed a backup plan, in the likely event the humans managed to escape the Guvnuragnaguvendrugun Confederacy's attempted imprisonment. His contacts indicated he had very little time to act. The fleet would be en-route to the Sol system shortly. Granth turned to a communications terminal and entered in his personal encryption code. The reptilian Locayl Captain Hshrif, he called him for high risk specimen acquisition. 

""Granth, how good of you to call. What can I do for you today?"" 
""I need to you pick me up some high priority, high risk specimens. I'll pay you three times the usual rate for these,"" Granth replied, cutting directly to the chase. 

The Locayl ran his clawed finger along his chin. He mulled it over for the moment before saying, ""You don't usually offer that much for specimen retrievals. What gives?"" 

""As I said, it's very high risk. I need you to go into the Sol system and acquire specific Human specimens for me. The system is currently under quarantine so you will have to do it covertly. You only have two standard weeks however according to my contacts. Get in and get out. If you don't you won't be able to escape the star system indefinitely."" 

Hshrif thought about it for the moment, ""I've seen the news about that Jenkins Human. Killed a Hunter raiding party on Outlook on Forever with his bare hands. I also heard that another Hunter raiding party struck their planet. They know we're out here. What makes you think they won't fight back when we try and snag one?"" 

Granth just let out a mirthless smirk as he said, ""Don't worry, it's worse then you think. I need you to find me trained human warriors. Keep them sedated the entire time until you get them here however."" 
Hshrif shook his head, ""You are asking me to risk a lot. I'm not certain that triple the usual rate will cover expenses for this, let alone make it worth it."" 

Granth shook his head, ""Everyone seems to think that just isolating these Humans will be enough. That they won't be able to breach the quarentine without our seeing. By all logic they shouldn't even exist, their planet is a class 12 DeathWorld. But the logic doesn't apply here. we have to be ready just in case. They've already proven they are able to push beyond what the average individual is capable of. And that's an untrained individual. Imagine what a trained warrior could do."" 

Hshrif snarled, ""I am, that's what I'm imagining with this frown."" 

""Then you understand why this is necessary. I'll even agree to pay you triple now, plus 10% for each warrior you bring me,"" Granth said, playing to the pirates greed. 

Triple plus 10% was just too much to pass up for the Locayl, ""Alright, I'll get you what I can. But just so you know I will be out of there before this interdiction starts, with or without your specimens."" 

Granth nodded in agreement and closed the channel. He then went to his terminal and summoned one of his many assistants to his office. The new intern came in as reqested waiting for orders. Granth looked at him and said, ""I want you to start going through the planetary registery of all surveyed planets. I want every planet that is classified Temperate Class 10 or above referenced and the date of survey for each planet. Then I want you to contact our usual acquisition experts and send them out to those worlds to resurvey those worlds and to give us an idea of what is currently there."" 

The nameless intern nodded and went to carry out his orders. Granth turned and looked out his window on the garden world his laboratory was located on. The Corti looked out at the world scowling. The risk was great, the chance for catastrophic failure high. However, someone needed to develop a contingency. It had to be done. "

- From the accounts I've read and heard, getting a PhD is one of the most difficult and challenging experiences one can have academically, and I'm attracted to the challenges/hurdles that it presents

- I don't feel like I know what doing *in depth* research is really like, that is, what it feels like to work on a single project or idea for several years. If not in a PhD program, will someone get the opportunity to really think about a difficult problem deeply, in industry with just a BS?

- Personal development and drive. This is related to the first bullet point, in that getting a PhD is **hard**. My intuition and personal interactions with the PhDs I've known tells me that they can push through the toughest of theoretical and engineering problems. Not sure if this kind of tenacity is the reason said people were able to make it through their PhDs, or if it was developed during, but I suspect it's a reasonable mix of both. 

 About research:
I'm sincerely interested in electrical engineering but I haven't narrowed down my scope to a single area of interest; I honestly find that there's always really cool stuff to learn about in any of the classic areas (i.e., analog, digital &amp; embedded, VLSI, comms, etc). I think my lack of focus might be demonstrated by my research history which is somewhat scattered, e.g., I did some programming for two quarters in a photonics lab to implement some novel algorithms, and now I am helping a grad student with coding simulations for the behavior of nanoelectronic devices. I feel like my research ability is questionable because I haven't really delved into a single topic, but I'm not sure and I haven't met many other undergrads who want to do grad school (most in the EE dept. just want to get a job). I've definitely helped other grad students and post docs with their own research though, mainly in the form of programming.   

That said, I guess my biggest question is whether I'm cut out for a research oriented career or not. If I pursue the typical engineering route (which I have experienced and definitely enjoyed via internships), I'm afraid I might never have the opportunity to find out. I realize that spending several years in a PhD program only to drop out might seem like a huge waste, but my gut tells me I should at least give it a shot; if I fail or burnout, well at least I tried, and learned something valuable about myself... Then again, I can always enjoy learning in my own personal time, with the added comfort of a cushy salary (be able to buy more tools and toys!). And so goes the internal argument.

So that's about all I can manage without rambling more or writing a book. Thanks for reading and I apologize if it's incoherent (it's 2:30 AM). Any thoughts, opinions, or advice are greatly appreciated. Seriously.

At job interviews I always tell them that I'm a passionate programmer, that I have an special talent for programming and really love it, and I knew its my thing since I started when I was 13 years old, which is true but not the whole truth

What I only tell you is that my social life and spare time in general are wayy more important to me than that, as I'd expect to be the case with many. 

Now im working 4hr work days in an internship (also studying, though) and while it would be amazing to work like that after finishing my degree (because that schedule without studying would be like constant holidays), I agree that its not very productive :p. 

In my (unexperienced) opinion, something around 6-7 hours would be ideal in terms of productivity and life-work balance, but I guess Im willing to settle for the standard of 8. If I ever have to work more than that, I will really try to get out of that situation, for example by becoming an high school it teacher or something

According to my school's statistics, finding a job in France would be a piece of cake, but I would like to move abroad and/or find a really interesting job.

So I'm currently wondering whether to search for something in the US or not. What worries me is the cultural differences and the overall quality of life (things like health-care, commute, etc ...). From what I can see on reddit, the US culture is pretty far from what I'm used to and I'm afraid I might not be very happy over there.

What would be the real advantages of moving to the US rather than staying in Europe ?

If I was to move to the US, which area would be the most interesting in terms of both a career in computer science and quality of life ?

Also, not related to the US, but are PhD in computer science useful ? I'm also facing the possibility of carrying on my studies in France towards a PhD, but right now, I don't think a PhD would really be useful in computer science compared to work experience.

tl;dr: Should I stay or Should I go ?

I really want this job and it's my favourite IT field. There were alot of technical questions and I answered almost all of them. The interviewers said it's unusual for a person who's still in university and has almost no experience (I took an internship in that company last year but in the networking team) to have as deep technical knowledge as I have. 

However, my friend works in that team and he said after he asked the interviewers how did I do they said that aside from being suitable in terms of technical stuff it seems like I have no motivation and I might find the work boring since I also like gamedev (I mentioned that when I wasd asked to describe myself). I was invited for a 2nd interview (with different people from that team) for them to get the impression. 

So, how do I show that I'm motivated? In the 1st interview I was asked why do I want to work here, I briefly explained that I'm interested in IT sec, don't really know what to say more. The talked higher than average technical knowledge is the result of my interest in the field since I dedicate my spare time for that and I've literally been interested since my first encounters with the internet.

The company in question does plenty of government contracting, and they require special clearances to work on many of their projects, so I would assume background checks are a very big deal. I have never had criminal charges against me, but I am somewhat curious as to what else, if anything, they might be looking for. I realize you can request a copy of your own background check [here] (http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks), but since I was told the official offer will be coming in 2-3 weeks, I don't think it's worth filling all of that out for me.

Secondly, where could I go to get reinforcement on data structures/basic knowledge on them?

I am presently a third year engineering student at a top 15 engineering school. Tomorrow I will be interviewing for an internship with the same company that I interviewed with last year. As you can imagine, I was turned down last year. 

One tactic that I am considering for this interview is to take both my present resume as well as my past resume to allow the interviewer to compare and contrast who as was with who I am today.

How do you feel about this idea? 

For reference, I am not being interviewed by the same person as last year (I feel that this tactic would have the most impact if this were the case).

Any other ideas you have would be appreciated!

Background:

I am 22, I'll be 23 in November. I graduated from a great school with a BA in what is essentially Pre-law. I had intended on going to law school but after some introspection decided that I was doing it because others had told me I would make a great lawyer, rather than because it was something that actually appealed to me. I decided to get into Comp Sci/Programming as I had taken a class in Python in my last semester and it seemed to be something I would enjoy doing more of. Soon after graduating, I came into some luck when a family friend's relative offered me an internship at the very large IT company he works for, which after the summer turned into a full job. I work 40 hours a week, having never done so before in my life. I have come to understand that this is probably the least amount of hours and effort I'll ever have to put into a job, and I don't mind that. 

What I do mind is how much I am uninterested in my job. I am never given enough work to keep me busy, and when I am it's mostly meaningless stuff to do. On the off-chance that I am given a legitimate project it is in something that doesn't interest me.

I am looking to make a change into something else. I cannot figure out what I like to do. I have a passion for very few things, none of which are academic in any way. My friends are all moving on with their lives in the directions they have been heading in for some time and it pains me to know that instead of putting effort each day into a direction, I'm wasting my time at this job, one that many others would be happy to have, but that I cannot take advantage of because of my disinterest in the subject. 

I am scared to take steps forward because I feel that I will be heading down the wrong path, whichever I take. This makes it difficult for me to stick with anything that seems a bit interesting. I changed majors 4 times in college and ended up with the one I stuck with because it was easiest and I didn't know what else to do.

Having never had a passion before in anything, nor have I had the motivation to search for something, how do I move forward? How do I find what I am interested in so that I can dedicating my time to it? I am a smart kid, but I feel stupid for not having the ability to push myself in any direction. I just get pushed by circumstances and don't take any effort to change things for the better. 

Please help, as I do not know what to do.

TLDR: Willing to apply myself, but don't know what to apply myself to as nothing has ever stuck out to me as interesting. How do I find/develop passion? Thanks in advance. 

P.S. If there is a better way to make this post, please advise. Thanks"

She had been found lying in a ditch, fifty miles out from the perimeter of the hospital, due northwest. The paramedics brought her in, but it was a coin flip whether she would survive or not. As they wheeled her in that night, I was waiting in the office for my shift to end. It had been a long day, but the sweet smell of the weekend enticed me. 

A stream of blond hair flashed by me, and then the rest of the doctors. They closed the doors on the operating room, and that was it. I could hear tidbits like ""Blood loss,"" and ""She's not responding!"". You'd think I'd be shocked, but after working almost ten years here, I'm concerned about how desensitized I am. Sometimes I even count the amount of times it takes to use the defibrillator before they bring someone back.
	
Or before they lose them.

""Hey Kayle!"" An intern ran down the hallway towards my office. In his hands were a pile of papers and a folder. Great. What else would I would be doing on a friday night?

""What is it, Harper?"" I leaned over on the reception desk. ""Is this your restraining order for that bitch you broke up last week?"" He gave me a sour look and then shrugged. 

""It's for the new patient."" He slid it over to me. ""Bring up their info, get their insurance sorted out, you know the deal."" The lights did a little flicker and the surgeons shouted something. Probably ""Get me the scalpel!"" And at that point, the new guy would say ""Which one?!"" Believe me, I'd know. I almost killed someone on my first operation because I dropped the largest scalpel onto the patient. See, it wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't landed in his frontal lobe... And stayed there.

THAT was a long night. And a long day. Explaining how your grandfather got hospitalized for two extra weeks to a couple of kids is really-

""You heard me, Kayle? I said-""
""Yeah, yeah. Loud and clear."" I snatched the pile from him. Later when he was gone, I'd find his or her name, and then just shred it to bits. Who the hell still uses paper to transfer stuff like this? ""Wait a minute."" He raised an eyebrow at me. ""Aren't you supposed to be out tonight? You told me the Lakers were playing at the stadium.""

Harper blushed and scratched his head, which was a clear Harper sign of ""Yeah, I got ditched.""

""Well ya see... There was this thing... And then she kinda... Oh who am i kidding?"" He looked to the side. ""I canceled on her.""

""How come?""

""There's something I want to tell-""

""KAYLE MCGINNAN! IS THERE A KAYLE MCGINNAN? PLEASE ENTER THE ROOM NOW!"" Unexpected. Very. 

""Well that's my cue, Harper."" I got up and out of the small office, and patted his shoulder. ""Whatever you have to tell me, I'm sure it can wait.""

""Yeah.. It can."" He shuffled down the hallway and opened one of the restricted doors. I burst into the operating room and looked around. Several people, all with surgical masks on, and I was the lone idiot standing in the corner with all eyes on me. Even the patient.

Wait what. Even the patient?

""Ms. Mcginnan. The Garrison Center for Medical Treatment is indebted to your people."" The man with the gray hair did a small bow to me. The hell? 

""4-N-7-7-7-7-H-I-K!"" The woman in the bed spurted it out like an sos message. 

The gray haired man nodded over to the woman and the two paramedics flipped a switch. Probably more IV. I took another look at the woman. Her skin was pale, but clean. Nothing was bleeding. But her mouth kept repeating the same characters over and over again. 4-N-7-7-7-7-H-I-K.

""How can I be of service, Doctor?"" I had never seen the guy before. 

""We'd just like you to bring up some information on-""

""I have it in my office, sir."" Typical procedure. 

The gray-haired doctor gave me a sour look, but nodded in satisfaction. ""Bring it here, and be swift, please. It's been a long night."" Two paramedics with brown hair hit a switch and the bed slowly angled to sitting position. ""Thank you.""

""No problem...""

""Dr. Kusthanis.""

""Yeah. Dr. Cast-An-Us."" I backed out of the room, shut the door, and dashed to my office. I did a quick search on the staff list for a Dr. Kusthanis. The K's were filled with a lot of people; Kells, Keans, Khan... But no Kusthanis. 
So then who was that in there?
And who were those people with him?
Before I could go call security, I heard something else from the room.
""Where did you learn this code, Ms. Helena?"" So he knew her name. 

""It was the password.""

""To what, Ms. Helena?""

""The nuke.""

Bradley's eyes would trickle back and forth through his thick glasses, smiling when his eyes grazed over his assets as if they inspired a flood of memories. He licked his cracked lips, looking up as if he were about to speak only to see Erica give a halfhearted, impatient smirk while looking forward at his will, waiting for him to sign it. Bradley's smile disappeared into the folds of his wrinkles, focusing back on the paper as he continued to read carefully. It wasn't long before another one crept onto his wrinkled, spotted chin.
    ""I was born in that house..."" said Bradley in a phlegmy voice, he cleared his throat with a quick grunt. ""So many memories...I'm sorry, this is just a little 'overwhelming'--"" he said a bit clearer, his voice still shook though as one would expect of someone his age.
    ""--Take your time."" said Erica softly even though she was lying.
    Erica watched as Bradley picked up his pen. ""Ben?"" she called out.
    A well dressed man stepped through the door, brief case in hand as he impatiently walked in.    ""We ready to do this Bradley?""  said Ben as his phone began to rumble in his pocket, he glanced at it quickly, leaving it alone to rumble in his pocket.
    ""Don't you have to swear them in--"" asked Bradley.        ""--Already did that."" snapped Ben.
    ""We did?"" Bradley starred at the dotted line at the bottom, rotating his wrist while the pen sat in between his frail spotted hands. Everyone watched, waiting for him to finish but Bradley just sat there, wondering how long he had actually been in the room, wondering how many times he had read the document to himself. His heart sank a bit, he couldn't remember anything at all as the feeling of embarrassment washed over him. Forcing down the lump in his throat he dropped his hand, The pen finally landed and Bradley signed the paper as if it were the last thing he would ever sign. His signature looked worthy of such claim as Bradley smiled at his own penmanship.
    Ben quickly snatched the  paper and slid it towards himself. He clicked his pen and signed, sliding out of the way to make room for Erica's interns to sign. Once they did Ben stamped the file and clapped his hands together.
    ""Alright, Bradley you have a nice night."" said Ben with a quick smirk as he prepared to leave.
    ""Night?"" muttered Bradley as he looked  to his wristwatch.It was 8:05 p.m. ""It's 8:00?-""
    ""--It's 9:00."" said Ben as he lingered around the doorway, the interns squeezed by him as they made their way out the office. Erica pulled the blinds open to look out, Bradley peeked out as well to see that it was true. He looked down at Ben's stamp to see that it was May 9th.
    ""Who's picking you up?"" asked Erica. Ben had been lingering hoping to see a car pull up out their office.
    ""I was going to take the bus...but-""
    ""-They stop running after 6:00 p.m."" snapped Ben. Erica looked over at Ben, their eyes met and he knew that he would have to drive Bradley home. He simply waited for the words to leave Erica's mouth so 
that he could contest it.
    ""Excuse me but could I trouble you for a ride?"" asked Bradley. Ben turned to see that Bradley was speaking to him. Ben's eyes shot back to Erica who simply cocked her head, waiting for a response. ""I think we shop at the same Grocer, at least I think that was you."" Bradley thought to himself if Ben was the man he saw so regularly, as he turned his watch forward an hour. Ben looked to the ground, exhaling. It was him, he even went out as far as to help him load his bags into his car a few days ago. He wanted to lie, he was going to lie but as he picked his eyes back up he could see the look on Bradley's face as if he had almost realized that it was in fact him.
    ""We do."" said Bradley and Ben simultaneously. Ben looked over to Erica who had already began to gather her things with a smile as she stood up from her desk, filing away Bradley's will.
    ""Alright, let's go."" said Ben with a halfhearted smirk, he waved his hand to the doorway as  Bradley raised from his chair.
    ""You remember where you live right?"" said Ben in a prodding tone as Bradley walked through the doorway. Bradley  turned almost coming to a stop giving a wink.
    ""Ha! yes, I remember that.""
    Ben gave a smirk as he looked over at Erica. ""See you in the morning."" he said.
    The drive was quiet mostly. Bradley was too embarrassed to initiate any form of conversation and Ben hadn't noticed the silence, he was just focused on getting Bradley home so that he could do the same. The silence  grew uncomfortable  after awhile as he looked  over at Bradley.
    ""I just bought my daughter a cat...I uh, I like dogs but my girl kept asking for a cat."" said Ben.
    ""That's nice."" replied Bradley.
    Ben focused on the road occasionally looking over to Bradley who looked to be genuinely enjoying the small talk. ""We're trying to train it-him, now but uh... it's smelly, ya know?.""
    ""Smelly? This is very interesting Ben, please go on."" chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he turned the corner.
    ""I was just wondering what brand do you use?""
    ""Me?"" said Bradley quickly and curiously.
    ""Yeah, I remember seeing a bag of cat litter the other day when I helped you --""
    ""--Oh that was you?""
    ""Yeah--""
    ""See I knew, I knew you. I never forget a face, I do forget everything else though."" said Bradley in a joking tone. Ben  laughed out loud as he stopped at a light. ""I never thought I would actually lose my mind; ya know? I never really thought I would be this old."" Bradley turned to Ben as he continued. ""I mean, I knew I would get old, but no one ever really thinks it you know?""
    '""Do you have any regrets?"" said Ben; he immediately realized that this question might be inappropriate, that it might make the rest of the car ride a complete uncomfortable silence but, to his surprise Bradley answered, unbothered.
    ""Yes. A girl."" said Bradley as the light turned green. Ben continued down the road and looked over to 
Bradley to see him staring  out into the distant night. Ben was curious and wanted to hear more, he was glad he didn't have to ask. ""I loved her, she was my first and only. Most people want wealth, or success; I guess it's the same thing fame, some men want fame...I just wanted her. She had a dimpled chin and red hair that framed her perfect green eyes...I remember our first kiss, it was cold but I still loved it. She would just lay there and I would run my fingers through her hair for hours with her head in my lap.""
    ""Sounds nice.""
    ""It was.""
    ""What happened?""
    ""Time.""
    ""Time?""        ""Time, we simply just...had our time. It ran it's course. I mean, I was happy for the time we had but there just wasn't enough... it never would have been enough....""
    Ben turned to see Bradley looking out the side window, staring at his own reflection, into his own eyes. Ben glanced at the road for a moment and when his eyes turned to Bradley's reflection again he could see Bradley looking back at Ben through his own reflection. A smile grew on his face as he turned to Ben.
    ""Did you ever try to reconnect, like get back in touch with her?""
    ""No.""        ""Why?""
Bradley sighed a little. ""Because she's dead."" he said with regret.
    ""I'm, I'm so sorry--""
    ""--Like I said time."" said Bradley as he looked at his wrinkled frail hands, they were spotted and the veins were dark and thick. ""It's never enough time, It would have never been enough time....I never thought I would be this old, I mean, I knew but I never really actually believed it..."" Ben watched as Bradley looked at his watch and at the time on Ben's car radio,. A confused look grew on his face as he looked back at his watch and reached to set it to the correct time.
    ""Uh, no you're right...I forgot to set it back an hour, I actually keep forgetting."" said Ben.
    ""Ah, I was confused for a moment there. Thought I was forgetting the goddamn time for a moment."" Chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he drove through the neighborhood slowly, the houses were large and farm from each other and all looked like variants of the same home.
    ""Any of these look familiar?""
    ""That's me on the right.""
    ""Wow."" said Ben as he looked at the large three story house. It was different from the others as it had a very traditional theme to its construction. White paint, blue shutters, red door and the moon reflected  off the lake right behind his house. Ben  turned the car to pull into the drive way which was about twenty and some yards away from the home.
    ""No, you're fine."" said Bradley as he tapped Ben's hand which was resting on the steering wheel.
    ""Are you sure? I can pull in closer, it's no problem--""
    ""No, no I want to walk the rest of the way.""
    ""Are you sure?""        ""Yes. It looks beautiful tonight, I don't know when I'll see it from this angle or light again. I'd just like to take it all in one more time.""
    ""It definitely a beautiful home.""
    ""Yes it is. You know I was born here? Right in that basement."" said Bradley as he unfastened his seat belt and pointing out the window.
    Ben smiled. ""No, no I didn't.""  Bradley opened the door and stepped out slowly, turning around and waving.
    ""You have a good life Ben."" said Bradley. A lump grew in Ben's throat for some reason when he heard Bradley say that.
    ""You too."" said Ben as Bradley closed the door. Ben took his car out of park and  looked ready to drive away but stopped and rolled the window down. ""Bradley,  I forgot, what brand you use? For uh, your cats.""
    Bradley looked confused. ""I don't have cats. I sure hope I don't because I don't remember buying any cat food."" chuckled Bradley        Ben  chuckled as he raised his eyebrows together in slight confusion. He thought about the day he helped put the bag in his trunk, thinking that he might have been mistaken but suddenly remembered distinctly seeing several cats on the bag. ""What's with the kitty litter then?"" he asked.
    ""I do a lot of work in my basement, Cat litter is great for soaking up spills. In fact, I could definitely recommend  'Kitty Secret'.""
    ""Yeah?""
    ""Been in business since I was your age, gotta be doing something right, right?.""
    ""Yeah, I guess so.""
    They both lingered there for a moment, a comfortable silence as Ben looked over Bradley's shoulder to his home in the moonlight. A picturesque moment . ""A wonderful home Bradley, it looks like you've had a wonderful life.""
    ""I did, didn't I?"" he said with a smile. Bradley turned around and began walking. ""I'm off to relive my glory days, goodnight Ben.""
    ""Good night Bradley."" Ben watched him for a moment after he rolled his window down, taking in the sight. He hoped to see him in the grocery store next week as he drove off.
    Bradley walked , the freshly cut grass crunching beneath his feet. The closer he got the wider his smile grew. Closer and closer, wider and wider and he could begin to hear her voice but couldn't make out what she was saying. When he reached the porch he could hear her voice clearly, he wondered why she would scream so loudly; no one would hear her. He looked down to see the paper on his porch, he picked it up with a grin.
    ""Help..."" he could hear her yell faintly as he walked to his door. She must have been screaming for 
hours because her  voice sounded desperate, as if she had been crying all day. When he opened the door he could hear her grow quiet for a moment. The silence made Bradley grin as he closed the door behind him. The sound of the door closing behind him made her sob, she tried to yell through her tears but it was broken and unintelligible. It was just like his first time.
    Bradley made his way to the basement, the house was acoustically sound and you could hear every foot step made in every room. The woman sounded panicked and he could hear her struggle and cry. When he opened the door to the basement  the light filled in what it could, illuminating half of her face as she laid on her side. Her eyes were swollen with tears as she looked up at Bradley who had closed the door behind him, covering them in darkness. She rolled around making small crunching noises as Bradley stepped down the stairs slowly. She could hear every step, one by one as his loafers clacked against the wood.
    She tried to hide, she tried to muffle her breath. 'In the Dark?' she thought 'Is this his game?' She could hear his loafers crushing the cat litter on the ground as he opened a drawer. She could hear him rummaging through it, closing it and opening another. He did the same to another drawer until he laid something heavy on top of it, making a deep thud as he closed it. She could hear the sound of a knife being unsheathed, it was unmistakable. Bradley had done this every night just to get a reaction out of her just like he had done so many years ago.
    She was silent, Bradley couldn't even hear her breathe. It was so dark you couldn't even make out shapes yet she closed her eyes tightly. She wasn't there anymore. She would have been invisible if the lights hadn't come on. She could feel the slight warmth coming off of the bulbs and the light coming through her eyelids, yet she never opened her eyes. She could feel her body shaking as Bradley spoke.
    ""You look just like her."" he said in a soft voice. ""Red hair framing those green eyes, open them for me..."" 
She didn't think it was possible to close her eyes tighter but she did. 
    ""No?"" he said. ""I still know they're  there...even your chin. Wow, you look exactly like her, and you're exactly where she was...and I'm exactly were I was..."" Bradley was quiet for a moment, he just starred at her. ""My god even the dress looks exactly the same."" He  took her in, every feature, she was beautiful even with the gag, even with the grains of cat litter on her cheek, even with her legs and arms bound to each other. ""I love you so much Christina. I don't have enough time, but neither will you.""
 She sobbed through her gag as the tears forced their way out of her tightly pressed eyelids.
    ""I'm going to  hold your head just like before Christina, I'm going to look into your eyes just like before."" 
She cried a bit more as the tears rolled down her cheeks.
    We'll lie together just like before...I don't have enough time, but it will be more than enough. I'll be gone before your beauty fades.""
    She could hear him getting closer, the cat litter crunching beneath his feet. She cried louder, sobbing ""No."" hopelessly. She could feel his presence right in front of her and something inside of her made her eyes open. She looked up at him and his large knife, her tears blurred her vision a bit and her eyes fluttered  to push away the tears. It was in this moment that Bradley paused, she looked exactly like her, his heart swooned at the fluttering lashes as he plunged his knife into her belly.
    She looked into his eyes as he looked into hers, both were wide. Bradley could feel the warm blood running down his blade and trickling against his fingers.  They both closed their eyes at the same time as Bradley  twisted the knife, just like he did before but unlike before she was quiet. He twisted the blade more and deeper but still, nothing. He opened his eyes and looked down as the blood dripped onto his loafers. The pain came all at once as Bradley looked down to the knife in his gut, he fell on his side and 
looked around the room for her, and saw no one. Bradley reached for the knife but it was tender and  he flinched when he touched the handle.
    The lights turned off and the door to the basement opened. Bradley rolled over to see her standing at the top of the steps, the light pouring down through the doorway illuminating half of Bradley's face. Her makeup was fresh, her skin glowed and her dress was clean and pressed.She took a step down with wide pale eyes as she looked down at Bradley, full of fear and regret as the door closed behind her, consuming Bradley in darkness.

2hqzm8,1,2014-09-28,Without Regret,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2hqzm8/without_regret/,"    The room was cold and quiet, Erica and her interns patiently waited as Bradley read through his estate. Bradley's eyes would trickle back and forth through his thick glasses, smiling when his eyes grazed over his assets as if they inspired a flood of memories. He licked his cracked lips, looking up as if he were about to speak only to see Erica give a halfhearted, impatient smirk while looking forward at his will, waiting for him to sign it. Bradley's smile disappeared into the folds of his wrinkles, focusing back on the paper as he continued to read carefully. It wasn't long before another one crept onto his wrinkled, spotted chin.
    ""I was born in that house..."" said Bradley in a phlegmy voice, he cleared his throat with a quick grunt. ""So many memories...I'm sorry, this is just a little 'overwhelming'--"" he said a bit clearer, his voice still shook though as one would expect of someone his age.
    ""--Take your time."" said Erica softly even though she was lying.
    Erica watched as Bradley picked up his pen. ""Ben?"" she called out.
    A well dressed man stepped through the door, brief case in hand as he impatiently walked in.    ""We ready to do this Bradley?""  said Ben as his phone began to rumble in his pocket, he glanced at it quickly, leaving it alone to rumble in his pocket.
    ""Don't you have to swear them in--"" asked Bradley.        ""--Already did that."" snapped Ben.
    ""We did?"" Bradley starred at the dotted line at the bottom, rotating his wrist while the pen sat in between his frail spotted hands. Everyone watched, waiting for him to finish but Bradley just sat there, wondering how long he had actually been in the room, wondering how many times he had read the document to himself. His heart sank a bit, he couldn't remember anything at all as the feeling of embarrassment washed over him. Forcing down the lump in his throat he dropped his hand, The pen finally landed and Bradley signed the paper as if it were the last thing he would ever sign. His signature looked worthy of such claim as Bradley smiled at his own penmanship.
    Ben quickly snatched the  paper and slid it towards himself. He clicked his pen and signed, sliding out of the way to make room for Erica's interns to sign. Once they did Ben stamped the file and clapped his hands together.
    ""Alright, Bradley you have a nice night."" said Ben with a quick smirk as he prepared to leave.
    ""Night?"" muttered Bradley as he looked  to his wristwatch.It was 8:05 p.m. ""It's 8:00?-""
    ""--It's 9:00."" said Ben as he lingered around the doorway, the interns squeezed by him as they made their way out the office. Erica pulled the blinds open to look out, Bradley peeked out as well to see that it was true. He looked down at Ben's stamp to see that it was May 9th.
    ""Who's picking you up?"" asked Erica. Ben had been lingering hoping to see a car pull up out their office.
    ""I was going to take the bus...but-""
    ""-They stop running after 6:00 p.m."" snapped Ben. Erica looked over at Ben, their eyes met and he knew that he would have to drive Bradley home. He simply waited for the words to leave Erica's mouth so 
that he could contest it.
    ""Excuse me but could I trouble you for a ride?"" asked Bradley. Ben turned to see that Bradley was speaking to him. Ben's eyes shot back to Erica who simply cocked her head, waiting for a response. ""I think we shop at the same Grocer, at least I think that was you."" Bradley thought to himself if Ben was the man he saw so regularly, as he turned his watch forward an hour. Ben looked to the ground, exhaling. It was him, he even went out as far as to help him load his bags into his car a few days ago. He wanted to lie, he was going to lie but as he picked his eyes back up he could see the look on Bradley's face as if he had almost realized that it was in fact him.
    ""We do."" said Bradley and Ben simultaneously. Ben looked over to Erica who had already began to gather her things with a smile as she stood up from her desk, filing away Bradley's will.
    ""Alright, let's go."" said Ben with a halfhearted smirk, he waved his hand to the doorway as  Bradley raised from his chair.
    ""You remember where you live right?"" said Ben in a prodding tone as Bradley walked through the doorway. Bradley  turned almost coming to a stop giving a wink.
    ""Ha! yes, I remember that.""
    Ben gave a smirk as he looked over at Erica. ""See you in the morning."" he said.
    The drive was quiet mostly. Bradley was too embarrassed to initiate any form of conversation and Ben hadn't noticed the silence, he was just focused on getting Bradley home so that he could do the same. The silence  grew uncomfortable  after awhile as he looked  over at Bradley.
    ""I just bought my daughter a cat...I uh, I like dogs but my girl kept asking for a cat."" said Ben.
    ""That's nice."" replied Bradley.
    Ben focused on the road occasionally looking over to Bradley who looked to be genuinely enjoying the small talk. ""We're trying to train it-him, now but uh... it's smelly, ya know?.""
    ""Smelly? This is very interesting Ben, please go on."" chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he turned the corner.
    ""I was just wondering what brand do you use?""
    ""Me?"" said Bradley quickly and curiously.
    ""Yeah, I remember seeing a bag of cat litter the other day when I helped you --""
    ""--Oh that was you?""
    ""Yeah--""
    ""See I knew, I knew you. I never forget a face, I do forget everything else though."" said Bradley in a joking tone. Ben  laughed out loud as he stopped at a light. ""I never thought I would actually lose my mind; ya know? I never really thought I would be this old."" Bradley turned to Ben as he continued. ""I mean, I knew I would get old, but no one ever really thinks it you know?""
    '""Do you have any regrets?"" said Ben; he immediately realized that this question might be inappropriate, that it might make the rest of the car ride a complete uncomfortable silence but, to his surprise Bradley answered, unbothered.
    ""Yes. A girl."" said Bradley as the light turned green. Ben continued down the road and looked over to 
Bradley to see him staring  out into the distant night. Ben was curious and wanted to hear more, he was glad he didn't have to ask. ""I loved her, she was my first and only. Most people want wealth, or success; I guess it's the same thing fame, some men want fame...I just wanted her. She had a dimpled chin and red hair that framed her perfect green eyes...I remember our first kiss, it was cold but I still loved it. She would just lay there and I would run my fingers through her hair for hours with her head in my lap.""
    ""Sounds nice.""
    ""It was.""
    ""What happened?""
    ""Time.""
    ""Time?""        ""Time, we simply just...had our time. It ran it's course. I mean, I was happy for the time we had but there just wasn't enough... it never would have been enough....""
    Ben turned to see Bradley looking out the side window, staring at his own reflection, into his own eyes. Ben glanced at the road for a moment and when his eyes turned to Bradley's reflection again he could see Bradley looking back at Ben through his own reflection. A smile grew on his face as he turned to Ben.
    ""Did you ever try to reconnect, like get back in touch with her?""
    ""No.""        ""Why?""
Bradley sighed a little. ""Because she's dead."" he said with regret.
    ""I'm, I'm so sorry--""
    ""--Like I said time."" said Bradley as he looked at his wrinkled frail hands, they were spotted and the veins were dark and thick. ""It's never enough time, It would have never been enough time....I never thought I would be this old, I mean, I knew but I never really actually believed it..."" Ben watched as Bradley looked at his watch and at the time on Ben's car radio,. A confused look grew on his face as he looked back at his watch and reached to set it to the correct time.
    ""Uh, no you're right...I forgot to set it back an hour, I actually keep forgetting."" said Ben.
    ""Ah, I was confused for a moment there. Thought I was forgetting the goddamn time for a moment."" Chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he drove through the neighborhood slowly, the houses were large and farm from each other and all looked like variants of the same home.
    ""Any of these look familiar?""
    ""That's me on the right.""
    ""Wow."" said Ben as he looked at the large three story house. It was different from the others as it had a very traditional theme to its construction. White paint, blue shutters, red door and the moon reflected  off the lake right behind his house. Ben  turned the car to pull into the drive way which was about twenty and some yards away from the home.
    ""No, you're fine."" said Bradley as he tapped Ben's hand which was resting on the steering wheel.
    ""Are you sure? I can pull in closer, it's no problem--""
    ""No, no I want to walk the rest of the way.""
    ""Are you sure?""        ""Yes. It looks beautiful tonight, I don't know when I'll see it from this angle or light again. I'd just like to take it all in one more time.""
    ""It definitely a beautiful home.""

Ben glanced at the road for a moment and when his eyes turned to Bradley's reflection again he could see Bradley looking back at Ben through his own reflection. A smile grew on his face as he turned to Ben.

""Did you ever try to reconnect, like get back in touch with her?""

""No.""
    
""Why?""

Bradley sighed a little. ""Because she's dead."" he said with regret.

""I'm, I'm so sorry--""

""--Like I said time."" said Bradley as he looked at his wrinkled frail hands, they were spotted and the veins were dark and thick. ""It's never enough time, It would have never been enough time....I never thought I would be this old, I mean, I knew but I never really actually believed it..."" Ben watched as Bradley looked at his watch and at the time on Ben's car radio,. A confused look grew on his face as he looked back at his watch and reached to set it to the correct time.

""Uh, no you're right...I forgot to set it back an hour, I actually keep forgetting."" said Ben.

""Ah, I was confused for a moment there. Thought I was forgetting the goddamn time for a moment."" Chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he drove through the neighborhood slowly, the houses were large and farm from each other and all looked like variants of the same home.

""Any of these look familiar?""

""That's me on the right.""

""Wow."" said Ben as he looked at the large three story house. It was different from the others as it had a very traditional theme to its construction. White paint, blue shutters, red door and the moon reflected  off the lake right behind his house. Ben  turned the car to pull into the drive way which was about twenty and some yards away from the home.

""No, you're fine."" said Bradley as he tapped Ben's hand which was resting on the steering wheel.

""Are you sure? I can pull in closer, it's no problem--""

""No, no I want to walk the rest of the way.""

""Are you sure?""
    
""Yes. It looks beautiful tonight, I don't know when I'll see it from this angle or light again. I'd just like to take it all in one more time.""

""It definitely a beautiful home.""

""Yes it is. You know I was born here? Right in that basement."" said Bradley as he unfastened his seat belt and pointing out the window.

Ben smiled. ""No, no I didn't.""  Bradley opened the door and stepped out slowly, turning around and waving.

""You have a good life Ben."" said Bradley. A lump grew in Ben's throat for some reason when he heard Bradley say that.

""You too."" said Ben as Bradley closed the door. Ben took his car out of park and  looked ready to drive away but stopped and rolled the window down. ""Bradley,  I forgot, what brand you use? For uh, your cats.""

Bradley looked confused. ""I don't have cats. I sure hope I don't because I don't remember buying any cat food."" chuckled Bradley
    
Ben  chuckled as he raised his eyebrows together in slight confusion. He thought about the day he helped put the bag in his trunk, thinking that he might have been mistaken but suddenly remembered distinctly seeing several cats on the bag. ""What's with the kitty litter then?"" he asked.

""I do a lot of work in my basement, Cat litter is great for soaking up spills. In fact, I could definitely recommend  'Kitty Secret'.""

""Yeah?""

""Been in business since I was your age, gotta be doing something right, right?.""

""Yeah, I guess so.""

They both lingered there for a moment, a comfortable silence as Ben looked over Bradley's shoulder to his home in the moonlight. A picturesque moment . ""A wonderful home Bradley, it looks like you've had a wonderful life.""

""I did, didn't I?"" he said with a smile. Bradley turned around and began walking. ""I'm off to relive my glory days, goodnight Ben.""

""Good night Bradley."" Ben watched him for a moment after he rolled his window down, taking in the sight. He hoped to see him in the grocery store next week as he drove off.

Bradley walked , the freshly cut grass crunching beneath his feet. The closer he got the wider his smile grew. Closer and closer, wider and wider and he could begin to hear her voice but couldn't make out what she was saying. When he reached the porch he could hear her voice clearly, he wondered why she would scream so loudly; no one would hear her. He looked down to see the paper on his porch, he picked it up with a grin.

""Help..."" he could hear her yell faintly as he walked to his door. She must have been screaming for hours because her  voice sounded desperate, as if she had been crying all day. When he opened the door he could hear her grow quiet for a moment. The silence made Bradley grin as he closed the door behind him. The sound of the door closing behind him made her sob, she tried to yell through her tears but it was broken and unintelligible. It was just like his first time.

Bradley made his way to the basement, the house was acoustically sound and you could hear every foot step made in every room. The woman sounded panicked and he could hear her struggle and cry. When he opened the door to the basement  the light filled in what it could, illuminating half of her face as she laid on her side. Her eyes were swollen with tears as she looked up at Bradley who had closed the door behind him, covering them in darkness. She rolled around making small crunching noises as Bradley stepped down the stairs slowly. She could hear every step, one by one as his loafers clacked against the wood.

She tried to hide, she tried to muffle her breath. 'In the Dark?' she thought 'Is this his game?' She could hear his loafers crushing the cat litter on the ground as he opened a drawer. She could hear him rummaging through it, closing it and opening another. He did the same to another drawer until he laid something heavy on top of it, making a deep thud as he closed it. She could hear the sound of a knife being unsheathed, it was unmistakable. Bradley had done this every night just to get a reaction out of her just like he had done so many years ago.

She was silent, Bradley couldn't even hear her breathe. It was so dark you couldn't even make out shapes yet she closed her eyes tightly. She wasn't there anymore. She would have been invisible if the lights hadn't come on. She could feel the slight warmth coming off of the bulbs and the light coming through her eyelids, yet she never opened her eyes. She could feel her body shaking as Bradley spoke.

""You look just like her."" he said in a soft voice. ""Red hair framing those green eyes, open them for me..."" 

She didn't think it was possible to close her eyes tighter but she did. 

""No?"" he said. ""I still know they're  there...even your chin. Wow, you look exactly like her, and you're exactly where she was...and I'm exactly were I was..."" Bradley was quiet for a moment, he just starred at her. ""My god even the dress looks exactly the same."" He  took her in, every feature, she was beautiful even with the gag, even with the grains of cat litter on her cheek, even with her legs and arms bound to each other. ""I love you so much Christina. I don't have enough time, but neither will you.""

 She sobbed through her gag as the tears forced their way out of her tightly pressed eyelids.

""I'm going to  hold your head just like before Christina, I'm going to look into your eyes just like before."" 

She cried a bit more as the tears rolled down her cheeks.

We'll lie together just like before...I don't have enough time, but it will be more than enough. I'll be gone before your beauty fades.""

She could hear him getting closer, the cat litter crunching beneath his feet. She cried louder, sobbing ""No."" hopelessly. She could feel his presence right in front of her and something inside of her made her eyes open. She looked up at him and his large knife, her tears blurred her vision a bit and her eyes fluttered  to push away the tears. It was in this moment that Bradley paused, she looked exactly like her, his heart swooned at the fluttering lashes as he plunged his knife into her belly.

She looked into his eyes as he looked into hers, both were wide. Bradley could feel the warm blood running down his blade and trickling against his fingers.  They both closed their eyes at the same time as Bradley  twisted the knife, just like he did before but unlike before she was quiet. He twisted the blade more and deeper but still, nothing. He opened his eyes and looked down as the blood dripped onto his loafers. The pain came all at once as Bradley looked down to the knife in his gut, he fell on his side and looked around the room for her, and saw no one. Bradley reached for the knife but it was tender and  he flinched when he touched the handle.

The lights turned off and the door to the basement opened. Bradley rolled over to see her standing at the top of the steps, the light pouring down through the doorway illuminating half of Bradley's face. Her makeup was fresh, her skin glowed and her dress was clean and pressed.She took a step down with wide pale eyes as she looked down at Bradley, full of fear and regret as the door closed behind her, consuming Bradley in darkness.

2hrdbe,1,2014-09-29,Need career advice in IT,Wrestler04,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2hrdbe/need_career_advice_in_it/,"Hey guys,

I need some advice before I graduate. So I will be graduating in December 2015 from a decent local University with a degree in Information Systems.

So my main goal is to land a job as a network admin or some kind of networking job since I'm focusing on taking classes in that field. The thing is I don't have a great overall GPA because my first two years I was a Computer engineering major and I failed some classes.

I feel that with my low GPA and my limited experience I don't think I could get a network admin job right away without first gaining IT experience. I plan on starting with a help desk job right from graduation. What are some good certs to get to help improve my chances for getting a help desk job right away? I do want to get Cisco Certified but I heard those tests are pretty difficult and I don't think I'd be able to find time to study for that while in school. I'm hoping to get some internships before then so that should help with landing a job right after graduation.

Do you guys think I should just apply for network admin jobs anyways? Do any recent college grads get entry level jobs in networking?

Thanks reddit!


Edit: What do you guys think about the HDI-CSR certification? I'm not sure if it'll be worth it since I'm not even pursuing a longtime career in Help Desk support. Do you guys think I'll be able to land a help desk job with just a bachelors, an a+ and only limited it work experience?

2hswt0,0,2014-09-29,I want to stay local to intern this summer but have historically found it difficult. What to do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hswt0/i_want_to_stay_local_to_intern_this_summer_but/,"I'm finding it's not all that hard to get a summer internship, especially if you're willing to relocate for the summer (I've had two previously).

However, I've been trying to apply for local stuff in order to be able to perhaps take a summer class toward my degree at the same time and remain closer to family, but the replies I'm getting are either ""apply again in December or January"" (in the case of a couple of local startups) or ""would you like to work in Mountain View? Everyone loves Mountain View! asjhdjhsdhfgfgfgh COME TO CALIFORNIA!"" (in the case of both Palantir and a startup with local as well as CA offices).

I'm a grad student, as a rule we're ""batteries included, adult supervision optional"". I have some work and internship experience (totalled up, about two years' worth), am willing to work very hard, and have some decent skills in CS and open-source contributions. Do all interns have to be on teh main campus (and thereby under more direct supervision, probably) for larger companies that have low-level CS departments such as Intel, Xilinx, Google, et al? 

I'm not particularly interested in web development or front-end stuff (I'm more interested in the back end and the lower level heavy lifting for some reason-- maybe masochistic tendencies?), but have a fairly good knowledge of it due to currently having a co-op in a very hands-on, all levels infosec department. Trouble is, I know I don't want to work full-time for the company I'm co-oping at because it would require me to move to the *real* boondocks (even more backwater than where I live now), a proposition which isn't terribly enticing. Ergo the search for a different internship for summer.

My questions are these:

1. Does ""apply again in December or January"" really mean apply again because the company is looking then and will consider you, or ""fuck off, we want someone else""?

2. How does one acquire an internship at the larger ""satellite offices"" instead of the main house in CA of more well-known tech companies?

EDIT if this has been asked before, sorry. I tried looking for relevant keywords and came up with the reverse information-- how to get to CA when you're local to somewhere else."

2htc1j,2,2014-09-29,Getting Screwed at Work?,ScrewedJobs,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2htc1j/getting_screwed_at_work/,"Hey, guys, throw away account, and wall of text warning.

I recently moved to Music City because of a job offer from my old boss. A few facts about my old boss:

We met because he heard some of my tracks and wanted to produce them. He charged me 4k for two songs, and both me and my mother remember him mentioning a video, which we were under the impression was included in the price. Well, we recorded the songs, and in the end they were not the way that I wanted them. He refused to have them remixed unless I wanted to pay the mixer more. I also found out that 4k for two tracks is a huge overpayment. When it came time to discuss a video he gave us a quote for more payment, so we broke it off.

A year later I was interning for him. Now, I never signed a single piece of paper either stating I was an intern or stating that I waved my creative rights. During this internship, I wrote him a treatment for a music video that he used for an artist. The music video is up on Youtube with 25k views, and I know he got paid to produce it. I don't have as much as a credit (I have asked him for a credit, and he said he would get on it, but so far I haven't heard another thing about it). I most certainly didn't get paid for it. The same thing also happened with a documentary treatment that I wrote him.

Now, he called me up offering me a job, and he told me the payment situation would be a bit complicated, but I was unemployed and took him up on his offer.

I have been working for a large broadcaster with a station in Nashville, and I have worked over 200 hours and have yet to see a dime for that. I am, however, going to be paid by a record company for sound engineering and mixing a live set that the record company brought in. I'm getting paid about 2k for the three hours as Lead Sound Engineer and the ten hours of mixing, which is pretty standard ""on the card"" rates.

Now, my boss told me getting paid was going to take some time, as it takes time to get someone in the system. So far I have logged in over 200 hours working for him. A lot of this work varies--I've done a lot of skilled labor for him including lead audio engineering, assistant audio engineering, mixing, assistant directory of photography, lead director of photography, got coffee, chauffeured for him and his higher-ups. Basically anything they need me to do, I do it, and, as a rule I do it pretty damn well. If I can't do something well, I'm very up front about it. We have also been working with A-list country stars and their labels (can't name any names for legal reasons), but people who have songs on the radio right now.

He told me that the company would be bringing me on hired part-time--29 hours a week--and I would be getting paid $10/hr. As of now, I'm still working over 29 hours a week, because I'm not in the system yet, and I'm upset about the rate, but I haven't gotten paid yet anyway. This seems ridiculous to me. I know that I'm 22 years old, but anyone else doing these jobs would be getting paid a lot more (I actually think there are required union day-rates, but I'm still looking into this). As of this point though, I have not been paid by him or by the company for my work for the company at all. However, he HAS paid me for mixing some of his personal projects--about $14/hour. I know the he is getting a LOT more money than he is paying me. 

Now, when I brought up getting back pay for my work thus far, he told me that the check from the record company is what will cover my work so far. This seems illegal to me. Essentially, I did a service for a record company, who EXCLUDED him from the pay and paid me as a contractor for ten hours of service, and now he's telling me that the payment from the record company is supposed to cover my 200+ hours of work so that he or the company he works for doesn't need to pay me. I don't even have any idea if the company he works for even knows that I've been doing all this work. He always ""handles"" things for me--negotiating, etc., and I haven't signed anything with the company yet. I don't even know if the checks I get will come from the company or from him personally--I know this is very important. I'm worried that he is charging people ""on the card"" (at union rates) and then paying me ""off the card"" (whatever the fuck he wants). I don't KNOW if that's true though. He also keeps telling me to hang in there and it will be worth it come January.

I haven't been able to afford an apartment (I'm renting a couch in a garage), decent food, car repairs, and I've had almost zero time for my own personal projects, let alone finding a job that will let me keep this insane time schedule.

I KNOW that I am setting myself up to be screwed here. I'm hoping that come January it will be worth it and I may get a full-time gig at the company, which would be nice pay. Legally is there anything I should do? Am I being screwed over legally or have I just been an idiot.

The ONLY thing I have in writing is a non-disclosure and a non-competition form that he made me sign (which is why I'm keeping the details to myself).

I've taken data structures classes, algorithm classes, discrete math, intro to programming, some systems classes.  So I know about that stuff.  I've been applying to internships and I was asked a question that I am not sure how to respond to:

&gt; If you were to create a global, internet based, marketplace, what 
&gt; technology stack would you use and why? 

Now, I think this question is a little bit more broad than my education has been so I am not sure how to answer it.  Are there good sources for learning about the basics of technology stacks, and which ones are used for what purposes, which ones are better, etc etc etc?

I was well respected by my company such that, by the end of my summer rotation, my manager was making arrangements to send me a full-time offer in which I could choose the site.  I worked on the East Coast during my internships, and now I have the opportunity to work at their Silicon Valley site (I'm not sure how much information I should be giving, so feel free to message me if this isn't enough).

I've done some research on starting salaries for computer engineers, and many of the sources say $70k is a good place to start.  Based on your experiences, do you think this is reasonable?  Do you think it's too high/low for my situation and location?  Thanks!

EDIT: A second question I'd like to ask is, how high do you think could I make my offer before it becomes unreasonable?  Say I feel my experience, past projects, and overall skills out of college make me worth $75-80k.  Is it likely that I could negotiate a salary within this range?"

I hate hospitals. The smell, it’s the same all over the world. To me it smells like someone is covering something up, and I guess it’s in my nature to expose whatever that may be. Hospitals smell sick to me; the American kind of sick, the UK version of ill. They smell like sickness and sadness. 

It’s 4am and the fluorescent lights are hurting my eyes. I don’t remember when I last slept and I retrace the moment this all began and I see with the kind of clarity memories rarely have – Amelia Bachmann setting her purse on my paperwork, the designer bracelet on her wrist as she gave her statement on a cold metal table. I see Veronica Yu’s bruises and clean washing, technicolor magazines on her bed. A rabbit’s foot. Unlucky, Detective. I AM AFRIAD OF THE DARK. Sophie Blackwater’s face, her pearl earrings. Ash lighting up, Saph’s dark, tired eyes. Autumn’s skittish face. I see everything, and it all ties back to Niles Leyva. The man with a face and no real name. 
Ash is drinking coffee from one of those plastic cups you only ever really see in hospitals. It smells strong but grim. It smells false, mixed in with the still lingering scent of hospital food from a plastic tray. Catheter tubes still full of urine. I’m tired, I’m so tired. I’m nowhere near done. 

My cell starts vibrating in my pocket and I curse myself for not turning it off. The display lights up with each silent ring, and I see the name on the screen and I realise I can’t ignore it. 

“Hi Mom.” My voice sounds far away and I rub one of my tired eyes.
“Harry is that you?” she sounds faint. 
“No Mom, it’s Jack, you called Jack.” I look down onto the floor, the lights bouncing off the shining tile. 
“Jack? No. Is your father there? Put your Father on, Jack.” I close my eyes and try and remember a time I wasn’t tired.
“Mom, Dad’s not here, it’s just me, Jack.”
“Harry? Is that you, Harry?” she sounds far away, like she’s on the other side of the world. I haven’t slept in days.
“Mom, we talked about this. Harry’s… not here anymore. You remember, it’s Jack now. Jack.”
“I miss Harry. Tell him to call his Mother soon.”
Something rises up inside me, a familiar warmth covered in something else; maybe it’s acid. It burns inside my chest, rising, rising into my throat. 
“…Okay Mom. Go back to sleep. I love you.”
“I love you too, Harry. Goodnight.” She hangs up. It’s 4:12am. My head stays down and I just want to not be for a while. Be anything, be tired, be confused, be… just be. 

“I’d like to say it gets easier but I’d be lying.” The voice may carry a harsh truth, but it’s warm like a hot chocolate or a hot bath on a cold day. 
“Sorry I… sorry for having my cell on, I completely forgot.” I look up and see a doctor in light blue scrubs, holding two cups of coffee. 
“Your… partner asked me to bring this over, he’s gone down to the mortuary.”
“Mr Bachmann didn’t make it then?” I’m not surprised, but it still disappoints me.
“He was in what we call an unresponsive state. The movement you described was more of an antemortem movement.” She holds out the cup.
“I don’t think I can stomach any more coffee.” I still take the cup and hold it, and I find myself staring into it’s dark depths. 
“My Dad was sixty seven when he was diagnosed.” 
“Shit. Seventy two… she was seventy two. It’s been three years. It’s just…”
“Like talking into a telephone but the other end is stuck in the past.” She says it simply, but it’s both beautiful and damning. I look up, and she’s just looking at me, her face without an expression yet still open, friendly. Her eyes are green. “He’d have his good days and bad, but then it ended up with more bad days than good. It was like… he was lost in a dream. Stuck in the past.”
“I know what you mean. Some days I can go and she knows who I am, and then others she thinks I’m my brother, or worse, my Father… it’s not… it’s not easy.”
“Sounds like you were doing a good job to me. Is it just you and your brother?”
“Oh, no, he died when he was ten.” 
The doctor looks so horrified I have to apologise. “Sorry, it’s okay, it was a long time ago.”
“God no, I’m sorry, it’s kind of inappropriate for me to be talking to you like this. Shit, I mean, god, I mean sorry.” She looks so upset I almost want to laugh at her slip of the tongue.
“Jack Harper.” I hold out my free hand.
“Christina Angelo, well Doctor Angelo… Christina. I’m actually an intern, I was only meant to bring you some coffee and tell you where your partner was, shit. I mean, I really need to work on the bedside manner thing.” She smiles and I can’t help but laugh. 
“It’s nice to meet you, Doctor Angelo, I mean, Christina – can you show me where the mortuary is?”


By the time I’ve made a short elevator journey down into the bowels of the hospital to meet the coroner, I’ve managed to give the pretty yet accidentally off-colour Doctor my card. 

Ash is already talking to Gannascoli, the coroner when I get to them and he can’t really tell us anything we don’t know. 

“Death by exsanguination it looks like, but we can clear things up in the autopsy. It’s likely your victim was alive when the injuries took place – he’s received some blunt force trauma to the head, I’d guess enough to knock him out but not enough to completely kill him. If you don’t mind me saying so, this is pretty grisly.” Gannascoli was known as Dr Death at my old precinct, he almost enjoyed murder, the more gruesome and gory the better. For him, “pretty grisly” is the average man’s “horrific and ungodly”. 


Paul Bachmann is laid out on a trolley in front of us, ready for Gannascoli to take him away for autopsy. I’d been working with the dead a long time, even as a beat cop, murder and death seemed to follow me, hence the move into Detective work. Bachmann was, quite simply, a mess. The surgical team had attempted to remove the giant nail through his chest, but he’d died barely minutes in. 
“Rail spike. Old too, it seems.” Gannascoli motioned to the ten inch hunk of metal on a small table beside the body. “My Father worked on the railroads.” He adjusted his glasses and shook his head. “Musta taken a helluva force to get that through… no doubt it took a few attempts.” 
Bachmann most likely died slowly, and in agonising pain. If this was the work of Leyva – and let’s face it, it probably was… this gave a whole new meaning to the word “escalation.” This was technically our first body, and either it was a terrible co-incidence or Leyva was targeting Paul simply because he was related to Amelia. 
“PD have picked up the girl, they’re bringing her into protective custody. Parents are on the way.” Ash looked up from his phone. 
“Good news. How many other siblings are there?”
“Six, including Amelia.”
“Fuck.”
“They’re working on it, Jack, these rich kids aren’t always that easy to find.”
I look at Paul’s face, almost unrecognisable from the handsome young playboy in his Google search. Aside from the obvious injuries from the railroad spikes and head injury, his mouth had also been tightly stitched shut with fishing wire at the scene but had been cut open by the trauma team. On closer examination I realised that the blood on his mouth hadn’t only been caused by the initial sewing, but it was clear Bachmann had tired to open his mouth or call out, causing deep tears in the tissue. 
“The family won’t be seeing the body until after the autopsy. I’ll take care of him.” Gannascoli was watching me over his spectacles. “You should get some sleep, Jack. You look worse than most of the men back at my office.”

I consider saying something sarcastic, but I can hear a tinny rendition of The White Stripe’s “Seven Nation Army” coming from Ash’s phone. Not only by this point was this a bloody old song, it had been torturing me ever since I’d joined the department, and Ash being the irritating bastard he is, refused to change it. He answers, and doesn’t speak, just looks straight at me, shoots a “We’ll be right there” and snaps his phone shut. 
“Kimberly Bachmann’s neighbour called in a disturbance an hour ago. Uniform just called in a homicide.”



Kimberly Bachmann was Amelia’s younger sister, and at twenty-one was already known on the party scene as the life and soul of any party. Enjoying her drinking legalization since last October, she had really been turning up to everything short of the opening of an envelope. Clubs, bars, stores, charity events, she was there. She was a slightly less refined Amelia, still rich, well educated and attractive but wilder and less inhibited. Only last week she’d flashed at the paparazzi at a new club opening. 

Red and blue lights up the front entrance of Kimberly Bachmann’s apartment building, there’s uniform everywhere. The doorman is sitting down, shaking his head, looking off into the distance, dazed. When we reach the 15th floor, I can hear a woman crying, I’d guess it’s the neighbour. 

It seems Kimberly had similar taste to Paul; large, open plan apartment with white walls and carpets. Luxurious yet minimalist. She did seem a little more fond of erotic toned art, though. The Captain is already in the apartment, which means someone on high has woken him up and told him to haul ass. 

“What in the living hell is going on tonight?” he directs his question at me, although Ash is the senior detective on this case.
“Captain this has all escalated within a matter of hours…”
“Harper I don’t give a flying horse shit, we need to contain this. The Mayor’s office is already involved and Commissioner Bracco is up my fucking ass. Fix it.” He storms out of the apartment and heads downstairs, leaving us with Kenny Ryan, the younger coroner from Gannascoli’s office. 

Captain Thomas is what you’d call, in cop terms, a complete asshole. Ryan stands awkwardly for a moment and then punctuates the silence with his fast-paced, nervous speech. 

“Boys this is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” Ryan is a tall, lean guy with short spiky hair, huge bottle glasses and possibly the most excited, nervous disposition of anyone I have ever met. He practically runs into the bedroom at the back of the apartment, and his high pitched voice shouts behind him “And make sure you suit up.” 
A CSI emerges from the back bedroom with a camera, looking confused and quite possibly revolted. After the Paul Bachmann scene – which we still had to revisit after that CSI team had finished – I didn’t know what to expect, but there was a definite… smell, no, stench in the apartment. 

“I hate these fucking condom suits.” Ash is complaining, but I can almost feel the trepidation in his voice. This case; it’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before. Barely even read about. 

The bedroom is entirely different from the rest of the apartment, in fact, it’s almost like a little girl’s room. Pink walls, carpet and bedding, accented with a gold bed frame and an old time telephone stands next to the bed. It’s kind of vintage yet opulent, like a scene from Dallas. For a moment, it’s like nothing is wrong, until I see a large, yellow “1” marker next to a clump of long, blonde hair. On further inspection, I realise that a piece of scalp and fragments of skull bone are still attached. 

Kimberley Bachmann’s body lies in the clawfooted bathtub in the adjacent bathroom. The bubbles have long gone, leaving a sad, flat residue floating in deep red water. She’s halfway out of the tub, twisted oddly at the waist, her neck facing down towards the floor. A thick, dark, almost black smear across the white tile is all that’s left of her head. For a moment, my brain can’t process what I’m seeing – instead of a head, there’s just the bottom half of a jawbone, only identifiable by a few teeth left clinging on. My brain rejects what I’m seeing for a moment and I look at Ash – he’s the same colour as the crime scene suit. Pure white. He’s not complaining now, in fact I don’t think he’s capable of talking. Somewhere in the distance, Ryan is talking but I’m not really hearing him.

“…knocked her head clean off, basically, I mean it’s just… look at the spatter on the wall, I mean, it’s like six foot at least; blunt force trauma doesn’t really cover it, there’s nothing left of the top portion of her head to identify…”

“Shut up.” My voice finds my mouth and everything and everyone in the room just stops. “This is a person. She – and I point to Kimberly Bachmann’s body – she is a person. She has… had thoughts and dreams and fucking parents and brothers and sisters and now she’s dead. She is not your fucking science experiment, so just… shut up.” 

I feel Ash’s hand on my shoulder, and he doesn’t need to say anything. The reason he’s such a great partner, a great teacher is that he understands. He knows. He doesn’t need to tell me to calm down, to walk away, to go home and take a break because he already knows I’m going back to the station to see where we are with the rest of the evidence. Because we have to stop this psychopath from killing anyone else’s daughter. Or son. Or Mother, or Father.

Police work is normally just that. Police work. The pursuit of justice. Of making tough, rational decisions for the good of the city. But sometimes, it becomes more than that. It becomes a mission, a chase, a promise that you will not sleep, you will not stop until you know that your last victim is just that – your last victim. Your next potential victim, your next family destroyed – don’t become that. As easy as it is to write about death and fear and horrific things, it’s not so easy to consider that you’re writing about somebody’s child. Somebody’s sister. Somebody’s friend. Every victim was just somebody’s brother, friend, colleague, acquaintance, distant family member once. Before they became a tabloid sensation, a landmark case, a scientific discussion. 

By Kimberley Bachmann’s bed was a framed photo of two blonde sisters, holding drinks with their arms around one another, smiling out at me from the not so distant past. They looked happy, carefree, all those things casual photos from a random night are. I remember a similar photo of me and my brother on a beach somewhere. Behind me I can hear the click and whirr of the crime scene investigators cameras and the far off static of police radios. The scent of coffee drifting up from far below us. The sun is rising, illuminating the room, the faces of the girls in the photograph, Amelia and Kimberly with red morning light. New York was waking up.  I idly wonder if I’ll ever truly sleep again. 

Sometimes the most terrifying though of all is that life can change in an instant. We’re all balancing on a knife edge. What if Kimberly Bachmann had stayed out tonight? What if Paul Bachmann had stayed a little later at the office? Been caught in traffic? What if Amelia Bachmann had never met Niles Leyva? If their paths had never crossed? What if my Captain had sent Amelia to Jones or Ackerman instead of me? What if I’d walked away from Veronica Yu’s apartment without speaking to her? What if a million tiny things had never happened leading up to this moment? What if Niles Leyva struck again? How soon? What if I had decided to go home and sleep at shift end? 

I felt in that moment as if I was losing control. Not just of the case, but of everything. How could anything really be random? Was it fate, was everything just an intricate pattern leading up to this one moment? I swore to Kimberly Bachmann’s face, smiling out at me from a frozen moment in the past that I would find the person who did this to her. I felt as if I had failed her by dismissing Amelia’s claims as heightened paranoia only yesterday morning. Maybe it was my actions, twenty four hours previous, that Kimberley Bachmann wasn’t alive now. 

It’s all on a knife edge. Life can change in an instant.

I think it's awesome that we have these amazing pieces of hardware on us at all time, SO, I've always wanted to get into mobile development.

I started working on this app probably about 3-4 months ago. It should not have taken me that long, but I am a HUGE procrastinator and sometimes I just couldn't make myself sit down. If I had a better work ethic I could have probably finished within a month.

Anyway, through making this app I taught myself Java, Object Oriented Programming, and database programming through the use of SQLite!

It is called GetBig. It is basically a data-management app themed around workouts and lifting weights. It is very minimalistic. I have ideas for future features, but we'll see.

Another reason I made the app is because I graduate in December with a Math major and a Computer Science minor and I have no internships! I figured making an app would be a good way to showcase my skills to anywhere I might apply to, soon.

""What if x [best friend] got knocked up..."" I asked myself that. I know she wouldn't. But what if she did? how would i react? what would i say? how would the conversation go down? how would she reply? what would i reply to that? i run through these conversations in my head and they all pertain to me proving myself to someone. proving that i can be a caring and thoughtful person. proving that i'm not an asshole deep down, and that i do care for people.

what if J [old friend] texted me and said she was sorry? what would i say? what would she reply? what would happen? would we make up?

what if I still had G [another old friend] in my life? how would things be different? what if I texted her that I missed her? would she reply? if so, how?

and most importantly, what would people do if I killed myself? what would their conversations be like? would people avoid the topic? would people rejoice that i'm gone? would they mourn the loss? how would C [best friend] react? would she cry? how would my teachers react?

another thing is that i'm a really lazy person, and when i cant be bothered to do something and/or something pisses me off to a great extent, i just think: ""can i just put a gun to my mouth and blow my fucking brains out already?""

i don't have possession of a gun or fatal drugs or anything. i wouldn't ever act on these thoughts. but... they're there. they always have been. i've never, ever wanted to act on them. but they're powerful and influential. sometimes i can't sleep or i have panic attacks because i think i might hurt myself. i don't want to, deep down. but something inside me says ""just do it"".

---

i'm just scared to tell my therapist these things. i don't know how she'd react. i don't know if i'd be sent to the hospital again. but i can't go back. it wouldn't help me in this situation, and i have an internship and several AP classes that I can't fall behind on.

idk. i just feel alone. and the thoughts are intrusive today."

My girlfriend has just recently relocated to SF for work, and I am currently looking for a job in the Bay Area as well to follow her out west.

I've had significant experience in job searching due to past internships I've had in the past and feel relatively confident in the interview process. Unfortunately, I've only had to search for jobs locally and have no experience as to how the job process works if I were to be 3000 miles away from my prospective employer.

Here are some questions that I have:
1. What can I do to maximize my chances of getting an interview? I assume that since I am such a large distance away that I will be less of a priority for an interview as to someone in proximity. Is this true?
2. What can I expect for the interview? Will I be only getting a phone interview? Should I expect a Skype interview?
3. I plan to use a recruiter (I've heard to look specifically for recruiters in the engineering field) as well as an independent job search on my own. Is this wise?
4. Obviously, I don't plan on quitting my current job prior to finding a new one. What are some logistical things to look out for? Eg. Taking phone interviews at odd/work hours, references from my current employer (on this note, how do I handle references if I would like to keep the job search secret from my current employer?)

Bonus serious, but not serious question: I've heard that mentioning that you are relocating because of an SO during the interview increases your chances of getting hired. Is there truth to this?

Please also provide any sort of guidance or extra advice (perhaps another subreddit or information source that would be helpful) that I've overlooked for this whole process. This is my first real job search since becoming a real adult, and in all honesty, I'm a little nervous. I know I'm qualified for a variety of positions, but I'm not sure how to go about getting my foot in that door.

Thanks for all your help in advance. Much appreciated!"

I'm on my fourth month of being underemployed, nothing but $10/hr part-time jobs I am overqualified for since I graduated this past May. I have a very strong background of internships, an on-campus job I held for nearly all my student life, and campus competitions I participated in. I speak multiple languages, have been involved in leadership positions at student organizations, and I have a wide range of skills in the technical career I'm applying for. I also happen to be a woman, and a biracial (incl. Hispanic) one that too.

On paper, I seem great. And I know this is true because I get on average two invitations to phone interviews every week. I moved to the Bay Area (living with family) in the hopes I can tap into the bigger job market here. I've applied for contracts, internships, full-time jobs... but I have not gotten a single offer. Not even an on-site interview!

I've followed every piece of advice: preparing answers, reciting them, research the company, prepare questions, turn the interview into a conversation rather than Q&amp;A, I smile, I make sure I make the interviewer feels appreciated, I send thank-you notes, I breathe and relax before an interview, everything. 

I've spoken to senior employees from various companies and they all tell me I'll do just great. So what am I doing wrong? I'm starting to feel like I'm really not worth anything better than part-time positions, and I've been dejected, unmotivated, and deeply blue. Should I get a career coach? Should I change careers? So many questions. I sincerely appreciate all your time, thank you so much!"

This is not well written, just a recollection of a recent happening. Anyways, let me lay some background on you.

I went to a massive high school, I graduated with 900 kids, and the other schools in our area literally called us the green army.   However, regardless of its size everyone knew the popular girls.  There was this popular girl named Lexi in my high school math class that thought was absolutely gorgeous.   Eventually we started flirting for some time, and I managed to get her number, and things were looking pretty good.  High school crush stuff.  Anyways, I knew she had roid head x-boyfriend that was somewhat in the picture but I did not think anything of it.  One day I see him at my work, which was our high school spot to be, CDI.  I feel like we has staring me down but I figured it was just a coincidence, till I get a text from her saying, Kevin’s at your work, he knows we have been talking and he is pretty mad, be careful he’s the stalker type.  Well shit I thought, holy fuck this roid head could totally beat my video game playing ass into the ground.   I was like 6” 140lbs soaking wet haha.  As far as I remember I just told my boss who was an  in-training MMA player (so I felt protected) and nothing went down.  Lexi and I kinda stopped talking after that.  Fast forward, to July of this year.

Well I guess I forgot one thing, about June I sent her a Facebook message which is now weirdly gone, I just checked for it.  But I was just checking in on her, she was a cool regardless, and always a well-intentioned person.  Basically the typical what have you been up to, where are you headed kind of thing.  So July rolls around, I’m on CO-OP for the second time which is an extended internship through college, I get three credits to maintain my finical aid and then I get to go work for a company for about 8months.  On my first visit to Seattle with my company, I was leading a coating application study, I was basically a field engineer, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and I see “RIP Lexi” all over, so I do some digging and found out she was in a car accident at 3am NY time on a Sunday, dead on impact (remember this this is important).  This hit me slightly harder than I expect, sure I’ve had tons of family die, a couple of people I know die in college, and from high school, but I actually used to text this girl a lot, I don’t know, it was just harder than I expected to cope.  Anyways I knew she liked to party, so I had a margarita in her name at dinner that night.  Fast forward 3 weeks, I’m back in Seattle, doing the same old bottle testing and changing application parameters.   The weekend comes around, now the rental company gave me a free upgraded to a Camaro, so I put about 800miles on that thing (gas was paid for the car was paid for, unlimited miles, why not).  I drove up to see my cousin for the weekend, who lives an hour north of Seattle.  We played some magic pack battles and just talked because I see her once every 5 years this was extremely convenient to be in Seattle on business.  It seems like I have family where ever I go.  On my way back to the hotel , I had about 20min left to drive, I was driving on a four lane high way in the pouring rain, imagine, raining in Seattle.  Anyways, all of the sudden something moving upwards catches my attention to the right of me, it’s a jeep, flying up in the air, idk if it hit a deer or a bump I have no idea but my adrenaline was starting to flow, as it lands a car in front of it comes sliding to a halt in front of me (maybe it hit the right wall of the highway and bounced off), so I’m slamming on my breaks with all my might, as shrapnel is flying everywhere, and as I’m doing that I look to my right and another car is flying directly to my passenger side (3 cars so far), so I gun it and drift around the two cars just barely missing the car in front of me and to my side, by the time I look at the speedometer I’m going 120mph and far away from the crash, then I’ll I remember is pulling into the hotel.  I look at the clock it’s about 20min past midnight, so I might have spaced out for the rest of the ride back.  I’m not saying I’m good at drifting but I can’t believe I drove that well in that situation, I always thought I would just lose my shit and die.  I drive a 02 ford ranger I got from my grandfather, which is a rear real drive (Camaro is rear wheel too) so I’m used to drifting in a rear wheel vehicle.   I’m still a bit freaked out from what just happened so I decide to take a long hot shower and relax a bit, I put the song on “need to feel loved (Adam k and Soha vocal mix)”.  I find it relaxing and need to relax because I have work at 6am.   I was probably in the shower for an hour or so just letting the water hit me.  I get out text a few friends and get ready for bed, my Iphone had not been playing music at this time.  I tell siri to set an alarm for 5:30am  and she says “the alarm is set” and I go to get cozy into my  king size hotel bed, not 10 seconds later my Iphone decides to start playing music, it’s the song tracking treasure down by Gabriel and Dresden (mixed for feet version) except it’s not at the beginning its at 4:20 into the song where it says “at the same time” 9 times real slow. Suddenly I realize at  same time 3 weeks ago 12am Seattle time is 3am NY time I nearly avoided an accident and lexi died in one.  I got the craziest chill traversing my entire body for what felt like an eternity.  I love trance/edm music and most of my favorite songs give me the chills, but none quite compare to what tracking treasure down does to me now.

Web(RoR) vs Enterprise Java vs C/C++",sbcoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hwvn4/graduating_soon_trying_to_figure_out_which/,"Background: I am a UCSB student graduating soon with a BS in CS.

I have been coding since I was 13, first on a graphing calculator and then I learned C++ and then a bunch of other stuff since then.

I have had two internships. Both have been full-stack web development, one with Java/Spring/Hibernate and one with Ruby on Rails.

I've been in talks with Green Hills software (they make compilers and operating systems), and they seem pretty interested. The thought of working on mission critical systems where my code would be run on things like airplanes and sattelites sounds pretty awesome, and much more intellectually stimulating than web development, which has gotten kind of boring.

However, it seems like the tech industry is going more and more towards web and mobile, and I am worried that by working at Green Hills, I may get stuck in a niche field that isn't experiencing much growth. By tying much of my experience to being a C/C++ guy, will I go the way of the COBOL and FORTRAN programmers of old?

Another option would be Citrix, where I have a ton of connections and can basically get a job guaranteed due to how many friends I have there.

Eventually I would like to be working on huge data-processing/machine learning with big data sets, etc... Not sure which is the best way to get into that field. "

2hxg2w,1,2014-09-30,Should I Take a Year Off After Graduating to Build a Portfolio?,sockduffman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hxg2w/should_i_take_a_year_off_after_graduating_to/,"I'm an international student going to Stanford, and like most of my friends was going to be a Physics or Econ major until I got hooked on a couple of CS Systems classes I took in my Sophomore year and decided to switch majors, even if it meant taking a fifth year. In retrospect that was a pretty naive decision because I had zero background in programming and just wanted to know how ""the ones and zeroes"" worked and make stuff that other people find useful. I still don't regret it but think starting earlier would have been much better.

Now I'm at the beginning of my fifth year with no programming experience to speak of outside of class and with a 3.2 CS GPA. I had to take more courses than usual up to this point to catch up to my peers which took a toll on my grades as well as burned me out by the time summer arrived. I've learned a lot 

I'm afraid that I won't get any jobs because: 

a) My CS GPA is at best average.
b) I have nothing except Stanford and my GPA on my resume. No side projects, no internships.
c) I'm an international student, and if you are not a irreplaceable hotshot why would any company bother getting a work visa for an employee?

So to fix this I believe I should:

1) Focus on my classes and try to ace them all. Increase my GPA as much as possible (can realistically get up to 3.35-3.45). Do not waste time doing any side stuff.
2) After graduating, rent a place (I have a 10 year tourist visa and the finances to do this). Spend 6 months to a year doing anything that I should have done in undergrad (get an internship and/or contribute to open source projects and/or develop one or two of my own stuff and put it up on github AND practice for technical interviews).
3) Apply for jobs (now with a modicum of chance!)

What do you think?"

I didn't really experience that in school, but this week I started my first full-time job in my field and now I am starting to realize that I feel this way. My new job is at a respected organization and I was given a nice title and a decent starting salary for my industry. I was really excited to start, but now I feel like I don't deserve any of it.

My first day was yesterday, but I am realizing that everyone else around me is so much more talented and experienced than I am. I had several internships during my time in school and did well in my classes, but since I don't have the ""real world"" experience to back me up in my job like all of the others have, I'm worried that I wasn't the right candidate for the position. Don't get me wrong, I feel very fortunate to have this position and its a dream come true, however I can't help but to think ""Wow, they seriously picked ME over all of the others who applied?"" I'm having such a hard time getting acclimated to everything at work and I feel like an idiot for not understanding everything right away. My supervisors haven't been giving me a ton of direction and so throughout the day I kind of feel like a lost puppy, just desperately trying to find something to work on. I am so worried that my supervisors are going to realize it may have been a mistake to hire me and then I'll be out of a job again.

Have any of you ever felt this way? How do you deal with this feeling in a new job?"

So a little bit of back story. Over the summer, I worked for a relative at his office just doing a bunch of different stuff like setting up computers, installing software, troubleshooting, doing inventory, cleaning, paperwork, managing old archives. Just intern type stuff since I'm still only in high school. He agreed to let my buy my own parts so I can build my own PC as long as the total cost was maximum $800. But as what always happens, my budget went up from $800 to $1400. I kind of needed a new PC since my old PC was a pre-built Intel Core 2 Quad from Dell way back from 2009 that was really slow. That PC was horrible at gaming because it only had integrated graphics.

The main purpose for this build was gaming, browsing, watching movies, using Plex (transcoding), and doing a little bit of video/photo editing occasionally. My main goal was to be able to play the majority of games at High-Ultra settings at 1080p at 60fps. Second goal was to be able to use this PC without upgrading anything for at least 2-3 years. Third goal was to keep it all under $1400. Last goal was to try to go with a Black/Blue colour scheme and have it look great, not ""Gamey"" and have it run fairly quiet.

I could have not built this PC without pcpartpicker and this subreddit and all of it's builds as my inspiration. This subreddit was an amazing resource and help along with sites like Anandtech, PCper, Tom'sHardware along with LinusTechTips, AustinEvans and TekSyndicate. Other sites like Johnnyguru, MaximumPC, and Guruof3D were a great help also.

I named this build Serenity after the ship from one of my favourite shows Firefly. I couldn't think up of a name until I looked around in my room and saw the Serenity DVD. The pictures were taken with my brother's Sony NEX-5 which is most of the time a great camera except for in extreme close-ups, and dark scenes.

**CPU:** Chose the 4690K because I didn't really need a i7 especially since it wouldn't impact gaming performance. Plus it's one of the best CPUs you can buy without going over $250. It idles around 30°C and under load around at max 60°C in Prime95. I was debating between getting this or the locked 4690 but decided to go with this since if I want more performance in the future I can overclock making the extra $10-20 worth it. My first choice was actually a AMD FX-6300 when my budget was originally $800. It had great performance for the price but it was inefficient and had weak performance per core. I haven't tried overclocking the 4690K yet but I probably will sometime soon.

**CPU Cooler:** Chose the Corsair H100i since it has great cooling performance and looks really nice. First choice was of course the legendary Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO since it has great performance for cheap but it's huge and looks ugly. I have it in exhaust and what I am pretty sure is push, not pull. The cooler doesn't really get loud under load but in idle, it's noise is noticeable. The noise is just a constant quiet hum. One thing I didn't really like about the H100i is it's short Y-Fan cable and short fan/SATA cable. The shortness made managing the cables a pain.

**Motherboard:** I chose the MSI Z97S SLI Plus primarily because it looked really good and was a combo with the 4690K. I might do SLI down the line and overclock requiring a Z97. My other choices were other MSI mobos and other ASROCK mobos. Gigabyte and ASUS didn't offer any black and blue mobos plus most of them were out of my price range. Another reason I chose this mobo is because of it's Intel Gigabyte Ethernet port which I prefer over something from Realtek since I plan to build a NAS and wire my whole home. Somethings I didn't really like about the mobo was it's placement of front panel ports in the far left of the mobo. Otherwise I don't really have any complaints.

**Memory:** Chose this set of RAM since it was blue and at the time I bought these parts the cheapest high-quality RAM. The CAS is pretty low at 8 which is good, and the set looks good. Bought 2x4GB to utilize dual channel mode and it's 1600MHz since that is the sweet spot for performance and price at the moment. Was going to buy a 1866Mhz set of RAM that was around $98 but it jumped to something like $120. Other options were other G.Skill sets, and Corsair Vengeance RAM but all were more expensive at the time.

**Storage:** Bought the Crucial MX100 256GB SSD since it got amazing reviews and was cheap. Original choice was the Samsung 840 EVO 128GB but a few weeks ago there was some story about slowed down performance on older files which made me hesistant to buy it. So I said what the heck, I'll just buy a 256GB SSD and decided on the MX100. It's really fast and I installed my OS and all programs on it except for games. Might dual boot with Mac OS X in the future. I still get surprised by how fast my PC boots up. The average time is about 9 seconds.

For the HDD, chose a WD Blue 1TB since it has good performance and it is cheap. Could have gotten a Seagate for cheaper but I heard Seagate isn't really reliable. Was going to go with a WD Black but I already have an SSD so why do I need a fast HDD that costs about $20 more especially since it's going to be primarily used for data storage and game installations.

**Video Card:** I chose the Geforce 770 from EVGA. This was the first thing I bought and I bought it around late August. I am going to upgrade to the 970 using the Step-Up program. My first choice was the Radeon 280X from either ASUS or XFX since it had really great performance and cooling for the price at around $330 at the time. I was going to buy it but at the last moment I decided to go with the 770 since it was on sale at around $320 and was slightly better. Plus I heard that Nvidia's drivers and software was better than AMD's resulting in me going with 770. I also heard that the next x70 was coming withing the next 2 months back in late August so I went with the 770 so I could use the Step-Up program. The 770 idles around 30°C and under load from games like BF3, the max I have seen it go is 55°C. The 770 is a HUGE jump from the Intel graphics I had before. I get plus 60fps on Ultra settings on every game I have tried so far (BF3, Joe Danger 2, TF2, Left 4 Dead 2). It feels so good not having to worry about settings for every game unlike the Intel graphics which couldn't even play 7 year old games at the lowest settings. Back when my budget was $800, my top choice was the 760.

**Case:** I chose the Corsair Obsidian 450D since it looks amazing and has a pretty good price. It has great cable management and is roomy. My other choices were the Fractal Design R4 and the NZXT H440 but the R4 looked too simple and it's side windows was too small, and the H440 looked too simple also and lacked any optical drive bays. Plus the Black/Blue version I wanted was really hard to find and expensive. Also both have been used by literally almost every build in the last couple of months. The only things I don't really like about the 450D is the 5.25 inch bay covers can not be attached to the case if the bays are in use which kind of ruins the sleek brushed look, and the area for cables behind the mobo is kind of small making it a pain to put on the side panel. Also the front panel connectors were a little short making it a pain to connect them and the front panel/mesh that covers the fans is really really easy to take off which is a problem since I have little kids running around usually.

**Power Supply:** I chose a 750W Gold certified PSU from EVGA. It is a really great PSU with modular cabling, Gold certification and a cheap price. It also had a 10 year warranty which is insane (in a good way). It got amazing reviews from sites like JohnnyGuru. My other choices were either the Corsair CX600M or the RM650. The CX600M was pretty cheap and got good reviews not great while the RM650 got great reviews but was expensive and the reviews were not as amazing as the EVGA PSU. I know 750W is overkill but I might do SLI down the line and I heard that PSUs are the most efficient at close to 50% load plus the PSU was pretty cheap. With the 970 that I hope to upgrade to, the PSU might be even more efficient.

**Optical Drive:** Chose a Blu-ray reader from LG. Optical media might be dead to most people but I have a Blu-ray collection and I use my PC as a HTPC sometimes so I needed a Blu-ray drive. Could have gone with a writer but it was more expensive. Also I bought it from LG since the ASUS one didn't blend in as nicely as the LG drive with the 450D case. The drive works great but like all drives it is pretty noisy when the drive reads a disc when it it put in.

**OS:** Chose Windows 8.1 Pro even though I hate it with a passion. I love my Windows 7 Ultimate but in order to fully use the SSD's speed I needed to go with 8.1. Plus with a few downloads I can get my start menu back the way I like it. I got this for free since the place I worked at over the summer had a few spare licenses laying around because the majority of people who work there dislike Windows 8 and prefer 7.

**Case Fans:** Chose the Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition Dual Pack because I needed quiet fans for the H100i and it had coloured rings. Could have gone with a Noctua but it is very very ugly and far more expensive than what the benefit would be. They run pretty quiet and look great but I think they emit a very low constant hum. That might be the other fans in the case so I don't know. The fans work well as the max temp for the 4690K has been 60°C in Prime95. I have them configured in exhaust for the H100i in what I think is in a push config. I would have gone with a pull config since it is easier to clean but I think that would result in the fans not being visible inside the build negating the fact that they look cool. One complaint that I have is there are no instructions that come with it resulting in having to Google a few stuff to find out which way is intake.

**Accessory:** I got the NZXT HUE RGB kit since it's pretty cheap and looks cool. I know looking cool doesn't improve performance but dammit I want to show my rig off to my friends. Tons of options and modes and colours. A few complaints I have is the fact that the LED strip itself has fairly weak adhesive resulting in me having to open the case all the time to reapply it. I think I'm going to need to buy some 3M tape from Home Depot to fix this. Also the HUE doesn't come with any instructions on how to use it so for a couple minutes I was getting mad because I didn't know why the colour was still white. Turns out I have to twist the knobs a lot because I though the knobs have a lock so I was only moving the knobs a few degrees.

**Other stuff:** I have a Dell ST2310 monitor that is about 23"" and has HDMI, DVI, and VGA with a 1080p resolution. Works great but the base is wobbly and the picture quality itself is okay with okay colours and blacks. The quality becomes really bad in bright daylight. Got the monitor from the relative's office since nobody uses it. Have a standard Dell mouse from old PC and a great Lenovo office keyboard which I think is mechanical since it has pretty thick keys and makes a click when ever I press a key. Have an old Wi-Fi N card that I carried over from my old PC.

I am planning to get a new monitor within the next year so if you guys have any suggestions it would be great. Something that the monitor needs to be is non-glossy, IPS, max 24"", 1080p, and has to have a HDMI port and a DVI port. It would be great if it had swivel and portrait mode abilities. I am also planning to get a Corsair K70 RGB with Cherry Brown keys and the Logitech G502 mouse. If there are other keyboards and mice you guys recommend, it would be highly appreciated.

Overall the build went very well and took about a day to finish it. Remembered to put the IO plate first, test boot out of case went well and put all SATA and 5.25 inch bay drives before other stuff. Had to build on the kitchen counter since all of my house has carpet. Didn't need to use an anti-static strap. Just used gloves and grounded myself every hour or so. Cable management was a little bit of a hassle but otherwise the build went great. 

Sorry about the essay type description. :("
