(Especially in the Medical Device Field),dang_flabbit_gizmo,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o0b60/core_skills_software_knowledge_for_me_internships/,"I’m looking to get some opinions on what general skills and software knowledge would be considered most useful for ME undergrads looking to get that first internship this spring/summer. 

I’m very much interested in a biomedical-related internship, specifically something with a medical device company (Baxter, GE, Ethicon-Endo Surgeries, etc). Though I definitely will apply to more conventional ME companies considering the lack of exposure of BME material in undergrad. (Kinda hard to gauge what BME companies would want from undergrads)

-I’m currently debating whether to take an Introductory CAD course (a very time consuming one at that) as sixth class next semester, as I’ve heard from some friends that almost the entirety of the course is taught with NX. Up to this point I’ve always gotten the impression that 3DSolidWorks is where it’s at. Is it fair to say that some design software get more light of day than others? How about programming software (MATLAB, LabView, etc)?

Other than that there’s research experience (which I do have a semester of from last year, but it was back when I was in Civil and thought I would be an environmental engineer, not much pertinence there), and Excel skills. Someone mentioned in a previous thread about familiarizing yourself with [FDA regulations](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/default.htm) if you want to try the medical device field. Would this be impressive to know from a hiring stand point? Or would they think that as an undergrad that I'm blowing smoke out of my...well you know.

Sorry for the length here. Any other ideas? Or is it really as easy as making sure my name/resume gets seen by the right people?

nzt4k,4,2012-01-02,We were beaten to it because we took to long and were afraid. My biggest regret of my life this far.,businessmodel_bye_by,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/nzt4k/we_were_beaten_to_it_because_we_took_to_long_and/,"A friend propositioned me  on a business idea last February for a mobile application when we were both just 18 and finishing our final year in school.

The idea was for an app that ranks drink deals in your city's Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive. The app would be free to download and free for the club for the first 2 months. Then after the 2 months were up we would charge a nominal fee for each drink deal the club wanted to submit. We would have location based services built into the app so that users could not only see what the drink deal was but also how far away the Night Club was from your current position. Via the app you would be able to put yourself on the guest-list too. We had a lot of different ideas and plans for the app to add on after it had been created and published. We were to split the ownership 60-40 in my friends majority.

We got very excited from February on wards about the potential of the app. We started doing mock ups of the app in classrooms around the school after hours. We had a plan of action by April 2011. It was at this point procrastination began to sit in. We had exams in June that would determine what University we would go to. We said to one another that we would only spend non-study hours on the project and that it would not get in the way of our studies. We soon discovered that app of this size would cost in the region of 7000 to 12000 dollars.
The combination of these two factors left the two of us concerned about whether the app was worth it. 

Fast forward to Mid July 2011 after our exams. My friend came back from an Internship in Singapore for a start-up social networking site where he had met some multimillionaire entrepreneurs who had inspired him to go all out on the app. His motivation rubbed off on me when he got back. We sat down and planned what things needed to be done by when. We both downloaded Photoshop and began designing every page of the app over the next month and a half. We decided that we would have to get the app sponsored in order to be able to pay for the programming of the app. We were going to get the leader in drink distribution of our country to sponsor us.

We got our College places at the end of August and not much work was done on the project until end of September because we wanted to settle in. 

Then it all went down hill. On October 5th 2011 I walked into College with a different friend. We were approached in the main square by some promoter and a conversation like this occured:

Promoter: Hey Guys! Do you have a smart phone?
Other Friend: Nah, getting one soon though.
Me: Me neither, I have a Blackberry, why? ( I asked why just out of curiosity).
Promoter: Oh right, ok well if you 'like' our page on Facebook you could be in with a chance to win an iPhone 4. A friend and I basically just made an app for Android and iPhone that ranks drink deals in Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive.
Other Friend: Oh coo-
Me: What! (Grabbed the promoters phone to see it)
Promoter: Yeah its really cool!
Me: Is it successful?
Promoter: Well we released last Thursday and it has over 2000 downloads.

The design of the app was identical to what we had been designing except for the color scheme. My stomach sank. I ran out outside, my friend I was with had no idea what was going on. I rang my partner but he didn't pick up so I rang him non-stop for 10 minutes until he did. He was gutted and so was I. I wish them all the best though and according to the promoter he and his partner had spent their life savings on the app and had thought of the idea in February 2011 too.

As of today they have 25,000 likes on Facebook and the app only works in our city. So there is some serious potential for the application. It's called GreatNite if you wanna check it out.

TLDR; A friend and I procrastinated on an mobile application that had huge potential and someone beat us to it."

I breezed through high school, acing standardized tests and mastering concepts (except ochem, holy fuck is ochem hard) without any real effort. My parents aren't rich, but I have a nasty case of white privilege, I've never applied for a job but through high school always had nice internships in engineering firms, and I'm not doing so bad now either. (a friend of a friend knew somebody who knows a cofounder...)

I have rarely had to do something I didn't want to do. Homework? My teachers let me slide because I did so well on tests and was really good at kissing ass. 

This has fucked me.

When I try to do something, if it takes more that a little bit of effort I almost immediately lose interest. I decided last week to ask you for help reddit, and every day since then I've started writing only to delete my draft 10 minutes later and start browsing /r/funny . I dropped out of college, because they weren't so lenient about homework, and I just couldn't sit down to write papers and solve tedious problems. I've gone through a few jobs now, because after a month or two I get bored and just stop working, having solved all the fun parts of their problems.

Luckily I'm a computer programmer so I could keep this up for the rest of my life if I wanted to, computer programming pays ridiculously well. But I don't want to be so lazy! I want to start my own business, or go back to school and get a PhD in math! I want to reinvent the internet or play a big role in the creation of strong AI! 

It's gotten painful to meet anybody form high school, they all talk about how much potential I had and have, then I have to tell them I'm between jobs or working for some startup that isn't solving anything useful. It's painful not just to face my friends, but to face myself. I feel like I'm throwing my life away and badly want to stop.

tl;dr 

How do I keep myself motivated in the face of doing real work that isn't necessarily fun?
How do I train myself to delay gratification? At the moment, I can't for longer than a few minutes.

However, during my internship I've never had to do a proof to figure out if it'll work or not.

I'm an american citizen, who has just completed a masters degree in Media Innovation from the NHTV University of Applied Sciences in Breda, NL.  I have applied for and received a 'zoekjaar' visa from the Dutch government that allows me leave to stay in the NL for one year...  However, I have decided that I'd like to live and work in the United Kingdom, preferably London.  The language barrier in the NL will always pigeon-hole (sp?) me as a non dutch speaker and I just feel that there are more opportunities in the English speaking country.  On top of that, I have a large group of friends and an SO in London, so I selfishly want to be closer to them, if I'm not in my home country.

I've just had an interview for a position with Sony here in London (i came over for NYE) and they really liked me and wanted to plan a second interview until they discovered that my visa only allowed me to work in NL.  I was had a feeling that the visa was NL-only, but have just received it a few weeks ago and hadn't really tested the waters yet to discover what I could and couldn't do with it.  Needless to say, it was devastating to hear that I've been stopped in my tracks on moving to London to be near all the people that I hold so dear.  :(  

Does anyone have any advice regarding what my options are?  I've got a masters degree from an NL uni, a bachelors from an american uni and really REALLY want to do this.  I can't be the only American kid looking for the chance to live and work in the UK, but sometimes it feels like it because no one can really recommend any viable solution.  

Hopefully one of you can give me some ideas... I'm considering BUNAC, but am afraid that after the 6 months internship that I'll be in worse shape than I'm in now, as i'll have already 'used up' my chance and the UK govt will be less likely to grant me anything.

Any help/advice is so much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I get my diploma this month in Computer and Information Science. I'm a decent programmer, but I've absolutely 0 real world programming experience.

I also haven't been doing many programming projects on my own time.

I've been meaning to teach myself Python and Java (in addition to the C++ that I've been learning in class), but I find it hard to get motivated.

I was wondering if there were any computer engineering related internships that I could be looking into because the few that I have been looking into are mostly CS related, which I can do, but I prefer some thing more geared toward my major. I'm thinking that if there was a clear goal (like an internship) to work towards, I'd have more motivation to learn more things outside of class.

Also am I the only one that finds the requirements for application for internships pretty high? Like multiple languages, project experience and  leadership/extracurricular... I can't be the only one that hasn't done these things...

We had this uncontrollable attraction and started seeing each other. I broke it off with my girl, but she didn't break it off with her long distance boyfriend. It was fine because he was never there. Anyways, after an extremely short period of time, we fell in love, this being my first time to tell that to anyone, and her saying (and I fully believe her) that she has never felt this way before about anyone. 


She finally decided to pick me, and each time she tried something major happened to stop her, the first was him reading some of my texts which made him suspicious and her want to wait till he didnt think she was dumping him for me. Then his dad passed away (i know from outside sources that this is not made-up), then he found out we were still ""dating"" each other. We have gone through incredible emotional trauma that I cannot begin to describe here. Then she had a minor surgery, and he was there with her the entire time, and she began to have feelings for him again, which is understandable (I was not allowed to see her because her family doesn't know about me, and still thinks she is in love with him).


So yesterday she decided she couldnt handle the pain anymore, and that if she is starting to have some feelings for him again she should see how that goes.  I know for a fact that she is still in love with me, and that she is looking for the easiest end to the pain. I have explained this and countless other things too her.  Aside from email me and her will have no contact for a week, and then she will make her final decision.  I have dated many girls and would not have gone through this for anyone else, she is literally the perfect girl for me, and I the perfect guy for her. I trust her completely. She is not using me and I cannot let her go if there is still a chance. Oh, and she has an internship this semester, so she won't be here with me for college again until summer.

So reddit, I am here begging for your help. How do I convince her that what she is thinking of doing is wrong, and that she needs to stay with me.  I don't care if you downvote me, little else but resolving this situation matters to me at this point."

I'm nervous that I'll be alone in a big city, missing out on experiences with him, and that I'll regret it.

This is everything I have ever learned in my undergrad CompE degree.

Anyone have any guesses on things I should check over? I've reviewed my computer architecture notes, running through some programming principles and algorithms now, checked over some of my Verilog code earlier. I guess I should probably hit Digital Logic too, but I don't think I'll have time (interview came out of nowhere, fast).

Thanks!"

While I could go the way of dish washing and fry burning, I've invested a great deal of time into my passion: coding.  I'm not any sort of code guru and at the moment I have no formal training.  I've worked extensively with java, even getting 'paid' to teach it at a summer program but I have never really undertaken (and completed) a large or complex project.  Right now I'm trying to get up to speed on C++ largely because it looks to be a good place to start.  I genuinely hate web and mobile development as I view the platforms to be too much of a moving target to go after at this point and if i stick with the basics I can easily adapt down the road (right?) though I have the ability to do it (I currently manage two separate sites).
I just started looking and stumbled upon an internship opportunity for a game company caught.  Unfortunately they indicate that they are looking for full year interns and while I could maybe pass as having the proper skills (algorithms and c++ knowledge) I'm afraid to try.  For the record, I'm not even a gamer.  I enjoy and am reasonably familiar with the company's product and I like game development for the challenges (I've been messing with SDL in C++ and JOGL recently).  It is, however, not a career I'm dead set on yet and I'm told that its wildly competitive given the influx of crazy-gamers-who-want-to-make-games.

Has anyone else gone through this before?

o705x,5,2012-01-07,"My ""I'm tired of looking for jobs"" rant.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o705x/my_im_tired_of_looking_for_jobs_rant/,"Forgive the bluntness, but I'm really sick of looking for jobs. I graduated from college december of 2010, as a late 20's graduate, who paid their own way through college, working the whole time, taking an internship in my desired field, while still attending classes full time after the 40 hour work week at my internship.

And I didn't expect to have jobs thrown in my lap, and I still don't. But I am so sick of the (already tedious process in itself) browsing all the generic places to look for jobs, sending my resume out like a shot in the dark, hoping someone somewhere offers me something. I've applied for unpaid internships on top of working the crappy jobs I was working this last year just to have some form of personal progress to a field worth working, to no avail. 

And the crappy jobs I've had, it amazes me that some people seem(ed) almost surprised that the economy is going into the toilet. The minimum wage has barely been touched in decades, while cost of living goes up and up, even for the two miserable retail jobs I had last year, you have to know that for every position you apply for, whether it's toilet scrubber or fuck, even president,900 other people have all ready applied, sent in their resume, etc. 

The first shitty job, I learned every aspect of this retailer, went to their ""training"" thing to be a better person at the part of the job I did, all for less than a dollar above minimum wage. And when I found out someone who didn't know or do a quarter of the jobs I did made a dollar more, their response was ""well you shouldn't know that"" and ""we only give raises once a year"" and I believe they even said they don't give raises that were more than that. This same employer proceeded to then ask me if I was ""dedicated"" to this less than a dollar above minimum wage job, when I took my second job, and that jobs hours conflicted at times with this job, a second job that paid a dollar fifty more.  On top of that, the GM literally yelled at me and an employee from the vet that is inside our business because as I was walking by she gave me info on my pet, and then proceeded to just talk for less than 20 seconds, despite the fact that at my wage, I could sit there and do nothing for an entire hour, and they'd still be out less than a 10 spot, god forbid I converse with a coworker, why that's almost 20 cents of lost time.

The other job was slightly better for a while, but even there, I know when business slows you have to cut employees hours, but i went from working 6-7 days a week and forty plus, to working a 2 hour shift. All this at a business which when I was hired mentioned they were opening I believe 50 new locations in the next year. Maybe you shouldn't be opening 50 new locations if you can't afford to pay employees for 2 hours of work. 2 hours necessary to make sure that everything is ready for an entire 13 hour day of business.  And it's always interesting to me to work a job where the district ...whatever unique name they give them.... making certainly somewhere in the 60-100k range tells the GM making 35-50k a year to tell the back manager making about 30k to tell the hourly employees who if they even got 40 hour weeks would only make about 13k a year, that the labor costs are way too high. In that situation, I know a real quick way to trim about 150k of fat.... 

Additionally, after several months of working often 6-7 day weeks at this job, picking up every single hour I could get, offering to help in any way possible, when I told them after a week where I got 12 hours that I was going to move out of town to stay with the rents to save money, unless I could get a raise and more hours (because where I was living wasn't cheap), they told me they could give me, maybe,...a quarter raise maximum. Now I understand all the basic arguments about economics, worth of labor, etc...but there has to be at the same time recognition that in 2011/2 what can a quarter get you? As Wyclef Jean once said, NOTHING, motherfucker. If I even got 40 hours a week at this job, which I didn't, that'd still only be 10 dollars. So to offset the cost of living, I can now have an additional 40 dollars a month. Maybe. Sorry I'm not jumping like a pig in shit for your trickle down pennies falling.


I admit, I am particularly (some would say VERY) recalcitrant, and a stubborn prick at times. But how much do you have to be shit on for less than a livable wage? Wages in this country are a joke. If I were making a decent wage, enough to pay my bills, eat food, and not live in squallor, god forbid, I could probably say yeah, some bosses are dicks, and deal with it. But that's where we are a society. Anyone who DOESN'T view 8 dollars an hour as a positive thing is somehow an entitled piece of shit. It's like that Doug Stanhope bit ""How much is it worth to have your life suck? 13 bucks an ow'a..."" I don't want a handout. I've never gotten any aid, any unemployment, all I want is to work 40 hours a week at a wage where I can actually keep my lights on.

/end rant.

I'll go back in my little corner and listen to my angry david cross and doug stanhope bits

**TL;DR** I'm a stubborn recalcitrant and at times a prick, but begging and groveling to shithead managers for 8 bucks an hour? What fucking planet is this?

o6k7i,0,2012-01-07,Shitty friends &amp; no where to go. Help?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o6k7i/shitty_friends_no_where_to_go_help/,"Hey Reddit. Have I a tale for you. 

I go to school in a city. A relatively big college, and at the start of this story I had a few close friends, but two friends were closer then everyone else. We'll call the first close friend, Friend A, and the second Friend B. Everyone else I know through conversation or school. 

I'll be trim with the details. Friend A is a notorious jerk (he has classified himself as a douche, but a good kind of douche) from overreacting to going too fast with girls too quick, as well as lying and other things. I've been friends with him for a little over a year or so. I was friends with him because I felt bad for the guy, and knew that other people were shitty to him, so being there for him would be the right thing to do. Friend B had been friends with him for a long time, since junior high, and said he's been like this for a long time, and like me, he was nice enough to put up with him.

Introduce Girl A. She's really cute and nerdy and awesome. (she's a fellow redditor) I know her from last year, and she knows me somewhat. Friend A takes notice of her more when she gets a haircut and starts talking about how cute she is. I 'take notice' her as well. During this, Friend A goes through constant 'likes girl + creeps + goes too fast = ends bad' stages. 

Needless to say, Friend A and Girl A don't end up. Friend A goes way too fast, does many shitty things (but doesn't realize it right away) Girl A mistakenly leads him on a bit and that turns into a mess. Throughout this, he realizes I like her, and I can see he's bugged out about it. About a week or two after I tell Girl A that I like her (after we flirted, but still after her and Friend A didn't end up together) and she likes me. She's liked me for a long time. We start dating, and currently, we are in a relationship (which is awesome).

However. Shit changes. Friend A is pissed off, and he has a right to be. I have a talk with him and he says a bunch of things, and we talk it out.. at least I thought we did. I promised not to be couple-y about it and not to rub it in or mention her. I keep my promise. He starts messing around with this girl (we'll call her Girl B) I had a short fling with. 

Friend A and Girl B are messing around, and Girl B tries to end it, but lo and behold, they end up in a relationship a short while later. During this, he talks about how pissed he is at me and how bad of a friend I'm being *behind my back*. I confront him about it and he says how shitty I'm being, how he really feels, a bunch of stuff. I tell Friend B this, and he agrees that Friend A is being shitty (Friend B and I would rant sometimes about A's antics here and there. **Sidenote: Friend A &amp; B and I have two other friends, which I will call C &amp; D**) 

It's still pretty rocky after the talk. Friend A doesn't talk to me as much anymore, Girl B and her friends (who I used to get along with rather well) act weird around me, and act offstandish to Girl A. Friends A, B, C, &amp; D, along with a few other friends, have a party and don't invite me. They go out and neglect to invite me. But after shit had cooled down, finally Friend A talks to me and it gets a little better, even though I'm still wary of him and our 'friendship'. 

Cue winter break. Girl A and I are doing great. Talking about our relationship and dating and awesome shit like that. Friend A and Girl B seem to be doing good too. But it's weird, Friends A-D don't try to get a hold of me at all during break, or speak to me (except for one time for Friend A &amp; B. A, I wished him happy birthday, and B, I asked him how he was doing. Short conversation.) Finally, the tipping point, Friend C makes a post on FB, saying something to the point of me not being their (A-D's) friend anymore, and Friend B agrees. 

At this point, I say how close me and Friend B had been. We were friends for a year, but we talked and had deep conversations and I said how I depended on him and how we were best friends. And this happens.

So now.. I have no idea what to do. Break is over in a few days. (We're a state school, western state, but I won't say which because that's silly anyway) I don't have that many close friends, my really close best friend being far away in an internship. I talk to other people, sure, but they weren't as close as Friends A-D. 

What do I do? Am I being melodramatic? How can I get closer to new friends? Sorry if this isn't the right section.

**TLDR;** Lost friends who I thought were close, who I could depend on. At a loss. MMFB?"
o6jy6,1,2012-01-07,A Guide to a Career in Investment Banking,FuckYouImFunny,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/o6jy6/a_guide_to_a_career_in_investment_banking/,"I wanted to make an investment banking guide for future undergraduates (maybe graduates) who would like to go into investment banking. I know this would have helped me *tons* if I read this before I started hunting for a career in Investment Banking. Other users, feel free to call me out on things you believe I am incorrect on, add more information or ask questions.

The topics of discussions will be:

* Background
* Essentials on your Resume
* Networking &amp; Getting the Interview
* Getting the 2nd round (Super day)
* Professionalism

***Background***

As a background, Investment Banking is basically the crux of what a Finance position is. This includes Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Restructuring, Financial Advisory &amp; Services, and many more. You do not need to major in business to get into Investment Banking. I have seen people with a Music major, History major, and all sorts of different majors go into Investment Banking. What you do need is a stellar GPA - 3.5+ is normally the requirement, but it can vary. Anything closer to 4.0 increases your chances for an interview.

At the lowest level of an Investment Bank, you have Analysts that do the brunt of the work - pitch books, modeling, talking with clients, etc. Associates are the next level up, and have more responsibilities but I believe do the same work. Then you have Vice President's, Directors, and Managing Directors. Managing Directors work the 9-5 basic schedule normally, but their job is to maintain relationships with people and get deals. You will probably start off as an intern or an Analyst.

Investment banking is grueling hours, normally 80-100 hours a week. You will likely work from around 9 AM to 12 AM, that's the standard cycle. Weekends are fair game, I have heard Saturday you may come in for half a day, and Sunday it depends. I have heard people work Monday – Sunday, 9 – 12 AM… so basically expect no social life. Even if you finish all your work by 8 PM, you normally stay until 11 PM just in case any work sparks up. Lunch is normally skipped unless you could probably scarf something done at your desk, and there is normally time for dinner.

***Essentials for your Resume***

To be remotely considered, you need a good set of experience and extracurriculars. You want to get *involved* and hold leadership positions. It is important you do not waste your summers… You need a go to plan BEGINNING your freshman year, because it will make your life much easier the earlier you plan. For a Freshman, try to get some internship or leadership program over your first summer. This increases your chances of obtaining a better internship your Sophomore summer. For your Sophomore summer, I have seen Sophomore investment banking internships at some places, which is crazy because they are starting at such a young age. Experience is probably the best thing for investment banking – they will see your head is in the game and you know what you are shooting for. If you obtain a Sophomore IB internship (very few out there I believe), I can guarantee you that you will have a huge advantage over a ton of people.

Junior year is your last year for an IB summer internship (technically whatever your 2nd to last year is). Make sure you have extracurriculars as well, because they want to see you can balance school &amp; activities. Frats/Sororities can be very helpful since there may be people in the frat/sorority going for IB, so you can have a helping hand. This is another way to network Remember, your resume speaks a lot about you. It is the entrance exam – the more and better extracurriculars with a high GPA, the better your chance of getting the first round.

***Networking and Getting the Interview***

The first basic goal is to obtain an interview. This normally happens by networking. If you have some investment banking club, workshop or seminar at your school, that is where all the networking will likely happen. The resources provided by your school can be extensive, especially if it is a top undergraduate business school. Getting involved is the key, knowing the Director of the IB programs is a huge plus. Once you get into the program, you should be given tons of names. It is basically cold-emailing people, asking for a phone call. To stand out and have your Director like you, *get involved in the program*. Answer questions, ask questions, just participate by raising your hand. He will note that you are taking this seriously, and will refer you to investment banks who will be asking him/her for the best students.

Networking is extremely important because it gets you the interview - *your first goal*. You want to talk to as many people as possible in the company without sounding obsessive or annoying. I normally shoot for 2-3, but 3-5 is probably good too. Normally you want to talk to Analysts before you make your way up to Associates, VPs, and I would leave out Directors/MDs because they're extremely busy. 

If you schedule a phone call with them, call them at the time you scheduled. If they do not pick up, leave a voicemail and e-mail them saying that you left a voicemail and hope you can speak with him/her later on in the day or week. If they pick up, introduce yourself. Ask them if they’re still free to talk, and if they say yes, just act normal. Ask them how their day is going, what they’ve worked on today, etc. I would say include some small talk before you begin actually networking. Then say something like, I’m interested in working/interning at BLAH, and I was wondering if you could tell me more about the program. Listen, I would try to take notes, and then just ask normal questions that pop up into your mind. You can ask them about their experience so far and some of the deals they’ve worked on. I would try to act more informal after all your informational questions are answered (near the end of the interview), what they like to do for fun, some of their interests/hobbies, etc. End with if they have any questions for you, answer, and then thank them.

Normally they might ask you behavioral questions such as, why do you want to do investment banking, why our bank, or even tell me about yourself. Have good answers to these questions and any other questions you can think they might ank. You really want to be seen as a person someone can easily get along with – fun, confident, smart, etc. This is really important, because no one wants to work with someone they cannot get along with. If you are working with someone for 100 hours a week, you want to be able to get along, so THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BEHAVIORAL/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS!

If you don't have the resources to network, I don't really know what you can do. Apply online, try to call their offices to speak with an Analyst maybe, try to do something. Doing nothing is the opposite of what Investment Banking is. 

***Getting to the 2nd round***

Your second goal is to get to second rounds (after getting the first inerview). This normally means learning your behavioral and technical questions. Behavioral questions are questions such as, ""Tell me about yourself."", ""Why our bank?"" and ""Why investment banking?"". Those are the most usual behavioral questions, but it can extend beyond that. Technical questions are basic finance/modeling questions. Questions such as, ""How do you calculate WACC?"", ""Explain to me how a $100 deprecation expense flows throw the three financial statements with a 40% tax rate.""

In my opinion, technical questions get you to the second round. You need good answers to those three behavioral, but from what I have heard, technical questions is what separates you from everyone else. Ways to study for technicals are through books - Mergers &amp; Inquisitions (website), a Wall Street Oasis Study Guide, and you could probably just search it online. I recommend the first two books because they really have a lot of technical questions. However, searching advanced/unusual technical questions using Google will be very helpful.

There may also be brain teasers as some types of questions. One question I got was, ""Determine how many fridges are in the US, and show us your thought process."" Other may be quantitative such as, ""What is 9^3?""

***Professionalism***

Professionalism is crazy in investment banking. There is no horsing around when it comes to people. One mistake can really fuck you up. I have heard stories at my school where a student sent an e-mail to an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, but he had BAML (Bank of America) in the paragraph. He was obviously copy pasting the same message to everyone, thanking them. This spread like wild fire to the university alumni, and he was basically denied a lot of interviews for that. Do not do anything stupid, TRIPLE AND QUADRUPLE check every e-mail. Make sure you have your resume attached to the first e-mail, and make sure the file is in PDF and its name is LastName, FirstName. 
Make sure you thank people, and be grateful for the chance to speak with anyone when networking. If there is a presentation you are attending, THANK THEM after the presentation. This is also a great way to network at presentations, be the first one to go up to people and begin talking, thanking them for coming down and whatnot. 

TL; DR - There is no TL; DR for Investment Banking. If you scrolled to the bottom to only read this, you probably aren't determined to go into the field.

If you message me, I could probably just send you all my books on Investment Banking. They may be outdated, but it's a start.

What do I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ob7hd/reddit_my_mother_seriously_hates_my_sister_and/,"My mom is currently going through a divorce that started as a result of her walking in on my stepfather (my sister's father) beating my sister. My sister has developed serious emotional and behavioral issues because of this. Our mother has been incredibly apathetic toward the fact that my sister has these issues, and when we tried to report the abuse or tell her, she would tell us we were lying and refuse to discuss the issue or bring us to a family friend nurse that would overlook our bruises and cuts. Throughout the divorce, though, my mother has been guilting me into watching my 16 year old sister on weekends because she can't handle my her moods and behavior. My mom goes on ""overnight work bonding trips"" and ""just needs a night off"" every week complaining that my sister is too much to handle. I feel like I'm being selfish telling her that as a 20 year old, I'm parenting her daughter more than she is, but I buy all my sister's food, make sure she's on birth control, picking her up from dances and work, and I'm the one she gets pawned off on at any given moment when our mom wants to go out and party.

For example: This past weekend my mom decided to have a date stay over, but didn't want my sister at the house, so she asked me to watch her. When I said no (simply because I wanted a weekend to myself), she left my sister waiting for someone to pick her up from work. 

I love my sister and I don't mind seeing her every week, but with two jobs, an internship, and college full time, I can't worry about babysitting my sister because my mom doesn't like her. What do I do?

TLDR: My mother doesn't want to take care of my sister because she doesn't like her, so she pushes her off on me. What do I do?


EDIT: My sister needs to be watched because of her self-destructive behavior. She has a lot of emotional and behavioral problems that cause her to need ""babysitting"" to make sure she doesn't cut herself, get pregnant, get into serious drugs, or anything you wouldn't want happening to any other teenager. She has so far proven herself incapable of keeping herself out of trouble at and outside school because her own mother doesn't give a shit."

A take night classes at my school and my teacher told the last 3 of us before we left class that his primary job has openings. One of which is a php programmer position (Which is currently what I am doing.) My current job pays 35k a year (I am basically an intern but my job title is Applications Developer). I am just under 1 year of experience and do not have a degree but I am seeking. 

So onto my questions:

* I am in Omaha, NE what salary could/should I push for. The company is very large.
* What kind of skills are important to put down? (Should I put down programming languages I am comfortable in or only those that really apply?)
* What benefits should I be looking for?
* Do I need some sample code?
* How can I show that I am skilled in the required field?
* What questions should I ask about the job? (I am kinda lucky in that my teacher is department manager so I think I can find out a bit more about random stuff through him and it sounds as though php position would be working under him.)"

I'm earning 32k a year at my first job, and she'll most likely be earning the same amount when she graduates. She told me that if I didn't have any debt, that she'd be planning her future with me.

I'd just like to point out that I love this girl deeply, and wouldn't turn down a life together with her. 

I told her that I was going to try to get the burden of my debt lessened, that I was going to consolidate my loans and actively seek to move up the ladder job-wise, but i honestly feel like my only chance of holding on to her is winning the lottery.

Do I have any options?


edit: Sorry call me an idiot for not mentioning this, but I feel like I left a key point: she let me stay with her free of charge while i was trying to find a job, she helped me afford life in order to intern at my company on a minimum wage salary for three months until i got my promotion. the girl took care of me, she maybe she thinks she is cutting her losses honestly"

oegts,1,2012-01-12,"I'm interested in entering into politics, can Reddit give me some advice and helpful information for making this happen?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oegts/im_interested_in_entering_into_politics_can/,"his account is a throw-away considering content from my current main account could jeopardize future efforts.

With the current events and situation in US politics I have been pondering about attempting to enter into it as a career. I'm 20 years old, so I have plenty of time ahead of me to prepare and plan out what I aim to do and how I aim to do it. Where it stands as of right now is figuring what I should do with the time ahead. I've come up with a few examples of things that could potentially increase the overall influence of my lifetime career such as: getting a PhD or masters (enrolled in art school, have the support to switch and go for another degree), taking time throughout the next few years to dive into politics (intern for local politicians, attend city council, etc.), collecting sources and information that will benefit the campaign (keeping up to date and relevant, an example for today would be SOPA/PIPA), and garnering support, funding, advisers, representatives, etc.

I feel as though it wouldn't work as well if I didn't explain what my goals are and how I feel as a person on situations today. My end goal would be to run for President in 15 years. I don't feel confident enough to say if I'm a Democrat or Republican, but I understand that without associating myself with one or the either I would most likely be unelectable (at least in our current times). With that said, here are a few things that I see needing change in America:

- Corporations are not people.
- The Gov't is NOT allowed to bail corporations out of bankruptcy (there may be exceptions but it's rare). 
- The destruction of unions, pensions, and worker benefits is creating a type of ""paid slave"" in current society (under 20k salary/year, insurance for self but not for family, etc.)
- Police brutality results in immediate and permanent removal, and in some cases let go with absolutely NO BENEFITS (in severe cases).
- A Police officer should never be overweight, and should have access to 24/7 trainer/equipment/etc. (because they shouldn't be overweight or even fat, EVER)
- The Gov't will not touch the internet.
- The Gov't was founded on the belief of a free man, not religion.
- NASA funding should continue.
- Other forms of scientific funding should continue/increase (too broad to delve into right now).
- The Gov't has no right to tell you what you can and cannot put into your body.
- Gov't salaries are too high.
- People shouldn't be allowed to live on the streets (read below)
- The Gov't should fund accommodations for those who can't afford a safe, livable home.
- Sales tax should already be added onto products (on a per item system; carton of cigarettes for $60 (12 packs in a carton), sales tax at 8%, $64.8 for the carton, $5.40 for one pack).

I will be updating this list as quickly as possible, please bear with me.


There is a lot more but it's difficult to throw everything out there at once. If you would like to ask me about a current issue that you'd like to get an answer for I'd be more than obliged to answer it. All I want from you fine folks is information and support, help me make this a reality. Any assistance is greatly appreciated, and if you have any questions feel free to post them."
oeg83,4,2012-01-12,Need help with some MySQL query decisions,davydog187,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/oeg83/need_help_with_some_mysql_query_decisions/,"I'm working on a project for my internship that I've been building from the ground up. Its a web-based scheduler for application licenses thats built on top of flexnet publisher. I'm using the codeigniter framework for the backend which I really have begun to like for its ActiveRecord method to database access. However, I'm having some trouble with some of the more advanced SQL stuff.

I have two tables, features and licenses which look like this:

features:

    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | scheduleid | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
    | username   | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | feature    | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | date       | date             | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | start_time | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | end_time   | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

licenses:

    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field   | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | feature | char(50) | NO   | PRI |         |       | 
    | max_lic | int(4)   | NO   |     |         |       | 
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+

Now that I'm thinking about it, feature should probably be a foreign key. I'll fix that later. For now, I want to insert scheduled features into the features table. Whenever I do that, I want to avoid overscheduling by checking that the # of licenses per time period is less than max_lic. (start_time/end_time is always a half hour block, so I probably could get rid of end_time also). I'm thinking that I'll probably have to make use of MySQL transactions, but I'm not sure of how I should write the query to check for overscheduling. Essentially I would want to do something like this:

Assume:

    myDate = TODAY();
    myFeature = ""gcc"";
    myStart = 9


    (SELECT count(*) FROM features WHERE data= myDate and feature = myFeature and start_time = myStart) 
    &lt; 
    (SELECT max_lic FROM licenses WHERE feature = myFeature).

What would be the correct way of doing this check, then inserting to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency?

Thanks for your help. Also, triggers?"

So I'm in Computer Sciences right now. I was always more interested in humanities and social sciences in High School, but I did not see myself finding a job after University with that. I thought business, but it never really appealed to me. Then I found out about computer sciences, and thought, hey, I like computers! This sounds like a great idea!


And it's been ok, but I'm quite frankly getting sick of it. And I'm only three years in. I can't stand the culture, and I feel disinterested in many of my classes. I can program, but it feels so empty and hollow. I honestly can't see this being my life. Plus, I've completely lost my interest in video games in the last year which was where I wanted to work (cliche, I know, but at least there's an ounce of creativity in that field).


So this semester, I'm also taking a few courses that belong in something called ""Humanities Computing"" or ""Digital Humanities"". These concern themselves with science fiction, the history of computers, and the social influence of computers and video games. I *love* these courses, especially the social influence part. I actually want to go to class now.


I stopped to think about what interests me, and looked at a few of my University's grad school options. One of them is sociology. It sounds damn interesting. I've always been interested in different subcultures. I find computer and video game nerds especially interesting. And I've always wanted to be a professor...


But seriously? I'm quite sure a sociology after-degree would take at least another two or three years after my current one, then if I wanted to become a professor that's for sure six years of grad school. That's possibly nine years! I'll be in my thirties. Not to mention the risk of not finding a job, or failing grad school outright. 


I am for sure finishing the Comp Sci degree. I have a 1.5 year internship coming up, and then I have a year of school after that. I've put too much work into this to just stop now, and I have too many people counting on me. 


But I do not want to program for the rest of my life. I feel like I've already sort of screwed up my life and I'm only 20 years old. 


Has anyone been in a situation like this before..? What would you do?"

Recently, I've been offered an intership at a prestigious medical school (I'm not going to give the name for legal reasons) and am really excited to go. As a student in highschool, I think the opportunity would be really rewarding as I hope to some day have a job in the medical field. I am scheduled to intern during the summer for approximately 4 weeks. During which, I will, not only work with MDPHD doctors, but experiment with blood samples and extra DNA (kind of a nerd, but I LOVE this kind of stuff).
Normally during the summer, I attend a summer camp for 8 weeks (basically takes up my whole summer). I've made a bunch of great friends there and have a strong connection with the place. If I was to accept the internship, I would be unable to go to camp. This summer would be my last summer ever to be a camper at this camp. All of my friends and I have been looking forward to this summer ever since we started going. There's a lot of myth and excitement about being there this summer; we get tons more privileges than the other campers and everyone remembers THIS summer. 
I don't want to let down my friends, but I think the opportunity at this medical school is too important. My parents, though very supportive, haven't really leaned towards one decision or the other and I'm having a really difficult time deciding what I want more. Do I take the internship, and lose the summer with some of my closest friends? Or do I go to camp, but lose the intership at the medical school? Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. "
od55c,0,2012-01-11,Job Help,throwaway3188,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/od55c/job_help/,"Hey Reddit,

A few weeks ago I decided to look for and take a new internship. I applied for one at a local start up and a few other places around my college town, and get an offer for 14 an hour as before I was making ten, at a cool start up.

The day after I accepted the offer from said start up I got another internship offer for 22/hour from a IT company. 

I told the IT company sorry, and started at the start up. I did not enjoy my first few days, and am beginning to regret my choice.

I am worried however that the IT company will be worse, as there are NO women, I work from home part of the time, and I would be the only person under 30 working there. But the pay is amazing and it seems like a good gig.


I do not know what to do. I am torn. Any advice?

Tl;dr, I got two job offers one from a start up that pays less and one from an IT company that pays more but is boring. Advice?"

I built my first computer when I was 16, and made some pocket change doing odd jobs around my community. I earned my CompTIA A+ Certification in 2010. 

Now, I'm a Computer Science senior at a state school in PA. I'm 21, and going to graduate in May (unless for some reason I fail to pass all m classes). My school concentrates primarily in Java, while teaching you some C++/C (this is our basic/intro programming class), and COBOL (yes, they still teach that). Right now, I've been independently working on an Android App (which probably 60% finished, as I just completed the database-end of it).

My skills in more detail:
---------------------
Intermediate Java - decent understanding of Abstraction, Inheritance, etc. Have experience doing HTTP socket work, GUI/Swing.

Android - Getting close to completion with first app. Using Eclipse/SDK

Adobe Fireworks and Flash - I've done some independent stuff with Flash, and I minored in Communications Media so I have some Fireworks experience. Makes for some better ""programmer art"".

COBOL - Took a required class in COBOL. Know roughly/decently how stuff works.

Database - Basic experience with Oracle and a good bit with SQL. Know SQLite somewhat due to Android. Know how to normalize somewhat, ER diagrams, etc.

-------------------

I've only applied for a few jobs recently, but I've had a certain bank shown interest in hiring me (they called me the next day) for a COBOL internship position. It pays decent, as well. I'm worried about getting stuck in a rut though, as I'm not passionate about COBOL at all. I told them I would get back to them.

Since I was young, I've also been into gaming. It became a stress reliever during certain parts of my life. Therefore, I've been interested in game development. I've had a course with it involving Unity 3d, but I thought the class was useless. I have done research in the game industry, and i know alot of people tend to warn others not to get caught in it, due to long hours, deadlines, etc. I still have a huge passion for the field though.

Since lots of you are probably at work but surfing reddit, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm a 4th year computer engineering major at my university and I'm trying to get an internship. Do you have any hints or recommendations? There is a engineering internship fair coming up soon so I'll probably check it out. Should I make a resume? What should I put on it? (there must be a subreddit for this...)

A little about myself, I don't have a whole lot of computer programming experience besides learning C++, Java, PHP, and dabbling with some languages in the classroom. I do have some design experience, but not enough to be a graphic designer :( I'm willing to work hard and learn all that I can

I'm going to be starting an internship in Munich next month as part of my study abroad year and was just recently told that there would not be space at the company apartments during my stay.

I've just started by putting up some posts on wg-gesucht and studenten-wg, and was wondering if you had any other recommendations for places to find a WG.

I'm sure it won't be a problem to find rooms for Zwischenmiete, but it'd be nice to find something for my full stay until mid-August.

Background: I'm in my last semester at a university studying Computer Information Systems. I'm WELL ahead of any of the other students in my classes. I have a lot of hands on experience. I currently have a Datacenter Internship working at an EXCELLENT company. They're consistently top 25 companies to work for in the US. They actively spend money upgrading IT, rather than looking at is as a sunk cost. My main responsibilities include 100% control over the physical aspects of the Datacenter at our company. To put it in perspective we have a top-of-the-line DC, but only ~40 racks (not including UPS-related ones). They have no problem trusting me to transport ~$30,000 between DataCenters in different cities on a weekend trip. A lot of my duties are on the software side of things also (provisioning servers, VMs, troubleshooting, etc). We also have 5 full time competent System Administrators. I would say I'm pretty much already a Jr Sys Admin, without the title.

Question, in depth: This internship is a 1 year commitment which is over in May. I'm pretty much guaranteed a job with this company doing SOMETHING. They often have IT helpdesk positions open which include on-site and remote support. The liklihood of my getting a job as a Sys Admin there after this internship is unlikely, but I might be able to find something else higher up than a helpdesk position. Anyway, the question is this: Should I stick with this company and work my way up through helpdesk positions to get to a Sys Admin position, or take my chance and try to get an actual Jr. Sys Admin position with another company? My concern is that I'll end up at some company who doesn't care about IT with a bunch of incompetent people.

**TL;DR Work for an AMAZING company as a DataCenter Intern. When my internship is over should I stay with them and get a lowly Helpdesk Technician job and work my way up to a Sys Admin role, or try and get a Jr. Sys Admin role with another (less amazing) company?**

This is my first time I've ever been in such a setting, and to be honest I'm not sure how to navigate these shaky waters... I'm halfway through my term, and I have 4 months left to make a better impression. So far I've been known as the hard-working, quiet gal;  I don't mind this, but I'm worried that people find me anti-social. People in this department are particularly social, and I'm starting to feel a little left out..

To add to this, my boss isn't too keen on my right now. He treated the last intern in the same position I'm in now as practically his niece. According to a coworker who worked closely with this intern, my boss took her under his wing and helped her with everything, but he's making very little effort to make me feel welcome (gives vague advice, barely acknowledges me in the hallway).  I have a feeling he finds me too quiet.

Reddit, I'm running out of time. I have good work ethic but my shyness and lack of knowledge of the office life isn't helping me at all. Do you have any good advice?

ogoko,17,2012-01-14,Why The Time To Build A Wawa At Temple Is Now.,TheHeadiestBrah,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/ogoko/why_the_time_to_build_a_wawa_at_temple_is_now/,"[If you'd care to first check out this heavily relevant article from The Temple News I wouldn't blame you.](http://temple-news.com/2010/11/08/freshman-initiates-petition-to-bring-wawa-to-campus/) 

As many of you may recall, the construction site that's currently blocking half of the sidewalk on Broad St. between Oxford St. and Cecil B Moore Ave. is eventually going to be the home of a multi-purpose complex that will house over 1,000 students along with a considerable amount of space for retail shops. The complex is intended to serve as a ""gateway"" to our fine school for those arriving from center city.

Looking back a few years, Wawa and Temple seem to have developed and maintained a strong, mutually beneficial relationship. Wawa has consistently offered a number of internships and corporate training opportunities to us Owls (I believe mostly within the Fox School) in addition to partnering with STHM (represent), which has provided interns and student volunteers for Wawa-sponsored events as recently as this past July for the Wawa Welcome America Festival.

One can only assume that on an executive/corporate level, Wawa must think somewhat highly of our institution, as licensed by the ongoing nature of their recruiting efforts. Wawa doesn't interview Temple kids for cashier/deli jobs, their objective in recruiting us, as far as I have seen, has been exclusively for managerial or management-track positions. I believe it stands to reason that since Wawa, by their past actions, has clearly embraced the notion of allowing Temple and our alumni to play a considerable part in the day-to-day operation as well as the future development of their organization, that they should in turn be as greatly enthused by the opportunity to become a part of the ongoing development of Temple's community as well.


In writing this I was reminded of the work of two students within my major who completed a semester-long research project as one of our school's requirements throughout this past fall. In this particular class, students are given almost total autonomy as far as picking what to research, this particular pair chose to design their study to explore perceptions of what the student body finds to be lacking from main campus along with what those students would want to see built to address those deficiencies. The most common opinions found in their study (by a fairly wide margin IIRC) were that students believe that campus doesn't have enough options for places to eat and that there are not enough businesses that are open 24 hours a day on campus. In light of their findings, I must deduce that a majority of the students that provided responses to this survey share the sentiment that the time for a Wawa to be constructed at Temple is upon us.

I think there is a strong case to be made as to why the currently-developing site on Broad St. presents the ideal set of circumstances for the introduction of Wawa to our beloved university. Wawa's stores are generally fairly small (~3,000 sq. ft. according to their website) but attract a great deal of foot traffic day in and day out. It could work out to the benefit of other would-be businesses in the new complex in that a Wawa, by it's very presence, would act to provide a constant stream of visitors (potential customers) to the immediate area while leaving a great deal of the physical space open for other businesses to occupy. I'd think that maximizing profit per square foot is in the best interest of any real estate developer, I see no reason why this instance should be the exception.

In spite of these lengthy musings and in spite of my great personal desire to see this initiative come to fruition, there is much reason for  apprehension in that the good ol' online petition method has already been attempted with regard to this cause and has fallen short of realizing its goal. As such, I'm at a loss as to what might be the best way to go back to collecting and subsequently conveying our community's support for this initiative.

To those of you that share in this vision, I'd appreciate any input as to how you think one might make the best effort to organize/utilize our community to make an honest go at this. This semester is going to be my last on campus as an undergrad and I know I'm going to be too poor to donate to the school's alumni fund until I pay my loans off. Regardless, I still want to try to give back and make an effort to leave Temple as a better place than it was when I found it for the generations to come. To that end, I think a Wawa would do quite nicely.

**TL;DR: I dream of a world with touchscreen hoagies and f'real milkshakes for all Owls**

ogl8w,0,2012-01-14,"Hey Reddit, I'm 18 and insecure about my life. What do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ogl8w/hey_reddit_im_18_and_insecure_about_my_life_what/,"I suppose I don't really have a reason to be insecure about myself, but here's a little background info. 

I'm a college freshman who's doing well in school so far (3.9 GPA in the first semester). I went to a top ranked public high school in the US and because I slacked off, I now go to a fairly small university with about 6000 people total where I have a few good friends there. I love the professors and my newfound interest in learning, but I can't seem to really fit in socially. That's not to say that I'm not a sociable person. I can get along with people very well, but I haven't really made any friendships that mean something to me. Most of my close friends are all from high school and they're all very smart. All of them ended up in places like Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and UC Berkeley/LA/Davis. 

I suppose I may have developed an inferiority complex because I spent 4 great years in HS with them. In those 4 years they helped me realize that my education was important to myself, but at the same time, I couldn't/can't stop comparing myself to them. They're all extremely talented people with goals and here I am sort of drifting through life. Sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm not doing enough with my life. I feel like I'm uninteresting even though I've had really fun times with my friends. I'm usually the person they go to talk to about their problems because I always listen and try to give advice, so in turn, I don't end up venting about my worries often because I feel like they're insignificant in comparison. Sometimes when I talk to them, I hear their stories about how fun their lives are and how they're going to parties and enjoying their classes, I can't help but feel jealous and wish that I could find a place where I'm completely comfortable at my school.

Over the last few years, I've switched my focus between varying engineering disciplines (chemical, mechanical, materials) and am now contemplating Computer Science and Engineering. I've considered transferring to another university where I think I would fit in better, but at the same time, I'm worried that I won't be able to do well there. Where I am now, I'm doing very well and am pretty much at the top of my class. I also get along very nicely with my professors, but I don't feel comfortable amongst the majority of the students. It may be an elitist attitude that I have, but I don't feel like I can be friends with people who have even less of an idea than I do about what they want in their lives. I keep worrying about research and internship opportunities and I feel like I'm not taking enough units to compare to my friends.

Tl;dr: I miss the company of my old friends who are essentially sociable nerds, have an inferiority complex, and am undecided about my future.

What can I do Reddit?"
ogih2,5,2012-01-14,CS Major graduating in May: Have I hit an early jackpot or am I settling?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ogih2/cs_major_graduating_in_may_have_i_hit_an_early/,"I'm a CS major at a major university in New York City who is graduating in May. For the past year I've been interning in the IT department of a financial company. It was my first internship, and I did a ton of grunt work with the HelpDesk during that time, but I stayed on because they payed really well and constantly dangled a job opportunity in front of my face. I also believe that I learned more from the internship than I had during some of my later classes, and I made sure that I kept honing my skills during slower periods.

Fast forward a few months. A co-worker, the company's Backups Administrator, mentions he may soon be looking for an assistant. Primarily, he's looking for someone to stagger hours with and take some of the stress that is associated with being the only person responsible for a major part of infrastructure (and so he could accomplish more with some Disaster Recovery related projects). The job may also involve acting as a lackey for some of the other departments (Database administration, UNIX, networking), and I am excited about the possibility of still absorbing more information from these other professionals, especially since I wouldn't be making an intern's hourly wage anymore. Shortly before he considered me for the job, he mentioned this new hire would probably be starting around $60k.

Fast forward to today, and the job is essentially guaranteed (I'm reading the NetBackup literature and everything). No formal talks about salary, however.

So, /r/cscareerquestions, I'm willing to answer any other questions you may have/ heed any warnings. Does this sound like a good opportunity for a new grad, or am I selling myself short?"

The thing is, I got my first internship freshmen year of high school, writing ASP for a small local business.  Within a couple of years, it was no longer an internship, but a junior developer position.  Lots of ASP, some ASP.NET, database management, etc.

My second year of college, I began working at a small contracting company.  Despite being in college, my previous experience pretty much made me the senior developer at the company.  I worked on a large variety of projects, directly interacted with clients, spec'd projects, even helped make the sales.  Despite being in college, I'd work 20-30 hours a week, and full time (or more) over my summer and winter break, so I'd say this is very legit experience.

I graduated college a year ago and am still with the same business.  I may be moving quite far away this summer though, and if I do will be looking for a new job.

My concern is this:  Do I represent myself as best I can, with over 5 years of professional experience with a large variety of technologies and projects?  Or does it look suspicious to HR to claim X level of experience having only just graduated college, such that I should write my resume around my education and one year post-college work experience?  I could potentially see myself applying for non-junior/senior level positions, but I'm not sure if my young age will make this a poor choice."

Over the summer I graduated from a top 20 university with a bachelors in Business Administration. I feel like it helped me grow as a person, improved my critical thinking abilities, taught me the basics of financial analysis and other ""business"" things but didn't give me any real solid ""skills"". This is probably what they're shooting for with undergraduate education, so I don't particularly blame my schooling for my inability to land a job.

I worked for the entirety of my schooling at a local retailer and between that and full time school I presumably didn't do enough extracurriculars besides being an officer in an environmental student group.

After graduation I was able to find an unpaid internship back home working for the county as a budget analyst. I work like 25 hours a week doing whatever odd jobs they can think for me to do. They've been really good about not making me do menial things like filing and I've been getting a lot of experience in excel and SAP but still no real ""skills"".

I enjoy the internship about as much as I could expect to enjoy working for free, and would love to get further invested in that area of expertise but the county is laying off more people than it's hiring and I have only had one interview in months of searching.

I feel like as time goes on computers will replace most of the typical office jobs that people are strangling to hold on to now, and my job search is only going to get harder and harder. I've been a computer geek from the earliest times I can remember and have been pondering going for my masters in a field like Computer Information Sciences. Day after day of job searching and it seems like there is always a multitude of openings in the information technology industry. 

My problem is that I've already taken out a considerable amount of student debt (~30,000) to be able to afford the original university. I imagine it'd cost about the same to go for my masters and is that really a feasible amount of debt to have as a new graduate? Will a masters degree teach me skills that are desirable in the job market?

I'd love any and all advice on how I should progress with either graduate school (and how affordable that would be), or other ways of possibly acquiring skills. Or maybe my entire thought process is wrong and you can show me the light."

It still haunts her to this day.,staticvoidmain,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ollat/my_girlfriend_got_raped_almost_8_year_ago_it/,"I met a wonderful girl a few months ago which I could describe easily as my soul mate. It was idyllic and perfect. She's beautiful, smart, funny and full of joy.

When I started going out with her I noticed small scars on both of her wrists. I asked her about it and she brushed it off. I must have had a worried look because later she spit it all out. At age 13 she was raped and she tried committing suicide because she felt it was her fault and she felt dirty. I didn't inquire more about it. Fast forward a month later. She studies nursing and begins an intern in a psych ward. She returns to me after her first day down and angry so we decide to drink.

After a few drinks she begins to cry uncontrollably. I ask her what is wrong and she tells me it still haunts her everyday. She said since I came into her life it started to go better (I never noticed her having issues and being haunted) but it happened again after her first day at the ward.

She said after she felt dirty and at fault so she tried committing suicide. She then slept with lots of guys to try to make the pain pass and because she felt so dirty.

I am the first to know about this. Not even her parents and 3 year ex know about it. I was speechless. I love her so much but felt powerless. I don't know what to do, Reddit. When she was telling me how it happened I imagined the scene in my head and almost cried of madness.

I've been with this corporation working as a system engineer (intern) for 2 years which i get benefits. At the end of summer I will have my associates degree (Associates in Arts).

Now the other option would be to go off to college for two years that will cost me 20k a year roughly but I will still be able to intern at this company while i'm there.

oknez,109,2012-01-17,The Little Girl,SuperSayan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oknez/the_little_girl/,"I've been a police officer for almost 30 years. I've seen it all. Or so I thoght.

A few weeks ago I was cruising around town on my way to my favorite Starbucks like any other normal day. I had just been out on a school teaching some first graders about traffic safety so I felt pretty good. I got back to my car and sat down, pulled the seat back a bit and took a sip of the steamy hot coffee. It was a pretty fine day, the weather was a little dull, but it didn't really bother me. All of a sudden I get a call over the radio. I didn't recognize the voice, but we just got new interns at the station so it was probably just one of them. Some girl claims her mother needs help. The address is only two blocks away so I decide to check it out. I pull over next to an apartment complex and walk up to the front door. As I'm about to ring the doorbell hoping for someone to let me in I hear a faint voice behind me. I turn around and is greeted by a small girl. She appears to be 7 or 8 years old. Very, very pale with huge cirles under her eyes,. He lips were slightly grey as if she was ill. Her hair was flat and looked very dirty. She wasn't wearing anything besides a little white/grey dress. No boots or socks. I offered her my jacket, but she declined. When I told her why I had arrived and asked if she knew anything she motioned me to follow.

We went around the back of the apartment complex and down a small staircase to a basement which appeared to be the place to park your bicycle. She walked over to a door, which led on to the rest of the basement and opened it. Suddenly she picked up her pace and started running. I tried to keep up, but... She looked underweight, but she was jumping around the corners like a deer running from a predator while still telling me, in a silent whisper, to follow her. I couldn't hear the slighest hint of her being short of breath, her voice didn't change at all. At some point I lost her. I stopped to catch my breath and looked up. I was standing before a door. I placed my ear to the door and heard a familar noise. I couldn't figure out what it was, but I forced the door open and found myself in a washing room. The noise was coming from a washing machine and there, on the floor next to it, lied a woman. She lied in a pool of blood. Her clothes was torn into pieces and she had bruisers on her arms and legs. I called for assistance and an ambulance and ran over to check her pulse. She was barely alive. I picked her up and made my way outside. 

At the bicycles I was met by paramedics who took care of the woman. They told me she was gonna be fine, but only because I got to her in time. I figured the girl had seen her mother on the floor and called for help. I just couldn't find the girl anywhere. I wanted to let her know her mom was gonna be fine. After searching the rooms close to the washing machines for a good half hour I gave up and went back to my car. My coffee was freezing cold so I went right back to Starbucks to get a new one. 

I arrived at the station shortly after. The new interns were standing outside smoking so I went over there and told them about the little girl and how the call had saved her mom's life. They all looked at me like I was from another planet. Apparently, neither of them were on calls. I apologized and went inside. My boss rushed down the stairs from the dining room and told me to follow him to his office. As I sat down he started questioning me about the call. He was eager to know what I was doing in a locked up basement next to a woman who had been raped. I told my boss about the call on the radio, the little girl who had opened the door and shown me the way. My boss was confused. The paramedics couldn't get into the basement because the door was locked up good and barred from the inside. They had to wait for someone in the complex to remove the bar and unlock the door.

I deciede to take the afternoon off.. I had no idea about what had happened. I definately heard the call on the radio and the girl had been standing there right infront of me, without a doubt. How she managed to run away from me - I don't know.. and why she ran back and locked the door to keep the paramedics from enterring I don't know either... Puzzled I headed to the hospital to check up on the mother. A kind nurse showed me where the mother was lying. She was asleep so I picked up a newspaper from a newspaper stand and sat down next to her bed.

After about an hour the mother woke up confused about where she was and what had happened. I told her she had been raped, but luckily her daughter had found her near the washing machines and called for help. She looked at me with an odd look. She had never been a mother. She was pregnant 8 years ago, but the child was stillborn. 

Now I was kinda scared. I excused myself and told the woman to call the station should she remember anything about her assailant. I walked out of the room and headed straight towards the nearest elevator. I pressed the button and waited for the doors to open. For some reason I felt an urge to look back on the woman one more time... so I did. 

And there she was."
oklbn,2,2012-01-17,Am I being too harsh to Furries?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oklbn/am_i_being_too_harsh_to_furries/,"I despise furries, not because they are creepy or delusional. I dispise them for what they have done to the puppeteering and costume industry. 

I’ve worked for about 10 years in entertainment, started when I was 17. I’ve had some great opportunities in the FX and costuming industry that culminated when I landed an internship with Jim Henson Corporation. I’ve done costuming and puppetering for countless companies including Disney, Dream works and Warner. I’ve been everything, from kick ass monsters in horror films, to several recognisable characters on children’s shows. 

A number of friends know what I do and I’m ok with them joking about it. But gradually I’ve found my work as a costumed performer crossing paths with the stigma or furries and my sense of humour is dwindling. Whenever people ask what I do for a living, and I tell them, the first thing they always bring up are “hey, do you know what furries are?” 

I always feign ignorance, and they always feel the need to tell me. It infuriates me. I work with kids, and though I’m not prude, I just feel that anybody who is in this line of work should not be motivated by a costumed character fetish. When I go to a gig, whether it be a TV show, or just working on a cruise line, I can always spot the furry that got cast. They have this air to them, this really unnatural focus on the costumes that goes beyond healthy.

The last big gig I did, we got a furry fired. Though, he was getting on the nerve of most of the cast, I’m not sure he did anything outside mentioning he was furry. A group of us literally told the stage manager that we felt his personality was getting in the way of the groups comfort level, which on a cruise ship, is all it takes. I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, I’m so sick and tired of people associating costumed characters with sex obsessed weirdoes.

These days, I’m transitioning into working as an illustrator, and hope to cut back on costumed work. I think this is in part, to the fact that I just can’t stand furries, and in the rare cases I cross paths with them, I just want to punch them. Am I too harsh?

olqkh,6,2012-01-17,I no longer fear it...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olqkh/i_no_longer_fear_it/,"I have recently transitioned from fearing suicide to not fearing it at all. I'll try to give you some background. I don't know what I hope to achieve with this.

I'm 25 now, but I started being depressed in high school at 15-16 due to various factors. Maybe it was part genetic, maybe it was my bad family situation, maybe it was because I was a closeted gay at a single sex school. I grew up in a western country that has rampant homophobia and racism ingrained in society and from my late teens I felt a need to escape it. I had always thought about suicide from time to time, but never thought about it seriously until I was about 22. A friend gave me an intervention and said I needed to go get treatment. Before this I was against psychiatric medicine because of the seemingly changed personalities of my friends on it. I have now been on anti-depressants for 3 years, either having medications that didn't work or gave me bad side effects. I've gone through a bunch of them. I either feel dread or nothing. I don't know what it's like to cry anymore, it's been close to 10 years since I've been able to, even in the worst situations, like a friends funeral.

You could say I'm moderately successful, though in my eyes I am not where I wanted to be. I have a degree and I am working on my second (postgrad) one in a foreign country that doesn't speak english as a first language. I have worked at large corporations overseas doing summer internships multiple times. Despite this, I always fell short of my performance requirements and never managed to get a full time job, partly due to lack of effort on my part, partly due to asshole managers, partly cause it was very hard, and partly because i was stressed and depressed and still had to try put it aside to succeed. I have been trying to get a full time job outside of my home country for 3 years now. I don't do well in interviews, I tend to be badly judged in a short time with extremely technical questions.

More recently, I did badly/got screwed at my summer despite working sacrificing many nights and weekends and didn't get asked to come back full time. However I subsequently did well in university (though I could have done much better with my ability). Despite high pay at summer jobs, every cent goes into my education and I have no support from anyone and I'm not eligible for scholarships in this country. I have had to do crazy things just to get my study visas and I definitely have had less money to support myself as I would like. As a result I can never go out, never see friends, can't eat out, and have had to reduce the amount and quality of food I eat to make money last longer. Despite my frugal spending, I realised recently that I had overspent what little I had from unexpected costs and I won't be able to continue to the end of my degree without work. Getting a part time job is hard here, let alone one in english. I can barely afford my psychiatric appointments and medicine. I might have to go back to my home country without finishing my degree with only a few months to go.

I haven't had a relationship with any of my family for at least 2 years and have had to rely on friends as family since my late teens. I stopped talking to them because the anxiety and depression from even thinking about them was too much. A phone call or email will completely throw me off for the day. I haven't felt love for them for a long time. The idea of a working family seems so foreign to me now and I can't relate to wanting to be with them. I understand the instinct, but I don't feel it.

I have a network of friends around the world, but as you can imagine, not being physically in their locations makes it hard to be close to them. Most find it too much effort to talk over different timezones. I usually have 1-2 friends I am close to at any one time, but it changes year to year. I had a non-serious open relationship for a few months when I was 23, but have never otherwise had a relationship due to falling in love with unobtainable people (which luckily I stopped a few years back). I've never had someone in love with me at least.

A few months ago I started thinking more about my philosophies on life. I have always believed in the personal right to suicide, but it was never an option to me because of the hurt I've seen it do. I had a friend hang himself over a girl about 3-4 years ago and I saw the damage it did to everyone. On this past New Years Eve, I was alone as usual due to lack of local friends and money to go out. I got the most suicidal I had been in a while. I started to think that the only reason I was keeping myself alive was to not hurt those that knew me. This point has really stuck with me over the past few weeks.

I am frantically trying to make my situation work but I should have been fixing this earlier. I have had offers of small short term loans from friends who can't really afford it but the overwhelming guilt of accepting them and the uncertainty of employment/ability to repay them after finishing my degree makes me feel like it's not a realistic option. As soon as I get down to only having enough money to buy a one way ticket 'home', I think I'm going to leave.

I don't think I can handle going back in this state of mind though. I can't tolerate the general populous in my home country and their conservative attitudes. I can't handle starting over again with nothing and having to take a underpaid job with strict working environments. As far as I am concerned, I couldn't be happy that way, having lived through it already. The glimpses I've had of what it would be like to work and live overseas in the places I temporarily lived have felt like life is taunting me. My best effort with balancing sanity and work performance hasn't been enough to get me where I want to be. I feel like I have failed myself, and to me that is what matters most. Even if I got where I wanted to be, I'm not even sure if I'd be happy, and my quest for happiness seems almost selfish.

I'm an atheist, and I am perfectly OK with being cold and lifeless after I die. I hope they use my organs at least. I don't even want to be buried, I want to be burnt. I'm not about to go kill myself I don't think, not immediately at least. I think about who I'd leave things to based on who needed it the most and what kind of note I'd leave behind. Whether I should translate the instructions. I've gone from suicidal feelings from being impulsive and temporary to being meticulously planned and date TBD when I exhaust my current options. I'm currently on my backup-backup-backup life plan, and unsure where to go from here."

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate, I feel it is far below average salaries for entry level BSMEs in my area (San Jose, Silicon Valley).  

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, Indeed.com, EngineeringSalary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose, CA
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile, 90k median

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing, stock purchase, even education and veterinarian)

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, experiences, data etc. is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, thanks for all the advice everyone.  To fill you all in, I did compile all the information from my research and presented it to my manager.  He was surprised that I was attempting to renegotiate but entirely willing to hear me out and let me say my part.  Basically the gist of the argument was that our company does not fully compensate salaries based on the cost of living adjustment in the area.  There is a small bonus for employees in San Jose ~6%, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.  I'm happy with how this turned out and grateful to all you reddit engineers for giving me the courage to just go for it.

omp6c,2,2012-01-18,Question of what skills to list - Computer Science,diamond29,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/omp6c/question_of_what_skills_to_list_computer_science/,"I'm going to be graduating with a BS in computer science in the spring so I'm getting my resume together now to send out for jobs that are hiring in the summer. I've used maybe a dozen or more languages and frameworks since high school.

My question is, what languages and skills should I be listing on my resume? 

Last semester I did a project with OpenCL and C and I recently just made a simple visual C#.net app to learn a bit about the language and brush up on sql. The only languages I think I really feel comfortable taking interview questions on would be c, c++ and java, but I've used a dozen things like php, ruby, mysql, python, html and c# on projects before and haven't touched them since.

I do feel rather unprepared compared to what I've read on the internet to expect and I am trying to brush up on everything through some side projects. I'm mostly just worried that I will flounder if they ask me some intense php questions or something like that. I feel like my greatest asset is being able to pick up any language relevant to a project and be productive with it.

Another point worth noting...my mother passed away right before last summer break after a long bout with cancer and then my father followed suddenly after. This has definitely had an effect on my coursework/ability to prepare myself for employment, particularly when I had to drop my internship at school to go back home. Should I bring this up in an interview or not? I do think my resume would look different without this happening."

A bit of background:

I am 19. I met this fantastic girl at work (also 19), she was there for a month and we really hit it off. When her internship ended I asked her out and we started dating. That is all nice and sweet. The problem is, she was my intern. Also, my father works for the same company, and her father is my father's supervisor. Naturally, we kept it all secret.

She lived 3 hours away, and because of our schedules, we only saw each other on the weekend and as we got closer and close the pain of being apart got more and more difficult. It was a great relationship, some of the best times of my life, and I know It was special to her too as I was her first boyfriend. 

However, all the distance was causing issues. It led to me being clingier. After about 5 months in, It began to lead into silly little fights on the phone day in and day out. 

We broke it off at the turn of the 6 months. After another round of stupid pointless arguing that evening, over skype. She told me she can't do this anymore and she needs her time and space. I felt heartbroken, we always talked about how difficult it would be but in the end ultimately worth it all. And I felt like her saying she can't carry on anymore was her giving up. It really crushed me.

We kept talking, promising to be friends and all that. However, we met up twice since then (it has been about a month) and both times we acted like a couple. We still talked daily and texted all the time. However, the other day we got into an argument (she didn't want me at her birthday, and all the reasons she gave were terrible, I respected and accepted that but I let her know how much it upset me) and then I proceeded to get very upset. Here is where I fucked up and the shit hit the fan:

When I texted her later, she did not respond, but I kept doing it, I freaked out a little bit on her. It culminated with me telling her that I am going to tell her dad. This is something that would hurt her very much, and I did it anyway. I said it out of anger. 

She called me back right away, she said she was in class. and she said she can't believe I would threaten to hurt her like that, and that I broke her heart. I instantly regretted it, I did not realize quiet how much I hurt her. I apologized profusely but she was hurt too deep. She told me not to contact her, and she told she would contact me when she was ready to be friends (if that happens at all). The last thing she texted me was ""You hurt me, I need space"". I agreed.

I feel like a massive asshole now, and a terrible person. 

So What do I do now? I feel so lost and confused. I love this girl, I want her in my life as a friend or as a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to fix this at all??

**TL;DR: Close relationship fell apart from distance. Tried to be friends. Didn't work out too well. I freaked out, acted like an asshole and hurt her over a text. what do I do now?**

oozvg,1,2012-01-20,SDET vs SDE internships: which one?,netinept,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oozvg/sdet_vs_sde_internships_which_one/,"As background, there is a Microsoft recruiter coming to my campus, and it seems like they have three internships available, two of which I'd be interested in: Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), and Software Development Engineer (SDE).

I currently am a Computer Science Junior and work at my school as a web programmer, coding in C#, .Net, and HTML5 and I love it.

At first glance I thought that of course I wanted to do the SDE, but when I read the descriptions, it seems like the SDET is more suiting to my personality. It sounds like it's more of a problem-solving and people-oriented position than the dark closeted code jockey that is the SDE. Anyhow, here are the details they have on the Microsoft page:

SDET

SDE
http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/tech-software-internships.aspx#urswintern-1

The question:
Does anyone have any experience or knowledge in either position to provide further insight on which might be more enjoyable?

tl;dr: I love to code, would being a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), and Software Development Engineer (SDE) better suit my interests?

Edit: Thank you for responding, I really appreciate it :)"

I'm a college student who's workin/loanin through school.  I'm looking to get a car mainly to get to and from my summer internship, and I have no idea where to begin.  I've done some research but it's so overwhelming, so I thought I should ask some knowledgeable folks 

So from my understanding there's three paths: new, used and lease.  My first reaction is to buy used, but I'm very worried of it being unreliable, as I don't have the money for a ton of repairs on top of everything else!  I've been looking at certified used but they cost nearly as much as new :o  So what do you think the best path for me to take is?  What do you think I should expect in terms of a monthly car payment?

English isn't my native language so sorry for any mistakes, dont really care. I'm just gonna write whatever comes to my mind. I dont expect anyone to read through it or give a shit, you all probably have your own problems.

Also, I'm 19. If you're just gonna say ""you're only 19, it gets better"" - dont bother. It doesn't. 

I graduated a year ago and am now qualified to work with computers. I've been unemployed for a year and have never worked aside from two internships. My parents are alive, they're not alcoholics or drug addicts, just regular upper middle class people. So I guess I dont have any real problems and am just a whining bitch, that's what people keep telling me.

I spend all my unemployment benefits on gambling because its the only thing that makes me feel alive, as retarded as that sounds. I still bet everything even if I almost certainly know I will lose. I still do it. It makes me looks forward to something.

I dont have a reason not to work and I've been going to interviews almost weekly. I always go in as happy and as optimistic a person can be but never get hired. Lately I've been losing motivation and I stopped sending out applications. There must be something wrong with me if I can't even get hired at Mickey Dees.

I have no friends and never really even talked to a female. I dont see how that would change even if I did get a job, so why even bother. I failed at life and its too late to try and fix it now, I have too much catching up to do. I guess if I had a job and money, I could buy a hooker to get rid of my virginity. Maybe that would cheer me up? Probably not. It seems too fake but its also the only choice I have.

I do everything alone. I wake up, fire up the computer and spend the rest of my day online. I dont like to do it and most of the time I just end up listening to music and staring at the monitor for hours. I can't watch movies or television shows anymore because they remind me that there are people out in the world with friends and partners and I will never experience what those people take for granted. I've been trying to tell myself that I can manage alone but I just can't do it anymore. I guess its just human nature. I still live with my parents and its the only reason I'm still alive because I can't imagine sitting alone in a quiet house for 24 hours a day. I would literally go without saying a word for months.

Thanks in advance, Reddit.

You can ignore the rant.

**Rant**
 
~~I hate how America's leaders are either idiots who don't know what they're doing, or saboteurs who know exactly what they're doing.~~ This is probably true in some respect almost everywhere, so disregard.

I hate the American culture, with God being crucial in every significant thing. 

I hate how sex is still taboo, and knowing that any future daughter of mine may be mocked and bullied for being herself.

I hate the fact that gay rights is even a fucking issue. I mean, why the fuck are people still being treated as second class citizens?

I hate knowing that my future kids will have to either struggle with a shitty public school, or be subjected to the bullshit of a private school. 

I hate that the way my parents raised me (which I honestly can't think of any better way) is considered strange, unorthodox and dangerous. 
All of the positive things that we stand for take a backseat to old and outdated thinking. 

I'm just sick of the mindset. The financial problems of anywhere will blow over, I just want to live with people who aren't ignorant about so many things.

Uh... it took only a few seconds. Is this an issue? Sorry, I'm not sure I understand the problem. 

No, I need it to be quicker. It takes too long to open.

Why can't you get a new printer? This thing is so slow and it sucks.

It does 54ppm and we bought it 4 months ago. How long is it taking?

Well, it should be done my 400 page document by the time I get to the printer, right?

No, it will take about 4-5 minutes and you should really be duplexing this.

I have recently switched majors to computer science from chemistry and will likely be completing a BS degree in about 3 years. I'm currently going to a very small lesser-known university and I was wondering If that mattered with respect to future job prospects. Will employers care that i did not attend a top 20 school? Will i be in good shape as long as i frequently work on decent side projects, internships, etc?

I'm also wondering about relocating. Once i graduate, will it be possible to move to a different state with relatively little difficulty? I'm not a huge fan of the city I'm living in now. 

Thanks

otb73,2,2012-01-23,Summer Job vs Internship,garruk66,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/otb73/summer_job_vs_internship/,"Hi. I am 26 year old 2nd year CS/chemistry major in Canada and I'm having difficulty deciding whether to keep my summer job as a forklift driver in a lumber yard or to find a programming internship.


Lumber Yard pros:
- more money and its stable (worked there seven years, am wanted for busy season) $16 for 44 hours per week plus 16 hours of overtime per week at $24
- I get a lot of exercise which I don't do normally (don't play sports, hardly ever go out, never work out)
- Its easy and there is a lot of freedom; no supervision. I can listen to podcasts during the night shift and on weekends.
- not much socializing (I am the epitome of Socially Awkward Penguin)

Lumber Yard cons:
- not much learning
- not meeting new people (I know I have to get over my SAPness, but I am scared to talk to others)
- I am embarrassed to still work there because I don't want to be seen as a ""lifer"". I started going to university six years ago (told everyone I wanted to become a doctor) but I am only in my second year because I failed two years, took two years off to save money, and lied about going to university for two years while I played WoW). I told everyone at work I am graduating this year.

Programming Internship pros:
-learning experience
-more interesting and fun; I want to become a developer

Programming Internship cons:

I wanted to ask you guys. I am learning about WCF and still trying to get my head around it the main concepts. What I ultimately need to do is use a form I created that will display some *endpoints* in a listbox, then allow the user to upload a selected file by clicking a button.

I was wondering if you guys know any good articles on this topic or have any tips. I watched the 4+ hours of training on Pluralsight.com, ""Introduction to WCF"" already.

If I have time, I'd love to really add that *wow* factor and add some drag&amp;drop functionality in outlook, where users can drag messages from the inbox into the form to upload with the WCF. But I'll have to do the first part before I can mess around with that.

January 23, 2012

REDACTED NAME, MA

REDACTED TITLE

Police Foundation

1201 Connecticut Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20036


Dear REDACTED, 

I am excited to be applying for an internship at The Police Foundation. I am currently a junior at the REDACTED University, working towards my B.A. in Criminal Justice and B.S. in Physics. Due to my unique skillset I believe I would be a valuable asset to the Police Foundation as an intern.


Through my studies in criminal justice, I have gained a background in various aspects of the field and would love the opportunity to broaden my knowledge and gain real-world experience in the workforce. I have an especially in-depth knowledge of the subject of mass imprisonment through my research and work on the topic with Professor REDACTED. Through this work I have learned how to successfully conduct meaningful research, a skill, which I believe will be invaluable for this position. Although the focus of Professor REDACTED’s research is the effect of mass imprisonment on prisoners, I have also learned a great deal about the people working in the field and would love to learn more about the police and related personnel by working at the Police Foundation.   

I also believe that my international background has given me a unique perspective on the US Justice System, and would personally be interested to learn how the systems compare on a more detailed level. 

I am highly organized, with meticulous attention to detail, which is particularly advantageous when conducting researchm. When I am interested in a subject, I immerse myself in researching the topic and its context. Even when I am not actively engaged directly in work, I subconsciously commit my focus to the job.

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration. 


Sincerely, 

REDACTED

After this semester, I will have completed COMP 202, 206, 250, 252, and 273 - standard U1 courses. I haven't taken on any personal CS projects (I only recently got interested in CS actually), so my depth of knowledge is basically U1 level. 

I'd really like to get a CS-related job this summer. But I'm well aware of the fact that I have very little programming knowledge, and would be next to useless to an employer. My CV also looks bad, because of my lack of experience (I volunteered at some charity clubs in high school...)

Despite this, I'd love to find some work this summer. I'd absolutely love some actual experience (and, you know, money to pay off tuition would be nice)

Do I have any chance of getting an actual job with my very little CS knowledge? How should I go about finding work? Any recommendations of good sites with internship listings? Any tips or advice at all would be helpful"

I'm a computer science student who is closer to a degree in philosophy (which I'm much more interested in studying). Lately I've been sort of anxious about the amount of time and money I feel like I'm wasting in school for CS with no satisfaction. I love working in programming and solving problems, but the program at my University has me entirely jaded about the going to school for it. I'm a software dev. intern for a small company right now which employs two college drop-outs in the IT department of about 10 people. (One in systems and one in software). One of those 10 is also a college grad with a humanities degree, although he is going to grad school for comp sci currently.

I'm not sure how much of an anomaly my company is in this regard, since it's the only one I've worked for, so I'm wondering if anyone has stories/info about their own workplace.

I'm leaning toward finishing my Philosophy degree, feeling more fulfilled with school, and seeing where it takes me. Perhaps this company will keep me on if they feel I've been doing a good job, or perhaps they will let me go if I'm less of a ""potential hire"" for the future? However, they're also looking to expand so maybe they'd be excited to see me graduate sooner? Out of the two interns they employ, they often give me the more challenging, project-oriented problems.

Anyway, I'm not looking for advice regarding my current employment situation, as obviously (whatever I decide) I'd have to talk things through with them to know for sure what things would be like there. But I'd like to know what you guys think about hiring/working with someone with a degree in non-CS, and my chances of pursuing a career in CS if I decide to finish up my humanities degree instead."

I recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, which included a GIS certificate.  I managed to land an internship with a state agency doing GIS work, but unfortunately it hasn't presented many learning opportunities to this point (most of my tasks involve digitizing data; really simple stuff that anyone could be shown how to do in a few minutes).  I've realized I need to take it upon myself to learn some new skills if I want to turn this into a career, but I have no idea where to begin.

One of my biggest questions is (and this may be a dumb one) - what can I actually DO with GIS?  My college coursework was pretty much limited to making maps, and all my work experience has basically just been digitizing data for the use of others.  To make this question simpler, say I want to work with GIS but I also want to stay in the environmental field.  What kind of job could I get, and what kind of projects might I work on?

My other problem, somewhat tied with the first, comes from my observation that every GIS job seems to have different requirements beyond simple knowledge of GIS.  Going back to my previous question, in such a position as what I'm looking for, what kind of skills might be necessary for me to be a valuable member of a company?  To make answering this a bit easier, here's a general list of what I know and don't know:

* Basic knowledge of ArcGIS, including: digitizing files, editing data, very limited experience working with spatial, network, and 3d analyst, preparation of maps, some familiarity with some of the data management tools, and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head.

* I don't know Python.  How important is it to learn this?

* I have no database management skills.  I've started poking around with Access just to develop some kind of experience, but nothing beyond that.

* I don't know any programming languages, although I'm not at all afraid to learn some (as a kid I taught myself basic HTML for fun; I'm sure if it were necessary I could learn VBA or C).



I've poked around ESRI's site and looked at some of their training resources, but I wasn't sure which would be useful to me (plus I'm certainly not going to pay for any unless I'm sure I'll get something valuable from it).  I feel if I had a better understanding of what I should know, it would make learning those skills a lot easier for me. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

Little did I know there would be a guest speaker there telling me about the greatest summer internship a human being going to college could possibly acquire. I could make thousands of dollars in a single summer AND get invaluable experience that would help me succeed in my future endeavors. [Seems like the perfect opportunity, right?](http://troll.me/images/futurama-fry/seems-legit.jpg) That's what I thought too.

Anyways, they hand out these little sheets of paper to the whole lecture hall, and me, being the driven individual I am, quickly filled it out and passed it to the left ([not the right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtLONl4cNc)). It asked for some simple things like my name, my major, my year, my phone number, if I had a car, where I would be living in the summer. I figured I might have to do some driving and what not, I was okay with this.

A few nights later I'm surfing with my bro on Counter Strike, and I get this phone call from a guy who asked if I was still interested in the internship and would like to ask me a few basic questions. Being the college freshmen I am, I eagerly answered all of his questions. He asked me things like what am I going to do in the future, what field would it be in, why I would be a good candidate for this internship, etc. He then told me that I was qualified to attend one of the ""info sessions"" which would be held the next day. Three things stuck out about this phone call now that I think about it; first, I barely gave him any information about myself for him to say that I was ""qualified"" to attend an info session, second, why is he calling me at 9 PM the night before to question me and inform me of a meeting the next day, and lastly, why am I meeting up for this ""info session"" at the Bruin Bear not at the Career Center or some other legit place like that. Oh and then at the end of the phone call he asks me to promise him that I will show up. I swear he asked me this at least 4 times. Either way, I didn't give this any thought at the time.

The time for the info session rolls around and I put on my spiffy pant-shirt combo and head over to the bear. I find him because he told me he was going to be standing there with a white binder (this screams [legit](http://themavesite.com/TMS-Pictures/Epic/SeemsLegitToMe.jpg) at me). We end up walking to Ackerman Union (a quieter place to talk) with 2 other students who did the same thing as me to have the ""info session"". Now that I look back on this, its sketchy as fuck, but none of the clues registered or clicked in my eager little head. We sit down and again start talking about our future goals, life plans, and things of that nature. I go with the flow and like anyone who's giving their first interview in college, I'm [bullshitting left and right](http://i736.photobucket.com/albums/xx6/Frozenith/Everywhere%20MEME/EverywhereMEME-Bullshit.jpg). I'm wasn't lying about anything I did of course, but I start pulling words out my ass that I've only ever ~~used~~ seen once before in my life. But that's besides the point. 

Out of the three of us, I end up getting picked to go to this ""first interview"". I was absolutely ecstatic. I walked out of there like a [fucking BOSS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4gtaMq2l1qfmplv.gif). I get back and somehow only tell a few special people about it. I wanted to keep it a secret until I actually got it, but at the same time wanted everyone to know. 

ANWAYS, heres where it gets interesting. I google College Works Painting. And before I even hit enter Google says ""Hmm, maybe you wanted to search College Works Painting scam?"" I told him ""Scam? What scam? This shit is LEGIT. I just got thi-"" ""No."" I told him to calm down and Google'd it anyway. I spend the next 3 hours reading reviews and doing some intense research about this internship. Turns out its a **fucking scam**. 

One of the many sites I read: [College Confidential](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/internships-careers-employment/395121-collegeworks-painting.html)

Actual Site: [Fucking Scam Company That Exploits Young Aspiring College Students For $$$](http://www.collegeworks.com/)

At first I was mad, and then my friend gave me this brilliant idea: ask Reddit for ideas on trolling the VP that was going to do my first interview or the actual guy who called me and did my info session. So Reddit, any ideas?

**tl;dr** Got super excited about getting an interview for a seemingly prestigious internship; turns out its a scam. An opportunity arises to get back at them. Need ideas however. Fast. 

EDIT: I have the original recruiter's phone number and I have an interview set up with his VP on Thursday morning. Anything is helpful!"

I'm wasn't lying about anything I did of course, but I start pulling words out my ass that I've only ever ~~used~~ seen once before in my life. But that's besides the point. 

Out of the three of us, I end up getting picked to go to this ""first interview"". I was absolutely ecstatic. I walked out of there like a [fucking BOSS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4gtaMq2l1qfmplv.gif). I get back and somehow only tell a few special people about it. I wanted to keep it a secret until I actually got it, but at the same time wanted everyone to know. 

ANWAYS, heres where it gets interesting. I google College Works Painting. And before I even hit enter Google says ""Hmm, maybe you wanted to search College Works Painting scam?"" I told him ""Scam? What scam? This shit is LEGIT. I just got thi-"" ""No."" I told him to calm down and Google'd it anyway. I spend the next 3 hours reading reviews and doing some intense research about this internship. Turns out its a **fucking scam**. 

One of the many sites I read: [College Confidential](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/internships-careers-employment/395121-collegeworks-painting.html)

Actual Site: [Fucking Scam Company That Exploits Young Aspiring College Students For $$$](http://www.collegeworks.com/)

At first I was mad, and then my friend gave me this brilliant idea: ask Reddit for ideas on trolling the VP that was going to do my first interview or the actual guy who called me and did my info session. So Reddit, any ideas?

**tl;dr** Got super excited about getting an interview for a seemingly prestigious internship; turns out its a scam. An opportunity arises to get back at them. Need ideas however. Fast. 

EDIT: I have the original recruiter's phone number and I have an interview set up with his VP on Thursday morning. Anything is helpful!"

TL;DR version:

For years Sashi has had excruciating in her abdomen, but doctors have only recently figured out what's wrong. She has large (LARGE) cysts growing around her ovaries which is affecting multiple internal organs. She is dying and needs a surgery which will cost thousands of dollars. Her friends have set up a Tumblr account where you can learn more and perhaps even donate a couple dollars. http://donateforsashi.tumblr.com

From the website: 

“Ever since she was a kid, she’s been suffering from chronic pain on her abdomen, getting worse over the years, getting fucked over by doctors who dis-diagnosed her or flat out told her she was “lying” about her pain just to get pain killers.
After years of awful symptoms, trying to figure out whats wrong, ER visits when she couldn’t bear with the pain anymore, having to rush everytime to the hospital, she has finally been diagnosed with a severe case of Endometriosis, which requires a big surgery that also requires to remove her ovaries that are practically all covered in several tumors the size of big oranges, even she feels the stiffness on her tummy.
Endometriosis consists in cysts (in her case of 8cm) growing around her ovaries and affecting intestines and several organs.
Up-to date, she’s 24, had to quit her job (and therefore having no insurance) because she can barely move anymore. She has developed several other side problems from this disease, she can’t eat because there’s literally no room in her intern organs to proceed any food anymore.
As much as it hurts to type down and as tears well up in my eyes,
She’s dying.
She’s been slowly dying in front of my eyes for the past years of fighting.
After trying several times to get medi-cal, today she got denial again because according to the government she doesn’t count as a “disabled” person.
saving her life is up to a surgery that would cost thousands of dollars, I am uncertain exactly how much, I’m researching that right now, been researching all night, trying to find out some solutions; but if she finally could afford this surgery she’d be able to…start to live again.
Though, is sweet of the person above me that talked about donations, Sashi herself is reluctant of donations because the surgery is really, really expensive and its true, it would require a LOT of work/donations to get to any near goal. 
I don’t want her to die and keep going through this, I would do anything that is in my hands to help her. To prove her wrong, to show her we care. I am writing this against her will because she would not want to sound “needy” or calling for attention for anyone. she’s always willing to help others with their problems, but she’s too fucking nice to ask for help for herself, she feels uncomfortable with this stuff. But, still. I need to write this. And its why she needs to keep on living, because she doesn’t deserve this at all, she’s the last person I know that would deserve this.
Can you take a minute to reblog, spread the word, and help us with any information you may have on some insurance or coverage she could get (medi-cal isn’t an option anymore, she’s been denied many times) maybe some of you know someone, or know about this stuff, hell, maybe there are some doctors out here. Maybe some answers are out there. Is worth a try, anything you can help her with.”

Hey everyone, My name is Chris (24) (if you couldn't tell by the username) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma..

 My now-fiance (22) and I are getting married in June, we've been dating for about 2.5 years, we both love video games, guns, internetz, and anything that involves being a nerd.

Right now we're living with her parents because we moved down here on a whim that I would score a job at the local school district as an IT Technician.. well.. I didn't get the job, and I had left my previous job since it was about 70 miles away.

My fiance left her job also since we moved and is getting screwed by her unpaid internship.. she's filling a woman's spot at the city jailhouse as an UNPAID internship that THANKFULLY she gets college credits for. Sadly, her getting paid for that isn't looking good, as they're cutting the budget which isn't fair because she's doing EXACTLY what that woman did (and better).

After a few months of job hunting (and getting a job as a pc repairman/salesman at a popular office supply store), I decided that I wanted to join the Air Force, they'd give me the training I need, would help me start my family, and I over all just wanted to be a part of something BIG and serve my country. I've been training for about 2.5 months and have already lost 25 pounds, I've only got about 30-40 more to go before they'll actually enlist me.

To get to the point - I'd love to be able to take her to a place where we can both be happy, we've had a rough 6 months and it really won't get better until I get in the Air Force. I really want to take her to DisneyWorld and Universal Studios, and stay in a nice hotel. That's really all we ask.

Right now, my mom is helping to pay for some of the honeymoon, but I REALLY don't like her doing that. She works for FedEx driving 18-wheelers in a city environment and she works DAMN hard for her money. SHE deserves that money. My mom is the type of woman who would give me the shirt off her back if it meant I could sleep warm.

All I'm asking is a few dollars to help pay for this honeymoon. It would mean the WORLD to us!

I've been trying to think of ways to thank people for donations.. and I think I've got a Reddit-Solution.

For every donation 20 dollars or more, we will take a picture (not nudes :) ) of your choosing. Whether it's us kissing on a ride, me giving Mickey Mouse a high five, or shanking a mascot and blaming it on the janitor. We'll try our BEST to get every single picture  in. It should be fun!

I'm not sure what I need to do to prove to everyone that I'm not some scammer or douche trying to take people's money. I guess we can take pictures of us holding up a handwritten sign or something. She's sleeping and I'm about to go to bed (have to be at work..on a saturday.. at 8 ) so we can take them eventually. I'll give a link to some pictures of us in text form.

I'll use my PayPal address since it's Business Verified (I used to run my own Game Console Repair business) if anybody wants to throw a few dollars our way. But really any sort of donation will be **SO MUCH** appreciated!

Here's some pictures of us for now until we're both back together so we can take some verified pictures.

Almost done with college and no idea what I actually want to do.,negative_epsilon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p202n/question_on_the_it_industry_almost_done_with/,"I know that not knowing what you want to do with the rest of your life isn't something to be worried about-- I've gotten that speech before. But I have absolutely no idea what I actually want to do. I have interests that range from music composition to database administration, from philosophy to combinatorics, from journalism to political science. My major is in mathematics because for the longest time I was dead set on going to grad school and becoming a professor, but in the last year or so that dream has died and a whole wide range of fields are in front of me; here I am with no idea what to choose.

I love analytics and problem solving (Otherwise I wouldn't be a math major, I suppose). I got my A+ Cert at 16 because I was in love with the idea of working with computers for the rest of my life, and my job right now is officially a student assistant for my university, but I'm building and managing databases in Access (Thus, I'm really good with VBA and have a little experience with MySQL) for the college. 

I'm minoring in statistics, and right now I'm kind of on an actuarial path. But I've heard horror stories of not being able to get into that field... and what if I really miss coding? Helping my friends with computer problems is still a pretty big joy in my life. I'm totally scrambled. My GPA is shit low, too (2.9), and that doesn't help me get internships. One thing I've thought about is becoming a Microsoft certified database admin, but are there jobs for database admins right now? Is that really a certification that people respect, or is it something that college students do when they have no real world experience?

Sorry I rambled. Any help is appreciated.

**tl;dr- Math major with no direction, is the MCDBA worth it if I really enjoy that?**"
p1wac,1,2012-01-29,Put off career goals? Or try to make them happen now?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p1wac/put_off_career_goals_or_try_to_make_them_happen/,"**Here’s my problem**: I’m a recent graduate who is unemployed and can’t secure a paying job in my field (one in a million, right?) So far I’ve done internships and freelancing on my own. My technical skills combined with my experience easily qualify me for the entry/junior level jobs I see posted in my field BUT the problem is none of these jobs are in my locality, they’re in New York and I live an hour outside of it.
 
Recruiters seem reluctant to hire an out-of-state candidate, as I’ve been applying like crazy and got only two interviews for all my efforts. One I didn’t get the job for because they went with another candidate and for the other I’m still on the fence.

Of course I have my parents, student loans, and a credit card to pay back too. I was able to put all but one of my loans in deferment till late summer/early fall and got the credit card company to hold off on my payments for a couple months at no additional cost or interest. Mom and dad are letting me stay at home for as long as I need to, but they have their own stuff to take care of and I feel guilty for tacking my bills onto their expenses.

**Here are my two ideas to resolve the problem**:

*Start using a friend/relative’s address on my resume, try to get interviews, tell HR ‘I’m relocating soon’ if they ask, and commute to work every day if I land a job.
(I think:  the most expensive to begin with, but should level out by mid-spring. By then I can probably sort out my finances for fall when all my loans go back into repayment. Plus, I’ll have the industry experience right off the bat.)

Or

*Take a retail or coffee job in my local area, save up money, move to New York, then start my career plans.
(I think:  the least expensive begin with, but will put off my experience for 7 mos. – 1.5 years, by which time my loans will all go back into repayment, will have to use the cash I save to pay them back plus current debts and relocation costs, etc. etc.)


Thoughts on which of these would be the better option? Or would you suggest I do something else entirely?

Thanks!

Unfortunately, I do not have anyone to talk to about how I should think about structuring the second half of my undergrad to best position myself coming out the other side. That's why I came here.

I've got a very solid GPA in and out of major and I'm involved in a relatively small research group (no experience required) right now. Coming in to college I had zero experience in CS so my body of knowledge is probably a bit smaller than your stereotypical CS kid.

Due to circumstances out of my control, this summer is not suitable for internships. It is too short for a full program and I am not going to take a quarter off, so I didn't apply when that time came around. 

My plan right now is to finish up the project I'm currently working on and search for some more serious research positions to buff my resume through the end of this year, the coming short summer, and my junior year. When the time comes to apply for next year's summer internships, I feel like I should have enough practical experience to make myself a worthwhile candidate. 

So that's my plan right now. I'd like to get some input from those who have been in my position though, because I feel like I'm way behind the game due to not being able to take an internship this summer and having a smaller pool of knowledge coming into college.

I received a notice about a job through a mailing list at my school earlier this month, so I sent in my resume because it looked like a great opportunity, but I didn't really expect a response. Earlier this week they emailed me and asked for an interview. I'm not really panicking--I've been through interviews before and I know that being nervous doesn't help me any. But I haven't been through enough that I know what to expect from the interviewer. Each time has been a wholly different experience. But my biggest problem is and has always been asking questions. I can usually answer them just fine, but I'm really terrible at asking my own questions. I'm not sure why, I just seem to have to process the things they're saying a bit longer than the interview time-span. I also don't fully understand post-interview etiquette. My last interview didn't go very well, and the interviewer told me she'd call me whether they wanted me or not, so that I wouldn't be left wondering. She never called (it's been almost 2 months) and I never called or did anything because I thought I was supposed to be waiting to be contacted.

Anyway, here's a **tl;dr** list of questions for you:

* **What questions should I ask?**
* What questions might I expect?
* What should I do after the interview?

p4cva,1,2012-01-31,Will a bad grade history affect me for internship? How can I fight it?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p4cva/will_a_bad_grade_history_affect_me_for_internship/,"Hi Reddit, 

 I want to begin by saying i'm applying for an engineering internship with a NASA program. Recently, I became alarmed when I looked at my grades from a bad year during my College Sophomore year. I'm talking about a year where I failed one semester of classes which brought my GPA from a 3.2 to a 2.5. In reflection, I remember a time where i wasn't motivated to do work. I felt shitty when a CERTAIN event took place, and that affected my performance in school. After that incident, I took two years off from school to travel the world so i could forget. 



I signed up with a non-profit organization and helped with projects in different cities in Mexico, USA, and the Philippines. I lead many projects, and became involved with their communities. I loved every minute of it. I helped with engineering related tasks by building wood bridges, and fixing cars, and creating other mechanisms that helped the community, and building homes. At that moment, I reignited the engineer within me. So, I ended up finding all the books related to my major and studied outside of the classroom. I met wonderful teachers who didn't have credentials but were so fucking smart to understand the theories. I learned from them and developed my understanding in those areas. For two years, I traveled and studied. At the end of my travel, I realized that i needed to return to finish my duty as a student. So, I returned home to work as a tutor until i regained enough funds to pay for college again.



Now, i'm back in school. I'm fighting an uphill battle with my GPA. If anyone tells you employers don't look at your grades, they are right until you try finding internships in technical related fields. Anyway, I regret that one year with a passion. Most of the internships that i'm applying to require a 3.0GPA; I have the smarts, but i don't know how to get around this GPA business. What can I do or write that can give me an equal opportunity for a job/internship position? Employers what do you look for and what suggestions can you make for a person in my situation? "

I'm about to start an internship that involves a lot of heavy graphics programming in python. The laptop I currently have does not have a graphics card, and I don't know if this will have any effect on the speed or functionality of the programs on my computer. Should I get a graphics card, or will I be OK without it?"
