we knew each other 10 yrs ago in high school. she was my first real crush.  i thought she was so unique and bold, and just so damn special.  we got to know each other back then and we became close.  nothing romantic, only platonic.  but i was okay with that.  i respected her.  we went our separate ways for college, out-of-state and out-of-country. after high school ended, my crush ended.  i dated in college.  maybe every 1-2 i'd recall elizabeth and smile, thinking 'ah yea, she was cool.  i wonder what she's up to.'  we randomly met up 2 yrs ago, and our intended 30 minute catch-up lunch lasted 16 hrs, ending at 4am.  in fact, i had to catch a flight back out to california (grad school) in just a few hours.  but, that night, she fell hard for me.  i was trying not to fall for her, but did.  i cannot explain to you how good it felt to kiss her.

she then went to indonesia and i did grad school in california. i buy plane tickets for us to meet up every 3 months. we talk on phone 1 hr daily. after 1 yr, i fly to indonesia and propose on the beach of bali at sunset. it was all good... it's been amazing. but, our religious differences are really starting to take a toll on the relationship. it's sad that this is the case, i know.

her 1 yr work visa in indonesia just expired, and she just returned to the states this week. she moved in with her grandmother, 1,000 miles from me. so we are still long distance until we get married. :-(

there are basically 2 draining factors on our relationship: (1) she has no care at all towards anything professional, and i'm at the opposite end of the spectrum. i've very goal oriented and finally landed my dream research job in boston, after 7 yrs of working my butt off in universities. (2) our religious differences mean a lot to her, and little to me.

so, i'm in this position where my life is set. i am the city i want to be, with the job i want, and with the girl i want. but, her life is completely contingent on mine; having just moved back to the states, she's in this temporary position of being in a state just for a few months until we get married, at which point she'll move up to boston with me. until then, she'll at best get some temp job and will have a boring life there. i tried arguing my case for her to move to boston, even though co-habitation is out of the picture. but she can't support herself. sadly, i can't afford to pay her hypothetical-boston rent either, as i'm already paying $1,600/month rent.

she's visiting in 2 days.

i've dated girls and have had a handful of experiences. so, i'm not quite hanging on out of desperation or attention or anything like that. i really believe we go together and mesh very well. it's just these underlying huge issues of what we believe in and are passionate about that are the issues. our interactions, sense of humor, outlook on life, overall demeanor, and way of carrying ourselves are all very well matched.

oh, it should be noted that prior to this relationship, i was dating a 27 yr old professor. we met during an internship and did the long distance for 1.5 yrs. she didn't believe in sex-before-marriage. she was agnostic, surprisingly.

i've been in a relationship with my fiance for 1.5 yrs now. so, no sex for the last 3 years. with this said, i feel as if boston is a headquarters for young, thriving adults, and maybe i could find someone who could better suit me. i admit, i sometimes daydream about going out friday nights to a local bar, picking up a girl, and going back with her to my apartment which is within walking distance to everything.

what do you guys think of all of this?

EDIT: i had no idea this many people would read my long story and care to respond.  thanks for all the advice, criticism, and support.  this was my first post on reddit, and man you guys are awesome.  well, i'm picking her up from the airport in a few hours, so i won't be checking this thread during her week-long visit, haha.  if anyone cares to hear how it goes, i'll give details in a week by writing them below this very text.  thanks!"
