24ewa5,0,2014-04-30,First Summer Internship. Any Advice?,Quanticks,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/24ewa5/first_summer_internship_any_advice/,"Thought I should post here to get the advice from experienced engineers.

Next week I will be starting my first internship (4 months) in the engineering field. It is a field job (oil and gas), and I have never done anything like this before. 

The internship is with a large known Canadian company, and I would like to secure another internship with them for next year as well. So I am looking for useful advice.

Lots of people tell me to ask lots of questions as it shows interest. Anything else I should actively be doing?"

I mean...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6fqm5?context=5)|We just released his EP and he's also part of the Low Pros project.

Do you guys still keep in touch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cf4z?context=5)|Definitely keep in touch with the gawd.

Brought it back to the funk, and also the history! Teaching young'n's about Nile, Moroder, etc. And I don't expect them to listen to dance music at home. Last time I saw Guy-Man we spoke about Dennis Wilson (humble brag). 
[I just saw you at counterpoint (I had the my parents think I'm at a church retreat sign\) and am counting down the days until I get to see you again at Terminal 5!

[Ghost Producing, have you, would you or do you engage in it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgt3?context=5)|The hot topic of the moment!!! Nah it was always important for me to know how to do everything because I'm a control freak. There's been some remixes where I've hired an engineer and it's always credited. I think this ghost-producing thing needs to be defined: the GHOST part is if it's hidden, uncredited. So either I do the whole thing myself (including mixdown), or if I'm in a time crunch I work with an engineer and credit them too. 
[Can we get a Diplo/Dillon Francis/Skrillex/A-trak song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cue4?context=5)|I'm down.

[I remember you switched to Traktor about a year ago but noticed in some recent pics that you've been using Serato again along with the DDJ-SP1. Why'd you switch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgqa?context=5)|I really like both platforms. I'm digging Serato's new DJ software so I wanted to mess with it. Traktor is really powerful, one of the few letdowns is the file management, you kind of have 2 libraries. So right now I'm enjoying the ease of Serato. But I could use both.
[Oh yeah, what's the name of the style of hat you're always wearing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgqa?context=5)|Hat: I dunno, I buy it where old folks buy their hats in NY.

[Will you teach me how to YOLO scratch? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6chuf?context=5)|You have to sign an NDA first.

 |Freddie Gibbs: we've been talking :) 
[I know you produce some stuff for other Fool's Gold artists, I really dug the production you did on Danny Brown's ""Smokin &amp; Drinkin"", what was it like to work with Danny? did you have creative control  in terms of the production or did he pitch in? Will you be touring with him perhaps anytime soon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6fa2r?context=5)|I played Danny some beats and he picked that one. Then I reworked it around his vocals!

I agree with your hunch that the versace scratch would defeat this FORMIDABLE opponent, because he would be so stunned by the flyness. 
[DJ Craze on an interview said that he was excited to have you on The Allies because he knew that then you will not have to face you... Where you feeling the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cvyq?context=5)|Hahah yes EXACTLY.

Heads Will Roll, Sebastien Tellier, Boys Noize, etc. I think the biggest challenge of learning to produce while actively DJing was not having much time to learn the ropes. I always played all my demos to my brother, he gave me great feedback along the way. Still does. 
[Ever had anything go disastrously wrong while performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cfo5?context=5)|OH YES.

Any cool stories from hanging out backstage or while performing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6hr8k?context=5)|It was actually a hectic day. We were only in NY for a couple hours, we had to fly to Chicago later in the afternoon to play 2 (!!) more shows that night. It was raining so the concert kept getting delayed. We rehearsed with the Roots during sound check literally as the band was learning the songs. It was all on a whim. I wish we could have stuck around to see Dead Prez, Badu etc but we were gone.

Armand and I met and starting going on hiking trips in the wilderness. One time I saw him start a fire using his bare hands. After that we formed a group.

Brother bean Flagstaff, AZ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6dbsz?context=5)|That's so dope man, thank for the continued support over the years.

24exxb,6,2014-04-30,Am I employable yet? How should I be using my time?,browe404,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/24exxb/am_i_employable_yet_how_should_i_be_using_my_time/,"Hello Reddit,

I recently graduated from East Carolina University in December 2013 with a BA in Computer Science. My road to graduation has been long and hard, having been involved in multiple car accidents and surgeries along the way, and it took me 6 years to get my Bachelor's (3 at community college, 3 at University).

I had to work 30-35 hours a week as a 3rd shift delivery driver during college to make ends meet, and as a result, didn't have much opportunity for networking or side projects. I applied to internships and never got a single call-back or interview.

Now, I work part-time doing light front-end development for an e-commerce site ( www.sizzlefish.com ) and attend meetups whenever possible (nice to have a normal work/sleep schedule again!). I started learning Ruby/Ruby on Rails on my own during the summer before my last semester, and built myself a portfolio site, which I later scrapped in favor of a different version.

Since graduating, I've built portfolio sites for myself and my coworker at www.brian-rowe.com and www.reidbeaman.com , both with Ruby on Rails. I wrote a small calculator with AngularJS to help me split up my checks from the e-commerce job into their accounts at contraculator-browe.rhcloud.com , and I'm working on a game for a fellow Redditor using Node/Express/KeystoneJS as the backend and AngularJS as the frontend at guessthefilm.herokuapp.com . I spend almost all of my free time studying web development, coding, or reading books such as ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""

I'm extremely anxious about finding my first ""real"" job and would appreciate some advice on how to best approach it. I'm running out of money since my hours got cut at the part-time webdev job and it'll only be a few months without something better before I end up back at my parent's house, 2.5 hours from the nearest major city with .5M internet.

I feel like my projects aren't really substantial enough to get me noticed. Though I enjoy attending meetups, a meetup relevant to my interests only seems to come along once or twice a month, and the time for networking is very small compared to the time for presentations and driving back and forth to the meetup.

I like working with: HTML/HAML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap/Foundation/Gumby, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, KeystoneJS
I'm interested in learning more about NodeJS and Express without Keystone, as well as delving deeper into the above technologies. However, I'm not picky about whether I end up doing front-end or back-end development (or both) at this point, as I'll likely continue to learn both either way. 

Is my portfolio good enough? Should I worry about overhauling my existing projects or trying to come up with more? How does my linkedin look? www.linkedin.com/in/brianrowe42/ 
Is my code decent? www.github.com/brian-rowe

Should I worry more about github commits or meeting people? How can I meet people more efficiently with relevant meetups being few and far between? Is applying online a waste of time or a legit way of landing a job? Should I bother talking to recruiters? I'll edit this if I can think of anything else to ask...

Thanks for reading,
Brian"
24ezh7,1,2014-04-30,How likely is it for my internship to be paid?,v4sk0,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/24ezh7/how_likely_is_it_for_my_internship_to_be_paid/,"I interviewed today at small healthcare marketing company (~60 employees) and landed an IT internship. The interview was very informal and the head (and only) IT/systems admin pretty much went over what kinda of projects we would be working on over the summer, it was short and sweet. However, he did not mention anything about the pay when he offered me the position. I'm worried that it won't be paid. I know the money isn't everything and that the knowledge I'll gain is much more valuable, but being a college student, money is tight. Later today, I got an email from HR that included a generic employment application. The application does have a spot for desired salary. 

I know it's awkward to ask if it is paid or unpaid, is there a good way of going about this? If it turns out to be unpaid, is it acceptable to ask for it to be paid? I've read in this sub before that engineers should not take unpaid internships. Just want to hear some of your thoughts on this and what experiences you've had."

I have no experience relevant work experience.  My only work experience is 2.5 years as a cashier at a major retail store. I quit my job as a Junior because I got tired of working there and wanted to enjoy some free time. I've enjoyed the free time and now have too much free time and no income.

I am thinking a either getting a Masters in Mechanical Engineering or a second bachelors in Computer Science. The only reason I want to go back to school really is to take advantage of internships so I can get relevant work experience and possibly a internship to full time hire type. Most of my friends/classmates I've kept up with who have no internship experience don't have a job either and my friends that did get internships do.

My thought process is that a Masters in M.E. will get me a higher degree and I can hopefully get an internship as a student to ride it to a full time job. Based on job search experience a CS degree seems to be a good choice and getting a job might be easier. Also, I did take two extra programming courses for fun while I was a student and enjoyed them.

I don't know which decision is better for getting employed. Of course if I do get a job before school starts I'll probably throw my plan away."

It also looks like I have a for sure internship at a large company in the area next summer due to someone I know in the company helping me out.

Any veterans here who can help?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24fjm2/frustrated_sde_here_any_veterans_here_who_can_help/,"**TL;DR:** *Fresh graduate with no previous experience; started working on a huge project; finding it hard to understand the large code base; recently had performance assessment and it came out bad. Too ""slow"" at getting things done. What do?*  

I graduated in August and got my dream job in one of the Big Four tech companies. I call it my dream job because the service my team works on is at the bleeding edge of tech, it aligns perfectly with my interests, and I work with *very intelligent* people.  

This is also my first full time job and I had absolutely no previous experience before this - not even an internship.  

1. Before starting this job, all the projects I had worked on were very small and hardly complex.
2. I had been involved in those projects since their inception. I knew the entire code base.
3. If I needed help, I could ask my professors/classmates.

Now, however, I'm working on this *gargantuan* distributed system with a very complex code base. Millions of lines of code with layers over layers *over layers of interleaved classes and interfaces*. Multiple threads running everywhere and *fuck* I have no idea what I'm doing.  
I spend most of my time navigating through code, trying to understand what is happening. I realized that keeping a mental track of every thing is just not possible. I keep forgetting what objects I had where and what objects they were made of... I've resorted to taking notes, but despite that I lose track of things. There are so many layers of function calls and objects, I can never reach the boundary of the code base (if that makes sense). There's always another object I don't know of and when I try to investigate what it's supposed to do, I find that it's made of of 10 other objects I never knew existed. *Ughh...*  

As far as I know, I am the only one in my team without any previous experience and most of my team mates have been working on the project since it began. They just seem to know every thing inside out. Asking for help is ~~kind of looked down upon~~ discouraged.  

So anyway, I had my performance review done recently, and it's not good. I was told that I am slow in delivering results and I seek too much help.  

*Help?*  

**Edit:** Maybe I should have been more clear in my post. I know it sounds like a rant, and it partly is. But to be specific, I'd like to know what experienced developers do to understand the details of code they haven't seen before. Are there tools that I could use (apart from what IDEs usually offer)? Are there any *tricks* to it? Or is this just one of those things that comes with experience and I should just power through?"

I have a problem. A pretty big problem, but a really good problem.

So, I just graduated with a BS in Electromechanical engineering with a minor in computer science and a breadth of personal projects involving embedded computer systems and firmware development. I've applied to a number of positions and have been getting deep into the interview process for 3 positions simultaneously and I'm getting to the point where I don't know which to choose. My degree allows me to be a fully functional electrical or mechanical engineer but I love developing software and working with electrical engineering on the digital hardware side of things (developing firmware, etc). 

The first position is at a company that develops x-ray contraband detection equipment for border control, airports, etc. This job is pretty cool and I did a couple of internships there. The pay is good but it's a pretty standard electrical engineering job. The facilities are nice and the work they do is really neat and it would be challenging but I fear that I'd grow bored.

The second job, is at Bose. I'd be picking up a software engineering position developing software for fine tuning the sound systems in luxury automobiles. This is cool because again, I love software. Also, I'm a big music lover and love DSP stuff. I've built a couple of my own analog synthesizers for fun so I could definitely see myself getting into this job.

The third job is a startup. This is the primary hangup I've been having. I've interviewed a number of times with this startup (they have a cool idea for home automation). There are only 3 people currently at the company. The CEO sold an app to amazon two years ago, perhaps you've heard of it, called ""Yap"" for like 7 million dollars. The CFO is a business guy with an engineering degree who has a good background in product release. The third guy is a former apple engineer who is the first guy to ever listen to music on an ipod. Definitely a good crowd and I'd learn a LOT of stuff. The pay might be lower at first, but if this job takes off it could be really great.

Basically I'm stuck because the stability and higher pay associated with the more established positions, especially Bose are very tempting. I feel that I'd learn more with the startup (I'm basically going in having to learn a whole new component of computer programming. I know Java really well but this will involve using Java to program an embedded computer system, communicate with a cloud database that I'd develop, and talk to mobile apps that I'd develop). It's a very high risk/high reward kind of situation. I think that even if the company failed, I'd come out with a killer resume boost. That only works out if I can hack the work they are dishing at me.

I need some insight! I feel like I can do all of these jobs, but I need to decide soon because all three are going to throw offers at me at any time. I don't know what to say to one about the other.

TLDR: I basically have 3 girlfriends and none of them know about one another. I can't choose which one I want to stay with. [Girlfriends = potential employers]

Also, I can't really say much about the start up as I signed a non-disclosure agreement."

At some point I'd like to go to HR and inquire about interning for the the school's IT department, but I'm not sure whether to do that before I am A+ certified or after.

If I didn't work there already I would just wait until after I was certified, but since I do work there and HR knows me my hope is that they will let me intern before I am certified. 

This is probably a situation where I should just go in and ask, but I thought I'd get some opinions here first. Thanks."

I was wondering if you guys know some good companies to start researching. I just started an 8 month internship in Canada working on embedded systems for an aerospace company. I want to start applying in a few months to US companies because my goal is to move somewhere in the south of the US when I graduate (Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona). 

As we say in Greek ""The children of the wise cook before they get hungry"". 

Any recommendations appreciated. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How much would it cost for reddit to pay for the services of a lobbyist? How could we go about doing that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ucqg?context=5)|In this economy? I am sure people would lobby for reddit for 40k a year.  But if you want a skilled lobbyist with good connections to offices and great relationships in DC to help give its users a real footprint? 70k-100k.
[So everyone on Reddit should donate a dollar and then we can start lobbying for what we want in congress ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6v8r9?context=5)|Hah. Sure! But how does a place like reddit come up with a unified platform?  What if certain members don't support it?  Should they go elsewhere? Maybe reddit users should unionize!!
[Good on you for not lobby for deregulation of air pollution. It's true that people need jobs, stuff like building pavements, but at what point do we wake up in a world covered in pavements and AstroTurf and decide that profit driven society is kind of a pollution machine itself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wzh7?context=5)|Do we want more jobs at the risk of the proven negative health risks from boilers - like increased cases of cancer, increases in miscarriages, asthma rates in children...?
 |It's a balance.  The thing is, those employers can often times foot the bill for new infrastructure.  They just don't want to because it affects their bottom line.  Fuck their bottom line though.  The health and safety of children &gt; your shitty paper factory.  
[What percentage of lobbyists would you say hold your same ideals and balk away from high dollars to merc for the ""bad guys""?  How do you pitch for more sidewalks if they are unnecessary outside of passing along a $25,000 ""contribution"" to a member of Congress? How is lobbying for ""bridges to nowhere"" (honestly\) better for the citizenry of the United States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6y7av?context=5)|Well a few things. You can't give a member $25,000 dollars. But earmarks have also been banned for 6 years now?  So the last transportation bill had zero.  And there were THOUSANDS of earmarks in SAFETEA-LU (the last bill with earmarks).  *Most* of them were not for bridges to nowhere. 
[As a lobbyist, do you have any idea what caused the intense vilification of earmarks?  As I understand it, they were some of the only ways to get politicians to support a bill for the good of all, by satisfying their need to bring personal money to their district to appease voters.  My own views have also led me to believe that Republicans abused these far, far more than Democrats did, which further leads to my misunderstanding of why Republicans spearhead and support the ban.  Do you have any opinion on this?  It's not as if selfish vying for money has stopped in any way, so why did they single out earmarks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7b77z?context=5)|Things like the big dig and bridges to nowhere. While there were bad examples, getting rid of them has essentially broken congress. Such a minimal portion of federal spending too.
[Alright, so you don't make any sort of recommendation as to how one goes about steering money to one member of congress over another, who you address in the process of pushing for one cause over another bearing this in mind, in your official capacity as a lobbyist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ywck?context=5)|We don't steer money in my organization, so (not so) sadly I cant tell you much about strategy there. But let's say you are a manufacturer of...i dunno...sewer inspecting robots?  Lets say the current process is an infrastructure bill provides money to communities to do inventories of their water infrastructure but there's no specific mention in the bill of funding new technology like remote controlled sewer inspecting robots.  Lets say a firm with the money to blow on such a thing knows they need to influence the committee to include that language in the next bill, but the committee is reluctant to do it on its merits alone.  So you probably want to throw some money towards the committee leadership's PACs (on both sides of the isle), and maybe some of the more influential members on the committee or subcommittee of jurisdiction for that issue, and maybe some money towards party leadership in general to try and pressure them from the top down.  But, really, I don't know.  I've never worked in campaign finance.  
[How accurate is the portrayal of lobbyists in House of Cards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u1g9?context=5)|House of Cards is not a political drama. It is a drama set in a political backdrop, which is an important distinction, I think.  Watch the first 3 episodes of VEEP.  The plot line with clean jobs/plastics is far, far more accurate.   
[Even all the swearing and imcompetence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6z3tn?context=5)|Gotta be able to shrug it off.  It's not personal.  People are right to be frustrated.  I'd prefer they learn something about me before telling me to die though!
[Have you personally seen what you considered to be unethical behavior by any elected officials, and if so, what action did you take, if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u4t5?context=5)|Unethical as in illegal or just shitty and awful?  I have not witnessed outright illegal activity.  
[Shitty and awful, though?   Can you offer an example?  Follow up - What influence have you seen the everyday (non-wealthy\) individual voter have on their representative, or would you say almost every interest is co-opted by an organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uglq?context=5)|I have to be a little careful about specific examples, but members vote all the time because a group asks them to even though it does not benefit their constituents in anyway, and may be contrary to what the bulk of their constituents want. that's why so many democrats have started supporting keystone. Labor pushes them to support it so that a few workers in the Midwest can get temporary jobs and labor can claim a win as ""job creators"".
[That is certainly disappointing.  Do you think that the recent supreme court rulings have had any effect on lobbyist/official relationships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vkkh?context=5)|I don't really have a good answer for you, unfortunately.  Not my area of expertise.  
[Do you think most members are actually well versed in the laws they vote on? I feel like most of them are ignorant about their policies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch723t8?context=5)|Depends. Generally no, but thats what their staff is for. To pretend they know on the member's behalf!
[Very disappointing, would you say that the members do this for personal gain(IE: kickbacks\), or do they really believe it's in the best interests of the nation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6w7s1?context=5)|If members are literally getting kickbacks, they go to prison.  That's 100% illegal.  Some members do things because their campaigns will get cash infusions. That doesn't always mean they don't also believe its in the best interest of the nation.  I think often times they just don't think much about it, occasionally they probably vote in shitty ways for cash.  There's a lot of members. They all have varying levels of ethical sturdiness!  
[I love how getting a 'kickback' would result in prison time, but getting a 'cash infusion' to their campaign in return for voting a certain way is legal and ethical.  Up until 1989 they could just pocket any cash leftover from their campaign fund.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71nqi?context=5)|I don't think most people feel to good about it. I don't!
[What is the pay like? At what level are you? Entry? Mid? Executive?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u6qb?context=5)|Mid. Pay is better than working on the hill.  Because we are a non-profit organization, the pay is less than if I went and lobbied on behalf of corporate interests.  But I get to sleep very comfortably at night knowing I don't do that!
[To elaborate on this, Hill staffers are not paid well at all unless they're very senior (Legislative Director of Chief of Staff for example\).  Staff Assistants usually start at around $25k.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xezi?context=5)|I'd say 28-30k, but yeah. the pay is shit!
[What is your take on paid lobbyists who do offer kickbacks whether intentional or not? And why isn't there a reddit PA?  edit: spelling, words, grammar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u1b9?context=5)|Many organizations now have PACs that allow them to contribute to member's campaigns, so the money flows from the PAC to the reelection committee and, by law, never goes through the member office.  Of course, members and their senior staff are generally aware of who their supporters are and it does grant them some access.  As a former staffer, I'd meet with anyone who requested a meeting under my issue areas, but I would agree that our big donors generally got meetings with the boss.
 |How do I feel about it?  I don't know. I don't know how to change it when we have a shitty activist court that keeps overturning finance laws.  
[*I don't know how to change it when we have a shitty activist court that keeps overturning finance laws.*  What do you mean by that? I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ysn6?context=5)|Well McCain Feingold put a lot of reforms into place, and so far the Supreme Court, particularly led by Republican Appointees, have effectively been overturning those reforms.  
[What specific reforms are you referring to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zu3x?context=5)|Google: McCain Feingold Supreme Court.
[Do you feel like certain interest groups have too much influence over politics in America, or that since there is such a large number of interest groups that all viewpoints are equal representation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6umka?context=5)|I do feel that certain interest groups have too much influence.  It's an undeniable fact.  Watch the comcast merger happen (hopefully not!) and you will understand exactly where the interplay between money, lobbying, and politics comes into play.
[Also, how true to life is the 'corrupt politican' stereotype?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6umka?context=5)|I don't think *most* politicians are corrupt in the sense that they are shadowy figures.  I do think leadership in both parties is super, super corrupt.  An individual member of congress has almost no power unless they chair a committee or are in leadership, and that's where the money flows.
[This is interesting. Are there are a lot of reps who are just taking blatant quid pro quos? Are there a lot of reps who are completely incorruptible? I'm guessing most are somewhere on the continuum.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch77awf?context=5)|I think your rank and file members are generally ethical/well intentioned people, that are playing a really shitty game 
[As a follow up.  What would be the blue collar entry-level position to work for a lobbyist group? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ubwk?context=5)|Work on the hill. Grad school. Some sort of technical expertise within a field.  It really depends on what you are lobbying for.  Science? Plenty of scientists come and lobby.  Working for Podesta? Former senior staffer to a member.  
[ also, many non profits, universities, associations, etc hire government relations staff.  Many of these people begin by simply following what happens in the federal government but don't do much of what you would consider ""lobbying"".  This is also a good start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wyox?context=5)|I'm sure you can get jobs as low-level researchers and support staff at lobbying firms right out of college, but I do think there's a bit of glass ceiling there. 
[Do many non-American's work as lobbyists or for their firms? I currently do communications for a Canadian Lobbyist group but would love to think I could migrate to the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7494m?context=5)|Lots of non Americans. 
[Do you travel outside of the DC area enough to see the seething hatred most of the rest of the country has for all things Washington?   If so... do you think Congress knows what low regard the public holds for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u2ty?context=5)|Everyone here knows how frustrated the country is with the institution of Congress. But MOST people really like their own members.  Check out the polling on that.
 |The institution is pretty broken.  I don't really know how to fix it - but that's not really my job (thank god). 
[The idea that people like their Member of Congress but dislike Congress as a whole is called Fenno's Paradox, and is a recognized and measured phenomenon in American politics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xnsx?context=5)|In general, it has a lot to do with the fact that there's a lot of good representatives out there!  The *process* is more broken than the people who work within the process!
[Shouldn't it be all of our jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70twh?context=5)|It should be all of our jobs to be engaged. We should all be fired for that.  
[I'm not sure how to feel about the fact that you are making a distinction between *process* and *people who work within the process*. It seems to me, and I'm just spitballin' here, that the people are the ones driving the process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch72toz?context=5)|One member of congress has no power over the process. Even a gaggle of members can only do so much!
[I heard lobbying is just taking guys out for beers and being friends who suggest certain things to members of congress etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vwzu?context=5)|That's explicitly illegal.  Like, federal ass-rape prison illegal.
[Is that what happens? Whats your average day like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vwzu?context=5)|If I am lobbying, I will send out an email to the office I want to meet with (generally targeted based on committee assignments).  Once I know I am meeting with them, I will aggregate district data, do background research on the member's past support for our issues, and go sit with them and make our case.  Usually some follow up - if they need more research from us or seem like they might be supportive.
[*federal ass-rape prison illegal.*  This is now my favorite descriptor of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71x1k?context=5)|I hope never to visit!
[Can you name some of the most corrupt politicians you know, since you're anonymous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vt68?context=5)|Not my area of expertise at all.  But here: [Link to www.crewsmostcorrupt.org](http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt)  They do pretty good analysis! 
[In a free market, wouldn't the fair shot be either a better product worth the extra cost or a lower price?  I think you actually supported my statement with yours. You were lobbying to shut out the opportunity of others in favor of a particular group or company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch708h7?context=5)|We are not in a free market. We are in a regulated market. What if the cheaper chinese product has high levels of mercury in it, which seep into the ground water and poison people/wildlife?  Just let the free market sort that out?  
[Are you lobbying for better regulations or are you lobbying for schools to use astroturf because a client sells it?  These are two very different things and you stated one of them above.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch743t0?context=5)|I don't lobby for either. It was an example.
[*And why isn't there a reddit PA?*  Assuming you meant to say ""PAC"": There was one. Doesn't seem to be active anymore, but they actively campaigned against Lamar Smith in the 2012 election.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u6a4?context=5)|If reddit is looking for a lobbyist to work on behalf of their PAC, I know just the guy! 
[Assuming you're a somewhat frequent reddit user, what is it like? Your profession is *constantly* the scapegoat for every political discussion. ""Those evil lobbyists, doing their job and getting paid for it. Why I oughtta..."" Even when reddit scapegoats do show up and do AMAs, they're either jumped on for some semantic issue in a reply or they're exonerated as ""One of the few, few, good ones,"" without disrupting the circlejerk scapegoat flow. So mad props for doing this.  **Q:** If you had to pick the top 3 misconceptions about your job, (as it relates to the field, not necessarily to you specifically\), what would they be and what is *really* going on there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vzde?context=5)|I wrestle with it.  Part of me doesn't want to blame people for not understanding - but at the same time, it's suuuper fucking frustrating watching something like the Comcast - Time Warner merger and seeing how easily the administration and many members of congress will bend over for a company that is in the business of monopolization.  So I get the anger. I am angry too.  But people should learn what the universe is beyond those examples.  Nearly every law is shaped by lobbyists.  Did a seatbelt save your life? Lobbying.  Did you drive in a car that you are exponentially safer in than you would have been 20 years ago? Lobbying.  Did your house or office withstand a significant disaster like an earthquake or hurricane? Lobbying.  Did you breath cleaner air in your office? Lobbying. Greater labor protections? Lobbying.  So, you know, hate it, but know that literally every positive aspect of your life is ALSO touched by it. 
[But do elected officials really need someone with deep pockets chirping in their ear to understand what's good for the country? Can't an intelligent person figure out what's good or bad for the people without being lobbied?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7440c?context=5)|I don't know if you're familiar with the sheer volume of public law that's addressed every year but no human could be an expert on even a 50th of it.
[What is the process for getting sit-down time with policy makers? Have you ever been bumped for a lobbyist from a big-money company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uv7w?context=5)|As a former hill staffer, I took meetings daily with lobbyists from ""big-money companies"" and labor.
 |The process is really simple.  MOST staffers will meet with just about anyone who requests a meeting.  I know a lot of the folks who cover the issue I work on, but even when I don't, a simple email usually gets me in the door.
 |Try it! If you want to talk with your member, email your district office and set up a meeting.  
[Follow up - Is there a general format to a meeting? Are you just stating a case or do you bring in presentation materials or even better source materials? If the staffer is of a different opinion is there a back and forth discussion or are you just stating the case and leaving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zotj?context=5)|I bring a bunch of district specific research.  Bring them up to speed on where things are at with my issue, what we anticipate the future will be, show them how its affecting their constituents, and then generally put forward our policy asks to close. 
[What do you think about the Koch Brothers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ul53?context=5)|I think they are everything that's wrong with the country.  But they aren't lobbyists.  They are primarily involved in PAC financing.  
[What do you think about George Soros?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wsyz?context=5)|I don't really have any thoughts.  I do think its hypocritical of D's to shit on big money/PACs, but then to play the game.  But the flipside is, if they don't, the tea party takes over? So...
 |Public financing! 
[Would not most companies be better off simply paying to fix what they are fighting against or for instead of paying a lobbyist to fight the cause?  Are they not spending about the same amount of money on both sides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vvst?context=5)|It's not just companies lobbying.  Particularly for issues like transportation, there are a *lot* of non-corporate special interests who represent grassroots interests.  I've never worked in corporate lobbying, but I'd have to assume the answer is no.  I can't imagine that there isn't someone doing cost/benefit analysis there.  
[Do you think Verizon will hold monopoly in getting cell service in metro or will this change in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zwor?context=5)|Not my field of knowledge at all.
[You say you're hoping to clear up some misconceptions about lobbying.  What is the biggest misconception you've heard?  Also, are there politicians who look at it strictly as an incoming bribe, don't care what you're lobbying for and strictly want to know how much will go into their coffers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6von3?context=5)|Biggest misconception is how the process works.
 |[Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg)
 |I think most people still think it happens like this. Lobbyists walk down on the house floor, hand out checks, and say ""vote for x"".  I don't think *most* lobbyists operate that way.  I don't think most of them represent groups with PACs or hand out money to politicians. There are people lobbying for almost literally every single issue under the sun.  As a former staffer I took meetings with people who wanted more astroturf on school football fields.  They had nothing to offer but data showing the cost effectiveness to our district.
 |That being said, certain groups do donate to members.  That's all relatively transparent unless it goes through PACs.  And those groups most definitely get greater access.  I would argue that for any given member, things aren't so shady.  It's mostly party and committee leadership where the big dollars fall.  
[So would you say a big part of the solution of ""getting money out of politics"" is getting rid of PACs? Because honestly, I was under the impression this was almost as crucial an issue as the entire economy. Lobbyists like yourself that seem to steer clear of handing out checks are far from the problem and probably help the american people, but I have no doubt there are PACs and individual lobbyists that would see entire communities go poor just to take that Mercedes SLS for a ride.  Maybe a follow-up question: do you see ""getting money out of politics"" as a big problem? And if so, how do we fix it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70vo9?context=5)|Public financing.  You can't really get rid of PACs because of our shitty supreme court.  But at least we can limit their control of politicians!
[This may be a bad question but I don't really understand politics, so what is lobbying? Also, what do you do on a normal day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ud9a?context=5)|Let me come back to this in an hour or so! This is a great question but I am running out the door!
[Do you see any ways to fix the dysfunctional and broken political system here in America that doesn't involve outright revolution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vaj6?context=5)|Not really.  Public financing of campaigns, redistricting reform, election reform.  But will that happen? Nah.  
[Do you truly believe that the freedom to lobby enhances our democracy? If so is there any example where it doesn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wg2i?context=5)|You can't prevent lobbying. Lobbying is the byproduct of a representative democracy.  If we want to have direct democracy, then there'd be no reason for lobbyists, but that's never going to be the case for obvious reasons.
 |I think the problem is how money flows.  We need to help separate representation from cash! 
[So my question. If you were hiring an entry level worker to your firm, what type of qualities, skills and experiences do you look for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uu6w?context=5)|After that, the last of art of writing is important.  The ability to form relationships.  Wonky knowledge of issues.  
[Well I'm a writer in the NYS legislature so I got that going for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wmbn?context=5)|That's a great leg up!
[Do you receive a lot of hate from stangers for being in that job position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6w9lt?context=5)|Only on reddit! People who know what I lobby on behalf of are generally super into it!

[Hello, sir! Thank you so much for doing this AMA!! I always wanted to hear from a lobbyist.  Could you please tell us how much international lobbying is there in our Congress? I have heard many times about how some countries invest a lot to get some support from the US, but I never knew how usual/powerful that was. Also, do you happen to know which countries have the most power when it comes to lobbying and influencing our politics?  Once again, thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wnr4?context=5)|I was lobbied by a few international energy firms (clean energy manufacturers from Israel and Germany, high speed rail from Japan), but other than that, I didn't see much of it.  My issues were pretty domestic though!  Can't really answer your other question in a meaningful way. I just don't know.
[House of Cards has been mentioned already, but does that show accurately portray a lot of things that happens on the Hill?  Also, what (not who\) do you lobby for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wfo2?context=5)|I lobby for equity and safety in our transportation system (I know, pretty evil!).  No. That show is not a political drama.  It is a drama that takes place on capitol hill.  Literally nothing about it is accurate. ESPECIALLY not the part where there's a dunkin donuts in the house cafeteria!!  
[Currently,  I am studying public relations and I really want to be a lobbyist. What kind of work experience and education should I go into? I'm thinking law school, but I've heard of people who skip over that bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vvg4?context=5)|Federal lobbying - go work on capitol hill for a few years.  As I said elsewhere, being able to navigate the U.S. Code of Laws is really important so law school cant hurt. But it really depends on what you want to do.  If you want to work at a high-power law firm like Patton Boggs, law school and being a chief of staff to a member will be helpful.  If you want to lobby on behalf of an smaller organization it's totally not necessary.  
[Could you give us an example of what a ""brilliant"" piece of lobbying looks like? Like that one time that, when you look back at it, you think ""Damn, that was really well done.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6x7oq?context=5)|Sure.  MAP-21, the last long-term bill that authorizes our nation's transportation programs was going to gut ALL dedicated funding for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure - which came from various pots of funding. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill cut the funding before it even reached committee. Boxer threw it out as a compromise to get Republicans on board.  Super frustrating for people who value things like safe places to cross the street.
 |So a lot of lobbyists for transpo groups, health groups, childhood safety advocates, etc, got together and struck a compromise in an amendment known as the Cardin-Cochran Amendment ([Link to www.cardin.senate.gov](http://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/news/cardin-cochran-amendment-would-boost-local-control-of-bike-ped-funding))  Basically, it was a compromise that allowed states the opportunity to transfer bike/pedestrian funding to other priorities *cough* highways *cough* if they chose, but ensured that a portion of the funding would go directly to local control for cities and towns that actually value things like ensuring bus stops have safe crossings next to them.  It was not a solution *any* of the advocates wanted, but it kept funding in the bill (at about a third less overall). It was bipartisan. It passed on the floor by voice vote without objection.  That was a brilliant last-ditch effort to compromise and save a program.
[Thank you! That was very interesting.  A follow-up question: How much of your time is spent lobbying other lobbying groups so that you build a coalition so that you can all lobby politicians together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6y66v?context=5)|50/50.  We don't lobby them so much as just work closely with them to stay on the same page.  We all generally come at this issue with the same mind-set. 
[Do you think it would be possible for someone from a professional field (not politics, but medicine/computers/engineering/etc.\) to run purely online for a senator/congressman?  Personally I feel like that's the only way to get an honest politician at this point in US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vucx?context=5)|Well. That happens a lot with the teaparty.  Lots of restaurant owners. Construction company owners. Farmers.  But they have a lot of ""astroturf-roots"" dollars behind them!
[I like the lobbyist guy.staying calm AND responding to dumb, half-assed comments/?'s.thanks and well done ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6z43e?context=5)|I get the anger.  Like I said to someone else.  I wish people would take the time to ask questions instead of telling me to die, but what can you do?
[How did you get into the field?  Where would somebody start if interested in lobbying?  What is a typical day for you?  Has your lobbying accomplished anything substantial (anything we may have heard about\)?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xlnr?context=5)|I've answered the typical day part a couple of times.  Worked for members of congress. Some national service before that.  My lobbying has not yet, but that's mostly a timing issue. Transportation bills are long-term authorizations and it will be another 6 months to a year before the next one is out.  Ill let you know! =P.
[What's the transport bill you're working on now?  I'm a driver down here for a news agency, curious as to whether or not it'll affect me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6znaa?context=5)|It's the transportation bill that authorizes *all* of our nations surface transportation programs.  If you move on the ground it absolutely affects you. 
[Do Congressmen realize how much we hate their guts for using issues, committee hearings, and voting on bills as a platform for their party to get re-elected, instead of doing their fucking jobs and representing the interests of the people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70exe?context=5)|I ask myself that a lot.  I don't think most of them are real people?  So no.  Some probably do, but they are generally the ones actually standing up to the machine.  Don't hear much in the press about them. Rosa De Lauro. Al Franken (sometimes). Thems kinda folks.
[Who are some of the politicians that are the hardest to work with?  The easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wujh?context=5)|You know, it's totally random for me.  I've met with offices that I thought would be a total nightmare and their staffs were great! I am reluctant to name names, as my effectiveness is really dependent upon those relationships.  Sorry I can't be much clearer than that. 
[If we read about politicians in China or India accepting tens of thousands of dollars from corporations, and then making policy that effects those corporations, we'd label it as corruption.What is the difference between lobbying and corruption? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wcm4?context=5)|A campaign contribution and a personal bribe are two different things.  If I gave a politicians *anything* personally, and they accepted, we'd both go to prison.  Read: Jack Abermoff.
 |But I don't disagree that our campaign financing system is shitty and breads really awful legislating! 
[In your experience how out of touch is Congress with the majority of lower (&gt; 40,000k\) income Americans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wiju?context=5)|Republicans? Super.  Democrats, I think most of them are generally in favor of supporting lower income brackets, BUT, their leadership is fucking awful and holds meaningless votes on things like food stamps and fair wages that they HOPE will not pass because it allows them to beat up republicans.  That's so fucked up.  
[Thanks for the great response, that is twisted, trying something you know will fail to throw it back pigeon holing Republicans as evil fat backs. What's something you can suggest to make my single voice heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71d2t?context=5)|No single voice is ever heard.  Make your voice collective. 
[Can you give a breakdown of the proposed Transportation Bill and how it differs from the last multi-year bill? Also does it have a chance of passing this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6we8r?context=5)|There are no bills in the Senate or House yet.  The administration has put forward a bill which differs in that it has greater focus on equity, interconnectedness, multi-modalism, performance from state DOTs and MPOs, performance and outcome based funding.  The major difference now is that there are no earmarks for transportation bills - which is HUGE.  The last bill was the first earmarkless bill and so all projects were formula funded except for one discretionary grant program which isn't nearly large enough to feed our backlog of transportation needs. The problem with that is you end up with silos of funding that don't coordinate well with each other and tend to lead to silos of infrastructure.  What incentive does a state have to connect sidewalks with transit with highways when they are all individual, formula funded pots of cash?
[Thanks for the reply.  I have not dug into the Bill, but what is meant by 'outcome based funding' on Transportation projects? Good to see more funding for inter-connectivity and multi-modal projects.  How do the local public agencies fare in the administrations bill? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch746gq?context=5)|Setting performance measures for states to follow and providing funding based on their success.
[How did you land your first job as a legislative staffer? If I'm interested in doing this, would it make sense to apply to an internship with my congressman? Do they hire successful interns to paid positions? What's the process like? Also, how much do legislative staff get to work on policy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch701j0?context=5)|Interned.  Makes perfect sense!  They hire *good* interns to be paid staff.  You have to strike the balance of working your ass off without being an ass kissing sycophant.  Not many people can strike that well.  
[Thanks for doing this.  I'm a biomedical researcher.  Funding cuts have been devastating.  Is there any hope to waking up congress?  What can we do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zyqt?context=5)|Not next Congress unfortunately.  You NEED to go to your representatives with evidence in hand showing how appropriations cuts are harming people on the ground in their district. Harming jobs. Putting us at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world.  They HAVE to hear from you or they wont stand up for you.

I'm currently researching the topic of getting into freelance but I figured people on this subreddit would have better advice personally tailored to my situation. 

My top concern with freelancing is I know that I won't be the fast at the start and I don't want to charge customers for the time I spent learning what I need to complete their request. At the same time I assume if I'm willing to put in 40-50+ hours/week it would be an acceptable finishing time frame for the work. (I'm just spit-balling thoughts that come into my head now).

[I served for 8 years in the military but don't want to keep doing what I did in the service out in the civilian world. Aside from the military training and certifications I received I have very little in the way of experience in a traditional workplace and have been stuck working dead end jobs while I try to make a switch to a career that I might enjoy. Do you have any advice on things I should highlight that would make me stand out from the crowd? How best to highlight the things I learned in the military that might serve me in the current job market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6xary?context=5)|This is a great question and one we'll both be at risk of going too deep on.  Jenny is getting back from lunch in just a few minutes, and I'd like for her to take first dibs on this.  I'll (Peter) chime in shortly thereafter.  So hang tight for just a few more minutes.
 |Just spoke to Jenny and she's back from lunch.  Reply coming soon.
 |I'm here!  GREAT question, and first let me say, don't discount yourself or your skills.  Your military experience is absolutely enticing to most employers...in fact, I can't think of a single HR professional or CEO, Plant Manager, President or Hiring Manager who wouldn't want to look at you very closely.
 |So...here's what I propose: take a blank sheet of paper and draw 6 big boxes: Logistics, Management, Communications, IT, Certifications/Awards and Other   Within each box, write several brief entries of the work that you had done while enlisted.  Think in specific terms, and don't worry if you use jargon that's unrecognizable to the rest of us (What the hell is a CB1015A Certification???)  Just jot it down.  This should take an hour or more - don't be shy, and gather any discharge info you need to do it thoroughly.
 |Next, have someone who you admire that works in a professional capacity - especially in the line of work you WANT to be in (have you decided what that is?  Totally separate conversation, but important.  Crucial.)  Have that person (or people, maybe 2-3) look at your ""boxes"".  Have them identify which of these entries are similar enough to the civilian world to be useful, and which are simply too military (ask them to help you re-phrase these if possible.  If you were a sharpshooter, first of all, remind me not to tick you off.  Secondly, unless you're aiming [ha, ha, little career humor there] for a Secret Service position, that's not going to be re-worked into a skill most offices need...EXCEPT it could be used as ""attention to detail"".  Not a lie - you were very attentive to every detail!!
 |Finally, once your entries have been extrapolated to your new intended career target, you can begin the work of crafting a resume that's practical for many applications in the civilian world.  I have no doubt that you have plenty of background to fill an entire resume, you simply need to decide which of your skill areas you want to highlight - if you want to get into marketing, emphasize communication.  If warehousing is a good fit (great career, excellent money) your logistics training and the structure you served under is priceless.  See how it works?  You just need to approach this as someone with YEARS of successful employment and skills that are portable to all kinds of sectors.  BEST WISHES - and thank you, sincerely, for keeping my family and me safe.  You guys and girls do the things I'm too afraid to even consider, and you do it every day with little pay and a whole lot of challenges.  Thank you for writing!!  You've got a bright future ahead - let me know how it turns out!
 |This is Peter - I'll add some thoughts here too.
 |We had a NCAA D1 Athlete below ask a similar question, and my approach is similar to that.  In addition to what Jenny wrote above, let's also think outside of the technical aspects.  What else are you good at?  Handling stress, chaos, teams, leadership, problem solving, high work loads, discipline, and a whole, whole lot more.
 |How you organize this info depends greatly on the amount and type of info, and the job opp at hand.  Maybe chronological, maybe skills - there again is where your friends might help.  Our [reddit stash](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zl0bz32u9oxwz3/os-IQq1GW-) has some samples and templates for each of these.
 |You're in a better position than most career switchers, in that you have a highly respected, diverse, and proven background backing you up.  The hard part, though, is crafting that into civilian terms.
 |I am not an expert on this part, but I do know there are both programs AND specific companies that have great programs to hire military.  **Maybe some other Redditors can chime in here?  **
 |Thank you, sincerely, for your service and for keeping my family safe.  
[Why jenny, why must you be 15 minutes late to people on the INTERNET!? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70bkt?context=5)|It was my 15 minutes of fame...now I'm just a regular Jenny again. *sigh*
[Do you ever feel like you are helping incompetent people get jobs they are not qualified for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vxwt?context=5)|Ha, well, sometimes.  I'm (Peter) a pretty candid guy though, so I tend to be honest with the person.  When we start looking at what I call ""Work impacts"" (aka - what did you do to benifit the last place) we often come to the ""mutual"" realization that they might be aiming a bit high.  We also talk about honesty and ensure what they're putting down is true.
 |There's also a degree of separation too - a good resume will get you an interview, not a job.  They'd have to bluff the interview process to actually get hired.
 |The gray zone is when we're helping folks with stretch goals - those they aren't necessarily 100% ready for but want to go for it anyhow.
 |I love that question.  This is Jenny now - I can pretty honestly assess how well someone who comes to me for help on a resume might do during an interview - and I try to share that information when appropriate.  For instance, if their soft skills (speech patterns, comfort with strangers, ability to make small talk, handshake, eye contact) are poor, I'll try to give them a few tips and recommend a longer meeting to practice, as in a mock interview format.  If they're stellar and really personable, I share that as well.  But I echo what Peter said, too - if they're truly not ready for a job that they want to write a resume for, it's clear.  I'm NEVER going to help someone lie or puff themselves up - it's wrong and simply a waste of time for them and the company.
[Benefit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70tqy?context=5)|Good catch.  SEE PEOPLE - HAVE SOMEONE ELSE PROOF YOUR STUFF! Guess who edits Peter???  :)  Sorry, man, you opened that door. Couldn't help myself.

[What is the worst error someone can make on their resume? (besides the obvious, like outright lying\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtrv?context=5)|Worst error: not proofreading effectively, or not asking someone with a really strong grasp of spelling, grammar, tone, etc. to read it through and be honest.  It's got to be error-free and it's got to read smoothly.  You want to ensure your margins are aligned, it's ""clean"" and ""crisp"" and it shows an accurate reflection of who you are.  The other worst error that immediately destines the doc for File 13:  forgetting to change something that was tailored for another company.  Company name is the usual WTF moment.
[What is the most common error you see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtrv?context=5)|Most common: Not personalizing (or making specific, since it's not human!) to each job at each company where you apply.  Too many people use the same resume for every job...this is bad juju!!
[What if I am not ""clean"" and ""crisp""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6z7su?context=5)|Serious answer?
 |Even if you're not C&amp;C, you can still create an excellent resume though, right?  (if they don't need to ""see"" you when you submit the resume).  Then, come interview time, you can sacrifice for one day and clean yourself up.  Then, see if the job is right for you.  Boring answer, I know, but it's mostly reality.
 |Now, we could get into a whole discussion about what's the right job for you here.  C&amp;C isn't for everyone, and not every job needs C&amp;C.  It becomes a question to you of which is most important to you - your lifestyle or your future earning potential.
 |Not Serious Answer?  Join a rock band or crew.  Any other suggestions for this person?
[How do I make my .docx files smell like smoke??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y0zx?context=5)|Just type really, really fast!
[I have been out of work for over a year. Is there anything I can do to still be considered for a job? I cant find employment anywhere and sending out 20 resumes a day with zero results will be the reason I eventually throw myself off a bridge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zmdu?context=5)|Please avoid the bridge.
 |Look into a Skills base resume - it's great for covering employment gaps.  I'll post a quick sample and template in our [Reddit dropbox stash](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zl0bz32u9oxwz3/os-IQq1GW-)
 |Also, have someone you trust, but that's honest, look at your resumes.  20/day is a huge # and there's more to the story.  
[When you are young, you tend to get glossed over. Everybody wants 4 years min of experience in a specialty trade. How am I supposed to obtain the experience if you won't hire me!? I have easily sent 10 resumes a day 3 times a week for the past 4 months, so it is definitely possible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch71grw?context=5)|Absolutely - spend more time customizing your resume so it's not general and speaks to the person reviewing it that you created it just for this opportunity.  Also consider volunteering or finding an internship in your field (unpaid is far more common) and networking: who do you know that does what you'd like to and you could ask some questions, get some real ideas on where to begin?
 |Networking gives some opportunity here.  Get in front of the people that either make or influence the decision.  This can include LinkedIn (where references are easy to have).
 |Also, remember that ""experience"" can be somewhat relative.  While staying honest, consider things you did in school that might have given you some experience.  Experience also doesn't have to be paid experience.  If you're a programmer and have been programming for fun since you were 13, you have experience my friend!
[I have a Master's, and I need to hide it from my job history to get interviews where I live. (Yes, it's a MFA; as seen in my username\) How can I do this and not be a total pants-burning liar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wm4b?context=5)|As in Liar, liar, pants on fire?  Love it.  Yeah, you definitely don't want that.  On an application you're normally obligated to list ALL experience, educational pursuits, etc. so they've got you there...but on the resume, you choose what you want to highlight.  Just put ""Related Education"" and leave that MFA off there. 
[I am a 5th year chemical engineering student with a substantial amount of experience and  I used to have ""home brewing"" as an interest on my resume.  I had a chief engineer at company tell me that people might get the wrong idea from that.  However, every interview I had the people seemed to really get excited about it and start asking me tons of questions.  What are your thoughts on including interests/hobbies on a resume, no matter how professional it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yb5z?context=5)|They key phrase in your question is ""no matter how professional it is"".
 |MY thoughts (this is Peter): I like a little personality in a resume.  It helps you stand out.  When you call me to follow up, or you come into an interview, I'll say ""Oh hey, that's Gary, the homebrew guy.""
 |It's a tough call, especially over Reddit, as to which way you go there.  Is the HR person super conservative and totally against alcohol?  Or are they super down to earth and share that common interest with you?
 |Look to the culture of the business, if possible.  You might find out pretty quickly if it's a place where that'd be cool vs. taboo.
 |**TL;DR:** Personality is great in a resume, it helps you stand out.  It's also a fine line.  Avoid controversial topics until you meet the interviewer face to face.
 |Most folks will be fine with it, if it relates somewhat and fleshes you out as a human being with verve.  I agree with Peter...and as for folks who would be offended, would you want to work with teetotalers?  Maybe not.  Of course, that could just be the hiring person whom you'd never have to deal with, but...
[I have been a stay at home mom for the last few years, but am now looking for a job,  what is a positive spin I can put on that so they don't focus on the fact that I haven't had a job in 4 years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zl7s?context=5)|This is Peter - and Jenny may have more to offer here soon.
 |First, look to a Skills resume.  Chronological might not be the best fit (but you be the judge based on your situation).
 |SAH moms usually do a lot of volunteer work and have other projects on the side.  Be sure to remember these.  Also, think about some things you could do at home, such as contribute articles to some blogs or websites, persue education, etc.  (all that said, trust me that I know SAH does NOT equal ""home on the couch!""
 |[Here's an article](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/834877/resume-tips-for-the-stay-at-home-mom) you might find interesting.  Anything to add here Jenny?
 |Congratulations!!!  That's one of the hardest jobs you'll ever love :)  I stayed home with my 4 girls for many years, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  The good news is, many working mothers and fathers nowadays (including me!) have an appreciation for staying home to raise children; it's not an automatic detriment to your career.  You are correct to be aware that you need to be careful with your resume.  I would offer that you want it to be very professional with a great amount of detail - specific detail.  Break down the tasks you have been responsible for just as you would in a paid position: Managed household finances; prepared taxes independently; created meals based on principals of nutrition; reviewed school assignments daily; performed housecleaning daily while directing family members' chores.  This seems like a micro approach, but you can put these tasks into measurable, meaningful categories that reflect your expertise.  Finally, I'd advise using your network (which is large, I've no doubt!) to get the word out that you're looking for a position.  People who know you - your character, your dedication, your work ethic - can be your best champions.  Good luck!!   
[After I got out of the military I had about 4 crappy jobs that lasted about 4 to 6 months each, then I started the career I wanted to be in and am now looking a different job.  I have been in my current job for 3 years and the one before that for 5 years.  I want the military listed on my resume plus the 2 good jobs but I hate listing the 4 useless jobs on there because they are irrelevant, but I don't want gaps either.  How should I format it? Is ok to list relevant jobs and length of time you had them and not use dates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y8m5?context=5)|Honestly, if you're currently employed and there won't be a gap before your next job, I'd just leave the irrelevant ones out completely.  That gap will be in the past and shouldn't (shouldn't!) affect you.
 |Unfortunately, dates are usually ""required"".  Sends up a red flag if dates are omitted.
 |*edit* - remember, the purpose of a resume isn't to get you the job, it's to get you the interview.  The interview is your opportunity to explain the gap.  As an employer, I'd be fine with that gap for the reasons you listed, especially given that you have 8 years SINCE then of steady employment.
 |Using relevant jobs, definitely.  Leaving off dates/lengths is not a good idea (you're usually going to have to complete an application separately which will ask for those dates...for all positions, so they've got you). With that being said, your resume is what you want to highlight - what you're showing them as your best foot forward to fit with this job opening.  Title that section ""Related Experience"" and put the jobs you feel speak to that there.  In the interview you can cover how the two other positions prepared you for the next role that you loved (don't criticize any job during an interview - just make it about what you learned and the positive take-aways). 
[How do you feel about the 1 page rule for resumes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|I personally like a one-pager.  No more than 2, ever, for sure.  Mine is only one page and I've been working for a while.
[What's a common mistake made when creating curriculum vitaes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|Common mistake for CV's?  Too verbose, too lengthy and too much bragging.  People want to know what you've done, but leave enough mystery so they actually want to meet you.
[What do you use to make resumes?  Do you use latex at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|I use my keyboard :)
[You should play with LaTeX. Make your stuff look like it came out of the Oval Office. Also - nerd cred.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wkc7?context=5)|Re: Latex question - I'm not 100% versed on it, but I do know of it.  It comes down to knowing the job opportunity, and ensure that the recipient can view it as intended.  If it comes out even the slightest bit garbled, most people would look at it and say ""WTF is this?!"".  If it's an opportunity that would ""get it"" w/o hesitation, sure.
 |Which is why PDF is the preferred way to deliver docs.  Formatting essentially can't change and isn't up for interpretation by the recipients version of word (doc vs docx, for example)
 |Sadly, though, most industries require pretty standard, boring resumes.  Exceptions include high tech/development jobs, and artys opps like marketing/etc.
[Customizing resumes for each interview is very time consuming. Do you have any tips on how to streamline the process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6ydrf?context=5)|Sure - let's take a Chronological resume for example here: 
 |Have two Word docs.  One is your resume, the other is for ""Scrap""
 |Preformat all of your jobs to the same format, so each could be pasted into the resume as needed.
 |Cut and paste into the resume as needed.  If it doesnt' apply, cut from teh resume and put over in your scrap doc.  Chances are you've hand fewer than 5-6 jobs in the past 5 years, so you won't have a lot of moving to do.
 |Next approach - say you're looking for something in either Management OR finanance.  You're applying to 10 jobs, 5 in each.  So, you'd need 2 resumes - one that focuses on Management, one on Finanace.  Right?
 |Last, you SHOULD take the time to research each company to which you are applying, if only for 5 minutes.  Then, do a touch of tailoring to your resume to fit their company.  Some terms, some acronyms, some specific topics you know will catch there eye.
 |WHY?  Simple - invest 8-10 minutes into a job that you might be with for YEARS.  It's a good payoff.  
[I feel this will be more as sort of a consultancy than an actual AMA, but you stated that you are here to help. I am assuming that you are the founders of you business since you created a book on it that is widely used. Did you guys start off as HR oriented professionals and then found a gap in the market and decided to cater to that?  Secondly, I am struggling to land my dream job in the finance industry, and have never seen a truly successful formula for such a CV. Do you have a link to template that would satisfy most HR professionals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vroj?context=5)|This is Peter, and I'll let Jenny reply separately.  I wrote 20 Minute Resume because I knew there had to be a more systemized way to craft a resume.  So I did a bunch of research, worked with several HR people, found the ""best practices"" of what I call ""winning"" resumes, and filtered that info down to a framework.  So, that's how I got into this.  Then, I found it fun and fascinating, so that's why I stayed around!  Jenny here - I LOVE helping people achieve their dreams - that brings me great satisfaction.  I'll never build medical devices that save lives, but I can have honest conversations about folks' goals and how to get from here to here - that's my finest hour.  I actually began my career in counseling but soon found that I wanted to help people before they faced the kinds of challenges I saw...I wanted to give them hope through obtaining a career they could excel in.
 |As for your question, I concur with Peter - a CV is generally advisable for Education and Literature/Journalism sectors.  Unless you've published or taught extensively, I would go with a traditional resume.  And the template he shared should be a real help.  Good luck to you!
[Point of order. In the UK, we usually use CV and almost never use resume, so the academic distinction is likely only true in the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yhx4?context=5)|Fair enough.  One reason we put ""US"" in the title.  There are cultural differences anywhere we look, so thanks to TTTaToo for bringing that one up.
 |The best way to keep this right is to look at the job description.  Does it say ""Submit a Resume"" or ""Submit a CV""?  Here's your sign ;-).  
[1.My  first name is slightly long tricky to pronounce... I saw on the Freakonomics documentary that CVs with ethnic names statistically have lower odds of getting picked.  In my day to day life I use a  similar, shorter and more common version of my own name, because its just more practical and easier for people to remember. Can I use this name on my CV instead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yyr0?context=5)|Use the shorter name.  It's a shame, but that's reality.  Same reason that overseas tech support folks have very western names.
[2.I'm an Architect. Is there a specific format for architectural CVs?, should I just mention the Studios I've work on, or should I include the buildings I've been involved with? The jobs I've found in the past I just kind of landed on account of recommendations, so I'm kind of a CV virgin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yyr0?context=5)|An architect resume is going to be a mix of a standard resume and a design portfolio.  1-2 page resume, and a portfolio of whatever length and format that works for you.  
[What is the easiest way to cut down a resume that is too long? Is it advisable to leave short term 'filler' jobs out? (for example, I lost my job and worked fast food for two months to have an income while searching for something more worthwhile\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wsol?context=5)|Yes, only include relevant and positive job entries on the resume.  You'll have to list all jobs on the application, but most folks understand and will admire that when times were tough, you took work that was available - hopefully that's the case here.  Be honest, but don't give them a reason to wonder if you're a job hopper!!
[So is ok to leave dates off the resume or is it ok to have gaps listed?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70zd1?context=5)|That's a tough situation, because it's not ok to leave dates off, nor is it advisable to have gaps.  Rock and a hard place, right?
 |Look into what is called a ""Skills"" resume - it gets rid of all that stuff.  
[Is it different for different situations? (Say, responding to an online posting vs. sending a resume to someone you have already met.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y87b?context=5)|You have to go with each situation differently obivisouly.  In general:   Not all resume reviews are HR people.  Some are small business folks that wear 15 different hats, so a little followup goes a long way.  It's fine to attempt to contact the hiring manager, though most places make it difficult and your email won't be responded to or your phone call demoted to a message for the admin. assistant...however, you have every right to try to contact the company so long as you're not being a jerk.  If you've not heard back in 2-3 weeks, consider trying to contact and asking if there is any feedback the company might be able to provide about your application materials.  Some places will do so, especially if they're smaller.   I don't see a difference for different situations, except that you might have better luck if you attempt phone contact.  Email is really easy to ignore. 
[I am having an extremely hard time getting interviews in new positions that feature jobs I am completely qualified for or even jobs I currently do.  Most of my applications have been through applying online.  I feel that my resume is solid and my CLs are good.. Do you know if there is more of an inherent difficulty to getting an interview from an online application as opposed to in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtqg?context=5)|If it's online, think like a search engine - keywords.  Most online submissions will get dumped to a database, and then automatically scanned for keywords.  Those that rank high will get passed to a human.
 |For example, say you're looking to be an inventory control manager for a manufacturing firm.  Be sure to include lots of keywords and jargon to ""Show"" the computer you're legit.  JIT, FIFO, FILO, QC, Efficiency, etc etc.  (just examples, I'm not a manuf inventory person)
 |Next, and this isn't a plug, but I would suggest that you find some HR folks that will give you some candid feedback - and just have them give it a quick look.  
[My boyfriend is concerned about listing our address on my resume, and I keep telling him he's nuts, and it should be on there.  Thoughts?  Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6xapf?context=5)|If he's applying to the mobb, might be cautious.
 |Kidding aside, and saying that I don't know anything about your situation, it IS standard practice, so I'd side with your ""nuts"" comment.  Hiding it could raise all sorts of speculation from the HR person.  
[My question is - how do you guys feel about including an objective? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6z6uo?context=5)| 
[I'm a former NCAA D1 athlete, how can I utilize that on my resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6w769?context=5)|This depends on your goal - are you looking to apply for a job that would connect with collegiate-level athletics in some way?  If not, I would include it for sure but push it down a bit, to the sections you've reserved for ""Activities"".  If the job you're applying for is, say, coaching or as an Athletic Director, I'd include it more prominently in your ""Related Experience"" section.  It might not have been paid, but all relevant experience can go there, if it's legitimately connected.
 |This is Peter - Being an athlete is a demanding job!  Think about how that'll translate to your goal.  Schedule, team work, demands, goals, pressure, competition, etc.
 |Another great use for your cover letter.
 |I'll also add that, depending on your sport, how important the people skills are, and that's likely something you've worked on more than most.  Working with a team in a stressful situation, motivation, leadership - all that will really help you stand out.  I think it's a great advantage for you.  That help?  If not, give us some specifics and we'll try to dig deeper.  
[I'm looking to get a job in a different state.  What's the best way to approach this so a hiring manager doesn't just think, ""this guy is two states away. Not worth my time.""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6ygi0?context=5)|Mention in your cover letter that you'll be visiting the area on ___date, and you'd like to set up a meeting to discuss your interest in the position.  Follow up with a personal phone call a few days after the Hiring Manager has reviewed your resume.  Be tenacious, not whiny.  It works! 
[How would you tailor a resume for a job in government versus private sector? Also, what is your experience with Wonderlic? Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wqnd?context=5)|For the government, I would use a more structured resume with distinct categories and wording that relates my responsibilities in former roles to what this position is likely to include.  Also definitely put in your volunteer experience or civic organization stuff - anything that screams ""responsible citizen"".  I've not used Wonderlic...Peter, have you??  
[I forget the official name of it, but I was once told that, if you needed some resume filler, to put in a section under your contact info with certain ""power words"" like ""Independent • Dependable • Initiative • Leadership"".  Is this a viable tactic, or will it be seen as the filler that it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6u4w1?context=5)|Call it what you want (Highlights?) but this **is** used effectively if you need some filler.  I'd suggest avoiding cliche phrases though, and instead, highlight your key skills.  [Here's a sample chronological resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e1u1qa8w86uogeb/Sample%20Chrono%20Resume.pdf) that uses something almost exactly like you mentioned.  Notice, though, that she highlighted her key value propositions.  Things like ""Independent, etc"" are on 99.9% of resumes out there already, right?  So, take that opportunity to stand out a bit.   
[What's the minimum GPA before its in your best interest to not put GPA on your resume? I'm about to finish up engineering degree from one of the best programs for my degree in the country but my GPA is hovering at around a 2.4. I have experience from an internship that I try to emphasize but what do I do about my GPA? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zj64?context=5)|As many have said, 3.0-3.5 = list it; otherwise, don't - regarless of school.
 |Pump up that internship experience, talk about WHAT you did in the classes, and that's your best bet.  Some firms MUST know your GPA, in which case, you have to face reality that you'll have some 'splaining to do (if you get the chance).
 |Here, too, networking is your friend.  A quick referral from a buddy of the hiring person can go a long way toward overlooking GPA.  
[Hey, I am a kid and do not have that much experience, could I put that I worked at an ambiguous store or would I rather be honest and say I do not have that much experience. PS for a job at Starbucks Do volunteer things count and if yes should I put it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6w551?context=5)|Hello!  The good news is, ALL ""kids"" as you describe yourself have little to no experience.  Don't be discouraged!  Yes, you absolutely need to list your job at Starbucks, and it should be detailed with the job responsibilities you had: order fulfillment, financial transactions, operation of automated equipment.  Don't gloss over your time there, and DEFINITELY list the employer's name.  Also, you should always list relevant volunteer experience...this goes a long way with most employers, but it goes even further if you don't have a ton of paid jobs to include.  Good luck!!
 |As someone that's hired a lot of ""kids"", show me that you're worth taking a risk on.  100% DO include volunteer work.  Also, Boy or Girl Scouts, church groups, sports teams, events you've helped run, etc.  Anything that took even a bit of responsibility.  All that stuff gives you points.  
 |Your cover letter will be key here.  Professionally demonstrate your desire to work, to excel, and to be valuable to the company.  Don't hide your lack of experience, but rather, show how your personality sets you up for success with them.  (and by personality, I mean work ethic, desire, friendliness, etc).  That help?  Ask more if not.  
[I work trades, is a cover letter still important for me to have with my resume? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6woxs?context=5)|It's not as often used in the trades, for sure - but if you include one it will be impressive...with one exception.  If you're interviewing with a die-hard, crusty SOB who values hard work above all, I wouldn't hand him (stereotyping here - it's a him) a crisp clean cover letter.  Save that for the front office staff if the company is large enough that they have a professional office.   
[What about languages where you can't avoid this? In Spanish using first or third person will invariably change the verb, you just can't get passed that.  If you HAD to choose, which one would be your choice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch7119u?context=5)|If someone held a gun on me, I'd say first person.  How creepy is it to say, ""Jenny raised profits 45%"".  Ever see the Jimmy episode on Seinfeld?  If you're old enough, you know exactly what I'm saying!!
[How about the typo in the post title?  ""...that specialize in perfecting resumes to *land* people interviews.""  No offense, but that is a kick in the credibility testicles. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch73dqn?context=5)|Yeah, I saw that too after it was too late.  We had trouble getting the AMA posted and this was the 6th time we'd typed the title.  
[Comma splice!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch72hih?context=5)|I really, really, totally love the comma splice.  It's such a cute little way to make people halt, then halt again!  Thanks for your comment - I smiled.  Favorite book: Eats, Shoots and Leaves.  Genius!! I would have titled it Eats, Shoots, and Leaves, however.  And there goes the whole joke!!
[Overqualified...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yhrx?context=5)|Yep, resumes need to be tailored to the job at hand.  Sometimes, life's turns require seeking a job that might be a departure from your history.  (this is sometimes a great thing, BTW).
 |So, don't ""forget"" about your experience, just spin it differently.
 |I will caution you though - that when you leave something off but it comes up in an interview, be prepared to back up why you left it off, ya know?  ""So you say you have a MFA, but you don't list it here.  What else are you hiding?""  Don't act cornered, act confident.  ""If I listed everything I've done in my life, I'd fill up 5 pages, and I know you don't have time for that!""  (Then, quickly change the subject).  Sound fair?
[If I'm hiring a new admin assistant and some Joe with 6 years in the local orchestra and an MFA applies, I'm not hiring him because he's going to leave as soon as his next audition lands him a gig.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zps4?context=5)|Ryken brings up a great point, and something that speaks to ""put yourself in the shoes of the job"".  This is a total real, and very legit concern.
 |So speak to that in the interview.  Since you tailored your resume for the job, you'll get the interview, right?  RIGHT?!

24h4d6,2,2014-05-01,Interview at Nasdaq OMX - In need of some tips,Pellebelle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/24h4d6/interview_at_nasdaq_omx_in_need_of_some_tips/,"Howdy! 

I have been invited to an interview at Nasdaq OMX for a summer internship position. It's a technology internship where most of the job will consist of programming in Java, according to the description.

The interview is scheduled for the entire day, so I guess there will be more than one interview, perhaps even some problem cases? They didn't reveal much when I asked, so I can only assume.

I'm majoring in Financial Engineering and have focused my studies towards stochastic calculus, so I'm not from the computer science area, but I guess they think my resume is ok any way?

My question to you is, what kind of questions can I expect? What should I prepare extra thoroughly? Have any of you been to an interview at Nasdaq? How was it?

Thanks in advance."

[Hello Imran, I really appreciate your website and the way BoF sticks to its values of balanced journalism, which is really rare in fashion industry. You have seen many personalities of fashion and the way the industry works. From there, what is your take on racism in fashion industry? Do you think it still exists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6yz18?context=5)|I think, unfortunately, racism still exists everywhere, not just in fashion. We've still got a long way to go before we live in a world truly free of racism.
 |As for fashion in particular, one of the things I appreciate most of all is that most people in fashion truly celebrate and appreciate diversity.
 |Hopefully over time, we can play a part in sparking discussions within the the fashion world about why we all need to be conscious of how the actions we take and the decisions we make (say for example within fashion editorials, or runway shows, or in store service) need to be sensitive to everyone. Fashion is a global business and must reflect this.
[How did you grow BOF into the business it is, and how did you get taken seriously when first starting out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zfs2?context=5)|BoF started as a passion project, not as a business. This enabled me to focus on creating the best content possible, and focusing on the things that were interesting to me. The content acted as viral social objects that people would share, and then spread on social media, which further built the BoF community and the BoF brand.
 |Regarding getting taken seriously, this was a real challenge. I was a former McKinsey consultant with no previous experience in fashion, so I tried as hard as I could to learn as much about fashion as possible. I am very lucky that I had good teachers (my fashion friends) and an insatiable appetite for learning about fashion and the people who work in the industry. I built my knowledge base one conversation at a time, and this helped me build a mental map of the fashion world and how 'the business of fashion' really works.
[I work in marketing at ANN INC. but am interested in foraying into luxury marketing.  Is an MBA necessary?  Or are MBA's useless in the fashion world since it's all about whom you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zezz?context=5)|An MBA can be very useful for two reasons.
 |1) To accelerate your exisiting career path by helping you to develop general management skills (which can also enable you to demand a higher salary)
 |OR.
 |2) To pivot from your existing career path and do something completely different.
 |I went and did my MBA wanting to pivot, but ended up going back into management consulting. It was only years later that I managed to make the switch.
 |In your case, you will need to think about what additional skills you need to move into luxury marketing and decide whether an MBA can help you get there. Increasingly, I believe MBAs are seen as valuable in fashion, as long as you can understand the unique dynamics and culture of the fashion industry.
 |And to your point about knowing people -- yes that can always helps you to get a meeting, but at the end of the day it is going to come down to your skillset and resume to get the job.
[What is the biggest set back you have faced in your career and how did you respond to it?  What lessons did you learn that have helped you reach where you are today?  Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zgsl?context=5)|My first risky venture post-McKinsey, a fashion incubator, only lasted 9 months. It taught me a lot about picking the right business partner, about how important timing can be in setting up a successful business, and how you can always bounce back if you really know what your own talents are and believe in yourself. I also learned so much about fashion in those 9 months that helped build a foundation for a knowledge base about fashion.
[Which (if any\) of the old cliches/rules of thumb should no longer apply?  (e.g. no white after labor day\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6z2g3?context=5)|I don't believe in fashion rules, except that you should always be yourself and dress in a way that is appropriate to the context and culture. Be yourself and don't worry about old-fashioned rules!
[, fellow Canadian! Secondly, I love that you would do something like this. Very smart and inspiring. I don't know that I have a question so much as a need for advice. I have a fashion design concept, a plan to implement it and (most\) of the skills needed to see it through. I've been reading/watching tons on 99u, TED, and BOF and there is a lot of info and strategy for getting over that fear of failure. Its not so much the fear of failure for me, its the fear of becoming broke after quitting a day job to follow a dream that might fail. Any advice or strategies for overcoming this? Do you think having a year long break and a failed business looks better on a resume than not trying at all? How would you have proceeded if BOF had not been such a success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch705hz?context=5)|My first entrepreneurial venture failed, and making the decision to leave a secure job was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made because I too was afraid of failure -- sometimes I am still afraid of failing! But, in all honesty, that initial decision to set up my own company, while not ultimately successful, was the best decision I have ever made, and now, when presented with a safe path or a risky, exciting path, I almost always choose the risky path. Taking risks is like anything else in life...the more you do it, the easier it becomes.

Any advice on how to break into the industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zmpj?context=5)|Get to know the industry and how it works, and especially understand the culture, the creativity and the various functions of fashion so you can see where you might best fit in.

[Hello Imran, As you have interviewed and met many of the successful forces behind the worlds most revered fashion houses.

 |One of the most inspiring people I have been lucky to get to know is Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net a Porter. She has always encouraged me to pursue BoF as a business, not just a hobby. It took me a few years to build up the confidence and courage to this, but Natalie played a key role in helping me to get there. She is wonderful and amazing.
[Hi Imran. BOF is great, I read it almost daily! I am kind of new to the sector, just finished an MBA in fashion. My question is how do you see the evolution of Brick &amp; Mortar Retail? And are you bored like me with seeing the same store concept repeated ""ad infinitum"" the world over? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zq3z?context=5)|Yes, I am totally bored with identikit stores with the same product everywhere.

I had no idea about the journey it would take me on, and I am enjoying every minute! Start with your passion, align it with your career, and magical things can happen.
[My question is about your advice for building awareness for a startup brand - have you seen any really smart examples of how a designer / brand has generated the requisite ""buzz"" without investing thousands in a PR agency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zpv0?context=5)|I live in Notting Hill too!

You don't need millions of followers for this to be effective. It is more about the quality of your followers and fans, than the quantity.
[Finally, do you see BoF as having a role in the discovery / showcasing of new and emerging designers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zpv0?context=5)|And yes, showcasing new designers/brands have been part of our BoF DNA from the very beginning via our series of Spotlight article showcasing brands and designers that are showing creative and commercial promise.

[Hello Imran In your opinion are the fashion schools able to answer to industry demands? And what do you think about the young generation's preference on getting head office jobs on buying or marketing instead of evaluating a start for their careers on retail/sales where there are opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zs06?context=5)|1) Some are often sorely lacking in business training, focused solely on the creative elements of fashion, operating in vacuum from all of the other elements that make the fashion industry tick.
 |2) Others are too commercial and don't give designers enough time to develop a creative point of view...
 |The right balance between commerce and creativity is key! Plus, there needs to be more education on how technology is changing fashion and how these tools can be used to streamline the industry and amplify and aid in the creative process.
[Imran, I am one of the founders of Lola Getts Active, think Lululemon but for plus size. Although some of your articles do not pertain to our demographic there are many that are technically based towards E-Commerce.  Are you planning on doing a segment on the plus size community and the enormous opportunity it offers manufacturers and retailers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zvy7?context=5)|Last November we featured an op-ed on the opportunity in the market for plus-size fashion.

[Why are starting salaries still so low in the fashion industry, even in luxury brands, when there is so much emphasis on employees dressing well and looking fashion-forward?  There seems to be a disconnect. Will this ever change in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zx1r?context=5)|I think it might be a question of supply and demand. With so many people who want to work in fashion, and few opportunities, companies don't need to pay high salaries to attract good talent? That is just a hypothesis...but I don't know for sure.
 |As for dressing fashion forward, being fashionable doesnt necessarily require a lot of money -- it requires a good sense of style and the ability to put together a good look from what you have.
[What did you think about what Lawrence Lenihan said in his op-ed about the end of $1 billion fashion brands?  What do you think the dominant business structure for fashion designers going forward will be?  Link here for the article. Link to www.businessoffashion.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch700wf?context=5)|Lawrence is an amazing Op-Ed writer because he takes a very strong position on everything related to entrepreneurship in the fashion sector. I do think that we need to spend less time focusing on building huge businesses, and more time focusing on building great, sustainable businesses!
[In all of your research and interviews, have you met any designers that particularly stand out to you in terms of they way they run their business and/or maintain their personal lives? How do you think they manage to be successful on both fronts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zy2m?context=5)|Tory Burch has a great balance between her personal and professional lives, and leaves the office at 6pm everyday to spend time with her three sons. This is admirable.
 |Setting clear professional/personal boundaries is important...
[What was the catalyst for you to quit the corporate path at 30 and switch to a less conventional and less secure job in a newly emerging fashion blogging community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zlcf?context=5)|I was feeling unfulfilled by my work, and knew somewhere inside of me that if I combined my analytical skills within a creative context, I might be able to find a career path that was more up my alley. I had reached the end of my tether and felt like I had no other option but to try. I am really glad that I did.
[Hi Imran, In relation to BOF why is it, considering you've created such an amazing space for intelligent fashion journalism, that you don't pay for the freelance pieces you commission and publish? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch704ic?context=5)|For a long time, I was not able to pay freelancers as BoF was not run as a business. People contributed from all over the world because they shared my passion for the business of fashion. Today, we do pay our freelancers.
[Hello Imran, I had the opportunity to meet you once and really admire your work. It seems that fashion still has a long way to go when it comes to embracing technology and vice-versa. Apple hired former YSL CEO Paul Deneve and Burberry's historic now ex-CEO Angela Ahrendts sending a strong message to both industries. Many people seem to think that their plan is to only launch an i-watch but Apple is known for redefining paradigms and being a trendsetter, not a follower... I truly believe it will be much more than a device: they are most likely aiming for the whole wardrobe. Do you believe that may be the case? If there is a radical shift in the way people dress in the next following years which brands do you see striving and thriving? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch713gv?context=5)|I have no idea what Apple has up its sleeves, but certainly the recent moves make this a company to watch!

[Hello Imran, and thanks so much for doing this AMA. You mentioned that BOF started as a passion project. How did you pivot to running it as business, and what was the catalyst?  BOF has become my daily and it's honestly indispensable since I decided to change careers and start a luxury label.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch70rsc?context=5)|My decision to focus on BoF full time came as a natural extension of the growth of BoF -- I simply couldn't manage it any more on the very lean infrastructure that I had in place. In order to continue down the journey I had started, I had to dedicate myself to it full time and find the team of people and investors who could help me. I am very lucky and grateful that I have found people who believe in my vision for BoF.

What fashion business do you think is in trouble? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zzp2?context=5)|I am watching Mulberry very carefully. They seem to have let a very successful business strategy unravel disastrously. The share price is down over 60% since the arrival (and departure) of the CEO Bruno Guillon who attempted to position the brand higher...it's a cautionary tale.
[Will Apple's technocratic culture have the patience for Angela Ahrendts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zukc?context=5)|Only time will tell on this. I am keen to see how Angela's contributions at Apple will help to bring a new point of view to what is a very strong culture, with a very 'Jobsian' way of dealing with things. Let's see!
[Hi, Imran. How did you navigate forging relationships in the fashion industry? I'm a current economics student looking to bridge that gap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zv0s?context=5)|Network, cold call, tell everyone you know you are interested in meeting people who work in fashion.

I have a fairly strong resume: two successful academic (but real-client consulting projects) and a strong case competition, two non-consulting internships, speak four languages, have recommendations from two consulting professors, strong leadership positions in extracurriculars, minus a low GPA (3.3).

How hard would it be to apply come the fall as a graduate? I'm seeking for Deloitte or Accenture type entry-level analyst position...

There is 4 full time IT guys there, and myself being an after school intern. I have no idea what ""skill level"" these ITs are at, because I haven't troubleshooted any issues yet. But from this tale, I don't think of them too highly. 


The main reason I was brought on was to help with the new computer rollout. These Core i5 machines were going to replace aging pentium 4's. Now we setup all the computers in their labs, 500 desktops across 20 labs and 3 schools. Now, the senior IT hands me a hard drive and says here image all of these computers. 


At first, it seems like a standard imaging process. So I start imaging hard drives and notice that Windows XP pops out.. funny these say Windows 7 on the stickers. Thinking he somehow gave me the wrong hard drive, I go back to him and tell him. I'm still face palming over this conversation...
     Nyy8: Hey Boss, I think you might have given me the wrong hard drive? This image is of Windows XP. 
     Senior IT: That's the right image alright.
     Nyy8: So... when are we upgrading to Windows 7? 
     Senior IT: But nothing is wrong with XP? 
     Nyy8: (At this point, I was confused and face palming) Yeah, your right! How could I be so silly. 


In the end, every machine got installed with Windows XP Pro and 6 months later they still are running XP. With no plans to upgrade them...

I am a Junior student with 3.67/4.00 GPA from Turkey. Biggest problem is I am the laziest and least competitive person I've ever known. I always hated school, homework etc. Somehow, I managed my way through them and got accepted to the best university in my country with full scholarship.

I chose CS major because it is only thing I can slightly enjoy. I'm good with computers since I was 5-6 years old, started by playing games at my dad's shop computer by writing their names to the Dos screen without even knowing how to read/write. I simply loved them and decided to work with them as I grow up. However, I never been a geek, and started to learn programming only when I was almost 18(I am 22). I chose to learn C++ because I wanted to pursue a career at game development and thought learning C++ would be more realistic.

Due to my limited knowledge of C++, I never had any trouble in college. First two programming courses, I didn't do anything related to school and got the highest grades of my program. For all other courses, I barely attended the lectures, only, stayed up all night before the exams studying and got really great grades.

Last summer I did an internship in Netherlands, at a University. I learnt Django and JavaScript, but I can say my 3 months internship consisted 2 months of smoking pot and drinking.

My biggest project and the first step of start realizing my dreams was a game project I did with my roommate for the opengl course. At first I was really hyped, but after figure out and coded the basic network/gameplay mechanics, I was done, I lost my interest, hated opengl, game development and my roommate who kept adding the futures no one really cares, like the game was the most important thing in his life.

I realized, I only care about 'how it's made'. I'm curious about how something is achieved, learn about it, try it out a little and it's gone for me.

Right now, I am desperately looking for an internship because its compulsory, that roommate(who has much lower gpa then me and same side experience) got accepted from the only place I'd like to work in Turkey. I still don't know if they'd accept me as well but this situation is eating me out slowly. Please don't get me wrong, this is not about him but he is the only example in front of me. I got rejected from couple of companies around Europe due to my scope and or enthusiasm.

Currently I live in a Europe country as an exchange student and still doing great at school here as well. However, my days are only about go out drinking or sit in my room in depression spending 8-9 hours in front of the computer literally doing nothing, can't even enjoy a movie. Because I know I have to do something for improving and feel guilty.

I don't like this situation, everybody is keep telling me that I am 'wasting my potential'. I know I can do much better, but the thing is, what if I don't want to? That's the question I'm most afraid to answer, because I have no other option.

Details in comments.,rb7_brady,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/24kghh/help_i_showed_up_late_to_my_interview_im_trying/,"I just interviewed for a summer internship position at an IT company that i am interested in. I'm a dummy and thought the interview was at 2 instead of 1 oclock when it really was. I realized before 1, but still showed up about 10 minutes late. 

I called before the interview time to tell them i would be late, and i also apologized at the start of the interview. Is this something i should repeat in the email? One of my main concerns is that i dont want it to reflect poorly on an employee who recommended me to his boss for the position. Is that something i should state? Or should i just leave all of this out of the email?

I'm a 20 year old backend engineer with a strong server administration and networking background. I'm running a small business and rented office space 9 months ago. My office is hidden away in a seperate part of the main owner's building. The owner is a Microsoft fanatic who looks like a pathetic wanna-be small version of Bill Gates, so I'll refer to him as PGATES from now on.

PGATES runs a ""multi-location"" business, consisting of aforementioned  main office and 5 other phantom locations with mail forwarding. He employs a secretary and a few freelancers. 

As soon as I moved in, he started pondering me with requests. Sure, no problem man. He helped me out big time by letting me have the office rent-free for 4 months, I'd gladly return the favor. What was unknown to me at the time was that the favor turned out to be a huge-ass enterprise website (to ""show the world what we can do and make them think we're a enterprise"") and 2 different iPhone/Android apps for a whopping $500 total, but that's a different story for now.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my life. I liked work, I liked the people in the office and everything was totally fine. I was the ""go-to IT guy"" for everyone and processed maybe 2-3 tickets a week. 

Then, 1st of April came around. I finally convinced PGATES to employ me part-time. I came through the front door and immediately noticed a buzzing noise that seemed to come from the ceiling. Upstairs, I was greeted by a VERY pissed off looking secretary and a pretty annoyed looking intern. The buzzing noise was now very notable. 

&gt; Mo3: What's going on here?

&gt; Secretary: Check the kitchen.

Outside the kitchen, the humming noise was now incredibly loud. Hesitant I opened the door to find PGATES running around like a kid on christmas. Then I noticed it. The server rack from hell.

In the 40ft² kitchen sat a huge 19"" server rack filled up to the top with Intel Modular servers. The air in the tiny kitchen was so hot and stuffy that I couldn't breathe. 

&gt; Mo3: What the FUCK!

&gt; PGATES: I knew you'd appreciate it! Just take a look at this beauty, I got it for a great price. 

&gt; Mo3: ............................... what is this for?!

&gt; PGATES: You know, Exchange and stuff! Every big business has to have one of these data centers. I know you have a server background and we can tell clients that we have our own Cloud! 

&gt; Mo3: ............... that's cool.. let me have a cigarette real quick

&gt; (5 minutes later)

&gt; PGATES: Ah good, Mo3! I want this set up until tomorrow evening. That shouldn't be hard for a IT person of your caliber, right? Just install THE cloud on it!

&gt; Mo3: Okay, first of all, there is no such thing as ""THE clou""--

&gt; PGATES: OF COURSE THERE IS! Microsoft has one, Apple has one, even Dropbox has one! We are trying to expand as quickly as possible so we need the best of the best in terms of infrastructure. 

&gt; Mo3: We can use XenServer for virtualization yeah, combine all of these servers into a pool and..--

&gt; PGATES: NO I don't want virtual ZenServers! I want THE CLOUD!

&gt; Mo3: ... Got it. But first I have a couple of questions regarding this.. setup here. How do you plan on cooling it? And do you have any idea how much power this consumes? Frankly this is a little bit overkill for your requireme..--

&gt; PGATES: YOU DON'T GET IT DO YOU? I want this business to play in the master league with the big players! Microsoft! Apple! Intel! I've already found a great solution for cooling *points to a tilted small window in the corner with a fan in front of it* and I don't care about power! Look, I even got a APC for it *points to a huge 20kVA APC behind the rack*


2 weeks later, the pool was fully operational ([Xen resource overview](http://i.imgur.com/3LgvgWD.png)). But that wasn't the end of it. Far from it. 

A few days later my phone rings. It's PGATES.

&gt; PGATES: Hey Mo3 there's a guy from the call center above for you.

&gt; Mo3: Okay..

&gt; BEEP BEEP

&gt; Mo3: IT at (PGATES' mental ward)?

&gt; CG: HEY IT'S CG. Could you please turn down the volume of your fucking servers down there?

&gt; Mo3: I'm very sorry but there's no way to turn do..--

&gt; CG: BULLSHIT! You're just incompetent. Go figure out how to turn down the god damn volume, our callers can hear 
it buzzing through the fucking phone. Now. And don't make me call again.

&gt; Mo3: Alright sir, I'll try. *click*

&gt; BEEP BEEP

&gt; Mo3: He wants us to turn down the.. volume.. of our servers.

&gt; PGATES: Then do it! There must be a volume control switch somewhere. It's a Intel server after all! You're a IT legend, that shouldn't be too hard for you.

&gt; *click*

At this point I'm like, fuck it. I'm gonna turn off every unused server. So I do that, the volume level goes down drastically and CG congratulates me on ""using my brain"".

2 hours later, PGATES bursts through my office door, his head red like a lobster. 

&gt; PGATES: What the hell Mo3! I told you, we need all of these servers turned on for the best possible performance!

&gt; Mo3: NO! Why the fuck would we need 30 running physical servers with 960GB of RAM for 2 VMs with Windows Server that use 16GB RAM combined?!

&gt; PGATES: DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! I know what I'm talking about. Turn on these servers and distribute them in THE CLOUD!


Keeping emotionally unstable callcenter guy in mind, I solved that problem by having a Raspberry Pi hit the Modular control panel's ""indicate position"" feature every 200ms for each component which made almost every LED blink constantly, essentially faking activity. PGATES was happy again, rejoicing over the ""beautiful symphony of blinking data"", and peace returned.

For 2 days. Today he noticed that the blinking LEDs didn't blink like the ones of the 2 active servers did, so he made me turn on all servers again. An hour later callcenter guy called again in pure rage and told me to ""fucking turn down the volume or he'll smash the servers to pieces"". PGATES told me to turn down the volume again. Sure you fucking dumbass nutjob I thought as I turned off as much fans as possible, lowering the volume to acceptable levels once again.

Lunchtime comes around. I just finished setting up the Raspberry Pi to ping all servers and services, check their health and send out alerts to my handheld radio/pager as a consequence of permanent hard disk failures (PGATES bought 180 used 6-8 year old HDDs). I'm behind the building smoking weed with PGATES' new cute redhead intern when all hell breaks loose. 

&gt; Radio: BEEEEEEEEP --- CRITICAL ALERT. APC ACTIVE. 

&gt; Radio: CRITICAL ALERT. SERVER 1 UNRESPONSIVE.

&gt; Radio: CRITICAL ALERT. SERVER 2 UNRESPONSIVE.

This continues for pretty much every server in the rack while I'm running up the stairs as fast as possible. Upstairs I'm greeted by the pleasant smell of burned technology. The thermometer in the tiny kitchen showed 126°F.

I am currently a CS major and junior at a state college. I recently completed a data structures course (A-) and I would say that I have intermediate level knowledge of Java and beginning level knowledge of C. About a few weeks ago, my school hosted a programming competition so I thought I would participate to assess my skill level and have fun at the same time. The problem is that I was only able to solve one out of six problems in the given time frame. My solution, although correct, was marked down heavily by the automated grader for being time intensive. This was very concerning for me since I realize how competitive computer science majors are both in my local area and nationally. 

I know that the obvious solution would be to just practice more. I did try practicing with past Google Code Jam problems and ACM contests but I always got stuck in the middle of implementing a solution and ended up having to look at the answer. Whenever I did correctly solve a problem, I noticed that my code was way too inefficient (too many loops / unnecessary checks / using an unsuited data structure) compared to the standard solution. I experience the same problems with inefficiency in my programming classes as well.

I feel like I have gaps in my knowledge of thinking algorithmically but I can't exactly pinpoint where it is. I want to be able to reach the level where I can at least solve 3-5 out of 6 problems in a competition, just like my peers, and I also don't want to be the stereotypical bad programmer that everyone has to clean up afterwards at my future internships. Do you have any recommendations for web resources or physical books that will allow me to refine my programming techniques (algorithms, data structures, and problem solving skills)? Also are there any solid resources for practicing for programming competitions other than the ones I mentioned? Thanks for reading this post."

The reason my boss gave was because I still had school to finish. The issue is that the full time people there already told me that school has nothing to do with it as they would say come back when you're done with school.


So I don't know the real reason why I didn't get an offer (I think my boss didn't like me personally, but have no proof of that just a gut feeling) despite getting better than expectations on all my reviews (on par or better than the other interns) and even having my employment extended (was originally only suppose to work until March, but was extended after my review for another 6 weeks). 



Well I received a letter from the company asking for me to sign it so if another employer contacts them they can say more than the current company policy of employment time and job title.


I'm not sure if I should sign this paper. While I didn't plan on using my main boss as a reference anyways, I do plan on using coworkers and another boss who I also worked for (on the same level as my main boss, but worked with him when his team fell behind) who loved me and is actually trying to get me back at this company to work for him. My fear is somehow a company down the road will find out who my main boss was and talk to them and I have no idea what will be said. So signing the paper will help with that, but hurt with my other references. What should I do?"
24mwf5,0,2014-05-03,Career and Grad School Advice/Rant for soon to be Senior Math major,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/24mwf5/career_and_grad_school_advicerant_for_soon_to_be/,"
Hi!

So I'm posting because I need some advice. I'm currently a Junior Math major at a top 30 public school and currently at a crossroads about where I want to take my math major and want I want to study in my life. (This is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance! There is TL;DR at the end.)


I was premed when I first entered school. (My high school had a CNA program that I went through). After my first semester I realized this wasn't the path I wanted to take. I then started taking astronomy classes because astronomy and cosmology was always something that I was interested in. After taking those and really enjoying them I decided to try and major in physics (my school doesn't really have a separate major for Astronomy; we just have an astronomy and astrophysics option within the physics major.) And then introductory mechanics happened. I passed the class (D+), but it left me scarred. I had never taken a physics class before and I put many, many hours of studying (a lot of all-nighters) in because I wanted to do well. I was meeting with one professor twice a week and still did terribly. It didn't help that a majority of the people in the class had taken physics before and the class was more application based, so as a result I had to really learn the concepts on my own.


After those I decided to take some summer classes, one of which was differential equations. It has without a doubt been one of my favorite classes that I have taken in college. The instructor was awesome and I really liked the material. After that I decided to become a math major. I then took electromagnetism because it was required and while the class was better I only passed with a C.


At this point I was completely turned off from school and grad school. I just wanted to get my degree and start my career. The issue with that is I don't really know what that career would look like so I decided to add a major or minor in Statistics and Operations Research to help out with job prospects. As time passed and I got closer to becoming a senior, I started to really freak out because I didn't really know what I wanted to do after college. 


I know I want to pursue something math/astronomy related, but the problem is that I'm not involved with anything really involving math/astronomy at my school. One of my regrets in coming to college is not deciding to major in math sooner so I could get involved with things like research. I'm involved with a lot of groups around campus, but none of them are math or astronomy focused. I have a job in a social justice leadership program that lasts all 4 years of college, I'm a tour guide for my university, I have participated in a couple of medical service trips abroad, and I even got to study abroad on a scholarship the summer after my first year. I am also beginning to solve this issue as well. I have been talking to various advisers and professors in our math and stats departments. Another one of my interests is dynamics and chaos theory so I have been talking to professors about that as well. One of the professors in the physics department is a theoretical cosmologist, so I have been in contact with advisers about doing research in the fall for academic credit under potentially in the summer and the fall. Either way, I will be doing some type of research in the fall either as a volunteer, as a job, or for academic credit.


Another one of my regrets is that I didn’t know how to adequately study for my classes. I have ADHD and this mixed with being terrible at time management my first few years caused my GPA to take some hits. I have begun to rectify this by meeting with a counselor, so this semester is the first one in which I actually feel like I know how to study for my classes and prioritize my schedule. But I have been freaking out about this lately and it has been distracting me from my academics. This is a big problem because my school is currently in the middle of finals and I have my real analysis exam on Monday followed by my linear algebra exam on Tuesday.


I have narrowed down the possibilities to 3 possible options. I will be in my universities town over the summer, taking classes, having at least two flexible part time jobs, and ready books to prepare myself for senior year


* The first is to double major in Math and Statistics and Operations Research, so I can find a job after I graduate and I don’t need to go to grad school. The stats department offers an internship that can give you academic credit, so I would definitely do that spring of my senior year. I like this option because I think it is the best one to prepare to find a job right after college. I like the idea of working a 9 to 5 job and then being able to relax once I get off. I don’t have to worry about school, and I’ll have time for my hobbies like reading or learning a programming language. The major issue with this option is that I still don’t know what that job would be or what I would be applying for. I’m keeping the option of becoming an actuary, so I’ll probably be studying for the first exam over the summer for this option.


* The second option is to major in just math and have a minor in stats. This option is most geared towards graduate school in math (for something in dynamics or chaos theory). Over the summer I would be preparing to take the GRE and the math subject test in the fall. For the option I would completely immerse myself in math to prepare for research and my classes in the fall. This way I would be able to figure if I like an environment in which I eat, breath, and sleep math. 


* The third option is basically the same as the second, but instead of math I would focus on physics to try and get into graduate school for theoretical cosmology. It is too late for me to major in physics, so I’ll be reading numerous books to try and catch up. I like and dislike this option at the same time because while I love cosmology, I don’t know if I like physics. The astronomy classes I have taken in which cosmology was a topic that was discussed have been some of my favorite classes. While I really like math, I have never been giddy with excitement about what I was learning. That has only happened once, and it was when I was learning about inflation and the potential for multiple universes. That was the only time in which I felt like I could shout to the world how much I loved the material. So if I follow this option I would eat, breath, and sleep physics to see if I could do this for the rest of my life.


If you’ve made it this far, then you are a freaking saint! So my actual question is what is the job market and the day to day life for each one of these? For the 3rd option, what math courses should I take to prepare myself for cosmology and what books should I read to catch up on. I have more upcoming meetings and emails to send to research and pre-graduate advisers. My course schedule for my last year looks drastically different for each one of these so any and all advice y’all have is welcome. To the people who read all of this, y’all are champs! Like I said I have two exams coming up so I’m blocking all distracting websites, but I will be checking this on my phone. Thanks in advance! Please excuse any formatting errors, I'm pretty new to reddit.

**TL;DR**
Math Major not sure what option to do heading into my senior year of college. Schedule looks drastically different for the 3 below options

* Math and Stats so I can find a job after college
* Just Math and then math grad school for dynamics or chaos theory
* Just math and prepare for physics grad school for theoretical cosmology

I've heard that their interviews are really tough, so I'm kind of worried.

What should I read to be a better theoretical CS student? In particular, I'm interested in existing literature, since I'm getting a lot of recent (2005+) papers from my advisor as it is, so textbooks and the like would be appreciated. So far, the only theoretical CS course I've taken is Discrete Math (which is basically normal discrete with a lot of program analysis and decidability thrown in).

I've taken a lot of math (I took ODE/PDE, linear algebra, MVC, and complex analysis in high school and matrix theory in college), so I'm looking for more CS-heavy things. Anything would be appreciated, though. Thanks!"

24nw1h,2,2014-05-03,Research over summer or internship?,tetraphenylphenyldia,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/24nw1h/research_over_summer_or_internship/,"I'm a junior, MatSci major. Money's not an issue as I would be earning money either way.

If I were to do research, I would get to finish what I've been working on and quite likely get a paper published. Since my goal is to go to PhD, it would be greatly helpful. Not to mention that it would look good to the PI for sticking around to see the project to the end. The grad student that's heading this project is also trying to wrap up the work by this September as well.

However, doing the internship also seems pretty good, since the field of the internship is what I want to work on with my PhD and the rest of my life, and it's quite different from the research I'm doing now.

I could do both, by doing the internship for the first half of the summer and research for the latter half. However, doing the internship for 8 weeks would leave too little time to do the research, while doing the internship for just 4 weeks is, well, too short to get anything meaningful done.

I presume that this company (plus others) would be willing to hire next year as well, but since it's also a pretty good opportunity, I don't want to miss it either. And it's dat dere industry experience, the thing that makes the difference between an employed person and a neckbeard living in his parents' basement (this point is especially important should I decide not to do a PhD or do it much later).

I understand that Computer Science ! = Programming and anyone, anywhere can be a programmer with the amount of resources available online and in paper format.

Although, I do want to ask how big of an impact do the CS concepts actually affect a competant developer, things such as Big-Omnicron, Algorithms, Data Structures, Semnatics, et al vs. a self-taught one.

* One example I read somewhere was how a team of self-taught's program took 8 hours to run vs. a CS intern's 7 mins because he/she knew all the Big-O complexity stuff.

My program is extremely heavy in digital methods, and although I did not have a very technical background coming in, the graduate students that are finishing their degrees have a lot of technical experience in corpus management, speech synthesis, speech analysis, and programming. I have completely fallen in love with these areas of study.

Before this program, I never would have dreamed that I would be interested in a CS career. Now I am very interested specifically in computational linguistics and I am wondering how I can find a position working in natural language processing or linguistic data management.

As I am just now starting the program, I have two years to mold myself into this new-found and unexpected passion for computational linguistics. I already have the opportunity to intern doing exactly this kind of work, so that can be crossed off on my to-do list. I also teach robotics and a technology course currently. Is there anything else I can do within the next two years that will allow me to get a job in this field?

I am afraid that even with two years to prepare, I will still not be able to find anything because my degree name says 'linguistics' instead of 'computer science.' Are computational linguistics positions extremely difficult to get? There seems to be a wide variety of them available when I search for them, but I do not know what the competition is like.

I'm currently a Software Developer II for a Fortune-500 company in the South.


I graduated last May with a just under a 3.0 overall in Computer Engineering, and had very minor internship experience. I knew I'd have to work my way up to begin with job-wise.


I was hired on as a Software Developer making around 52k base salary, and after receivng a lot of praise, was quickly offered a raise 4 months later, putting me at 56k.

Year reviews came around recently, I was reviewed as a ""5/5 - Role Model"" in the top 5% of Software Developer I's in the company. I was given bump to 62k base a year, and a promotion to Software Developer II.


The company is leading me in the direction of project management, and is offering to pay 100% of costs for me to start working on my EMBA in the fall at a top 20 business college.

----


My question/concerns are this:

I like the actual work enough, but if I start on my EMBA, I'll be here another 3-5 years. (You must stay 3 years after completion to not owe money.)

I was considering look elsewhere throughout the country now, but my parents have expressed concerns that I'll be viewed as a ""job hopper"", and that I should really wait till I've acquired 3-5 years of work experience.

Thing is, I don't necessarily want a long-term career at this current company, I have no wife/chidren, and frankly feel a bit underpaid in this area in general.

Should I look elsewhere? What advice is there in terms of the length of time one remains in one job?"

I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. I am a junior in CS. My resume in all honesty, is not that great. I really am aware of this. I am trying to make the most of it since I am applying for internships. My lack of experience definitely shines right through. My GPA is not on there because it is not particularly great, I mean, it is downright ugly (2.7). To be fair to myself, a large part of my grades has been due to a bad work ethic from high school, it was not the lack of understanding or being overwhelmed by the difficulty of the content, but in fact the sheer boredom of doing regular home work that led me to my bad grades. I obviously was wrong, and have been trying hard not to make the same mistakes anymore. 

In all honesty, I am not exactly going for the Big 4, a simple internship at a mid to big company would be what I am aiming for. To gain experience of how development is done in the industry.

Sorry for the long post, I figured knowing my situation might help you advice me better. So, what do you think of my resume? 
Thank you again, for all the things you guys have helped me learn here on this subreddit.

I have a rather complicated background and I would like some advice on what should I do next in order to get an internship after freshman year (I know there are some post about this, but my situation is rather different then those out there).

I am an international student (from a non-English speaking country in Europe) and I will be a freshman in the fall at Illinois Institute of Technology (if it matters). I discovered programming in hs. My teacher is one of the best in algorithms, but every time I wanted to develop an application of some kind he advised me against it and said that I should focus on algorithm. The other problem that I encountered (but found out about it just a few weeks ago) is that I have been using a rather basic programming technique (I code C++, but I mainly work with basic loops and variables, rarely with lists, structures or predefined functions and definitely not OOP). After my admission to college I was approached by a professor and he offered me a research opportunity in distributed systems (which I know nothing about) and I accepted it (why not?).

So to sum up: I have a strong algorithm knowledge, but code them in a primitive way, I have no apps and honestly no idea of how to build one, but I will be doing research in Distributed Systems and have a lot of free time and will. 

I would want you to help me figure out what should I do in the near future to ensure that I get an internship in the summer after my freshman year (2015) because I really need it to pay for my living expenses. Should I modernize my coding and if yes, how? Should I start building apps and if yes can you give me some further advice? Should I focus on my DS research?

Basically until a few weeks ago (when I began to browse the internet a lot about programming) I thought I had strong chances of getting a job, but now I don't and I'm freaked out!

Thank you so much for your help and sorry for asking these stupid questions!"

That was part of my problem for the first year but now that I am dual certified in two states I am trying to figure out what could be keeping me from getting a job??

During my interviews I am always professionally dressed, I always bring a list of questions to ask, and I always bring examples of things I did during my student teaching internships (lesson plans, classroom management techniques, schedules, etc.). The interviews always seem to go really well and always go the full time (I have been told that if they don't like you they can cut your interview short, so it is always good if it goes the full time) and they always tell me they are really impressed afterwards. However, I never get picked for the job in the end and I end up checking the mail to see that I have received another rejection letter.

What could I be doing wrong? Am I even doing anything wrong? If they are so impressed with me and really like my credentials why do I keep getting rejected? I know the teaching market isn't doing so great (it was when I first started my degree) but I am hoping something gives soon!


I have heard that getting into a substitute position really helps get your foot in the door. I am hoping I can do that once my Husband gets a job after he graduates law school next week.

24q63y,0,2014-05-04,Graduate Admission Decision (MSCS) : Should I choose SJSU or SFSU?,epochElipse,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/24q63y/graduate_admission_decision_mscs_should_i_choose/,"My Background:
Non-CS Undergrad (Architecture)
Fairly new to CS - began taking fundamentals courses at my local CC 1.5 years ago
Non-Traditional student (35 years old)

My Dilemma:
I have conditional admits to both bay area schools. SFSU is requiring 2 foundation courses, but SJSU is requiring 7!  This means that it would take roughly 1 year longer to complete the degree from SJSU than from SFSU.

The pragmatic side of me says to choose SFSU because I would finish 1 year sooner, and because the concentrations in SE or Business offered seem to fit my situation (links below).  The program description seems to market them as a more practical program that actually ""prepares you for the software industry,""  I mention this because I am aware of the debate regarding CS majors that come into the SE industry with ""too much theoretical knowledge"" and ""too little programming skills"".

SFSU MSCS - General
Computer Science

SFSU MSCS - Software Engineering
Computer Science

SFSU MSCS - Computing &amp; Business
Computer Science

That said, I recognize that SJSU is probably a more complete CS education and a more respected degree.  In my situation, however, that extra year is a major factor as I am already ""late to the game.""  Purists will cringe, but I am a little wary of ""theoretical overkill.""  Ideally, 100% of what I learn would actually be applicable to my new career.  Ideally.  

SJSU MSCS - General
Department of Computer Science

I also think that SJSU may offer better internship &amp; recruitment opportunities due to it's adjacency to SV.  Is SFSU at a clear disadvantage here?  Or am I wrong to assume that?  

My Anticipated Future Role in CS / SE:
I am a competent programmer and do enjoy problem solving a great deal.  However, I know I will never be a ""superstar hacker"", nor do I aspire to be one.  I am more than willing to pay dues and get the experience needed, but I am hoping to eventually leverage my experience in project management and design from my architecture background into areas like PM, HCI, UX in the software industry.  I feel like I have the ""soft people skills"" that might go unused in the wrong role.

Are there any SFSU grads or those familiar with the program that can comment?  I'd really like to know if any have suffered from or noticed the SFSU degree being disrespected??"

An overpowered workstation that dictates traffic and runs an enormous amount of custom scripts. Beside it should be an intrusion prevention machine, another overpowered workstation that should be our traffic watch dog. Except, that machine is missing and our IDS box is turned off.

&gt;BBB: Is something wrong?

&gt;Me: Someone stole our IPS box and turned off our IDS box. Whatever is happening is definitely internal. Someone \*\*\*\*ed us and \*\*\*\*ed us hard. Honestly, please turn off the servers. If they have an open connection to our computers they can delete practically everything and take us offline for days or weeks.

&gt;BBB: You stupid IT people, how could you let this happen? 

&gt;Me: I actually can't deal with you still. As well, this guy is just getting introduced to our situation and couldn't have been part of this.

&gt;BBB: How do we know? You said this was an inside job! What if it was you?

&gt;Me: I'm trying to fix this. Excuse me but I have to call the police about the missing machine here.

&gt;BBB: Wait! The machine isn't missing, its in my office. Don't call the police, I own these computers anyways, I can't steal them.

&gt;Me: I seriously can't believe you right now. Prove it.

After a short walk and a bit more explaining of the IT situation to my friend in the elevator, we make it to the BBB office. The machine is inexplicably on his desk, cords going no where.

&gt;Me: Why is that there?

&gt;BBB: I wasn't able to recieve a dot ek-zee in a zip file, and I asked one of our techs why I couldn't. He said its your custom stuff that locks me down. I am starting to think I might have made a tiny mistake here if this is actually related to the hackers.

&gt;Friend: HAHAHAHAHA! Oh my God are you serious?

&gt;BBB (Still angry): What exactly are you contributing here?

&gt;Me: The joke here is that its not 'related'. It's entirely your fault. If that machine is turned off, all our techs get sent messages instantly because its so important for that to be up 100% of the time. You unplugged the machine that sends those messages before taking this box to your room. 

&gt;BBB: How much are you going to charge me for you not putting this in the documentation?

&gt;BBB: Good. Get working, and fix the documentation when you're done.

After another elevator trip with the machine in hand, I just had to think about how BBB functions as a human being. I showed my friend out the door after plugging everything back in. I took a look at the outgoing traffic after everything booted back up and took out my phone.

24srhr,15,2014-05-05,internship vs research?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24srhr/internship_vs_research/,"I'm currently a junior CS major and I'm having trouble deciding what to do over the summer. I have two options: I could either spend the summer doing an internship or I could do research with a professor. The internship requires me to learn ruby on rails and git by June 1st, is unpaid, and I have to put 20-30 hours a week in. The research is for an internet radio website and we're using the standard web technologies like HTML, Javascript, CSS etc., I make my own hours, and I do get part time pay. 

My main question is will the internship look better than research on a resume? It may be a stupid question, but I've always heard that unless you get an internship, you won't get a job. No one ever mentions research and frankly, I would rather do the research with my professor because he is actually paying me and I'm more interested in the technologies he's using rather than Rails, which is what the internship is using.

I already accepted the internship, but he's not paying me and there was no contract or anything signed, so I want to back out to spend time on the internet radio research and have more time for personal projects as well. Is this a bad idea? Can anyone tell me what they think about research vs an internship on a resume?"

I obtained an internship in January (I'm a junior at a university) at a startup as a web developer. It only paid $7.50 an hour as a contractor, but I was like, whatever-- I wanted to learn web dev, and this seemed like a fun opportunity.

It wasn't a bad time, but I didn't learn as much as I wanted to. Granted, I only worked about 20 hours a week due to class. 


Now, I'm about to work ~35~40 hours a week, and I'm about to get paid an X amount a month, but when i calculate that X amount, I get less than $7 an hour....


Is this fair? I'm going to talk with my boss relatively soon. I understand this is a start up and they did say you won't get paid as much, but I didn't except under minimum wage. I get that I'm a 'contractor' but still..


EDIT: New question... do Contractors need a ""2 week notice"" as well?


EDIT2: If I do quit, I want another web dev job. If I can't get one, would it still be smarter to quit and take a retail job for the summer? I'm still a student and was using this as ""internship experience"" but yeah.."

However, I do have a good internship with a big 3 company(microsoft, amazon, google) coming up, and I go to a good school. Here are my pros and cons, essentially:

    **Pros**
    Big 3 Internship
    Open Source Contribution
    Research Work (very brief)
    Good university (UIUC)
    Good interviewer (problem solving, whiteboard coding, personable) 

    **Cons**
    Pretty bad GPA
    Networking (most of my friends are not in CS/engineering, working on fixing that)

Do I still have a chance of landing a decent job in the Fall? Or should I take an extra semester to boost my GPA before I start looking? The whole GPA thing is really getting me down. "

I am searching for some resources on how to write a high quality SDK for a devices. I will be joining a startup soon and my role will be to write a SDK for their device.

I know how to program, I have a bachelor in software engineering and have some professional experience  through some internships plus through personal projects. How ever, I have no experience in writing an SDK, and I don't really have any experience in gaming development. Eventually, that SDK will have to work with Unity and Unreal engine. Again, I don't have experience with those engine either.

Now, I believe I might be tackling a project that is bigger than I can chew, but I'd be interested in any kind of resources on how to write a quality SDK. Like, what are some common pattern that people use, maybe a framework for that. Maybe a quality, open source, sdk you know about that I can inspire myself from.

24u2pq,9,2014-05-05,[2nd year CS Major] Uneasy about future.,CSCOLLEGESTUDENT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24u2pq/2nd_year_cs_major_uneasy_about_future/,"A little about myself: 8 years ago I graduated high school with the bare minimum to get out. I disliked school and had zero intent to go to college and didn't take part in any planning or steps an average student would take for their future. 2 years after graduation, I was given a job doing graphic design and some minor web design/development (two hobbies of mine) for a small marketing company. This job fell into my lap and I was incredibly lucky for the opportunity. The pay wasn't great and I lived at home with my parents but enjoyed the work, especially any thing involving PHP programming. After 5 years I quit my job and moved across the country with my family and enrolled in a local community college, where my passion for school was reignited, and am currently holding a 3.8 GPA and working through my credits towards a Bachelors in Computer Science. My 'dream job' would be some marriage of Programming and Art(creativity) like Web Development/Design or App development, or possibly something in Software Engineering/Design perhaps, but really anything that involves Programming and problem solving is what I love.

Now my problem. As I stated, I am in my mid-twenties attending a community college full time, and I cannot help but feel like I am just being churned through the system. My computer science curriculum focuses on C++, and even after two semesters I feel like an amateur or worse. I also have taken some classes that dig deeper into the ""how"" computers work and basic computer language/compilers and that stuff felt way over my head yet still passed the classes. I will most likely be transferring to a local 4-year university soon and am very worried that I was rubber-stamped and pushed through, leaving my knowledge versus a university level understanding of Computer Science much to be desired. 

Is it possible to use the free resources available on the internet and properly bring one's self to the level that one needs to be at to enter higher CS level courses? And what about graduation? Should I be learning more languages in parallel to my C++ classes? And where does one learn about opportunities for internships and experience outside of the classroom?

I apologize if this is rambling or incoherent, I essentially was hoping for some guidance into the steps I should take or the things I can do to make the transition from what feels like someone who is earning a CS degree but will struggle to use it, to someone who will be successful after graduation."

Thoughts?,ttthrowaway25,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/24u57u/transferring_from_community_college_planning_on/,"I have been accepted to SAS for CS and I think it would be a good time for me to move out. I will live on-campus if I can't afford it or if it involves me taking out any private loans, but I would prefer to live off-campus for two reasons: my family situation is tense, and living near Rutgers would provide me with more internship opportunities. I currently live far south in NJ with very few tech companies around and living near NYC and Philly would be a huge opportunity, not to mention that many internships require you to work during winter and spring vacations which I won't be able to do if I have to go home to my parents' 150 miles away.

We would both be receiving about $14772 per person in financial aid money for housing, food, utilities, etc. which is $1231 per month per person stretched over 12 months, on top of summer employment. (If you're interested in seeing how I got that number, click [here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nnDKJ0L8).) Our parents have agreed to pay security deposits and deposits for utilities if necessary (we have both been using student credit cards responsibly for about a year now).

I've never been to the New Brunswick area so I don't know what to expect for the cost of living there. We were planning on living on Cedar Avenue in Highland Park ($1200-$1000 per month plus utilities) both for the neighborhood and because a Livingston bus stop is within biking distance.

I'm essentially afraid that we won't be able to afford it and it'll be too much to deal with. Since we've never really gone to school full time, we don't really know how hard it will be to manage time between school and work. Is working for $2000 per year at a work study (avg. 12 hours per week at minimum wage) too ambitious? Or do you think we'd be able to handle more? 

When summer time comes we will have more time to work. For me, I'd be taking a programming internship which is usually paid by law and the minimum wage is about $11, average about $15. The only downside is that they will most likely be in NY which requires $25 in train tickets every day.

TL;DR: two community college students looking to move out for the first time in off-campus housing. Is it possible or is it better to live on campus? Sorry for the wall of text."

I have learned the most basic of introductory Python and Ruby, and am completing a class in AP Computer Science (in Java) this year. Earlier this year, I went through the codeacademy tutorial for JavaScript.

I got an internship at a startup and they're telling me to learn certain languages. So I need a way to learn how to implement jQuery and HTML (as well as get a better understanding of JavaScript) really quickly so that I can become useful.

To illustrate what level I should be at, I was told to make a tic tac toe game that is interactive and tells you when you won/lost. I would like to be able to do this in a couple of weeks but... I don't know how realistic that is.

Does anyone have any suggestions for someone at my experience level? I mean, my coworkers will teach me themselves once I understand the most basic fundamentals, so I don't need to be an expert or anything.

They're also asking me to learn PHP... but I'm thinking at this point that's just way too much. If you have suggestions for learning that quickly, then by all means mention it but... I don't know.

I guess what I'm just looking for is a tutorial that's at the right pace. Ideas? How long do you guys think it would take to get the fundamentals of the language down?

My school is known for its CS program but that hasn't helped me much at all. I've been applying to internships since about mid December (about 50 total companies). I've only had 5 interviews and none of them panned out. Shit, most of them didn't even tell me I'd been passed over. I had two separate companies interview me and then not even bother to tell me I'd been rejected. 

Realistically, how important is an internship? Everyone I talk to on campus seems to have one lined up and they act like its easy to get one. I feel alone like I'm the only one without one.

It's really been stressing me out. This is kind of the first test of my skills/experience isn't it? I imagine applying for a job will be similar. If I'm not getting in now, what do I need to change to get a job next year?

I've read that doing personal projects and working on open source helps a bit but can it really replace an internship? Is it possible recruiters will wonder why I don't have an internship on my resume?

Side note: Is it still possible to land an internship position? I know its really late but is there any advice specific to getting a last minute position somewhere?"

**CPU**: chose the 4770k for its hyperthreading over the i5 as I'm planning to use this computer for work/school Java development.
Overclocked this right now to 4.4Ghz (29 Idle, 65 Load)

**CPU Cooler**: looks good with the Case/280mm cooling/didn't want to use a H100i, there are so many builds with that.

**RAM**: Mostly for the looks, got a good deal on the 1866Mhz speed Dominator Platinums.
Got the 2x8gb set upgradability in the future. Maybe video editing? 

**Mobo**:Originally wanted a sabertooth but the formula comes with better components, integrated sound card, wifi, crosschill (watercooling coming in the near future) for only ~70 dollars more

**SSDs**: put these in RAID 0 with a GPT OS install and backing up to the HDD. 

**HDD**: Going to be holding more games if I fill up the SSDs and also for photo storage/editing storage

**GPU**: Was planning on getting a normal 780 for 1440p gaming but got a sweet deal on the Classified version. Overclocked to 1200Mhz currently with temp target at 72 degrees C. Boost clock up to 1397Mhz

**PSU**: Considering SLI in the future when the ROG swift comes out. Sleeved cables were not as nice as I expected so I got the Bitfenix extensions.

**Fans**: Considerably quieter over stock fans.

**NGFF SSD**: Got this to utilize the NGFF SSD Slot on the Formula and it's currently being used to cache for the HDD. 


Will be posting an update once I get the chance to stitch the cables."

This also includes full medical insurance, 2 weeks PTO, 2 weeks of holidays with a possibility of a $10k raise if certain conditions are met.

A little about me...

I live about 1.5 hours outside of a large metropolitan city. Population here is about ~100k people. 

I have a 2.6 Major GPA but did not disclose that when I applied for my internship.

I don't have any personal projects to show for outside of things done in class. 

If you need any other information let me know."

NASA SkyGuard project logs object 14573-A beyond the Oort Cloud. The Automatic Space Object Tracking Observatory logs the velocity, direction, mass estimates, and estimated speed. The system flags the entry for review during the weekly staff meeting.

**September 20th 2023 0900**

The weekly staff meeting is canceled.

**September 27th 2023 0900**

The weekly staff meeting is brief, the readings on Object 14573-A are declared ""off"" by the Project Manager. The object seems to be moving too slowly to be an extra-solar entity. The issue is handed to the interns to either correct the issue or confirm the readings.

**October 1st 2023 0900**

The interns actually get to work on the issue.

**October 2nd 2023 1100**

The interns successfully reconfirm that the readings on Object 14573-A are valid. They are laughed out of the Project Manager's Office. After a staff member double checks the readings the Project Manager orders a diagnostic check on the system.

**October 4th 2023 0900**

The diagnostic check returns clean all systems. 

**October 4th 2023 1400**

A full staff meeting is called concerning Object 14573-A. The minutes are as follows.

       Dr. Chen formally objects to this waste of time

        The meeting is formally called to order

        The Intern group updates all staff on their findings and process concerning Object 14573-A

        Dr. Wineholt explains to the interns that it's not possible than an object that massive would radiate heat and be an extra solar non orbiting entity.  She also corrects their Mass and Volume calculations as ""Drastically Overestimated."" 

        Dr. Chen claims all this is impossible.

        Dr. McHelan updates staff on diagnostic test.

Dr. Rathburn encourages the staff to send the findings to observatories in Germany, China, and New York.

The media, smelling a story, arrive at NASA space command and set up live broadcasts speculating wildly, some referencing the ""Sun Spots.""

**October 6th 2023 1130**

A man, later identified as Mark Saklun, Assistant Director of Solar Observation, bursts out of the front door of the NASA facility, screaming incoherently and howling at the top of his lungs. He is tackled by uniformed officers and dragged back into the facility. This is televised live across the globe.

The coming months were arduous, to say the least. I had made a deal with the Detective beforehand, I plead guilty to being an accessory to a crime and my sentence was five years of probation. I pulled the trigger on everyone, all at once. They arrested the Head of HR (HoHR) for murder, and she was convicted several months later. To the best of my knowledge, she's not only still in jail, but won't be up for parole until my children can vote. The CEO was convicted for insider trading, which is the blackmail that HoHR had on him. Money somehow escaped the laundry list of convictions, which I'm not sure how that happened. 

 Really Cool VP and several other VP's spun off into their own firm, and when they did they presented Skip and myself the opportunity to work with them at $NewCompany. We're both still there to this day, the PFY and myself. Work here is rather uninteresting compared to the events that happened at $Company, but I'd rather not be interesting. Motorcycle IT Guy decided  to move out of the area, and settled down somewhere in Arizona. The last I heard from him he had gotten married and was expecting a little one of his own. 

 Unfortunately, the events at $Company were completely true. When I decided to write my tale, as unbelievable as it sounds, I first contacted the Detective to ask if I should even bother. He has read over and given his blessing on this version of events. I wish I could say that I didn't have to change things to protect the innocent, no matter how few of them there were. Both Skip and the Detective read over this story, and both of them agreed that it's detached enough for it to protect ourselves. 

Since I know you won't appreciate a cliffhanger. Dan is currently retired. When $Company went under he decided that he was done. He survived a heart attack not too long ago, so I suppose he can't be in that great of health. 

 Oh, one last thing before I close this tale. The PFY has instructed me to write both a set of tales involving $Company before I was given Sword or MITG quit, and another set for the events at $NewCompany. I'll be starting those soon, so this isn't the last you'll hear from me. 

 Cheers, 
*rstrt*

Edit: 

 *I've been asked the same couple questions, I was convicted of Withholding evidence. It was a formality if nothing else, but they barely slapped me on the wrists. The folder I handed HoHR contained proof of other, more petty crimes, including a letterhead from her company that wrote that software. The folder was only to prove that I was serious and actually had something. There was a 'rumored' bit about the murder in the Black File, but I never acted on it since I assumed it was bogus. The Detective had me go in with a wire, and hoped that she would confess to pushing Intern. He got enough for an arrest, and she ended up pleading guilty and confessing later. I don't know exactly what they were arguing over, just that she pushed him to get him to back off. His death was really only an accident, but she tried to hide it for years before MITG told me about it.*

24wz6u,6,2014-05-06,Advice on a possible internship,Ribald_Partisan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24wz6u/advice_on_a_possible_internship/,"So, I interviewed for a full developer position but I didn't get it. The owner of the company mentioned that they do internships and that I would be a good fit. My time ran out on a problem and he told me I could submit it if I wanted when I was done. Of course I did.

It's been about a month. Summer's rolling around and I'm not seeing any internship posted or sign that they offer one. I'm a self-learner, though, and a lot of internships won't hire me because I'm not enrolled in school. I need a bridge so that I can have viable experience.

Is it too bothersome if I e-mail and ask about the internship? Or should I leave it alone and turn my attention elsewhere? I'm not afraid of being persistent but I also don't want to put strain on a bridge to a potential job in the future (I very much like this company.)"

24x9z7,24,2014-05-06,My Online MBA Experience,PennStateOnlineMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/24x9z7/my_online_mba_experience/,"As more reputable business programs begin to offer online MBA options, I figure my experience may be of some use to those considering this route.

**About me:** Business Admin undergrad from an ACC school, 3.25 GPA, 650 on the GMAT, and a military background with two years of experience when I submitted my applications to Arizona State and Penn State.  I was admitted to both and selected Penn State’s iMBA program.


**Selecting a program:**  Those of you who have looked into multiple online programs have probably realized that the design of each program varies significantly from school to school.  Most of the more reputable programs have a set course load for you to complete over a 1-2 year time frame.  Some schools require in-person appearances every semester to take final exams while other well-regarded programs online require as little as 3 days for in person orientation.  Penn State’s program requires 2, week long residencies.  The number of credits for the degree also varies.  I ultimately chose Penn State over ASU because PSU’s 48-credits featured more interesting classes compared to ASU’s 42 credit program.

Cost is another important factor to consider.  During my search, it seemed as if most online programs had the same or more cost of tuition as their brick-and-mortar counterparts.  However, the main benefit of the online route is that you do not have to sacrifice wages for two years as with full-time programs.  Some employers are also very generous with assisting employees with continuing education, but this is different for everyone.  Some tax incentives also applied in my case that lowered my taxable income by several thousand dollars.  In all, the listed tuition for Penn State was around $55,000 for the entire program.  Tax incentives and employer assistance reduced this to approximately $48,000 in my case.

At this point, I am going to speak more directly about my experience with the Penn State Interschool MBA (iMBA) program, but many of the themes likely apply to other online MBAs.

**PROs:** 

*Flexibility.* Each online program is different, but the concept is the same: study anywhere you have an internet connection. I had to attend two week-long residency classes over two years. Everything else was done online. I was an Army officer during the entire program and completed 18 credits of the program via a very slow internet connection in Afghanistan. Most of the assignments were due at the end of each week, to include timed exams. As long as you finished in the allotted amount of time, you were fine. You will most likely do a significant amount of teamwork during the program. Most teams in my program met 1-2 times a week on a fixed schedule for about 30-45 minutes each meeting.

*Cost.* Although most of the more prestigious online programs cost the same as their full-time counterparts, you actually save a lot of money if you continue to work through the program (ie you don't pay the opportunity cost of forfeiting your current income). Most employers also pay some sort of subsidy for continuing education. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe you will need to pay taxes on any amount of educational benefit over $4500/year.  

*Networking.* You'll need to put some effort into this, but if you attend one of the better online programs you'll likely meet other students working roles in upper management at big firms. Two of my best connections are a R&amp;D manager at a Johnson and Johnson subsidiary and a SVP at a Fortune 1000 tech company. Although this was a plus for me, it is no guarantee of other people's experience. I think networking opportunities at traditional programs are much greater than online ones.  I eventually got a pretty good job based solely on the recommendation of the SVP at the tech firm (as in they created the position specifically for me based on his recommendation).

*The Degree.*  My diploma says “Pennsylvania State University, Master of Business Administration.”  No mention of online, no asterisk.  It is the same diploma handed to those who graduate from Smeal full-time program.  My resume also states the same.  Although I do not claim to have attended the Smeal School of Business, my resume does not state that my MBA was done online.  I am honest in all interviews when asked on the matter, but in reality it has come up in less than 25% of interviews.

**CONs:**

*Class structure.* The design of my program was extremely do-it-yourself. Here's a wall of the professor's notes to read, 1-2 chapters of textbook readings, and participate in these discussion forums with your classmates. This structure allowed for slacking from students and (some) professors alike. Traditional lectures via webcam (what I expected going in) are virtually non-existent. Weekly professor office hours were held through conferencing software similar to GoToMeeting, but a majority of them were not mandatory. Some students skated through a two year program and earn a 3.2 because of the lax structure. It really added to the online-isn't-worth-it stigma.

*Classmates.* Just as a rough estimate, I think about one-half of the program could get into a pretty decent MBA program (within the top 25) if they didn't go the online route. The other half weren't exactly dumb, but they were either extremely lazy or lacked business acumen.

*Networking/Recruiting/Employment Opportunities.* This is probably the biggest shortcoming of online programs in my opinion. First, a lower-quality of students mixed with considerably less face time leads to less opportunities for networking. Next, corporate recruiters target future MBAs on campus, not through Internet correspondence. Most Fortune 100s groom their MBA hires by first picking them up for a summer internship after their first year, then hire them in the fall. Finally, the dominating opinion in the business world is that a full-time MBA is better than part-time or online MBAs. It's most likely true, but not to a great extent IMO. I've filled out resumes that were very specific in their requirements for MBAs from full-time programs (ie they excluded part-time and online applicants).

*No degree specialization.* I think this is true for most online programs. You take the same 42-48 credits as your entire cohort so you end up with a mass of people with a general management-type MBA. I wanted to specialize in supply chain management and I missed out on a MBA in SCM by going the online route. I don't think this will really hurt me in the end, but I wish I could have studied more in the topics that piqued my interests.

**Results:**  I finished the program in the allotted two years with a 3.8 GPA.  I left my job in the military for the private sector four short months after graduating.  My networking with quality classmates in the program led to several good interviews with large companies (JnJ, GE) and eventually a position with a mid-sized tech firm.  Although my starting salary (ballpark $90k/year + 10% annual bonus) will not be as high as most of my full-time counterparts, the fact that I continued to earn high wages through my degree resulted in a greater NPV for the online route vs the traditional MBA route (assuming avg. tuition + salary information for a CMU grad over 5 years after graduation and assuming a 7% discount rate with 4% annual wage increases across all jobs).

**Advice:** If you travel a lot for work, live too far from a reputable part-time/evening program, and cannot take off two years to attend a top or mid-tier MBA program, then an online program from a reputable school may be a good option for you.  At the end of the day, you need to really ask yourself if getting this degree is worth it to you personally and professionally. How much will your employer assist with tuition and what sort of time will you owe in return for their assistance? Is it something you really want? What opportunities will it open for you that you wouldn't see without it? 

I welcome any constructive criticism or questions to this post.  I will continue to monitor this post through this throwaway account.  I look forward to the discussion and hope that some of you find it informative.

24xa2s,5,2014-05-06,Tutorial for learning Python that assumes you already know C/C++?,[deleted],learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/24xa2s/tutorial_for_learning_python_that_assumes_you/,"I've got an internship lined up for the summer and they want me to learn Python or Perl for the position.  Python seems to be more popular, and everyone says it's easy to learn, so here I am.  I'm a computer engineering major, so pretty all of my experience with programming is in C (with a little bit of x86 assembly, ARM assembly and C++ on the side).  Now to my question.

Is there a good Python tutorial out there for people that already know C fairly well?  All of the tutorials I can find (which are very few) start out assuming I know nothing about programming, which makes it difficult for me to find what I need.  It would be nice if there was a tutorial out there that said ""arrays in C are equal to lists in Python"" or ""input is equal to scanf in C"".  So I thought I'd come on here and see if anything like this exists.  If not, I'll just keep looking stuff up individually.  Thanks!"
24xbhr,3,2014-05-06,"Question about possible ""limitations"" on future job opportunities because of internships and experience",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24xbhr/question_about_possible_limitations_on_future_job/,"Sorry for the wall of text, my issue may be similar to others, but my background is just providing some insight to my situation:

**My Background**
So I have had some luck regarding internships since I've started pursuing my BS in CS. With my background with the military for a few years and some decent grades, I've been able to somehow work my way into a few positions. 

I live in a city with a relatively healthy tech scene and I landed a continuous internship (they call it an apprenticeship) with what is arguably the biggest corporation in the city. 

I had an ""in"" and had a referral for the program, but during the interview process it's just called a ""technical apprentice"" position and they put you on a team depending on who you interviewed with and what team they happen to be on if they decide they liked you. So, you could be put on a mobile development team, or a backend support team, etc etc. The position I got was being put under an engineer who is part of the solution translation team (translates the software into the languages that the company supports, among other related things) who handles all of the technical aspects that arise on this team. So I dealt with backend packaging of translated strings, client and internal SR's, testing, etc.

I had another ""in"" with what is arguably the second largest tech company in the city, or at least the fastest growing, and was told that I would be ""perfect"" for this summer internship position this year in which I will be supporting some of the internal business solutions on the backend side as a system analyst. There was no real application process since I had a solid referral, so I couldn't opt for a specific position, if they even offered that chance.

**The issue** is that I have no interest working a career as a systems engineer or dealing with any sort of heavy IT role. I enjoy coding and development and have been slowly teaching myself mobile development on top of the little software development I've had a chance to do. Because of the luck I've had with the internships and some of the vagueness of the application process, I've just rolled with whatever I could get. I didn't want to act ungrateful for the opportunities, they are extremely great positions in which I've learned a great deal and I'm humbled that I was looked at. I felt having two of the bigger companies in a growing tech city on my resume would be beneficial, regardless of the position, as long as it was dealing with CS in some way. 

I'm really worried that I may be limiting myself to doing what I want to do as I feel like I'm on this system engineer path that I didn't really plan to do, I just sort of fell into it. Does anyone have any advice or similar experience? I'd really like to pursue a career with a startup or smaller business as a mobile developer, but if I find myself applying at larger companies, will I even get looked at much for the role that I want?

**tl\dr** Have you ever felt like your job/experience is taking you down a career path you would prefer not to go down?

Thanks, I appreciate any response! Let me know if I can provide a resume for overview if that may help for some reason.

Edit: Please let me know if there is a better suited place for this. The weekly internship advice thread seemed to be a little dead."

I am looking for any advice that may make my transition easier in the slightest way. These are my initial concerns:

* What sort of computer I should look into buying? [(recommendations here)](http://www.eos.ncsu.edu/soc/laptops/buying_new)

* Would it be beneficial to have both a laptop and a desktop?
 
* What I programs I should load and where could I get them as inexpensively as possible hopefully? Aside from the obvious Microsoft Office (I have that covered; I picked up a license for Office 2013 through an internship for $10. Score!) and such. 

I have basically a $3,000 limit which I would think would be plenty to invest in a solid laptop, a solid desktop, printer, cables, cords, etc and maybe a tablet (if the money will allow) for the next four years and it will be covered by a scholarship. 

Some additional questions:

* What exactly is MatLab?
* As an ME, should I learn any programming or coding?
* Is there anywhere that I could take a sort of ""refresher"" for Pre-Calc and college algebra? I have not had a math class in three semesters and I am worried that Calculus is going to destroy me...

Any general advice would be greatly appreciated as well!! Thank you!"

How big of a deal are short run jobs and gaps for a junior web developer? To be more concrete: I started an internship, which quickly turned into a junior role last year. This whole episode lasted 6 months, after which I had to move to another country, where I found a remote junior role.This role lasted close to 4 months, and because of mounting communication issues I quit. 

I've decided to take time off, heal burnout, and learn some new things. I've been diving into machine learning and I've been contributing to a cool OSS project.
After 4 months I'm moving *back* to where I came from and I'll be looking for a job again. 

**tl;dr** I have a total of 10 months of work experience in a 17 month period, with two fairly large gaps - the first due to moving, the second due to burnout and moving back.

Is this information on my resume going to affect me negatively? How can I minimize the negative effect if it occurs? I have code I can show for the gaps and plausible reasons why I quit my last two jobs fairly quickly (moving), but for that I gotta get passed CV screening I think.

Most of the time when I see something like that, I just say ""good for us"" and try not to think about whether or not the person can afford it or not.

But in general I think paycheck cashing promotions are pretty tasteless. E.g., Cash your paycheck and get 5% of the total value in free slot play.
[Can you ELi5?  Sorry, to me that just sounds like you hand over your $1000 you earned, and get back $50? Which seems wrong...?  Or do you get an extra $50?  Hmmm... Thoroughly confused myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbo6jh?context=5)|Let's say your check is $1,000. The casino will cash your check and then also give you $50 in promotional credits to be used on the slot machines. The idea is that since we've given you some ""free"" money to begin playing the machines you will also dip into the $1,000 cash that we also handed you.
[Are there any clauses that prevent you from just spending the $50 in free bets and cashing out the $1k without actually playing with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbt3lg?context=5)|No, you get the $1K in cash and the $50 can only be used in the slot machine. I've done this once when I started my new job and my direct deposit wasn't set up yet so they issued me a live check.  
[How many people just walk directly out of the casino after cashing the check with their 5% bonus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbt4nq?context=5)|I don't know, I've never run this promotion but generally speaking when we give away promotional credits, the ""walk rate"" is in the 25% range.

Do you get treated better if they know what your job is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbm85k?context=5)|I really don't like them so not often unless someone is in town that wants to go. I don't have a moral objection, just think it's a waste. ""Hey do you like to eat steak? Give me $20 to smell this delicious steak! No, you can't try it!!!"".
 |So that having been said, I might spend $20 to give to the girls on the stage and maybe a lap dance.
 |No, I don't get treated better because of my title really. They usually just care about how much money you spend and that's it.
[What are some sneaky strategies that you use to get people to spend more money?  I don't mean obvious things like having ATMs...but things related specifically to gambling.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbki6o?context=5)|Ummm... Off the top of my head I think the sneakiest thing is probably side bets on table games (e.g., play an extra $5 and if your two cards are a pair then you win $25) because the odds are terrible or things like advertising low table game limits but modifying the rules (e.g., blackjack pays 6:5 vs 3:2) to increase the house advantage.
[Some casino customers are super cheap and only play $1 Blackjack. Others are whales and the casino spends a lot of money to attract them, but they are rare. Somewhere in between, I imagine, there are customers who spend a significant amount and exist in numbers to make most of the casino's profits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjv53?context=5)|First, we quantify most everything by ""theoretical worth"". That is, how much we can expect to win from you based on the house advantage of the game you play and how long you play. The general formula is decisions per hour X house advantage X hours played X average bet. So, $25/hand at blackjack X 1.5% house advantage X 2 hours played X 60 decisions per hour = $45 in theoretical worth.
[Is that true? How much does a ""bread and butter"" customer gamble in a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjv53?context=5)|Second, It really depends on the particular property. The number is a lot higher for Wynn then it would be at Joker's Wild (a really, really dumpy casino on the outskirts of Vegas). That having been said, most places will be very happy to have you if you are in the $150-300 a day in theoretical worth range.
[That sounds pretty affordable.  Assuming a 30% comp return I guess that comes out to $50-90 in comps a day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblkv9?context=5)|30% includes the stuff we send you in the mail generally too so at the $300 range you could expect a room and a meal a day. 
[What kind of awful rules are you using to have a 1.5% house advantage, or is that number based on the average player being really terrible?  How much in comps would I actually generate for two hours of $25 a hand Blackjack? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chcua3a?context=5)|I just threw the 1.5 number out there. We also factor in skill into house advantage so as to be more favorable to the player, comp wise.  comp wise we'd probably give you 15% of the $45, or $6.75. That's just in what we call discretionary comps that the pit supervisor or host can give you. Then you could expect another 30% in the mail via free bets, hotel, food, etc. 
[I guess you need to register with the casino loyalty club so you know what we are spending.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblpsz?context=5)|Correct.
[I currently reside in Arizona, where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an Indian reservation and - as a result - a casino.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|Well I've worked all over the country and, yes, of course we always keep an eye out on new competition that would impact our existing customer base, especially as the business has seen much more legalization in new jurisdictions in the past 20 years.
[The casino/resorts are getting increasingly sophisticated.  Better facilities, better entertainment, and better marketing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|For Vegas, I think most strip properties have dealt with this by investing in properties in regional markets so as to send their customers to their Vegas properties so it is pretty accretive. Someone from Harrah's Ak-Chin in the Phoenix area gets offers from Harrah's Las Vegas quite often.
[Is this something the Vegas casinos consider a rising threat, welcome competition, or something else?  How do you - as a marketing guy - react to the fact that a trip to a casino no longer necessarily means a trip to Nevada or New Jersey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|The bigger problem really is for the markets where they were a monopoly for some time and really rested on their laurels. Reno and Atlantic City come to mind. Those markets are dying fast and there really isn't much upside. In Atlantic City, for example, you have casinos buying competitors just to close them so as to reduce the inventory.
[What really happens when somebody wins on a slot machine? Like, what is the behind the scenes stuff that we don't see? Are they checking out the cameras to make sure it was that specific person before they payout? What if you switch seats? What if an underage gambler wins?... What if they switch seats with an of-age gambler??  Honestly, I've never done that, but I've always wondered the underage stuff because I've never ever got carded on slots!  I've won hand-pays before (nothing really exciting\) and they always hit me with the tax form. What do you guys do with the tax form? Does it get sent out from you guys or does it remain my responsibility from thereon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chc87xj?context=5)|I worked as a slot analyst (analyzing machine performance) years ago and never on the floor so I don't know/remember the exact steps. Essentially, though, it's verifying that the machine is functioning properly and recording the details of the jackpot for audit/regulators. If it is a taxable jackpot ( &gt;= $1,200) then we are required to fill out the IRS W2G form to report it to them for tax purposes so at that point we have to get your ID, etc. to facilitate that. Then of course, there is the matter of actually paying you the money, verifying that it is the correct amount, etc. The tax form does get sent to the IRS. You can request the taxes not be taken out of your jackpot as you are only taxed on the net win at the end of the year.
[How did you get involved in the casino bussiness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|1/2.) Just needed a job and applied to a very entry level job and worked my way up.
[Did you set out to work at one or did it come about another way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|3.) It can be fun and exciting.
[What do you enjoy most about your job? Least?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|4.) There's a lot of pressure to make money/meet your budget so all of the bullshit that goes along with that. Dealing with politics, having to adjust staffing, etc. And I don't like that at my level the usual tenure is 2-3 years so you move around a lot. I'd like to be more settled, especially in a place I'd really want to live for a long time and I don't feel like I have much control of that in this business.
[1\) When you talk about being moved around a lot, is that relating to being moved around in what you do at a particular casino? or more like which casino your working at?  2\)  Do you feel that your skills at this current job gives you fallback options should your tenure run out? ( Such as in other service based industries?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbm97t?context=5)|1.) I mean there is only one of me at every casino so if something happens whether I don't like where I work or what something different (e.g., more money) or they don't like me (shocking, it happens!) then the likelihood that I have to move is high, especially if I'm in a city that only has a handful of casinos.  2.) I obviously feel like my skills could take me anywhere! But in reality, it has been tough to change industries when I've tried. Usually places like hotels don't pay as much as casinos and look for more sales-related skills and restaurants don't really have marketing people except at the corporate office whereas my skills are more analytics-oriented. And both usually pay less than casinos.
[ time I went to Vegas (around 30 years ago\) it still had that ""mob"" vibe.  When I got married there in the 90s (I joke now that I gambled on marriage in Vegas and lost half my stuff\) it was much more ""corporate"" and ""family friendly.""  The ""What Happens in Vegas"" campaign seemed to try and change that perception.  Do you think there's value in returning Vegas to a more ""wise guy"" kind of feel...playing up the classic vibe, or is it just a big collection of theme parks with gambling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbmdwb?context=5)|The problem with returning to that type of vibe is that it's difficult/impossible given how big the casinos are. Sure it was easy for Benny Binion to control everything and not be ""corporate"" when the old Horseshoe was literally 1/10th the size of MGM Grand. 
[What was UNLV like?  Did you live in the dorms?  It seems like a strange school where everyone commutes and there's no college life around the campus.  What are the pros and cons of going there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblnl0?context=5)|I went there for grad school so was older and had a wife and a house. It is definitely a commuter school so there's not a lot of school spirit. I went to undergrad a school with a huge, huge, huge, football program so it was a bit of a change for me. I also didn't find the students to be terribly bright (with exceptions, of course). On the upside, a lot of people like living in Vegas and the Hotel Administration College (where I went) has very, very good brand recognition.
[Do you find people have lots of misconceptions about the casino industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbju23?context=5)|That the games are rigged and that we love giving away a lot for nothing/little in return are probably the two biggest.
[So what's up with prostitutes and the casinos?  I understand that prostitution is illegal in Vegas, but that they're still there.  Is it like the movies, where they're just hanging out in the casino bars waiting to be picked up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbn1nu?context=5)|Yes, they hang out at the bars and then there are services you can call and have them sent to your room. If it's overt, casino security will clear them out of the bar area but the vice cops generally focus on human trafficking kind of stuff. 
[As an insider, what do you think the job prospects are in the industry for someone with a similar education background, but no casino experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbp2w8?context=5)|1.) The industry relies heavily on industry experience so job prospects are good if you're willing to start in a low position and work you're way up. If you go to UNLV and get the degree I got and expect for some casino to make you a Director of VP with no experience then you're going to be very disappointed.

Making consistent money? Then definitely not. If you are entertained by thrill of gambling and have the discretionary funds to do it, then by all means. 
[Aw okay! cool. Any idea why people do it? Is it just a thrill? Would being a ""whale"", make more of a difference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbpxgh?context=5)|For the people that do it for entertainment, it's the thrill of anticipation.
[Was it hard getting a job with such a detailed degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwnh?context=5)|My undergrad degree is pretty bland, political science, so it wasn't hard at first. I did my grad degree in casino management because I was living in Vegas, wanted to get an MBA, didn't want to take 2 years off from work to get a full-time degree, didn't have the support of my job to get an executive MBA, and didn't like UNLV's MBA program.

Are the dealers payed solely by tips/do they get to keep all tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chcl5hv?context=5)|1.) Generally there are poker dealers and table games (e.g., blackjack) dealers. Few do both. Among the table games dealers, most know multiple games as the more you know the more hirable you are. In terms of the qualifications it's just that you've gone to some sort of dealer school (there are commercial ones and some casinos do it in-house), experience, and a live audition.  2.) Really depends on the market and the casino. At the high end like Wynn or Venetian they will do close to $100K/year but at an entry-level place it could be more like $25K/year. It's base salary plus pooled tips (aka tokes).

24y5db,16,2014-05-07,Extremely stressed. Leaving first programming job. Need some advice.,usernameisnull,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24y5db/extremely_stressed_leaving_first_programming_job/,"I feel the need to preface this with a bit of backstory before getting to my main questions.

Backstory - Got my BS in CS in 2012, had no luck finding anything (probably my lack of internships). I got hired back in August by a small (~20 people total) company doing development work. I started with Classic ASP then moved on to C#.Net (while still supporting sites built in Classic ASP) when new projects came up. I even wrote a desktop application to print movie tickets for a local Film Festival (no bugs, didn't crash. hahahaha). Here's the thing though, I'm pretty much a factory worker at this place. I'm pushed to slap code together in hopes of producing something that works just enough for my boss to show off. I've had to teach myself the majority of what I know. I have a ton of respect for my mentor but he has very little experience with .Net and has had barely enough time to show me the ropes. 

So, I'm leaving the company. I want to find a job where I can code in a slower environment. I'm thinking something along the lines of Intranet tools for a medium (1-5k) sized company. My resume is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlp86qxjinvij91/Resume%20for%20Reddit.pdf) just to give you an idea of my skills.

Does wanting to work in a slower environment sound weak (not sure how else to put it) in any way? What sort of questions can I ask to figure out how fast the pace is without sounding lazy? "
24ybrw,17,2014-05-07,"I'm a QA analyst. I have no idea where I can go from here, or how to do it.",justwanttotest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24ybrw/im_a_qa_analyst_i_have_no_idea_where_i_can_go/,"I graduated from a really good school 2 years ago with a degree in Chemistry. I was pretty much forced into that degree by my parents, and by the end of my schooling I realized I just did not enjoy it at all, and had no interest to go back for my PHD. I really enjoyed the intro CS classes I took, so I decided I would try something out along those lines. I found a QA internship in Boston and after a few months was promoted to a full time QA.

My current responsibilities are writing up test plans, black box testing handheld devices and web apps, managing test plans for a team of testers off in India, working with PMs/Developers etc. I do not do anything involving automation which is where I was hoping to get too. My company has a completely separate automation team, and does not want the team i'm on doing automation. We're assigned all the manual tasks. I've spoken to the head of the automation team to see if there was any chance I could transfer, but they don't have any openings. It seems like there is currently no way to grow in my company.

So now for some questions:

I'm having a very hard time telling apart all the different QA roles. I originally thought it was just QA analysts who do manual testing + automation, and SDETs who also do automation, but also white box testing. Is this the case? If so, what role would I have considering I don't do any autmoation I also thought that QA analysts were not paid well, but SDETs were payed the same as developers. Based on my current salary I thought this was true, but looking online I that QA salaries are really high as well. Are these sites just conflating SDET with analysts? If QA analyst should be making a lot more money than I thought, maybe my best path is to just stick with QA analyst (a different company that does some automation).
(http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=QA+analyst&amp;l1=boston,
http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=QA+tester&amp;l1=boston)


Assuming SDETs get payed a lot more (which i'm assuming is the case), I would like to eventually work my way up to this position. For the past year or so I've been doing some minor studying to try and improve my skills. I'm familiar with the basics of Python (classes, inheritance, i/o etc), though haven't done any work on the deeper stuff (design patterns, data structures, algorithms). I've gone through Selenium tutorials and automated some websites for fun. My most recent learning experience has been with SQL (just started). I'm trying to teach myself, but i'm getting to the point where i'm not sure what I should be studying if I want to get into the SDET role. I'm not sure which areas are important, and I definitely don't know how to get any actual experience. What areas should I focus on studying, and how should I go about getting experience?

Based on what i've been able to find from skimming the internet, I shouldn't have too much of a problem finding another QA analyst position that has automation. Do I have any other choices right now? Is it possible I could just suck it up and take a SDET internship at some company now, and hope that they would take me full time after? If that is not reasonable, are there any other good options? If not, where do I go from QA analyst? Just stay there while studying until I know enough to become a SDET? I'm just very unaware of what opportunities there are for QA, and how to advance?

In late January, I decided to focus on Android development. I read through every page of an Android fundamentals book, and for the past two months I've been working on my first app. In the meantime, I've been applying to Android-related jobs, and am waiting to hear back from two places that want to schedule last-round, on-site interviews - in addition to this third place that scheduled a phone interview.

You know what sucks though? Every Android job posting lists ""must have at least one app in Play Store"" as a job requirement. So I'm trying my best to finish my first app on top of schoolwork, but at this rate it's going to take another month before I'm anywhere close to finishing. There are all these little concerns - like deciding what features to implement, laying out the user flow, designing a logo, dealing with threading, setting up a backend, testing - and it's just a lot of work to meet that must-have-app job requirement. No one wants to see my Android app's half-complete codebase on GitHub.

On top of school and personal project stress, it turns out that there aren't that many Android positions in NYC compared to general back-end work. Maybe I should have invested my personal project time into web applications. Maybe all three of my current job leads won't pan out. Then I'll be fucked, and that places even more stress on me to finish my first Android app, which needs to meet my personal bar of quality before it's released. Even after that, maybe I still won't be able to find an Android job.

From what I've read just now in the FAQ here though, interns aren't expected to know a lot. Should I have accepted and studied up on the topics in the meantime? And is it still possible to do so if I call back and explain that I'm interested?

I met some studios over there which seemed interested in C++ programmers(which I am). Now, they were all happy about me being able to program in C++, but all of them also told me they wanted to see a portfolio of the games I made.

Now there is my problem. I don't really have a portfolio and can't make one in time(I only have like 2 games I can show them...). So I came up with the idea of making a little game. I will send this game to all the game studios I want to apply for. In this game the studio will get to know things about me and get to see my curriculum vitae.

So my question after all is: Game developers/Game studios of this subreddit, do you think my idea will help me and will make up for the fact that I don't have an actual portfolio?

I am comfortable working with VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, HTML/CSS, javascript, Java, SQL, and MySQL.

Since I'm not going to be taking any CS related courses until I transfer, what would be the best time to start looking for internships? By the numbers, I'd be a 2nd semester sophmore (or 1st semester, barring the fact that some GenEds might not fill certain requirements) but since I haven't actually taken any CS courses, I'd be more like a freshman in terms of actual CS knowledge.

My question is - with this in mind - when should I start looking for internships for the following year? I'm presuming that applying for internships now would be a bit of a waste since I haven't got any concrete CS knowledge (though I have applied to a couple, most haven't responded, or I just got flat-out denied).  Should I be focusing on anything in particular over the summer so that I can get a leg up when I attend school in the fall?

I tried to get back together with, because I truly, truly love her, and there is not way I can rationalize with that, but those attempts have failed, and I am pretty sure she has moved on. I wish with all my heart that those feelings could just disappear but they don't. I try to avoid seeing her but I go to a very small college and it is basically impossible.

Worse than that is that I am stuck at my college, 2,000 miles away from home, if I don't get a job or internship. My parents have told me that I can not come home without one. I have applied to about 25, and have only gotten 2 interviews, neither of which have panned out. My depression and the pressure to get an internship have had a very negative effect on my studies. I have lost all motivation to do work. I drag myself to the library but all I do is force myself to read whatever I am supposed to, but I can't actually do it. It is as if the words or going in to me brain and coming right out. There is a haze of depression and sadness that just surrounds me all the time and I can't produce decent work while doing that.

I have no idea where I want to go in life, it seems like everyone surrounding me is doing all this things, holding all these leadership positions and doing important internships and jobs and here I am just sitting at my computer. I have tried to remain optimistic and proactive. For the beginning of my depression I was able to do all my work and get good grades, I was able to apply to a bunch of internships. But as time goes on none of it has really improved my life. Things are still just as horrible as ever. I have tried CBT and more traditional therapy, and I was on anti-depressants but none of those things did any good. I exercise 6 days a week and that hasn't changed things either. I have already tried to kill myself, it was a half hearted attempt with pills when i was drunk, and all it did was make me feel awful the next morning. But honestly I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I want with all my heart for things to get better, but I have lost the motivation to try. I tried already and it did no good. I can't keep going on if I don't get any results to keep me moving forward. I won't kill myself tonight or in the next week, I still have to work up the courage to do that. But I am afraid, I am getting regular thoughts of suicide and that is a start. I don't know what to do, nothing feels worth living for if things don't change or get better."

I come to you with a desperate plea because I have no friends to confide in so I must confide with strangers on the Internet. At least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself (which I have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past). I've posted this on another subreddit and I don't know your rules on multiple posting, but if I don't get help soon, I fear what I might do.

I need life advice. 

Ever since I've left high school, my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure. I was originally accepted to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree. I originally wanted to be just computer science, but with influence from my accountant mother, she encouraged me to take CompSci with Accounting.

I moved out, then something in my head just switched. In high school, I was a responsible honor roll student who got all As with little to no effort. When I moved out, I just let go of everything. All my classes started failing, I got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time, starting with Skyrim, then into League of Legends. 

After I moved out of the dorm without steady internet, I realized how wretched of a person I could become. I remember that after every class, instead of going somewhere to study, I went to one of the common rooms with my PC, mouse and mousepad ready, hooked up and just played League of Legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep. I've also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning, making me unable to go to class the next day.

After a straight year of mediocre marks, my parents and I agreed that maybe Waterloo was too difficult of a university and that I should go to an easier university. Better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university right?

Well, moving to York University initially wasn't so bad. I did get good marks initially. But this year, I've once again failed my parents and myself. My League of Legends addiction stayed, causing me to play instead of studying, causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses, causing me to drop one and end up getting a D in the other. I never paid attention in class, I was too proud and stupid to think that I needed to. ""I would read that on my own"" I said to myself, but I never did since my nights were filled with League. Since I also repeated an accounting course that I needed for an internship but didn't get the mark I needed last semester, but since I kept forgetting to do online assignments and didn't pay attention in class, I ended up getting a worse mark than before. I'm very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my GPA was high enough.

Now, with the beginning of my new semester, my ol' faithful ASUS laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and I've managed to get some time to think about my life. I decided that I would start paying attention in class, start studying and stop playing so much games, especially since the laptop I have now can only play shitty games.

However, my dad just talked to me about an hour before I typed this. He and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at Waterloo, but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge. My mom, who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her, has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling. My dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatum.

If I don't start pulling my marks up (and B's are probably not going to cut it), he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone. For the past 20 years of my life, he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice, but I have never done any of it. I can't blame him for wanting to kick me out. I've wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and night.

I don't know what to do. I want to believe that I can study and do better in school, but I don't know if I can at this point. I have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past, but I always seem to forget the strife and pain that I went through just a few months before and fall into old habits.

I've already feel guilty about all the shit I've put my parents through and it's beginning to affect my head. Ever since I've failed those midterms last semester, every time I go through any kind of emotional stress, I've been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head. ""Maybe you should just kill yourself,"" they say. After I hear these things in my head, I always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide, how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how I wouldn't have to worry about disappointing them anymore. I'm scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my control.

Even with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts, I am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving, then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure. I'm lost. I cannot tell anyone in my life about this. All of my friends wouldn't know what to tell me and probably couldn't tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit. I don't want to put all of my emotional baggage on them. They don't deserve it, they have their own lives to worry about.

The only glimmer of hope I see is that I have been successfully working out at home using workout videos. Although most of my drive to get in shape was to get ""a pornstar body"" (I'm really fucking motivated by sex for some reason), it's about the only good thing I have going for me. Hell, that might be the only way I could make money when my dad kicks me out and I have to start whoring my self out.

Please, I need help. I need a third party to tell me what to do. I keep seeing the pattern of my life but I just can't seem to break the cycle. With my dad about to kick me out, I'm really afraid that if I don't pull my marks up and turn myself around, I may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alley.

I'm not currently suicidal right now, but I know that if I can't pull this life off soon, I will have good reason to be. Any kind of advice is needed, even if it's just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit. I've tried to find one but Google didn't help me this time. Please, I don't know what to do."
250wq5,5,2014-05-08,I hate myself sooooo much.. Is it possible to ever get out of this? Or should I just die now,toosadtolive,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/250wq5/i_hate_myself_sooooo_much_is_it_possible_to_ever/,"I've been depressed since I was in the seventh grade.. Only 12 years old. Because of daily bullying from my ""best friend"" every day since fourth grade, I already felt like I wasn't good enough by mid grade 5. By middle school I was used to people treating me like trash and by ninth grade, I was very suicidal. I cut myself for the first time in a bathroom stall at school and since then, I was hooked. I spent all my time thinking about suicide and I thought of ways to kill myself. I even wrote several suicide letter and I always revised them because I didn't want to leave anything out. 

Finally my family moved to a different state, and I left all those people who bullied me behind. Unfortunately my memory is really good and even now, I can remember specifically what many people said to me and what they did. And at my new school, people were so friendly to me   and one of the popular guys at school asked me to homecoming. I was basically transparent and everyone I met could tell I was extremely insecure and I had numerous people ask me what I was so insecure. I made some good friends there and overall got a little bit happier, but underneath it all, I was still so insecure and hated myself.

I had always read that college was supposed to be the best four years of your life. Well when I went to college with high expectations and thought I would finally leave my self-loathing behind and find myself. All my good friends went to the other side of the country for college and they all got in serious relationships, scored internships, got really involved, have high gpas + are preparing for med school/law school, etc. And there's me: I went to college, I was on my own for the first time and so lonely and depressed. I lost my virginity to a frat guy who kept pressuring me and calling me a bitch and insulting me until I gave in. When I did, he treated me like girls are treated in vulgar porn scenes. I got even more depressed and slept with three more guys within the next few months, and one of them treated me like shit as well. I even cried while he just laughed. I know some girls are okay with sleeping around (and that's fine), but for me, it makes me feel like shit. Every day I think about this and I can't believe I let guys treat me as badly as they treated me. I realized that my whole life, I've only had one guy who has liked me for me... Everyone else was people who have never spoken to me and most of them lose interest once they actually know me. This is disheartening.. it's like my true self is unattractive. I lost all ability to focus and can't even study.. Whenever I actually attended class, my brain was all foggy and I couldn't bring myself to listen. I failed almost all my freshman year courses, and got kicked out. But I appealed, got back in, and ended up getting kicked out again at the end of this year. I have a total of 19 credits after 2 years at college, and now I have no school and I owe 20k in student loans. I had a job but lost it because I couldn't control my anger at work one day and caused a scene. I finally got a job the other day as a door-to-door marketer, but that is the WORST job ever, I am depressed as fuck and I have to act happy, KNOWING that I'm annoying the fuck out of other people. 

Idk when I think about it I just don't really see a future for myself... I don't see myself getting anywhere in life and I really don't know why I bother to keep myself alive... I've hated myself for so long I just don't know if I can ever like myself again...Why live when I don't?

People always ask me how I sleep so long (14+hrs a day) and it's because when I wake up, I think about everything that makes me sad and I go back to sleep to rid of those thoughts. People ask me why I have no motivation to study and it's because I don't care about myself or my future. I'm 20k in debt, I 'm basically jobless, educationless, friendless. I'm so thankful I still have my parents, and I know they love me...They've made sacrifices just for me.. But they're so disappointed in me and I've overheard them talking about it.. It makes me even more depressed..Idk... I just can't take this anymore, I feel like I'm at rock bottom. There have been many times before when I felt I was at rock bottom, but this is true rock bottom... I just want to die."

So, I landed an internship in the bay area as a software engineering intern. My interview questions were all algorithmic based (arrays, sorting etc). Now, when I got the letter, and as I spoke to my internship head, he says my job is to work on Ruby on Rails development. 

I accepted the position because I was willing to learn and this seemed like a fantastic opportunity, but the problem is that I don't have experience in Ruby on Rails. How should I go about it? Can I learn the basics in 4-5 days? I don't have much time before I join.

Right now, I am doing interviews for internships and talk a lot about that internship and the Java program. 

What I did was basically use ctrl + f for everything that the manager wanted done. I didn't really learn much but I tried by trial + error until I changed the program to how my manager wanted it. 

I think being honest about that is good for the interview but I know I should explain how I SHOULD have went about it in hindsight. This was a program sort of like Paint/Photoshop for reference. I only had Intro to CS 1 and Intro to CS 2 under my belt and simple knowledge of Swing as my starting knowledge base.

It began when I was a young boy and my parents thought a visit with a therapist may assist in curbing some behavioral and social issues they were concerned about. The office was welcoming in its warm and friendly atmosphere. The therapist was a sweet lady that asked me to sit down and spoke with me about anything and everything that I wanted. She gave me advice on how to handle my thoughts and feelings along with something she referred to as “impulse control”. Eventually, we began to confide in each other and I started helping her through her issues too. We saw each other for years until she retired and moved to another state. A long lasting impression had been made and right after high school, I enrolled in college declaring myself a psychology major.


The program was difficult with all the lecturing, research papers, and tests but that wasn’t fulfilling my desire to help people. I don’t know how they expect students to gain experience without interacting with real clients. Case studies were bullshit, I wanted the real thing. They say that if you want to start changing the world, you need to start in your own community so I began to console those in desperate need on campus. While it did not gain me popularity with my peers, it was a valuable first lesson: You cannot help those that do not wish to help themselves.


I tried to help the women first since my therapist was a woman and I felt I had a better connection and understanding of them. Not that many women accepted that their binge drinking, experimentation with narcotics, and sexual promiscuity was a result of their father’s molestation, paternal lack of attention or male presence in their life, or an unconscious emulation of their mother’s behavior. I expressed my desires to help the fix their obvious moral flaws but I was met with physical violence more often than not. 


The men were equally as unresponsive to my diagnosis of their overwhelming desire to prove their masculinity. Their fixation on chugging beers, bedding women, and acting as an “alpha male” was due to underlying issues with unacknowledged homosexual tendencies and incestuous desires for their mothers. These encounters solidified my belief in helping only those that want to be helped. When I presented my theories to these troubled men, I was met with fierce emotional outbursts and threats of violence. 


As much as I wanted to help my fellow students, I couldn’t save them from themselves. It’s not about nature vs. nurture. It was their environment that didn’t help them see the forest from the trees. I switched my approach and found a method to have those in need come to me. I applied for an internship at a therapist’s office where I was assigned administrative work. Although it wasn’t what I signed up for, I made the best out of it. When the therapist attended conferences and after closing time, I was able to gain practical experience by scheduling my own appointments with new patients. Over three months, I had developed a client list. I must have done an amazing job because none of my clients ever returned after a session with me. 


The arrangement went well until the police crashed one of my sessions at the behest of the therapist. Some of my clients had called and complained about my treatments. The police became involved when some clients had relapsed and harmed themselves or others. I was shocked at that accusation that my patients had committed these crimes because of my malpractice. That’s where I learned my second most important lesson: you cannot blame yourself for client failures. You can’t win them all and some will fall between the cracks. Even though the weaker willed clients ruined my practice, the police were interested in having me do some work with them, pro bono, of course. 


They escorted me down to the precinct where I was assigned a private room and two new clients waited for a session. They read me the Miranda Rights which was unnecessary. I swore that under the rule of doctor/patient confidentiality I would not disclose any information to anyone about them without their permission. They questioned my qualifications, experience, and competency. I can understand why that clients are interested in the lives of their therapists but these questions probed too deeply into my life. After I finished my session with those clients, they told me that they wanted to keep me on for a little while longer. I was escorted to a cell for the night. I couldn’t imagine why they would put me there but I did not ask questions. It was probably due to budget cuts that they couldn’t give me a hotel suite. 


The next morning, I was bought into another session with a new client. The man introduced himself as my lawyer. I laughed at the joke and thanked him for the offer but I didn’t require his services. It would be a violation of ethical standards. The man didn’t seem to understand my refusal of his services and continued to act as if he was performing the duties of a lawyer for me. His case was very extreme but my job is to understand him, not argue about reality. 


Like the clients before him, he asked questions about my credentials and services performed for clients. Privilege would not allow me to disclose any personal information about them. I redirected the questions toward the lawyer in order to better understand his obsession with his job. My diagnosis was a combination of grandiose delusions, narcissistic disorder, and he was most certainly a pathological liar. Compulsive lying for a lawyer is an understandable portion of the job but his attempts to convince me I was in trouble with the police were bordering on the line of delusional. 


After finishing the session with the lawyer, I was taken into a court room to serve as an expert witness. I had never been in a courtroom before but I found it strange that the judge had referred to me as the defendant. I identified myself as an expert witness. The lawyer told me to stop talking which I took as an offense. We are both professionals. There was no need to treat me like a child. Why would they invite me here, as an expert witness, only to have a client keep me silent? Since the lawyer was the expert on law and court, I stayed quiet while I awaited the defendant to arrive. No one else showed up. 


The judge asked the lawyer for a plea on behalf of the defendant. He responded: “not guilty by reason of insanity.” I finally understood what they needed from me. I had spoken out of turn and was reprimanded before. The lawyer asked me to take the witness stand and answer questions. Once again, my credentials were scrutinized until I was dismissed. I don’t know how I was much help to the defendant as I had never met the man or woman before and could not judge their sanity.


After some deliberation, all parties concluded that the defendant was unfit for trial. I’m glad I was able to stop them from putting a mentally ill man through trial. He wouldn’t even be able to understand what was going on around him. The judge was impressed with my work and assigned me to a new position at a mental health institution. 


When I arrived, I was given an office with a desk, chair, and bed. The state must really be going bankrupt if this is how they treat their employees but that wouldn’t stop me from doing the job I was born to do. My client list consisted of daily sessions with other therapists that worked in the facility with me. The job required me to be there 24/7 but at least they were providing me with food, clothing, medical care, and restricted internet access. That’s where I learned my third lesson: always discuss your salary before you start doing a job. I never spoke with anyone in human resources about how much I was being paid for my services. I’ll have to discuss payment with them at some point in the future. For now, I am the happiest man on Earth. My childhood dream came true.

So I got my first project today. I was asked to create the inner workings of a simple contact form on the play framework. It seems easy enough: I've found some good documentation, but, at the same time, I have a million questions about the source code I'm working on. I was literally given thousands of lines of code and asked to figure it out myself. At the same time, I'm not allowed to email the head developer (Who is in Russia but speaks fairly good English) personally as he is busy working on integrations, and the CEO said he will be unable to answer my questions.

So, my question to you guys is: 
Is this a common practice in development? Do companies usually hand their intern source code with an assignment and ask them to go at it?

China’s banks look very similar to US banks before the 2007 bust. They are thinly capitalized and made risky loans in an environment characterized by slowing growth. If markets lose faith in the Chinese banking system, it could lead to a cascading liquidity crunch and rapidly deteriorating growth across the globe. Additionally, the Chinese government is limited in its policy response, because bailing out the banking system could alienate the middle class

Their primary market will always be China. However, new models for growth like it's AliExpress, could do very well in the US. Alternatively, its e-commerce 3rd party payment tool Alipay could make inroads in the US yielding opportunities for Chinese consumers to buy directly from US retailers 
[Can you give us an idea of the products Chinese consumers might be interested in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcraw9?context=5)|It really depends on what type of consumers you are targeting and what suppliers you have access to. For example, authentic luxury goods from the US and EU are in high demand. Also, beauty products - skincare, makeup. Baby products - infant formula, and just about anything else. Be aware, not all of these consumers are in tier-1 cities. Lower tier consumers make frequent purchases online because there are not as many flagship branded stores in their cities.

Is the Chinese Government buying commodities to hedge against inflation globally?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpmeq?context=5)|China's ""go out"" policy at the government level is it's primary policy framework for international investment. As you look at its motivations, for doing so, it can be broken down into the following areas - investing in state-owned enterprises that go global allows China to invest it's US foreign exchange reserves (now approx 4 trillion) in a more controllable fashion than traditional investment vehicles. It allows the government to gain access to natural resources the country needs to fuel it's economy. Lastly, it helps create ""national champions"" or globally recognized Chinese companies that help boost China's softpower and raise its image on the international stage.
[What is one tip you would give a smaller business to be more successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp5tz?context=5)|If you're looking to enter the Chinese market for the first time as a small business you should really look at e-commerce. Platforms like Alibaba's Tmall International, are a great way to test the market before making a big investment.
[What are your thoughts on the Chinese real estate bubble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrmlk?context=5)|I think the real estate bubble is in line with one of the many potential destabilizers of the Chinese economy. Refer to my note about ""shadow banking""
[There are so many ""manufacturers"" over there than just get some parts and put them together...how do I find the ""true"" manufacterers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpnsz?context=5)|The best way to find manufacturers in China to produce a product is via Alibaba.com. Their rating system allows you to determine who are good manufacturers and who are not. There are even 'verified' manufacturers where representatives from Alibaba go on site to the factory to audit the operations.
[Thank you! I've done some of that, my problem is that if I could skip the guys calling themselves manufacturers and get the parts to put together myself, I could reduce costs greatly. When I talk to them they all say it's their factory that makes them, but I'm almost positive that's not the case.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpw38?context=5)|It depends on how much work you want to do yourself. There are third parties that can take care of everything from payment, shipping, customs, etc. Or you can work with several individual manufacturers. It just depends how much time and money you want to invest.
[Any advice for a student studying communications who aspires to work in the PR/Marketing industry? Also, any places in China/around the globe where there are an abundance of opportunities for a future uni graduate fluent in Mandarin Cantonese and English like me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrtct?context=5)|PR and marketing is probably one of the better areas to get into in China as a foreigner. If you speak Chinese fairly fluently you can get a job as a English copyeditor at  PR firm in China. With time you can rise to take on more significant roles within the organization.
[Is it true that Chinese companies will hire westerners for executive/managerial positions, just because they think that having an american/european-looking guy in charge will make them look more globally successful &amp; financially savvy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqard?context=5)|There are certainly cases where westerners are hired to be an ""international representative"" however if you look at larger companies making headlines around the world, the hire actual experienced western executives who have global experience and can bring new capabilities to their organizations.
[That does sound more reasonable.. Although, I have heard of situations where they'll hire westerners to sit in meetings and look rich, because they want to appear more capitalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcr00h?context=5)|I think it comes down to face, or what Chinese call ""mianzi"". Having a foreign face at smaller firms doing business in China is a good 'credential' as they seek ways to position their firm against competitors.
[To what extent has outbound investment so far been led by the state?  Do you think China's going-abroad strategy is going to influence the balance of state vs. private ownership in the business sector?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcq2fl?context=5)|Ill be back in 5 min to answer.
 |Chinese companies (both state-owned and private) are going overseas for two reasons - government-driven and business-driven motivations. While there certainly are government motivations which I mentioned about, the business motivations are very real. This is because the domestic business environment across a variety of industries is very competitive and also decelerating. Therefore, Chinese companies are going overseas to access new markets, secure new capabilities in the form of brands, technology and management capabilities. This is much easier in other emerging markets across SE Asia, Latin America and Africa, but it becomes much more difficult in advanced economies like the US and EU where there is much more regulation.
[Are there any pending US/EU policies that will drastically change the status quo?  Will these policies potentially be changed by the upcoming elections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpi5b?context=5)|As you look at Chinese investment in the EU it becomes very complicated depending on where in Europe these investments occur. Deal reviews are typically conducted by individual governments and not the EU as a whole. Under the current system a Chinese company could have a deal blocked in the UK, then make the same investment in a less-regulated central european country and then freely trade their products across the EU. 
[What's the best approach for small company when contacting producer in China to get the best deal (best prices\) even if it's for small amounts of goods that are being ordered ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqf9t?context=5)|Small amounts are very hard. For the best deal you really need to buy quantity. Small batches are best to use AliExpress, large batch use Alibaba.com.
[A close friend of mine is going to begin attending NYU Shanghai next year for business,  what's your opinion if the school if you have one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrhga?context=5)|I don't know too much about this particular program. I do know there are several top tier universities from the US that are opening co-branded programs in China and in other parts of Asia. They usually have the same faculty and curriculum to maintain the quality of education.
[Hey thanks for taking the time for this AMA, this is a really interesting subject. Japan and China, being neighbors, have always had a trading relationship. However, this relationship has been strained due to PM Abe's efforts to expand the Japanese self defense force and the touchy island ownership rights, not to mention lingering resenentment from WWII. Do you see their relationship ever improving or is it going to be as strained/uneasy as it is now forever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqrtc?context=5)|I think we're at a particularly tense time when it comes to Sino-Japanese relations. It's difficult to say if this will ever go away given the long history, but it should hopefully not remain as tense as it currently is at the moment.
[As a student in uni studying International Business &amp; Marketing and minoring in Mandarin, how would I get a foot in the door into the China-US B2B relations field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrdlp?context=5)|You should do everything you can to get relevant internships. Do your best to build up a practical skill like sales, or design. If you speak mandarin and have a marketable skill, you'll have great opportunities after your graduate.
[This guy is so obviously a representative for Alibaba, guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrsti?context=5)|I'm not. If you know anything about e-commerce in China, then you would know that Alibaba has a particularly strong position in the market. JD.com does well in the consumer space, but in all other categories niche players barely have any significant marketshare. 
[Hi, I am planning for the future is my money best going into a chinese business or a African business based in a country China are investing in.  I fear China's one child policy will kill growth in 15 or so years and China will be a mess with an ageing pop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp71f?context=5)|We are at the very early stages of a wide-range of cross-border opportunities that will emerge as a result of China's globalization. From China's so-called 'walking wallets' the name used to describe its luxury-buying tourists, to trade linkages with Africa and Latin America, to the impact of Chinese firms operating in the US - like Shuanghui international's acquisition of American pork-producer Smithfield Foods.
[I thought China got rid of the one child policy ban.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpeca?context=5)|It's only in certain cities at this stage. Many cities now allow parents who are both single children to raise multiple children.
[Mostly, they'll temporarily hire a westerner who's already in China to wear a suit, and pretend to be an executive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcquv2?context=5)|I think theres a good NYT article about this somewhere. Google it.
[How would one stop them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpdye?context=5)|Of course, many in the United States are rightfully worried about the threat Chinese investment could pose to domestic security and competitiveness. However, there is no need to ""stop them"" - Chinese investment can lead to many benefits such as job creation, infrastructure development and increased tax revenues. The key is for the government to have the right regulatory processes in place to ensure potentially negative investment from China that could result in anti-competitive or national security threats are blocked.
[Doesn't the Chinese practice of currency manipulation harm these developments from occurring? Surly this and the other shady trade maneuvering, made by China, can be detrimental.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpqze?context=5)|I think the real worry is China's shadow banking sector. Shadow banking refers to any financing provided to a Chinese company by a “non-bank” entity. According to Reuters, China’s shadow banking industry is comprised of “thousands of unofficial credit providers, pawn shops, trust firms and various other loan vehicles ”. The shadow banking sector was allowed to flourish without much government intervention, because private companies helped offset the cost of supporting unprofitable SOEs while Beijing tried to maintain high levels of economic growth. 2013 estimates by global investment bank UBS put the size of the shadow banking system at $3.4 trillion – equivalent to 45 percent of China’s GDP.

252gvn,3,2014-05-08,Business student thinking about switching major to a double major or complete CS major,cs_trowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/252gvn/business_student_thinking_about_switching_major/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

I’m a German student, currently in my second semester of my Business Administration Bachelor, and I’m thinking about switching my major to Computer Science or “Business Informatics”, which is a double major in Business/CS. I got into programming only 2.5 months ago and but spend a lot of time doing it, and I definitely want to pursue a career in software development.

Because by the time I could switch my major, I would already have spent two semesters on my business admin degree, so switching to the major “Business Informatics” would be easier for me, because I could keep all my grades from this year (which were quite good) and I’d have way less workload in my next semesters and would have more time to learn other things. However, because the CS classes of this major build up on each other, I would also have to spend the same time on this major as if I would start at 0 with a full CS major. 

Also, the “Business Informatics” major has only 6 CS related basic classes and of course doesn’t cover CS topics in the same depth a Computer Science major does. In these basic classes Id learn the basics of Java, basic data structures and algorithms, Database basics and some web languages. In this major I’d also work on 2-3 projects during classes and I’d have one Bachelor project on which I’d work for two semesters. One specialization of this major I’m interested in is “Computational Finance“, which has classes in Heuristic Optimization, and the basics of Artificial Intelligence. 

I don’t know if a double major in CS/Business drastically lowers my chances of getting a decent developer position, because it has a reputation of not teaching programming properly in Germany. Of course I plan on getting internships and building a good portfolio during my studies. 

**TLDR: Currently in my second 2nd semester of my Business Admin Bachelor; Got into programming and want to switch my major to a tech related degree; A business/CS double major would be an “easier switch”, but wouldn’t cover CS topics in the same depth as a normal CS degree.**

**Is it worth it in my situation to start all over with a CS degree or could I just make an easier switch to the double major and focus on internships and own projects?**




Thanks in advance for your help!"

[SLS seems to have encountered more criticism than average for a heavy launch vehicle. How has this affected your experience with the program?  Also, obligatory question about whether any of you have played Kerbal Space Program.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwa7o?context=5)|Interesting question on criticism.  Personally, agency level criticism does not effect me day to day because we are so busy working technical details in developing our booster - making sure it will be ready for launch.  So when I see it in the news, it is a little frustrating, because I believe this rocket will provide a great capability, both for manned space flight and for unmanned science applications.  But I don't personally spend any time worrying about it because I want to get this booster right for any mission.  And no, I have not played Kerbal, but my son has told me about it and said I would love it.  Bruce 
[Do you feel that soon the US will experience a resurgence of it's space obsession that will allow NASA a larger budget for space flights to other planets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwc2r?context=5)|I sure hope so.  My 3 children are really excited about space and rockets and I wish for nothing more than an increase in American desire to reach beyond and do what we can do best. Gordie.
 |NASA has, historically, received strong support from Congress and our Presidents, so I'm guessing that the agency will continue to receive strong support, and a larger budget would surely help!  I would love to see a surge in the space program  that would mimic the excitement of the space program in the 60's. -Eddie.
[For getting into the field, what college degrees are most useful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcw50t?context=5)|Hello out there, Thanks for being interested!  Most folks I work with in the SLS Booster office are engineers by trade, but we have all kinds - mechanical, electrical, aeronautic, and materials at least.  Personally, I have undergraduate degrees in geology and mechanical engineering and a masters in mechanical.  I was a thermal analyst in my early years before I moved into project management.  But any project like this takes hundreds of people, including financial and business expertise as well as engineering.  But certainly engineering is the primary degree we use.  Bruce.
 |There are several different degrees which help when working on any space program.  Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, Chemical, Systems, Environment Engineering are useful, but also business, accounting, and management degrees come in handy.  -Eddie.
 |I'm an Aerospace Engineer, I think that's most likely your best bet for getting a job at NASA, considering what we do. That being said, I have met a number of other various engineers at the center: chemical, nuclear, mechanical. Any engineering degree will you get a good start at a job though really. Answer taken with a grain of salt, I'm just an intern. :)

[What is your favorite thing about being part of NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxwu7?context=5)|Hey penguinkitten, my favorite thing is that it's a GREAT place to work.  My job is a lot of fun.  NASA was selected as one of the top places to work in the government. I work with college students on a daily basis who are building rockets for us.  Additionally, I work with bringing on students as Pathways Interns.  But, NASA is always working towards new and great things... which inspires me everyday.  - Julie.
 |I love supporting an agency that is on the cutting edge of science and technology.  People all over the country seem to be enamored with NASA, and I'm proud to be a part of that!  -Eddie.

However, we have many contractor partners helping us build our SLS rocket that hire engineers from all different countries. Our engineers generally have degrees from accredited University in an engineering field and there are many different fields for engineers - aerospace, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, environmental, etc. Good luck!  -- Shan.
 |NASA offers a limited number of opportunities for international participation.  Most projects are only available to students within the United States or its territories; and Department of Defense schools operating on U.S. Military Installations. However, there are several projects that will consider applications from international students.
 |One option you may wish to consider as you prepare for college is the NASA Academy.  You can obtain information and how to apply at: [Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/NASA_Academy.htm) .

[What is a basic set you want to build a rocket yourself? Edit: And what are often made mistakes and how do I prevent them if I'm building a rocket myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwd8a?context=5)|If you're talking about hobby rockets, there are several inexpensive, commercially available kits that are a great way to get started.  One of the most challenging aspects of building a hobby rocket is the recovery system(s).  Be sure to seek guidance and advice from experienced rocketeers to be sure that you learn good habits and develop reliable recovery systems. -Eddie.
 |I think Eddie gave a good answer, for a first time build get a kit, then move on to designing your own rocket using a program like [OpenRocket](http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/) or [RockSIM](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocksim/Rocksim_information). [Apogee Components](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Kits/High_Power_Rockets)  is a good place to start. Look into any local rocketry clubs in your area to get some help from the experts.
 |Edit: As for common mistakes, you shouldn't make many if you start with a kit build. The components are going to be strong enough for what it is made for, just be sure that you use a high quality epoxy and don't skimp. Let it cure fully. After the first launch the shock cord or parachute may have some damage. Be sure to inspect the rocket after each flight for any damage.

[What do you think of Russia's plan to build a super rocket capable of lifting up to 130 tonnes, and also colonize the moon by 2030?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcymjf?context=5)|I hope it'll reinspire the US to have a space race again! :) - Julie.
 |I think it is definitely possible.  The next stage of the SLS program is to develop their heavy lift vehicle that can carry 130t of payload to orbit.  Combine that with the initial SLS lift capability of 70t to launch the astronauts into space and you have 200t of payload! :)
 |I really hope we as Americans can get there first! :)  We've done it before and I know we could ""win the race"" again!  We have brilliant minds and capabilities in the upcoming generations of youth that are looking toward the stars! Gordie.
[How has the privatization of space missions effected NASA's future in Washington D.C.? Due to this competition, will NASA head into a more supervisory role (contracts, safety &amp; mission planning\) and away from actual building of rockets, vehicles &amp; rovers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwgi4?context=5)|I think it takes both commercial and government involvement.  The private launchers we are funding are designed to bring crew and cargo to Space Station, while the SLS rocket that NASA is developing, is built for non-routine, deep space exploration.  So both paths are needed.
 |Hi EyesEvrwhr, NASA has been going to low-earth orbit for a long time.  We can now leave that to the private companies to continue that effort while we explore further.  So in my opinion, the privatization only helps us to continue to support things like Space Station.  NASA has many partners that help us do our job.  Thanks! - Julie.

[This may sound like an incredibly stupid question, but why do rockets have to be SO incredibly complex? Surely after all the years of development and progress in building them, they could be simplified and made cheaper. Or are they relatively simpler and thus cheaper than they used to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxyvv?context=5)|The U2 does get pretty high, about 70k ft by a quick search online. However the edge of space starts around 5 times that altitude, and the space shuttles goes quite a bit higher than that. Airplanes work in the atmosphere, they work by having air fly over the wings to produce lift. As you get into space there is less and less air. Not to mention the fact that airplanes use air-breathing engines. They don't work where there is no oxygen to burn. So you said it yourself, you still need a rocket, they carry all their own fuel and don't need extra oxygen to create lift. Also, the U2 gets up there by being incredibly efficient and not having a lot of extra weight it has to lift, like a rocket engine and payload. I know that they have looked into air launched vehicles, but it's not efficient, and doesn't end up saving any money to get things into space.
[Also, I've always been confused as to why a rocket as we know them is necessary. I understand the earth's gravity has to be escaped, but can that not be achieved by launching like a normal plane, and spiralling up, then perhaps using some sort of smaller rocket motor to push out of the last bit of atmosphere? The U2 spy plane can get pretty high, so if it had a small rocket strapped to it, could it get higher? Expanding on that idea, something the size of a 747 could theoretically do the same? Or could it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxyvv?context=5)|Not a dumb question at all.  It takes an enormous amount of energy to carry any decent amount of payload into space.  That's why the Satern rockets were so big (Satern V - 363 ft tall, SLS is 321 ft tall) and the engines have to be so powerful.  One fun fact I see is that our SLS rocket has the thrust of 135 jet engines on a 747 jet.  Gravity has not changed since Satern, and basic rocket chemistry has not changed either - which is why the rockets are still very similar.  Bruce  And yes you could definitely start be taking a plane that can fly really high and then strap a rocket to it and launch from there.  You should google a new concept by Stratolaunch Inc. (a Huntsville, AL company created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen).  They are developing a low-cost satellite launching system using rockets made by Orbital Sciences Corp.  The contract is to build the world's largest air-launched space rocket.
[How did you land your jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcw7w5?context=5)|Hey everyone,  I obtained a degree in Elementary Education and became a 5th grade math teacher.  While I loved teaching, it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  I found a contractor job in the Education Office here at Marshall Space Flight Center.  After 7 years, I went back to school and obtained a Masters in Human Resources Management.  By going back to school, I became a co-op and eventually a civil servant.  I love my job!!  - Julie.
 |I have degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  I supported NASA Marshall Space Flight Center's Non Destructive Evaluation office that tested various space flight hardware flight and test articles for the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and NASA's newer work.  At a time when work in my specific office was running low, I applied for my current job and accepted an offer. -Eddie.
 |Hey,
 |My name is Jason, I'm and intern working with Julie Clift on the Student Launch team. I don't know if I'm the best to answer this question being just an intern, but I can tell you that I got the job by being on my school's Student Launch team as an undergraduate. I was on the team for a year and then I became a lead for the team. Julie saw that on my resume and called me up to offer the job!

[ Will the SLS Booster in EM1 be recovered? Can a Europa Clipper reach  Jupiter’s Moon  in less than 3 years using the SLS? Will the MegaFlex still make as a wing of the Orion? Is the Cygnus Service Module with Ultraflex solar Panel capable of being utilized as a space tug for Expandable Habital Modules? When will the Stratolaunch Pegasus launch? Aside from Rockets, Space Solar Panels will you not make a HumanSpaceship in the future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwu2x?context=5)|I can only answer one of these since I work the Booster.  We were going to recover it under Constellation - in fact ATK developed and tested a new parachute system for that booster.  But when SLS came about, the requirements and flight manifest changed and recovery was no longer the best cost option for our system.  Bruce.
[How much impact do you see 3d printing having on the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwwup?context=5)|As an intern here at Marshall, we were taken on several tours. One of the big ones was to show us all the additive manufacturing capabilities that we have on center. There are a good number of people working on 3D printing here using it to create different parts. I know that they said they were making quite a few different things to be tested in rocket engines. They were all extremely hopeful there, telling us that printed parts were a fraction of the cost, many times quicker to produce, and gave nearly the same strength as machined components. That being said there is still a lot of work to do. Different printers give different material properties, and there is little oversight in the process. Part of the work they were doing there was qualifying different machines and processes, pinpointing the properties that a certain technique will give you to create a database that companies can point to in the future when ordering printed parts.
 |Jason.
 |I think that 3D printing will have a major impact in the manufacturing industry.  I have had fun model rockets created by 3D printing on my desk for over 10 years.  The technology has been around since the 1980s but only recently has it become much more economically available and the technology has improved dramatically.  NASA employees at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) have already created a 3D rocket engine part and used it flawlessly in a real launch.  The part they recreated was stronger and much cheaper than buying from an outside vendor.  MSFC also has a Deep Space Habitat division where they are creating a mockup habitat of what astronauts might live in while travelling to Mars and they have shown that they can create needed tools or parts in space as they travel.  I think that is an invaluable resource when you are away from your home on planet Earth and all the resources we have here! :)

[Beyond ion engines, what technologies are realistically feasible within the next generation to provide very high specific impulse propulsion?  Is VASIMR anywhere near being ready for prime time, or does it seem like there may be some major hurdles left to cross? Are there lesser known technologies that have turned out to be promising, at least in theory?  I've heard that there has been a lot of work in low energy interplanetary transfer over the last decade. Has NASA actually found the math to hold up, or is that still mostly mathematical theories that have yet to work out in application?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyrso?context=5)|I'm not much of an ""exotic propulsion"" guy, but I know electronic propulsion has been used as a low thrust, high Isp alternative. -Eddie.
[Project Constellation was developing the Altair lander along with the Orion, are there any plans to use the lander with the SLS Block II and return to the moon's surface for testing habitats intended for a future Mars mission? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwiit?context=5)|I just work the booster development, but I am not aware of plans to use that specific lander in the near future.  I remember it was discussed in Constellation days that we would use the moon as an outpost, but I don't think we have that right now.  The SLS rocket can certainly go to the moon and the first two test flights send the Orion around the moon and back, but no landers involved.  Bruce

I did build and fly two rockets obtaining my level 1 and level 2 certification.  So... anyone can build rockets.  But, the hardest part for me, was seeing my rocket go out of eyesight and praying it would come back.  It did! :)  - Julie.

How high did it go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxa40?context=5)|Hey Cablancer2!  I'm not a huge hobby-rocket person, but have flown two.  I hope to get back into it one day.  My largest was on a J motor and flew to about 5,000 ft.  What about you?  - Julie.
 |I've flown a 6"" wide, 38 lb rocket to just over 14,000 ft with good recovery. -Eddie.
 |I made a 3"" diameter rocket about 4' tall for my level 1 certification flight. I flew it on an I216 to about 3000'. I didn't have an altimeter on that one so I'm not certain. Had too big of a parachute though, I walked around for close to 3 hours looking for it. I went home without a rocket, but I was called up by the farmer who's land we were on and got it back several months later.
 |Currently I'm working on a level 2 rocket that will be electronic recovery with an IMU in a payload bay. It's a modified [kit](http://www.madcowrocketry.com/Arcas_HV_Rocket_p/k-144.htm) build, I'm planning on putting a J in it, haven't decided which one exactly.
[Julie, I'm really wanting to go in to NASA Education - particularly at MSFC where I have already been looking into internship opportunities. After the Shutdown, the budget forceast for Education and Outreach in our government offices looked bleak. At the university I'm associated with right now, our outreach opportunities in many departments were tied to NSF funds and things are having to get creative - to put it positively.  I believe that NASA education, particularly opportunities like this Launch event, is going to be essential to creating the broad scientific literacy that will ensure long-term support for the SLS and its goals.  So what *good* news can you give us about the future of non-rocket scientists at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwmlo?context=5)|Hi Tuesday_D!!  Great question!  There are currently not any open opportunites in our office... however, most people think to only look at USAJobs for opportunities.  I was actually a contractor before becoming a civil servant.  So check out the contract that supports the office, in this case, Aetos just received the new contract.  They are likely to have more opportunities available.  Additionally, it's always good to have a teaching degree to work in our office, if you don't already.  There is also a new program called Pathways.  If you are interested in going back to school, you can apply for the Pathways Intern opportunites on USAJobs.  If you've graduated within the last two years, the Pathways Recent Grad opportunities are a better fit.  As far as the future of non-rocket scientists at NASA, there are more opportunities that people often don't think about.  We have photographers, graphic artists, TV broadcasters, communications, human resources, protocol, and a number of other positions that support those great rocket scientists.  I hope that helps answer your question! - Julie  
[I want to go into NASA, but I am not sure what major to take, base in your personal experience, Would it be better to be into multi-disciplinary majors? Or should I specialize in one specific field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx8k6?context=5)|Hi AricYael - I would recommend looking at what interests you first.  For example, Marshall primarily works propulsion.  Each of the ten NASA Centers has different expertise.  Because of being a propulsion center, we hire mostly aerospace and mechanical engineers and less of electrical, physics, and science majors.  But, as I said, look into which Center fits your interests.  - Julie.
[Simple question here, how fast can you possibly make a rocket these days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwyvo?context=5)|Depends on what type and size of rocket you are referring to.  Are you talking about a rocket like the size the college groups in the NASA Student Launch are creating or are you talking about NASA's SLS rockets? Gordie.
 |With experience, you could build an average sized high power hobby rocket in a week, although the more you rush, the easier it is to make a mistake.  The lifecycles of NASA rockets varies from several months to many years, depending on the type, size, and mission. -Eddie.
[I'm asking about NASA's SLS rockets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx9hm?context=5)|To make one rocket doesn't really take that long.  Back in the Shuttle days we could start a new rocket segment every week.  (Remember the Shuttle rocket had 4 segments stacked on top of each other.)  It took about 1-2 months to complete everything, including safety inspections, on each segment and then ship them to Florida to be stacked.  The SLS rocket has 5 segments but it would still only 2-3 months to get all the parts to FL.  What I did not include is how long it takes to stack the rocket booster in FL (of course times 2 since there are 2 boosters on the SLS vehicle).  The SLS vehicle also includes the Core Stage which I have no knowledge on their manufacturing capability.  The stacking of the whole integrated vehicle then has to occur.
 |Of course I'm only talking about the pure manufacturing timelines.  You still have to take into account all the design and development time up front before you can start building a space vehicle.  That timeline is dependent on the government budget allocated to space and the size of the workforce that can support the program.
 |Gordie.
[Rockets now run on a new type of fuel, Pancakes or Waffles. Which is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx412?context=5)|Pancakes!  They taste better, so they have to be a better fuel, right?  =) Eddie.
 |Well I know I can run off both waffles or pancakes or either, depending on my mood! Gordie.
 |I'm a waffle girl. - Julie.
 |I'm a Waffle house man, no pancakes for me, but honestly I prefer bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns over those.
 |Jason.
[Which is more powerful a Liquid or a Solid Rocket?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxwxu?context=5)|That all depends on how big the rocket is (not dependent on whether it is liquid or solid).  If you are talking current rockets that exists today then the largest solid rocket engine (one SLS booster) produces around 3.6 Mlbf of thrust and the largest liquid engine I can think of that has actually been used (the F-1 engine) creates around 1.5 Mlbf of thrust.  Notice that usually when someone uses a liquid engine they group together 3 or 4 or 5 engines to get enough thrust.  It all depends on what your design requires.
 |Honestly I think the best space vehicle needs a hybrid of both solid and liquid rockets.  The solids will give you the best thrust to get out of Earth's orbit and the liquid rockets to support that and then provide additional needed thrust and maneuverability while operating in space.
 |Gordie.
[What are the big differences in rocket engine designs since the 60's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyaf5?context=5)|Hey luizluiz - I'll answer your second question: NASA offers a limited number of opportunities for international participation.  Most projects are only available to students within the United States or its territories; and Department of Defense schools operating on U.S. Military Installations. However, there are several projects that will consider applications from international students.
[I mean, the F-1 engine is an engineering marvel even by today's standards, what are some of the improvements we can make today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyaf5?context=5)|One option you may wish to consider as you prepare for college is the NASA Academy.

(I know that's not a good answer, but we went from receiving 4% of the federal budget in the Apollo days vs. less than one half of 1% now).  - Julie.
 |We could all use a little cash! :) Gordie.
 |Honestly it depends on how fast and how successful we want to be.  If the Space Program had unlimited funds like they kind of did back in the Apollo days, then we could get back to the Moon and eventually Mars quicker, and with a vehicle that had every design feature in it that we wanted. Gordie.
[I used to be obsessed with space as a kid - growing up, Sally Ride was one of my biggest heroes, and I was positive I wanted to join the Air Force, be an engineer, and then fly space shuttles or some such. Over time, the normal foibles of life lead me to end up taking my career in a different route, and I've ended up a working scientist, but a Wildlife biologist instead - pretty far off from anything space related! I still have a deep passion for all things space exploration, though, and have wanted to be involved in sharing that interest in space with the next generation; I feel like space inspires people in a way my own field doesn't. Do you have any advice on how an 'expert' non-expert could get involved in outreach and education in that regards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx9ni?context=5)|Hey TwoYaks, I understand.  I'm a non-engineeer myself and found a passion for NASA later in life.  The first astronaut I met was Eileen Collins, the first female commander of the Space Shuttle.  What an amazing woman!  My degree was in education, so obviously NASA needs all kinds of people.  I would recommend looking into programs, like the Solar System Ambassador for providing outreach and education.  Here's the site: [Link to www2.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/ambassador/) - Julie.
[Why do we need the new SLS and not use the one that was used during the Apollo missions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy04y?context=5)|The technology on Apollo was less than what your cell phone can do now.  We've taken certain aspects of Apollo and Shuttle, developed some lessons learned, and recreated a newer, better rocket.  I usually tell my students when they ask about why we retired the shuttle... ""Would you like to be driving a car that was built in the 1970's?"" (or in the Apollo case... many years before that?) :) - Julie.
[What is the cost breakdown for building and filling the rockets you work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy4m0?context=5)|Generally, the biggest cost of a project, both in time and money, is the development (design stage).  Manufacturing costs less, and the fuel costs less.  Generally speaking...  -Eddie.
[I'm curious about fuel vs. manufacture vs. design costs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy4m0?context=5)|I don't know exact percentages but in order the design costs are the greatest, manufacturing costs are the second highest, and the actual fuel probably comes in third.

If it happens, you can sign me up! -Eddie.
[I'm also curious about how allowing SLS a longer timeline to operations has changed the program dynamics. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwnjc?context=5)|Not sure I understand the question - can you elaborate?

I'm also looking for recommendations on a good mechanical keyboard and mouse since my current ones are getting pretty old.

253tld,3,2014-05-09,"Feeling bullied at work. What to do, how to cope?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253tld/feeling_bullied_at_work_what_to_do_how_to_cope/,"So, a little background: There are quite a number of times where I have felt singled out by a particular person at my workplace. I work as a technician in a pharmacy (one of the grocery chains) in the northeast. This person bullying me is a staff pharmacist, but technically not my boss. She is my 'boss' when my manager is not present, which is most of the time. Two pharmacists rarely ever work together at my store. We do less than ~300 Rx's most days. 

Isolated incidents: 

1) I received an Rx from a customer that had a questionable notation for the directions. I had never seen it written that way before and wanted to clarify before sending the customer away. I get an eye-roll, a sigh, and a Jeez Louise! from the pharmacist in front of the customer waiting and another technician. As I walk away, I can feel eyes staring at me and whispers about what just occurred. Apparently the question I had was unwarranted and stupid. So embarrassing. 

2) Anytime I ask the pharmacist a question, it seems like she intentionally conjures up a confused look on her face and says, ""wait, what???"" Like she had no idea what I just asked her. If it happened on occasion, I might think nothing of it. But honestly, every, single, time. It seems like she is pretending to have no clue to make it appear to other people around us that I ask vague questions, questions that don't make sense, etc. 

3) I have been told directly from this pharmacist that 'I do stupid shit.' 

4) She entices other coworkers to gang up on me. In these situations, there is usually some laughing and joking going on. I feel like I have no choice but to join in and laugh at myself. If I don't, they may think I am taking something personally, and I want to seem unaffected by this bull shit.

4) She forced me to wait on customers out of turn when the tech who was assigned to be running the register was available. She and the tech went to the back of the store and began talking, after she told me to 'please wait on that guy so he stops staring at me.' 

5) Did not fully explain her reasoning behind her decision to refuse a fill for a customer I was waiting on. I had no better explanation for the customer than 'she said no and I am doing what she told me to' sort of answer. She pulls me aside in the middle of my shift and accuses me of throwing her under the bus. I have a fully detailed post that I put up several months ago about this situation. To this day, I am still confused about why she wouldn't do it. I genuinely feel like she set me up to fail.

6) I offended a customer by accident. The whole situation was really fucked up. I feel terrible for it, but the customer clearly had some issues that needed addressed. This pharmacist was so pissed at how I handled the situation that she yelled at me to move!! out of her way, yelled asking 'why would you say that?!?!' In front of other customers, the upset woman, and other coworkers. Very traumatic and unnecessary. 

7) I was waiting on a customer while I was still a fairly new employee. The customer was asking me a question that I simple didn't know the answer to. Before I could even ask for help, she came up behind me, grabbed me on both shoulders (like upper arms) and MOVED me aside, so she was standing directly face to face with the customer. I almost tripped. Like, get your hands off me bitch!

There are many other situations that have occurred. I am honestly afraid to go to work sometimes. I dread pulling in and seeing her car in the parking lot instead of my boss's. Every time I work with her, I feel stressed, over worked, unappreciated, and just stupid when I come home.

Question: How to deal with this situation without jeopardizing everything I've worked for? I am starting pharmacy school in the fall and would like an internship with this company. This pharmacist may end up acting as my preceptor. I don't want to go to HR. That seems really stupid at this point. I can't quit. I could transfer… but would that look bad? Other than finding a way out of this store, how to cope? Help!"
253usx,1,2014-05-09,Need help making a post-grad job decision!,Zaahman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253usx/need_help_making_a_postgrad_job_decision/,"I am currently deciding between two job offers and I am looking for perspective. The first job is exactly what I want to do with my career, at a medium sized health system, working with some fantastic people. The problem is it is in my hometown, at the same place I did my internship for the past three summers. I desperately do not want to move back in with parents and I will feel embarrassed and defeated by doing so. That being said, its obvious that the position is probably best for my career. 

The second job is in the area I went to school, working at a small health system doing some of the work I want to do, but a lot of stuff that doesn't necessarily interest me currently. The positives are the salary is most likely higher(haven't received that info yet), I would be able to stay around 10s of thousands of young people and would not have to live with my parents. 

The question is, do I sacrifice my career goals for independent development or do I suck it up, work the better job for a year or two and then reevaluate?"
253vc5,3,2014-05-09,Always living in the past?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253vc5/always_living_in_the_past/,"So I have SERIOUS issues with moving on from the past. I know it's common for people to always think about their past and things they regret, but I take it to a whole new level. I will think about things that happened 5 years ago and be depressed about it. Every morning when I wake up, I think about an event that occured a year ago, and it depresses me like no other. Literally things from the past bother me so much that it interferes with my studies. Sometimes I become so enraged by things that happened ages ago to the extent where I can't control my anger.. when no one else even remembers, or if they do, they don't care. 

All my good friends from high school are now more than half way through their degrees, getting internships, and basically building a life for themselves. And then there's me, living in the past.. It's so embarrassing and I know that people would look down on me if they knew how bad it is for me, yet I can't change it! My brain is just completely obsessive Idk... Also, I often get super depressed when I think back to certain things.. to the extent where I get suicidal. Wtf is wrong with me???? I know I'm supposed to let go but HOW?

Also, does anyone else ever do this: Talk to someone about someone else as if you're friends with them when you are not? For instance, I was talking to someone at my college who went to the same high school as me. We never knew each other back then.. Anyway we began trying to see if we had mutual friends and he mentioned people and I'd say stuff as if they're my friend when in reality I only talked to them a couple of times before, like 3 years ago or something. I realized I do this quite frequently and thought about how embarrassing it would be if he talks to them and brings me up, assuming we're friends :/ "
253vue,2,2014-05-09,"What to do, what to do..",LongandLanky,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/253vue/what_to_do_what_to_do/,"Background: 

So I'm currently a junior in college pursuing a Finance Degree. I am way ahead of track and have a pretty good GPA at 3.67, even though it will go down some after this semesters grades come in. I am pretty far ahead in school and after this semester I will only have 12 hours left to complete my finance degree. Since the beginning of this school year I have been interning for a large telecommunication corporation in the Business Finance department. I get paid pretty decently for a 21 year old and am working almost 40 hours for a week and taking 12 hours of classes at night. I have been doing pretty well at my internship, and my boss has asked me a couple times when I graduate and told me to keep up the good work, pretty much giving off the vibe that I have a full time position waiting after I graduate. 

Issues: 

First off, even though I love the atmosphere at the corporation I work for, and I really enjoy the people I work with, the work itself bores me to death. I sit on excel/sap/access all day creating or modifying different financial reports. Most of the time I'm just clicking buttons that I've learned to click in the past. I get that I'm an intern and I have to do the grunt work, but I see full time workers doing the same type of work that I am doing and I just know I couldn't do this for the rest of my life. 

I have told my boss that I am planning on graduating in December and he currently thinks thats when I will be able to go Full Time. Technically I could graduate at the end of the summer if I wanted to, but I don't know if I want to graduate until I figure out what I want to do next!

Recently I have taken an interest in studying abroad next fall and being a kid one more time before I graduate. Technically my planned graduation isn't until May of next year, so this plan would entail interning till the end of summer, then study abroad in the fall, then comeback and try and intern at the same corporation I was working for in the spring semester as well as apply for other jobs. 

If the study abroad idea doesn't work out (currently in the middle of filling out a bunch of applications, already been talking with the school) I have considered getting a minor in Geosciences from the school I go to. I don't know how much this will help me in the future, I just feel like this gives me a better chance of getting a job in oil finance or possibly a job in land management or some other field. If I got my geosciences minor I would graduate next May. If I did this I could continue on with my current internship while looking for other jobs. 

I've also been thinking that I am incredibly lucky that I was able to get through the different interviews and able to find a team in the Finance Department that likes and respects me and that I'm taking this all for granted. My last idea is to take all my last classes this summer and then go full time starting this coming September. From a financial perspective this would be best for me as I wouldn't lose a lot of money from studying abroad and would have a full time job a year sooner than I normally would. 

The last thing I have to say is that I don't really like Finance at all. I originally picked this as my major because I like to make money, but soon learned a Finance Degree was more about accounting for money than actually being out there making it. Part of the reason I might especially dislike finance is because at my current internship half the things I do involve products you can't see or hold, I might enjoy it more if it was a product or service I was actually interested in. At the same time, I am a pretty extroverted person who enjoys working on projects and using my creative mind. I like to interact with others and enjoy finding solutions to different types of complex problems. I now see myself getting a finance degree because it shows I am pretty decent with numbers and have a business background, but don't want to sit behind my computer making different pivot tables my whole life..  This is also why I'm considering the Geosciences minor, I was hoping this minor would help me having more opportunities when it came to different types of jobs I'm qualified for. 

What should I do!?! 

tl;dr 

Should I graduate early and go full time at a job that doesn't really interest me, or should I go study abroad for a semester and come back in the spring and finish school up and search for a new job, or should I not study abroad, stay in school and graduate on time, and get a minor in Geosciences.

253xzl,2,2014-05-09,Applying for internships but having some issues,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/253xzl/applying_for_internships_but_having_some_issues/,"I am currently applying for internships for the upcoming summer. I have already submitted most applications, however I am experiencing some complications. I started at a community college earlier than most of my peers so as a result I accumulated many more units. By the time I transferred to a 4-year school, I was considered a ""junior"" and after the completion of this semester I will be a ""senior"". However, as far as the computer science program goes, I am still at ""freshman"" level (according to the official CS roadmap) having just completed a Data Structures and Algorithms in Java course. 

I am really hoping that this doesn't put me at a serious disadvantage when applying for internships. Do you think recruiters will expect me to have way more experience than I already do because of my ""senior"" status? Also on a more practical note, do you think I would have the level of knowledge at this point to be successful in an internship or should I be waiting to intern after I complete higher-level coursework?"

I work in my room (what if full of stuff like posters and PC parts) and i have a pretty nice leater IKEA desk-chair. I have two monitors and maybe i want to get a third one. My keyboard is a Razer Blackwiddow Ultimate 2013 (BIG mistake).

I just can't seem to get working on projects! Or even learn some new stuff! I'm now an intern at a company that makes it possible to digitally write and i'm making some projects that i got from school.  I was talking to this PHP developer who is a pretty cool guy about HTML5 and CCS3 and that i had a problem. I send him a .zip file with all the files for the website and he looked at it and tried some stuff and it was solved! But the thing what i noticed was *how* he worked. He was very open(?), he didn't fully focus on the code but he was just talking and trying some stuff. 

This made me think about the environment where i make websites because when i'm writing a file i try to be fully committed and i sometimes get grumpy but he just does it..

How do you work and what works best for you? I want to get some ideas what i could improve."
254aev,1,2014-05-09,Internship advice,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/254aev/internship_advice/,"I need some advice... I graduated college a year ago with a degree in Marketing. I hate Marketing. I think it's important to mention that. The only reason I didn't quit was because it would cost me too much to do another course. I would have had to fund it myself, and there was no way I would have been about to pay the €7000 with my minimum wage job. 

Anyway, for the last year I've been working my part time job and in the meantime moved out of my parents house and started renting with a friend from work. 

I've been looking for a job for the last year with no luck. I've had interviews for paid jobs but nothing came out of them. 

I realised that the only was I can progress my career is to do an internship to get experience. So I got an internship with a good company doing their digital marketing. It's an unpaid 6 month internship (no expenses paid). I'll be keeping up my part time job in the meantime. I'll be working about 45 hours a week altogether. 

I just started the internship this week and I already hate it. I'm pretty much doing the social media side of things which I already know how to do. It doesn't look like I'll be learning anything new. I was hoping I'd be doing some market research, which is the thing I wouldn't mind doing in marketing. 

The people in the office aren't nice at all. As soon as I walked in the door one of the other interns said to me ""Oh another intern? Your gonna hate it here"". She been questioning me as to what I've been doing for a year, and why haven't I got a job out of my degree already. As if it's easy. And why am I doing an unpaid internship, as if it's a stupid idea. It's getting to me. 

I really want to quit already, which is not a good sign. I don't want to waste my time in there. And I don't want a career on digital marketing in the long run. Should I quit?"
254rwy,6,2014-05-09,Stack ranking and performance reviews at large companies,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/254rwy/stack_ranking_and_performance_reviews_at_large/,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  This isn't something that I've noticed is talked about often on /r/cscareerquestions, but it's something that's really important for prospective employees, especially those that want to join the Big 4 companies, to know about ahead of time.

For people that are unfamiliar with stack ranking, it's effectively grading your employees on a curve every single performance review period.  There are often different buckets you can be put in, such as ""top"", ""good"", ""average"", ""below average"", and ""poor"", with a different percentage of employees supposed to be in each bucket.  Often, promotions are only given to those only in the top few buckets, and those in the lower buckets are often targets for layoffs.

A lot of larger tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Paypal, Yahoo) - as [described in this article and others](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2013/11/11/StackRankingWhyAreAmazonFacebookAndYahooCopyingMicrosoftsPerformanceReviewSystem.aspx) implement some form of stack ranking.  Microsoft supposedly got rid of it recently, after years of people complaining about it, but many other large tech companies have always had it silently.  Yes, the companies' official stance is that ""they don't have formal buckets"", but that's almost always bullshit, as anyone who's a front-line manager knows.  There are always ""recommended distributions"", and you'll need a damn good reason to not follow the recommended distributions.

It leads to a culture of competition, and talented engineers not wanting to work with other talented engineers, since they simply can't compete with each other when trying to get promoted. Work-life balance gets severely fucked up, and that's the main reason you see companies wanting to hire new grads - you pay them cheaper, and they have less commitments to family and their personal life.  It's also one of the main reasons you see less actual engineers as people get older - if you need to work 70-80 hour weeks to keep your job, that's just nearly impossible for most people with a family.

My personal experience - I've been an engineer at one of these larger companies, and I've never been in one of the lower buckets, partly due to my skill sets, but mostly knowing how to show my work off to management. I've been on multiple teams, and on each team, I've seen extremely talented engineers just either quit or get laid off because of not knowing how to play politics within these companies. The smarter ones just go to teams with much worse engineers, but the ones who are the best know to never (officially) work together.

Remember, this happens at the companies that everyone wants internships or jobs in. Definitely check Glassdoor before knowing what you're getting into.

To keep it in the spirit of /r/cscareerquestions, I'd definitely like to hear about other people's experiences with stack ranking and performance reviews. Honestly, in my opinion, it's a shitty system, and I strongly believe that tech companies need something like the Writers Guild of America to help expose these issues, rather than just complaining on Glassdoor.

255gnr,0,2014-05-09,Is Software Engineering Manageable Without Prior Programming Experience?,Stoic17,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/255gnr/is_software_engineering_manageable_without_prior/,"Hi all,

(Semi-long post ahead) Two things to ask about: if SE is manageable for someone without prior programming experience, and if it is, should I pick SE or CS. I've been admitted to both Waterloo CS Co-op and Waterloo SE Co-op. I was more or less set on going for Waterloo CS Co-op until my SE offer came yesterday (wasn't expecting an offer since I didn't have any experience), and now I'm considering SE as an option as well. My concern is that SE requires prior programming experience while I have none (other than a summer internship doing QA for a software firm - I only played around with their apps and didn't do any coding). I plan to start learning over the summer but I don't know if a summer's worth of coding can qualify as ""prior experience.""

1. What are the first year programming courses like in SE?

2. Would someone be able to manage catching up with the class if they're going in without any prior programming experience?

3. Are there any SE students/alumni who went into SE without prior experience who can share their experiences?

4. If anyone can offer some insight to help me decide which program I should go into, that would also be wonderful.

I have done some research on the differences between CS and SE but am still very undecided.

Software Engineering:

* Smaller class that stays together
* More focus on systems design
* More group work
* More practical work
* CE and CS courses both included

Computer Science:

* Different people each semester
* More focus on specific algorithms
* More individual work
* More theoretical work
* Flexibility in choosing electives/minors

Thanks!

TL;DR Is SE doable for someone who doesn't have prior experience (but plans to start learning in the summer)? If so, SE or CS?"

I know for certain that I want to get involved in software development, there's no wavering there, but I'm not certain on how I should target things academically.

I was shooting for an Associates of Science in Computer Science but learned that that might not be the optimal way to plan my trajectory and that it's better in most cases to get generals out of the way with an AA and finish up with a BS at a well-established university.

I don't care much for generals but if it's the ideal way to handle this, then I don't really see much other choice.

Could someone tell me if this is the right thing to do? I'm pretty stressed over this. Not to mention clueless. I'd appreciate any advice.


One of the other things was: I'm worried that I'll have less time for CS outside of classes, and also that my chances of getting an internship will be decreased with less CS-focused courses for my resume."

I'm finishing junior year at a very good school, have a bunch of leadership experience, have taken quite a number of upper division CS classes. My GPA is atrocious (2.4), but whatever. I left it off the resume.

The thing is, I got through the lower division classes by working with very smart people. I wrote a little bit of code but not too much. Upper division classes were very theory heavy, so I didn't code much. There's only one personal project I listed on my resume but it's a work in progress. I haven't written any code for it, but designed the overall structure of the program and the exact specs of its functions.

Not gonna lie, I'm bad at programming. I mean, I can do simple exercises that are taught in basic CS 101 classes and FizzBuzz type of shit, but I haven't committed enough time or effort to be proficient at it. I'm just afraid I'll show up for my internship and not know how to do anything, and feel bad for being deceiving them and wasting their time. "

Early 2009 everything goes to shit as interns and contractors are laid off and people are offered early retirement. In order to fill vacation positions and to fully push this ERP IT Project, they were moving people onto the project from other teams. I was on the low end of the totem pole in my group so I got moved and started working as a System Analyst. It was either that or be out of a job. I chose the new position as my wife was three pregnant and I couldn't be out of work for an uncertain amount of time. Long story short, I hated it…awful team, incompetent boss, incompetent project management, taking orders from consultants, low morale, etc.  HR and management assured me I would be moved back to my old System Admin job (that I loved) after a year. It became apparent this was never going to happen and HR confirmed it.  I almost left, but was offered a 7% raise to assume the duties of a co-workers who was leaving. I was the only one else on the team that knew what he did. This also was around the birth of my second child, so I stayed. I worked with a lot of bitter, miserable people who weren't that much older than me (ages 32-34). In 2013, I felt miserable and displayed it enough that two co-workers mentioned it to me. I knew then that I REALLY had to leave or I would end up becoming like the co-workers that I never wanted to become.  After nine months of trying to move, I moved to the IT Security team in September 2013 processing security requests for the application being deployed in the ERP IT Project. It was  nice to be off that old awful team, but I hated the work and I was mentally gone at that point. Every little thing was getting to me. Something had to break. In December I interviewed for another large company as a System Analyst in a more interesting industry/system and  I was sold. I started in January 2014. So far, everything at the new place has been nearly the opposite (in a good way) than at the old place. A little salary increase and pretty much the same benefits.

 

Four months in and I am wondering if this is a “grass isn't always greener on the other side” moment.  I like what I do now, but feels boring already. I was only in that IT Security position for four months and I wonder if left too soon and didn't give it much of a chance. The kicker is my associates and bachelor degrees are in a related field to IT Security: Computer Forensics and Network Security. I have an interest in having a career in those fields or related and I feel if I would have stayed at my old job, I would then have IT Security experience that I could leverage later in my career. Now, it is only four months’ worth. The place I am at now has an IT Security department but I can’t move anywhere until January 2015, but there is no guarantee that department will have openings anytime soon. I eventually plan to get certifications in that field but I just don’t have the time right now.  Did I make a mistake or am I just overthinking? Should I just give up having a career in that field and carry on my current path or try a new company next year to see if I can get a Security job?

 

Sorry for the length. I just wanted to have air my thoughts out. Thank you."

I'm a ChemE so my coding knowledge is mostly in those two programs. My boss works in the quality department so stuff always gets shipped in and I have to enter it into a spreadsheet before I do coding stuff. I sit next to the HR lady who hired me and she led me to believe she was my boss the first month I worked there (she never told me the guy I was doing a project for was my boss, and she always tells me what to do if I talk to her). I didn't question it because she sometimes enters data into spreadsheets and her intern used to do data entry into quality department spreadsheets so I thought I was doing the excel coding for her. I sit near her and her intern, and we are the only people who sit in that region. There are no cubicles so I'm stuck in their enviornment so to speak.
 
Well I ask her a month later, who is my boss? I was aggravated she didn't tell me initially, but my boss is very relaxed and just didn't care that I didn't talk to him. He lets me set my own hours (15-20 hours a week whenever I want), as long as I come in everyday. And super appreciative of things I'm doing. So I learn to ignore her because she obviously has power issues.

I sit near her and her intern and just stopped talking to them other than ""hi and good nights"", because whenever I talked to her she would ask me what I'm doing, and interject her retarded advice. She has no computer skills but expects me to follow her advice on whatever I'm doing. I wrote macros in excel that were pretty complicated but she doesn't like excel so she wanted me to do redo everything in google spreadsheets which uses javascript and it sucks. This would have taken up all my time and it wouldn't have worked well anyways, and I wouldn't have time to do matlab projects so I ignored her request. My boss hates google so why would I even do that? And I have no experience coding in anything other than matlab or excel (which I'm working on, but I don't care about javascript).

She also tried to stop an engineer from giving me busy work one day because it was ""sexist"" that he was giving busy work to the female intern. While sexism exists, I don't think he was being sexist and I am afraid he was scared off from asking me for help ever again (maybe for something useful like matlab). I also don't know if she made it known I didn't want to do it, which I'm afraid she did (I had no problem doing it, it was just making some copies for an hour). She also is crazy and will never shut up about the fact that I ""need to leave by 6"", even though I have never stayed past 6 unless she was talking to me.

I ended up just not talking to her about anything work related for a few months, then this week she put something on my computer. A note to follow a ""process"" that would be ""helpful"" for me. Which included ""asking people for advice, even if they aren't coding experts"". God damn it how do I get her to leave me alone? Her advice is useless and she expects me to follow it, and will ask me every day if I've solved the issue using only her ideas. Fuck that, but I don't want her to badmouth me because I'm ""cocky and think I'm better than her"". She also is convinced her intern works ""really hard"" and has a ""ton to do"" even though he just comes in for 4 hours a day and watches youtube videos (I sit 2 feet away from him). Sigh.

Ignoring her meant I could do matlab projects for two other engineers, and an excel project for another engineer. She would have me doing everything in google spreadsheets, I am not a computer programmer and only know Matlab and Excel. And chemical engineers don't use Javascript, so it's useless for my resume. Her ideas are terrible but she tries to get her nose into everything.

Am I handling this okay? I'm only there for a month longer before I start a new co-op, but I want good references and I'm afraid she talks shit about me. She talks shit about a lot of people though so it doesn't surprise me if people roll their eyes at her."

I need to figure out by Monday what job I had to take. Let me explain the two jobs so someone can help me figure out which one to take, because I am stuck. 

The first job pays $30,000 a year, which isn't so great for an out-of-college job. However, I will be doing basically 'bitch work.' I will have to drive an hour away from where I am about twice a week or so. They will pay for my gas though. I have to market the company. The company is a doctor's practice, though. I don't want to pursue this field at all. It's normal hours, M-F 9 to 5.

The second job is... more an internship. It's relevant to my field, but not exactly what I want to pursue. I only get paid commission. I will be making from maybe $500 to $2000 a MONTH. It will only be two months though. If they like me, I will get a job there (which I would accept since although it's not something I want to pursue, it's something that is related to my field). It's a really big and notable company. It'll be marketing the company, just like I want to pursue, but not in this exact field. I'll have an office desk and will work on a computer -- which I am totally okay with. It's normal hours as well M-F 9 to 5. 

I am leaning towards the second job since it's high risk, high reward. I'm not guaranteed the job at the end, but I'd put my all into it. My bigger dilemma is my mom. She isn't happy with the second job because I will not really be getting paid. I'm not paying rent and I'm living under my parent's roof, but she doesn't think it's better for me to do the second job. I know she's only looking out for me, but I don't know if I'm being irrational to jump to the second job/internship. I feel like the outcome would be better and look better on my resume... for when I want to apply to my field.

The thing is, I have some years of experience in Technical Support in a specific field that's not so easy to find people who are good - at least here - and involves web development, and I just got an offer from a company that's starting its operations in my country.  
  
My plan was to get a (mobile) development internship~&gt;job because I know that there are more chances to find a position somewhere else, and of course, I like it. I've been to US and I know the downsides and the difficult to get a visa there. I don't have a specific country where I want to go, I do have some countries on mind (US, CAN, AUS or GER), but I'll try to at least spend some time in some of those places before decide.  
  
I have some questions:  

Do you guys think that if I accept this offer, is it ok to ask on interview if there is some possibility to the company reallocate me after some years or can it make them turn me down?  
Is it possible to migrate to a developer position even if you study by yourself and don't have a job that relies specifically on it? Or would it be better to get a job where I can improve my dev skills and forget this position?  
  
Well, I'd like to hear if you guys have any advice that can help me trace a wise path to help me have more chances to get outta here in some years.

Thanks!"

257twu,6,2014-05-10,Concerns about a job offer...,internable,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/257twu/concerns_about_a_job_offer/,"I could really use some career advice. I have been working as an intern at a small start-up that is doing research and development for about six months now. In addition to going to school part time (mechanical engineering) and working this internship, I have a full time day job, a wife and two kids. Recently my day-job boss decided to make everyone’s work schedule more regimented. So I felt that I would not be able to keep working at my internship (I have been working spilt shifts to get my time in at the internship). When I gave my two weeks notice, I was offered a full time job. So, I need to choose between my current job, and this new job.

A little background about me: I’m 33, and have been a machinist for the last 13 years. The shop I work at (until recently) was focused on doing repair work for manufacturing plants, and so every day we had some new problem to solve. Probably less than 5% of our work was production work, and less than 5% of that was in quantities greater than 12. I started working on a ME degree a couple years ago, and I’m still at a sophomore level in my coursework. I applied to the internship just to get feedback on my resume, because I was certain that they wouldn’t hire me; I got a call back the next day, and was hired at my first interview. I’m not saying this to brag, I just want to point point out that in some ways this seems like a job that I am a very good fit for. My current job pays well for a machinist’s salary, and has good benefits (health, dental, clothing allowance), the new job pays slightly better with no benefits. Like I said above I have a wife (stay at home mom) and two kids (both &lt; 6 yrs. old). Maybe the most telling fact about my work history is that I had only ever worked for one company (except for a job at a deli when I was in high school), until we were bought out a few years ago. I’ve never applied for a job, and I’ve always been able to trust that my boss was actually looking out for me. (not that this has made me naive, just a little lazy when it comes to skepticism)

What I need advice on is this: what kinds of questions should I be asking my prospective boss to ensure that this new job is a good fit?

He let me know right away that a job with his company would have some big risks, IE they may not have funding a year from now, and therefore I may not have a job a year from now. Although that is a daunting prospect, it’s not a deal breaker. He told me that if they were going to let me go, they would give me two or three months notice. I think I’d be able to find a job in that time. Should I be more concerned about this?

Other concerns I have: am I going to be able to do all that is required/expected of me? Will I be able to take time off/work flexible hours so that I can finish my degree in a reasonable amount of time? Since the new job has essentially zero benefits, will the new healthcare exchange be able to provide me and my family with affordable insurance? How can I determine if my personality is a good fit on a long term basis? 

Of course, my biggest concern is that there is something I should be asking about that I don’t even know to ask about. So please don’t hesitate to ask “Aren’t you worried about X, Y, Z…”

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone that has taken the time to reply to this post; I really appreciate your advice. But I also want to make a clarification about what I'm asking. I'm not really asking about whether I should take the new job or keep my current one. That's a decision that I need to make for myself. There are a lot of factors besides ""stable vs. risky"" and ""benefits vs. none"" when it comes to choosing between the two jobs. For instance, I'm not sure that I will be able to continue going to school if I stay at my current job. My current job is at a pretty small firm, and the owner has started to make changes that may lock me into a schedule that will keep me from taking classes during the day (which is workable for gen. ed. classes, but now that I'm getting into higher level classes I'm going to have a hard time finding a Thermodynamics I class that meets on saturdays or is online...) What I was really hoping to get advice on is this: what kind of questions should I be asking my prospective employer? Like I said above _i've never had to apply for a job_ (outside of minimum wage jobs) and I need advice on how to find out what a full time position at this job would entail.

Also, I think that the replies to this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/256l46/advice_for_a_new_graduate_in_a_startup_company/ are kind of diametrically opposed to the replies I've received. What gives?

I have no programming background and as far as computers go, I can build them and do basic troubleshooting, so this is definitely a new field to me.

I have basically 2 choices in schools, both because of their proximity to family and jobs in my spouses field. 
* [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](http://catalog.utc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&amp;poid=1271&amp;returnto=233)
* [University of Maryland University College](http://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/cybersecurity-major.cfm#)

Basically, I am just curious on what you experts think or if there are any other options. UMUC looks like it doesn't offer much programming, which I don't consider a bad thing since I am not looking to become a programmer necessarily, but would that hurt me in getting a job? My goal is to complete my degree as quickly as possible so I can start working, however - I would like to pursue at least 1 or 2 internships with the NSA or similar.

Any knowledge/help you can provide will be greatly appreciated! I have been researching for the past week or so and have a bit of information overload both bad and good.

EDIT: I should add that even if I do mostly online at UMUC, at least 1 class per semester will be in person, for the GI Bill... Also, at UMUC, I will get about 2200/mo for rent (and will live with family for 200-400/mo) whereas at UTC I get about 1200/mo, and rent would be 800-1000. Job at UTC will be more flexible to my hours however unrelated to CS, at UMUC I would pursue some type of IT job or at a minimum work part time somewhere. Money does factor in but is secondary to education quality and job prospects in the future."

I kept the content the same.

&gt; As some of you are no doubt aware, Glassdoor data for new graduate positions is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish signing bonus and equity numbers alongside salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until late in the year, long past offer deadlines.
&gt; 
&gt;I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ to get a better idea of what we should really expect when interviewing and negotiating.
&gt; 
&gt; In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like the following format:
&gt; 
&gt; For each commenter:

 
* Target School: Yes/No
* Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
* Major/Concentration: 
* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
* OPT: Interned At:
* Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No

&gt; and then for each offer on hand:

* Company: $name
* Location: 
* Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
* Salary: 
* Signing Bonus:
    * Caveats or Obligations: 
* Equity or Stock Grant:
    * Vesting Period/Earn Out:
* Application Method: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* Application Process: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. Applied: 9/25, Offered: 10/12 or a detailed explanation of the interview process. Whatever you feel works best!

&gt; To save you reformatting the above, here's the raw markdown:

    * Target School: Yes/No
    * Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
    * Major/Concentration:

Background:
I'm currently a 2.5/3rd year student who switched over to CS from Civil-E at the start of my sophomore year and I was also a part-time student during that fall. So technically, I'm quite behind in terms of my CS classes and expect to graduate a semester or two late. I've only taken an OOP/Intro to Data Structures course so I'm still quite new to the curriculum, and the following CS classes are only going to get harder/more time consuming (I don't think its too smart to take 18 credits of all hard CS/ECE/Math classes just to graduate in time).

In order to prevent this, I plan to take 3 summer classes to lighten up my course load next Fall. The courses are Differential Equations, Statistics, and Digital Electronics. I'll be taking DiffEQ and Digital Electronics together in the 1st session and then Stat in the 2nd. I'd also like to mention the professors for these 3 summer courses are good teachers and many of my friends in CS/Eng. have gotten seemingly easy A's in their classes. However the professors in the Fall for these same courses all seem to suck. 

The downside is the first session courses will end in late June, and the second will end July 22 (it overlaps ~3 weeks with the first session). Stat will be in the 2nd session during the evening hours twice a week. So technically after late June, I am free to work full time while taking the Stat class. Alternatively, I could take only 1 class (Stat, because it's in the evening) and work the rest of the time, but this would further delay my graduation.

The internship I would continue is in RD at a big defense contractor, and comprises of mostly System Admin duties Sometimes I will be assigned a project to work on that relates to some coding/development but usually has to do with menial documentation, most of the time I will be testing capabilities of various software/services on cloud platforms (so scripts, Sys. Admin stuff, etc.). There's not much pressure in the job, most the people I work with are nice, and it pays $20 an hr. 

My main concern is, after taking the summer classes, I will be drained. The past two semesters have been probably the most stressful times of my life; my father had a heart attack and went through a triple by-pass, I was VP of my fraternity while taking rigorous courses, basically never slept, cut down time going to the gym and loss about ~20 lbs, broke up with my girlfriend and my uncle passed away.

I feel like I should just take a break relax for the rest of the summer instead of working, spend more time with my dad, go fishing with him, focus on my own physical health, hit the beach with friends and maybe do a trip to California a visit some more friends/family. Yet at the same time I feel obligated to work in order to pay for school (especially with graduating a bit later), and don't want to lose out on future career opportunities. 

I already have 4 months interning at this company last summer and 5 months working as a Sys. Admin for a small server company my junior/senior year in high school under my belt. Will it hurt my resume and/or post-grad career prospects if I don't work/intern this summer? In all honesty, even if I worked/interned again, I feel I would still learn way more if I were to dedicate the same amount of working time to taking a few CS/developer MOOC's and working on side-projects on my own or with friends. Is it worth continuing a mostly IT, sometimes software engineer/development internship as a CS major? Am I naive to pass on this opportunity?

TLDR;
Will employers look suspiciously at a gap in interning? Is one internship sufficient to be competitive as a candidate post-grad? If not, How many internships should an ideal graduating student have (and for how long)?

25a5bb,2596,2014-05-11,TIFU by using the Pornhub app too much,mas0518,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/25a5bb/tifu_by_using_the_pornhub_app_too_much/,"This actually happened a couple of days ago.

I am an engineering intern and was invited to go to a seminar with a bunch of other engineers from my company.  This required about a 4 hour road trip.  My smartphone was on the verge of going over my allotted 2 GB of data per month, with a few days to go until a new cycle, so I knew this was going to be a long boring trip with nothing to do.

About an hour into the trip, feeling bored, I jokingly announced, ""can someone set up a wifi hotspot with their phone, I've reached my data limit"".  The engineer sitting to the left of me said that he had problems with going over his data limit as well until last month when he changed some settings on his phone.  He asked me to open up my app settings to determine which applications were using the most data this past cycle.  This is where I fucked up.

I had forgotten that I had gone without wifi at home for a couple of weeks because fuck paying bills.  After a few days in without internet, I had not had any happy time, so I decided to look some stuff up on my phone.  However, my phone for some reason will not stream videos from porn sites.  I can stream youtube, liveleak and many others, but any porn site that I try to watch a video on, my phone tells me I can only download it.  Well, I did not want to download porn onto my phone, so I decided to find a pornviewing app and stumbled upon Pornhub.  I had heard a few days before on Reddit that Pornhub would plant a tree for every hundred videos watched, so I felt like I was doing some good in the world everytime I used this app.  Which was multiple times before I got my internet turned back on.  

So back to the van on our road trip, I bring up the list of apps that had used the most data the past cycle.  I should point out that I have a Galaxy Note 2, which has a very large screen.  To my surprise, because I had forgotten, right at the top of the list was a big Pornhub emblem and a green bar that said it had used about 1.2 GB of data.  Unfortunately for me, the engineer on my left, and the engineer on my right, and the chief engineer sitting behind me were all watching me while I did this.  To make matters worse, as soon as I realized what was at the top of the list, I tried to slide it off the screen to make it disappear, but in my nervousness, I ended up tapping on it which opened up a screen to give more details about the app, as well as enlarging the icon for all to see.  The engineer to my right started laughing, and wouldn't stop for about 10 minutes, the engineer to my left stated ""well this is awkward"".  And the chief engineer behind me would not make eye contact with me at all for the rest of the day.  I overheard the story being told multiple times during breaks in the seminar with the other 6 engineers on the trip, so now everyone in my office probably thinks I'm some sort of perv.  I am not looking forward to work tomorrow morning.


Edit:  Wow, this kind of exploded today.  Thanks for all the great responses.  I'm sure that Everyone will have a few good laughs at my expense tomorrow which I think I can handle.  I imagine all of the engineers in the office will be jealous as shit though when I tell them that [u/Katie_Pornhub](http://www.reddit.com/user/Katie_Pornhub)  responded to the thread.  That's almost like real life contact with a female.  We all know who I will be thinking about tonight when I arm wrestle with my one eyed vessel  (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞


tl;dr:  Showed a few engineers that I am interning for that the number 1 data using app on my phone is Pornhub :("

I see a lot of posts about math in CS, I know there is a lot of math involved but my question is, to you computer scientists, how does math apply to your job or whatever it is you do?

I ask because in my previous jobs, the people with a bachelors in computer science were always ""Project managers"" or even just help desk... I never seen how they would use even algebra in their daily tasks.

This may sound overzealous, but I want to do more than help desk and simple IT stuff, I want to be proud of the work I do and see results or some kind of completion. Luckily the school I'm going to has internships with JPL and other companies, but I am mostly interested in working with JPL. I hope this could be a good starting point.

I used to be really bad at math in high school but recently found out I am actually pretty good, I just needed to apply myself. (Thanks to my GF who is a math tutor) So I feel my chances of success have gotten better. BUT, I want nothing to do with help desk.

25b6ma,0,2014-05-11,taking class during summer internship?,lostgirl14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25b6ma/taking_class_during_summer_internship/,"So I will be interning at a company this summer which is about 15/20 minutes away from my school, and thus will be living close to campus. My school is offering a summer course which lasts about a month and a half--a month of which would coincide with the first month of my internship. The class is a Computation Theory class, and is a requirement for my major. If I don't take it now I'd have to take it senior year. This class is normally a very hard class, but its supposedly easier in the summer. And its not exactly a subject I'm looking forward to, so it'd be nice to get it out of the way. I checked with my internship and they said that they'd be able to get me out of work in time to make it to the class--which meets at 6PM twice a week. The class lasts for 3.5 hours. I'm a bit concerned because I've just come off the most intense, draining semester of my college career, and am not looking for more burnout this summer. It's hard to tell how much work internships are. Is it normal to take work home from or stay late at an internship? I'd like to take the class if I can handle it without sacrificing sanity, but it's hard for me to tell how difficult/draining the internship itself will be. Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?"

I am desperately looking for advice as of now

I am a transfer student from community college, this is my senior year, I got into UCLA as a chem major, however after a semester I realize chemistry isn't what I want to do, but I can't change major as a transfer, so I started taking CS classes and found that CS is indeed what I want to do for the rest of my career

I finish all the CS lower division classes and took advance algorithm, machine learning, networking and security class with overall CS GPA of 3.48.

I have 2 personal projects one in search optimization/recommendation and another one in android, in addition I have two research experience with one web development and another one doing NLP. 

I am also doing a summer intern this upcoming June, but the thing is there is an absolute chance I am going to fail 3 chemistry classes this quarter as I am taking 5 classes this quarter, so dismissal from UCLA is a high possibility. 

Taking chemistry classes is absolutely a nightmare for me as I don't understand it but I love CS to the point I self learn and did little projects in Haskell, Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, did some code in R, matlab and is proficient in python java and C. So my question is, is it possible to get a CS job without getting a degree at all?

Any advice if any will be much appreciated "

Here's a little bit of background on me. I am currently a senior in college I will be graduating in May 2015. I have a job on campus working tech support for half of the campus. I will be working at Quicken Loans this summer for an internship doing tech support for them as well. Also I just received my first certification, the EMC 100-002 Information Systems Management. What I would like to know is what should I do this summer during my downtime this summer? Should I start working on another certification or should I start some side projects? Any relative advice would be greatly appreciated!"

The thing that worries me is if I'm actually learning the right stuff, I have a really good GPA (I made B's in two classes, the rest were A's) but I don't feel like I can truly say I am anywhere near ready for the job market. I know that I'm a couple years away from it mattering, but it worries me a lot.

I can get the assignments done, but I haven't done much programming outside of school. Whenever I look at sites like StackOverflow I get cold sweats because I feel like I don't understand even half of what the discussion is about. When it comes to the more theoretical side of Computer Science I'm at about the same spot, I know some of the basics but I don't know much more than that.

I'm afraid that I'm only good at being a college student (doing assignments, taking tests) and that once I get out of here I'll be totally unprepared or that I won't get a job.

I'm starting an internship this week, but it is only barely CS related and is with the school.

Am I worried over nothing and what can I start doing so that I can be sure to have a place to go after college?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I watch your channel alot and your videos have helped me understand engine concepts and alot of other car related engineering substantially better than textbooks and other written sources have! For that, I am grateful.  My question is, since you call your channel ""engineering explained"" do you ever plan to do videos on non car-related engineering subjects? Hydraulic systems for example...water-pumps...etc etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf92f3?context=5)|The original goal of the channel was to be fairly vague, just covering anything engineering related (Here's a strange example: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5D4EQaJkE)) My passion kind of took over, and I started getting pretty in-depth solely on automotive topics.
[Also just a minor sub-question:  Are you employed as an engineer? If so, what is your job title and what day to day activities do you undertake? I am a design engineer at a heavy plant manufacturer for the quarry industry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf92f3?context=5)|I work as a test engineer for a forklift company. Day to day is a bit of research, hands-on testing, and some data crunching/documentation. Sometimes a quick test can provide engineers with a great amount of useful info, so that's where I come in. 
[Thanks for replying, i looks forward to many more videos. Have you done a video on power steering ? (either you have and i've missed it, or you havent but im just too lazy to look...it is Sunday after all\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9dze?context=5)|Sundays are meant for relaxing, I'd recommend watching it tomorrow. :)
[Hi, thanks for doing this, will definitely be looking at some of your videos later. What is your experience of making money from youtube?. Ideally how much you make and on what payment structure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf905a?context=5)|Making money via YouTube is definitely not easy. I've had my channel for nearly 3 years now, and only recently has it consistently paid for rent (and a little extra). It's against YouTube's terms and conditions to say how much you make, but with a little Google dive (or YouTube ranking websites) you can get estimates, which throw out a very general number of about $2 per 1,000 views. It's a rough estimate, and depends completely on the topic you post about, as well as the time of year (There are more advertisers in December than January, for holidays). 
[Something I've always wondered... if, after 5 seconds, I ""skip"" the pre-roll ad...do you still get paid for an ad impression, or do you get nothing and the advertiser pays nothing? I'll stop skipping ads on my favorite channels if they don't get paid for me skipping it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa5cr?context=5)|If you skip, no $$ for the channel. I'm not sure if the advertiser still pays, but I don't believe they do. I always have the option of skipping ads, because frankly ads are annoying. Of course, there are other solutions to not having ads, but I still feel like the option to skip should be there for those who don't use these solutions. 
[The 5 second ""skip"" countdown can be disabled by the channel? Also, good to know, thanks. There are some youtubers out there that I really like and from now on I won't skip their prerolls! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfacpi?context=5)|Yes, you can force the ad to play in its entirety. Probably would make more money doing so, but at the risk of losing viewers. I typically don't watch videos that force me to watch the whole ad. 30 seconds is a long time if you're only somewhat interested in the video. 
[But if you get no money from people skipping, and assuming just about everyone skips the video (since they're often 30+ seconds long, while skipping can be done after 7 or so\), that means you're showing people ads without getting money for it? Wouldn't it be better to have the ads be on (and non-skippable\) every once in a while?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfi0on?context=5)|I suppose, though the only option YouTube shows is to allow skipping or to not allow skipping. 
[I can see that, considering the theme of your channel its harder to find a good network, its way easyer to find a good network in gaming market etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfk0pk?context=5)|Well, there are dozens of networks out there, and plenty that are automotive based. But honestly they just want a 80/20 split and none can prove that they'll provide any real benefit. ""Higher CPM"" but none will guarantee it. ""More views"" but none guarantee it. You'll notice a lot of bigger channels move away from Networks, if they ever joined them in the first place.
[Thank you for the great channel and tutorials, it's awesome to see some fairly complex concepts explained in a thorough yet concise manner.  You have mentioned being a test engineer; could you please describe your role and general day to day activities? Would you recommend the avenue to engineering students who are leaving university, or is it a path that requires more experience to get into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9i7z?context=5)|I think test engineering is probably one of the more exciting positions an engineer can have. I've only been in this position for 2 months, as I recently switched positions in my company. Day to day means applying various tests to the equipment I work with. Does it overheat under x conditions, can changing y variable improve efficiency, can said item handle z load, and what will the deflection be, etc. It's learning with physical objects, rather than purely simulation, which makes it interesting for me. I'd recommend it to any engineer.
 |Edit: word.
[That's really exciting to hear, I'm starting a 12 month internship as a design engineer this summer but my graduate paths are still very open to me and I'm not really sure what field to begin in.  Test engineering does look like good fun and very varied, thanks for the insight :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9v0j?context=5)|Awesome, best of luck with your internship!
[Does youtube ad split pay the most or corporate sponsorships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf97l0?context=5)|Solely YouTube ads, at least right now.
[Would you rather take up sponsorships to control the ads and ad experience, or are just happy to have youtube deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9iuj?context=5)|Well, one thing some people don't realize (though likely everyone here is better informed) is that ads are targeted to the viewer, not necessarily the channel itself (though this can happen to). Google will do a much better job of showing you things you want to see (and buy) then say an automotive sponsor. If I had my way, I'd live off of donations, and get rid of the ads, but I don't believe that would work.
[Have you considered giving Patreon a try for the donation thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfxif2?context=5)|I will have to check that out, I've never heard of it to be honest!
[ off, I love your videos! I've learned a ton from them...more then I ever imagined. I think most of my car knowledge comes from them. Oh, btw, I'm the guy who suggested the Aerodynamics videos-thanks so much for taking the time to make them!  Do you have any advice for me, academics-wise? (Like how much of my attention should be on school vs work/internships, and is Formula SAE worth my time? Like, a LOT of people do it...\)  I really want to get a job at a performance division (SRT, ///M, Nismo, etc.\) What types of jobs could lead to a career with them? Or is it not all that feasible/there are better alternatives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfah4k?context=5)|Very welcome for the Aero videos, thanks for the suggestion! On that topic, I'll have a video very soon on the Nismo GT3, explaining all of the aerodynamic bits on it. I think you'll really enjoy it, as it's probably more of what you were looking for (splitters, side skirts, dive planes, hood vents, naca ducts, etc..)  This is the best advice I can give regarding academics: [Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.htm) Also, you want a balance. Don't put all your focus on grades. Unfortunate as it may be, there are plenty of high GPA engineers out there looking for work. To set yourself apart, I think there are two critical things you have to portray to whoever is hiring: A. You can communicate well. Not just on engineering topics, basic conversation, be personable. B. Work on something related to your interests outside of work, and talk about it during interviews. Mine is YouTube, I bring it up in interviews every chance I get. People want to know you're passionate about what you study - having side projects shows this! FSAE is completely worth your time.   I don't have all the keys here unfortunately. It's challenging, which doesn't mean it's impossible. When I was in London with Nismo I met a 23 year old who had just joined their team as a race engineer. He had an internship with them, and went to school for motorsports engineering. Just don't stop trying is my best advice. People become complacent and this prevents them from moving forward. Maintain passion and you'll get there. My girlfriend and I are good examples. We work constantly towards our goals. I spent a recent three day weekend (which I get very few of in the professional world) completely working on YouTube videos.
[What would your dream job be if money wasn't a concern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9o0j?context=5)|I'd probably own a race track, and do tests and comparison with today's vehicles, and also test different items and show whether or not they do what the claim to do. Ex: tire testing - which tires stop the fastest, hold the most lateral g's, have the lowest rolling resistance, last the longest, etc.. But with everything, not just tires. If someone wants to donate a couple billion to make this a reality, I'm in. 
[This would be great for my Potty Racers technique.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfp1lf?context=5)|Always trying to improve my experience on the potty. I hate that word.
[How's the Youtube business working out for you? Some say it doesn't pay, some say they're gold.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9m0r?context=5)|It's not a simple get rich fast business, but it has steadily grown since I first created it. I do recommend making a channel to nearly everyone, as what's the worst that could happen? It's free! 
[*what's the worst that could happen?*  Ugh. So many bad ideas germinate with that phrase.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpzx1?context=5)|Haha, but seriously what is the worst that could happen when making a YouTube channel that goes unrecognized? Time wasted. But not really, you'll probably learn something from the experience. 
[So...who's the greatest engineer throughout all human history?  (no 'depends' allowed\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9loe?context=5)|Well, a couple obvious choices would be Newton or Tesla. But it's the 21st century, so what the hell. I'll say the greatest is Elon Musk, simply because of his ability to foreshadow a problem, think of an all encompassing solution, and actually follow through with the creation of his solutions. He's an incredibly inspiring man, and if you haven't yet watched the Bloomberg Risk Takers on him on Netflix, I highly recommend doing so. 
[Have you ever met any famous Youtuber, like in vidcon or any other places?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9ezz?context=5)|I have not attended VidCon, though I thought about it last year. I don't know how amped people would be at an event like this, for an educational channel. Never met any famous YouTubers, though I've messaged with EricTheCarGuy and Saabkyle04 a bit on their success and building their channels. 
[Just watched one of your vids, loved it! You won another subscriber! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa51i?context=5)|Thanks for subscribing! It's looking like collaborations may start becoming more common. Here's a video I just did last month with Nismo's channel: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz4eDaC5vCc)
[My question is the following - have you ever thought of doing a mashup with other popular channels, like /Drive or Motor Trend (I haven't watched all your vids, excuse me if you already have!\), something like EpicMealTime did with Jay Leno? I think it'd be awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa51i?context=5)|Collaborations can be challenging though. It's difficult to get someone's attention, and your channel has to be fairly successful for people to be willing to try it out. 
[Loved that video! Looks like binge-watching is in order :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfapr2?context=5)|Thanks! Don't watch too much, some of them contain math and are absurdly boring. :)
[I love your videos! any plans for videos of yo working on your new car ? i love the theory videos but would love to see that too ! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf8zwg?context=5)|Thanks! Glad you like the videos - I do have big plans for videos on my cars. I'll be starting with the Integra, as I feel it's a good place to start learning - don't want to break my new Subaru! My Integra is going to be the project car of my channel, with anything being a possibility - this video hasn't been uploaded yet, but will in the next few months. That's where I'll be taking suggestions for what to do to it. 
[Hey man, really enjoy the videos. Do you have any engineering qualifications or just a keen interest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf90fn?context=5)|I have a bachelors of science in mechanical engineering, from NC State University. I currently work as a test engineer. 
[Did you ever think the channel would get as big as it has, when you first started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfagz4?context=5)|Absolutely not. I just wanted something that I could put on a resume that shows I invest some of my free time in educating people. I think when I first started applying to jobs I had somewhere around 2,000 subscribers. It's awesome how well received its been, and so long as people continue to enjoy the videos, I'll continue to make them! 
[What are your plans for the sti? In your review video you make it kind of seem like no mods are in it's future...is this the truth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfbxor?context=5)|Though eventually I will modify it, it probably won't be soon unless a third party gets involved and wants to collaborate. I'm going to enjoy the warranty on the STI for now, and start messing around with the Integra (as a learning tool). I'm sure one day I'll get the itch, and have some fun with upgrading the STI. :)
[Hi, I'm currently studying mechanical engineering (study break for finals right now\) and I was wondering what sort of advise you have upcoming engineers, what helped you the most in order to get where you are now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfh3j6?context=5)|If you haven't yet read this, I'd recommend it.

 |If you're about to hit the interview process, here's my advice (quoted from above) -

What inspired you to start making youtube videos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf95jh?context=5)|I wanted something other than a GPA to put on my resume, in hopes of one day getting a job. I can't say job searching is easy, but YouTube definitely helped me get a job! 
[Do you need a special account on youtube to get paided? Lets say i made a page today and uploaded 3 videos and got a million hits on each and a million followers. What would be the next step to start getting paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa3mh?context=5)|Not anymore. You used to have to be accepted into the partner program, ""back in my day."" Now anyone can monetize their videos I believe. So if your hypothetical situation worked out, you'd probably pocket a few thousand dollas. 
[If you could have gotten the EVO X instead of the STI, would you have taken it? You really seem to love the STI, so I'm guessing not.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfcqk9?context=5)|Considering they're both in the same price range, it was definitely an available option. I went with the STI for a few reasons.
 |Hatchback.
 |Six speed manual.
 |Subaru is doing well in the US. They have a solid reputation for reliability, and aren't going anywhere. Mitsubishi's not doing well in the US at all. (But mostly the first two reasons). 
[Im thinking (seriously\) about engineering studies. I do not know what to choose mechanical engineering or transport engineering. Do you know what is the difference between these two? (I LOVE cars and everything, that has an engine\). I would be thankful for your answer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfed9m?context=5)|Here's some advice I have to give: [Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.html)
 |Regarding mechanical vs transport - mechanical would be studying the engineering of any moving machines. Transport would be more similar to civil engineering - city planning for efficient routing, etc. 
[Do you watch car reviews channels on Youtube?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf90fs?context=5)|Such as? I enjoy Motortrend, Nismo actually has a really cool channel (regardless of the fact that we've collaborated) - gets an in depth look at their racing programs, Red Bull, Go Pro, and... well... I watch my fair share of kitten vines. 
[Hey EE no question here just wanted to say you're awesome keep up the great work also can you squeeze in a video on how emergency brakes work?

Loving my UEL headers!
[I appreciate if you cannot answer this, but how much money do you make? Every YouTube AMA this either never gets asked, or never gets answered. I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfq2j1?context=5)|The reason it never gets answered (I do believe it always gets asked haha) is because it's against YouTube's terms and conditions to disclose how much you make. It pays my rent is about as detailed as I'll get, and the very basic $2/thousand views. It certainly depends for every viewer, but if you go to socialblade.com it will provide estimates, and generally you'll be somewhere within the estimate (I'm closer to the lower side, than the higher side).
[Hmm interesting. Link to www.youtube.com was auto captioned ? AFAIK, auto captions don't show up when a video is loaded at the start unless someone hits on the Captions button. Hence was curious!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfkwk7?context=5)|Ahh, I think you've found the only one that is not auto captioned. I didn't make them though, a subscriber did and simply sent me the file (very kind). There are a few others with captions in different languages, but the vast majority are just auto. 
[How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf916d?context=5)|See response to ""Donotscratchyoureyes""
[Hi Jason, can you do more diesel/truck videos? Perhaps you can talk about emissions control equipment, fuel systems, air brakes, suspension.

[So you make enough to pay your rent which is $00.00 per month.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chg61c8?context=5)|There may have been a small amount of sarcasm in my comment to which you replied.
[I have tried to help my friends at ""Donnie Does"" become big.  The response has been mixed but enough people have been asking for more videos that it has been growing.  My question is how do you manage your social and do you find that it makes a large difference to update social repeatedly to keep people engaged?  Also, Have you done any collaborations to help channel growth? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpto5?context=5)|Minimal collaborations, but hoping that this changes as my channel grows. My first collaboration with another channel (aside from displaying featured channels, I'm talking videos) was with Nismo, and these videos have just come out.
 |Regarding managing social media, I'm probably not the greatest. I just post things that interest me, as well as my videos on Facebook. It's more of a ""Oh I saw this thing on cars and thought it was cool, others might as well"" rather than ""I should update my social media page today.""
 |That said, I think there are much more effective and engaging methods, I just really can't find the time to manage it all.

I know people always say put up qualitiy work and people will come.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chg9vh8?context=5)|Post consistent material, with consistent timing. Have a theme, and try not to vary much from it. If you want people to follow you, your channel has to have it's niche. Quality work is good, yes, but it's important to be consistent. I post a video every week on how cars work. It's one sentence that very predictably tells my audience what they're going to get, so if they like the topic, they may end up following.

[Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.htm) If you're about to hit the interview process, here's my advice (quoted from above) - You want a balance. Don't put all your focus on grades. Unfortunate as it may be, there are plenty of high GPA engineers out there looking for work. To set yourself apart, I think there are two critical things you have to portray to whoever is hiring: A. You can communicate well. Not just on engineering topics, basic conversation, be personable. B. Work on something related to your interests outside of work, and talk about it during interviews. Mine is YouTube, I bring it up in interviews every chance I get. People want to know you're passionate about what you study - having side projects shows this!

25ciy5,4,2014-05-12,How much of a headache is Android programming compared to iOS?,Chronoglide,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/25ciy5/how_much_of_a_headache_is_android_programming/,"My university requires its students to complete a final year project in order to graduate. Even though I haven't graduated yet, the company that I did my internship with has gladly decided to hire me full time (I'm only left with that project anyway). The company itself is involved with mobile applications on both iOS and Android. 

My internship was very iOS intensive and I learnt a lot from it. I can now confidently say that I would not have a problem building simple to medium level applications in Objective C. 

When I told my team leader about my project idea and what platform I was building it on, he made his concerns about Android heard. He says that he strongly advises I stick to iOS because:

1. The framework itself is much more robust and developer friendly

2. Developers should spend more time fixing business problems rather then technical issues. According to him, going down the Android path means dealing with problems such as why X and Y can work on Device A and B, but it's broken on Device C while only works partially on Device D

3. I've already learnt quite a bit of Objective C, so doing the project on iOS would be a shortcut. (of course the team leader wants me to be the least distracted as possible) 

How valid are these points? I've always wanted to learn to code on Android, but these points are making me think twice. Am I setting myself up for a big headache? "
25d01l,11,2014-05-12,Should I return to University?,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/25d01l/should_i_return_to_university/,"I'm a 21-year-old  3rd year student at University of Glasgow doing accounting and finance (Bachelors of Accountancy). I won't be progressing to honours and will be leaving with an ordinary degree. As far as I can tell, an ordinary degree will not be good enough for graduate-level schemes and jobs that require a degree usually ask for a minimum of 2.1 with honours. I was originally planning on graduating with a 2.1 and finding a training contract for professional accountancy exams to become a chartered accountant. I don't think my ordinary degree will count for much given that the large majority of students on my course graduate with honours. I don't want to continue with accountancy because if I can't achieve an honours degre in it, it's very unlikely I will enjoy/be able to get a professional accountancy qualification. I didn't really socialize with people at the university as my attendance was poor and my group of friends from school still live locally. I think I'm capable of getting a 2.1 with honours, I just failed in being motivated and taking it seriously.


I've enjoyed the finance courses and loved the financial analysis and statistical work. My original plan for university was to study maths or computer science but I changed this after I tried an accountancy course in high school which was new to me and I felt I was naturally good at it. In my free time I enjoy strategy/card games which require mathematics and logical reasoning. I find almost anything with probability or statistics interesting. I feel like I would be more suited doing a maths &amp; stats degree. Failing to graduate with an honours degree was a personal failure and I want to correct it. 


**TL;DR I'm leaving my accounting and finance course early with a poor degree and no longer want to be an accountant.**

**I want to work as a data analyst, preferably in the public sector**

I have a year before I can apply to university and so I will try to find a job or I will volunteer somewhere. My dilemma is whether or not to reapply to university.

Pros:

* Personal satisfaction of achieving a degree.
* Potential graduate-employment schemes.
* Would be able to make full use of internships, experience, extracurricular activities and other resources that I'm now aware of.
* Work during university and within university to build CV.
* Could enter a career that would take 4+ years to reach from entry level in another field.
* Opportunity to get more involved.
* Have a better understand of how the system works - what courses to take, what is required of students etc

Cons:

* Risk of failure, potentially wasting another 3 years.
* No guarantee I will be able to enter a career in analysis/statistics.
* I would be 22 (maybe 23) when I start the 4 year course. Don't like the idea of being in higher education until I'm 28.
* Not done maths in a long time, may not be cut out for the difficulty of the course.
* Very little programming experience.
* Lower income while at university.
* May not be closer to where I want to be compared to working 4 years.

Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the rambling."

My situation is aptly described by the title: I'm getting a late start into my cs education. This year(my junior year) I took a cs intro course and loved it, proceeded to take data-structures the following semester and loved it also. Next year, my current plan is to take as many cs courses as I can probably manage (Fall 2, Spring 3). I'll be coming out of this with a minor.

So here's my question: what can I do this summer to get me ahead? An internship isn't an option as I've already committed to a non-cs internship. My options appear to be either work on a project or take coursera courses. Would anyone know what sort of project would be managable for a summer or which online courses are worth taking or even have other ideas for how to sharpen my cs skills over the summer?

Appreciated."

This company is a local company with ~50 people in a city with a fairly low cost of living, and as of right now they seem at least satisfied, if not impressed, with my work (been working remotely from school).  For the summer, I'm willing to work the standard 40hr work week, but once graduation rolls around I really, *really* want to reduce my work week to 5 6hr days, maybe 5 7hr days.

How do I go about doing this?  Having a shorter work day is something that is very high on my priority list, since I like to have plenty of down time to exercise and relax, and do things other than work.  I'm familiar with the research on software developer productivity in relation to hours worked, but the manager who's likely to negotiate the terms of my employment is about 45-50 yrs old and I'm not sure he will be open-minded enough to accept such an offer...  I'm even willing to take a pay cut if that's what it takes.

Am I delusional for thinking about trying this?  Will this hurt my prospects for raises/promotions in the future?  I'd like to hear stories from anyone who's managed to do this, as well..."

Users have asked for details about my therapy sessions with my old clients from the internship. I was hesitant to release details of my patients and their treatments but the therapists I console have shown a great deal of interest in my treatment methods. They only asked that I use different names for clients and not to reveal anything that will make them easily identifiable to avoid lawsuits and maintain professionalism. Otherwise, these writings can be considered case studies. 


In the comment section of my first post, I described an experience with a veteran returning from an overseas conflict. If you have already read this comment, you know how the story ends but I have included more details in this entry and gotten some help from fellow therapist with information the case to shine a light on what really happened, if that still interests you. Otherwise, I shall begin with “Henry”, my first client. 


Henry phoned into Dr. J’s office where I interned doing administrative work and scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, Dr. J was booked for the next two weeks and Henry’s request was for an appointment as soon as possible. The closest appointment I had was in a month’s time after Dr. J returned from a conference in Arizona. There was something in his voice that told me that he wasn’t being impatient but desperately needed help. My instincts are rarely ever wrong when it comes to matters of psychology so I invited him to the office after hours so that we could have a session. 


After getting ourselves settled into Dr. J’s office, I asked Henry the purpose of his visit. As I reached for my pen, Henry jumped across the table and grabbed my arm. The look in his eyes told me that was in panic. It was a result of being afraid of something. I asked him to release me as I was only going to grab a pen. He held on for a few moments before releasing his hand from mine and sitting back on his side of the couch. 


He seemed embarrassed but asked that I not write anything down of our sessions. He didn’t want to leave a paper trail behind of his visit to the therapist. That’s when he revealed to me that he was in the armed forces.  He didn’t want to use his insurance plan because it would be reported and noted on his permanent record. He’d never be considered for advancement again. I respected his wishes and told him we would discuss payment later. Always remember rule number three: Always discuss your salary before starting a job.


I was feeling hesitant before about scheduling the appointment but all that disappeared the moment Henry told me he was in the armed forces. Deep in my heart, I knew that I was doing my duty as a citizen of these United States and a psychologist to assist this young man in his time of need. We must always support our troops! 


The session lasted three hours before we finished. Getting Henry to speak about his problems was as difficult as pulling teeth on a patient with no anesthetic. Henry was guarded to the idea of discussing his service time overseas in combat. Most veterans of war do not like to speak about their experiences. It is understandable so instead we talked about his symptoms. He had extreme difficulty sleeping as he experienced flashbacks of his time in war during the night. The anxiety of awaiting an attack did not allow his mind to rest. Along with lack of sleep, this was causing a hypersensitivity disorder making him prone to emotional outbursts and bouts of rage. He was self-medicating with narcotics and alcohol to put himself to sleep.


As Henry spoke about his symptoms, I could see it in his face that he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Wartime calls for men and women to perform unspeakable acts of violence and horror to each other. It was a clear cut case of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and drug addiction. What worried me the most was Henry’s admission of contemplating suicide then lifting his shirt to show me that he was currently armed. He slept with the gun under his pillow and felt unsafe if he didn’t have a weapon in arms reach at all times. It was shocking but I am not there to judge the man. I didn’t feel threatened by him.  He wanted my assistance, unlike the others I tried to help before. 


As my treatment options were limited, I believed that the best option of treatment was exposure therapy. Henry was a young man haunted by the demons of the past and he needed to confront them without facing any real danger. How do you send a man to war without putting him into danger? In a flash of brilliance, I prescribed Henry a form of exposure therapy that would be exactly what he needed. The young man did everything as I prescribed him, except for only one part that he did not follow.


To confront his demons, I had him watch the opening scene of the Allies soldiers storming Omaha Beach in “Saving Private Ryan”. To stimulate the parts of his mind still hurting from combat, he would need to turn it up as loudly as possible. The simulation of actual combat would allow him to relive those moments of war so he can come to terms with his fear. He would realize that he was safe and that his time on the front lines was finished. Henry would also need to have his gun nearby as it would serve as an anchor of safety to reality. It would serve as the protection his mind needed against the demons of war. 


In my original comment, I guessed about what happened after the point of where Henry began to watch the film. With some corroboration from the therapists at my facility, they have informed me that my guess was almost correct.  Henry suffered a flashback or re-experience scenario where his reality became storming Omaha Beach in World War Two. I was wrong that he discharged his weapon at the television screen in his delusional state. Instead, the neighbors called the police about a noise complaint because Henry was using a surround sound system with the volume extremely high. 


In the middle of the movie, the police pounded on the door in an attempt to get Henry’s attention and unfortunately, they did. In his delusional state, Henry must have believed that German combatants were attempting to break down his door. He surprised them when he opened the door and fired his weapon into their heads at point blank range. The officers never had a chance to react. More police were called to the scene as a result of the gun fire and there was a stand-off between Henry and the police. Henry took cover inside of his home and began to fire out the window. With no other options, the police fired back at Henry and he was killed in action. 


Finding out that this was the reason Henry did not return for our next session was heart-breaking but getting back to lesson number two that I’ve learned: You cannot blame yourself for client failures. And as to the one thing Henry did wrong, I don’t remember if I exactly mentioned it to him but I’m pretty sure that I told him to unload the bullets from his gun before he started the movie.

25e0tb,2,2014-05-12,Have it made. Want to die due to my shy personality.,throwaway198420__,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25e0tb/have_it_made_want_to_die_due_to_my_shy_personality/,"Seriously, some people would probably wonder why I would ever want to kill myself. I found the perfect girl, we're getting married this year. I just graduated from college with a 4-year degree. I have a family that loves me, friends, people say I'm ""attractive"", but I want to die. I've wanted to kill myself for a very long time now.  
 
I'm 29, just graduated with an IT-related degree after going back to college. I've always been extremely shy. Had friends throughout middle and high school, but I didn't talk much. I was picked on by the ""jocks""/older kids for being awkwardly shy. Most people just assumed I was gay. Even my friends and family did, whatever.  

Went to college, smoked a lot of pot with some new friends, eventually was just made fun of by them for being shy. 2nd year of college I moved in with a few friends from highschool. They would frequently throw house parties and I was so asocial I would stay in my room the entire night. Even pissing in bottles I would later throw away just so I wouldn't have to show my face if I had to use the bathroom or something. If I got hungry I would just starve until the party subsided. Basically I locked myself in my room for a year and played video games and smoked weed. I stopped going to class and eventually just failed out and moved back home with my parents for 4 years. I started thinking maybe I was schizophrenic.  

For the next four years I worked a full-time job while living at home. This is probably my loneliest point of my life as all of my friends had moved on. I would work, come home, smoke weed and play video games. I would occasionally go visit some of my old high school friends down in ""college town"" and during one party decided maybe it would be best if I tried moving back there out of my parent's house. I sure as hell wasn't accomplishing anything by living at home. 
So I started a new job, moved in with a friend (even though he and most others were now graduating soon). Really, I had just gotten sick of living with my parents and was embarrassed with myself for being such a loser. A year later, at 25, I met a girl and we really hit it off. I also finally lost my virginity at this time. We have so much in common so things are great there. I decided I didn't want to be a ""bum"" working minimum wage if I actually met an awesome girl to spend my life with so I decided to go back to college.  

The next four years are pretty good. We eventually moved in together, I proposed last year, I opened up a bit, but I'm still socially retarded. It's so hard for me to speak to people. This is really where all of my depression is coming from nowadays. I mean I hardly speak a word when I go to family functions. I sometimes, but rarely will get a wind where I actually am able to speak to people, but most of the time if I speak I fuck up sentences or questions when I go to ask them. It's hard for me to pay attention to people. You can speak directly to me and a lot of times I won't have a single clue what you just said. I have had an internship for the past year that I basically blew off. I was always too afraid to speak up and ask questions if I had them. I would sit at my desk for days/weeks before my boss would finally ask if I was alright with my current task and would eventually have to help me along. I could have been answering the help-desk line but was afraid to because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to answer the question/help the other person. It really showed too when I went to an interview for an IT related position the other week and couldn't answer a single help-desk related question because I basically had zero practice due to my shyness.   

I've seen a psychiatrist, I've tried probably 5 different anti-depressant/anti-anxienty drugs, but nothing really helps at all. I was diagnosed as having ADD/anxiety/depression, but my fiance seems to think I have aspergers as well, and I have to admit I do have just about every symptom. I really feel like I wasted my time getting a degree. I know that any big-person job I get I am just going to completely fail due to my inept ability to work with other people. I can't even see a Dr. right now cause I have no insurance. I was fired from my job 2 months ago after working there for 6 years. Basically got fed up with my boss and didn't do something he asked me to. My boss at my paid internship has graciously allowed me to continue working there for the next month since I don't have another job started yet. I think he just feels bad for me. I mean it's no secret I have been a horrible intern, but people always say I'm a ""nice young man"".. Okay maybe it's the old ladies that speak that line specifically.  

I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. All I know is I do not want to work weekends/evenings/holidays anymore. I've been doing that the last 10 years and I hate it. My fiance and I like to keep our weekends free to go do things (it's really the only time I'm happy), even though we're broke right now from the upcoming wedding and honeymoon. I don't even care if my job is computer related. I do know I only look forward to coming home after work so I don't have to be near anyone anymore. When I am home I'm bored out of my mind thoughs and don't really enjoy doing much anymore. I really just feel like an empty shell. So much so that I don't care about the good things in my life anymore. I really am just a shell. I've never had much of a personality. I'm 29 now. I've had pleeeeennnty of time to try and fix my life, be more social, enjoy shit more, I don't see it getting much better in another 10 years. It's gotten to the point where I'm once again searching for suicide methods and have one picked out. My fiance knows I'm suicidal and now I'm thinking about calling off the wedding because I don't see the point anymore. No point in her trying to make a life with me if I'm eventually just going to kill myself anyways. Might as well start closing things up so I can get this shit done with for once.  

Sorry that this is so long... I know many people won't want to take the time to read something this long, but I really could go on and on. I'm just trying to get others to understand my situation and how asocial I truly am despite having several good things going for me.

I graduated from a top 3 undergraduate university with a 3.65 GPA (magna cum laude) with a B.S.E. in Computer Science.    I'm currently a second-year student at a top 20 medical school (pass-fail, like most medical schools).  I didn't take any time off in between.


During undergrad, I spent a summer working for Google and another summer researching medical imaging techniques.


Presently, along with medical school, I intern part-time at a tech startup involved in community healthcare (currently unpaid), where I do a bit of everything, from organizing testing, to supervising data science projects, to heading up our push to get into international markets.  I also am involved in hospital operations research.  This summer I will be doing both (and will be paid for my startup internship as well as research).


I have not taken the GMAT yet (I will this summer), but I got a 36 (97th percentile) on my MCATs.  I usually test pretty well.


I plan to apply for the next round, and so, by the time I apply, I'll have spent 2 years (post-undergrad) in classes and 1 year interning in the hospital full time.  This is right after my third year of medical school (I am currently 24).  I plan to do my two years in B-school and then come back to medical school and finish that + residency.  Long term, I want to be involved with healthcare technology and/or startups.


My questions are as follows:


-- I'm worried about my lack of work experience - although I have had summer jobs and work part-time right now, by the time I apply I'll only have a year of ""work"", which is really me rotating through the hospital on various medical teams.  Is this something I should be concerned about?


-- Since I have a year to round out any corners in my application, do you have any suggestions?


--  Thoughts on applying now vs. after I have my MD/have finished residency?  I only want to apply now because I am more diverse (I'll have a lot less time for extracurriculars next year/during residency).  


--What are my chances of getting into a top 5 MBA?  I particularly want to go to Stanford (because of the proximity to Silicon Valley/focus on startup technology).  


Thanks for the help!"

25eekg,3,2014-05-12,I am a community college student who is about to transfer after 3 years to ucsd or uci for Computer Science.,evilraider13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25eekg/i_am_a_community_college_student_who_is_about_to/,"Hello everybody, Like the title says, I got into UCSD and UCI for computer science. I am deciding between the two. SO far I have interned for my mother's company for two years. She specializes in web development, mainly CMS (content management systems). 

At Sd, I would need three more years to graduate which would make it a total of 6 years for cs degree.
At UCI, i would need 2 more years to graduate which would make it a total of 5 years for cs degree 

Do companies care if i spent 6 years to attain a degree if i had internships and the college is ranked pretty high for computer science?

I also want to go to UCSD because i would get to move out and intern at other places and gain different experiences. If i went to UCI, then i would continue interning at my moms.

Thanks a lot for reading and for any inputs."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[It always strikes me how similar big cats are to domesticated ones. How do big cats truly differ from our pets, besides size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0uyr?context=5)|This is a great question.  In truth, small cats are just like the big cats.  They show the same behaviors, the same emotions, and often the same kinds of vocalizations.  Anyone who has watched their pet cat cough up a hair ball, hide itself in some dark corner, or rub its body against a person's leg has, in fact, watched the same behaviors as those of a big cat in the wild.  I have seen tigers and jaguars do the same things.
[How do you feel about Savannah cats? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ls6?context=5)|What savannah cat species did you have in mind?
[I guess just the whole crossbreeding a wild cat with a domestic one. I have read that some people don't think it's a good thing. I personally think they are beautiful. Especially the bigger cats (F1.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1t0p?context=5)|Okay, I didn't understand your question.  I have no strong opinion about crossbreeding cats for pets except that people must understand that these animals have more wild instincts than just pure domestic animals and can be vicious, even dangerous at times.  It is not their fault.  Also, such cats do nothing to help the situation for wild cats.  If we are crossbreeding species that don't naturally crossbreed in the wild than we simply playing games with animal's lives for human pleasure.
[Have you ever chilled with a liger? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0vt4?context=5)|I have seen one liger in captivity in my life.  Quite an impressive animal.  I can't say that I felt too ""chilled"" in its presence.  I have, however, chilled with tigers and jaguars, sitting very close to them and feeling their intense energy.
[What kinda big cat expert has only seen one liger? Use that status, bro!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ydn?context=5)|The kind that deals in the real world, bro.
[Yikes. I'm just saying the world is what you make it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg216d?context=5)|You are right and perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying.  The world is indeed what we make it.  But if we put money and efforts into creating fantasy animals like the liger, we have that much less to save the few real tigers and lions that are still out there.  People who care like yourself could really be a strong force in helping change things.
[Of course, I can see that. It's important to make sure all big cats (and all endangered species\) have efforts being made to preserve their growth.  What are your thoughts on ligers, though? I know the likelihood of them existing at all is extremely small without human intervention and they can't reproduce on their own. Would you discourage lions and tigers being kept together in captivity to prevent their creation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2hn1?context=5)|Good question.  No I wouldn't, no more than I would discourage humans who perhaps shouldn't breed with one another, from breeding and trying to have a good life.
[So I guess since tigers and lions exist naturally and can continue their own species in ideal environmental conditions and without human encroachment, they're slightly more important to protect than ligers, yes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg32xf?context=5)|That would be my take on it, yes.  You seem to love big cats.  
[I often hear zoos described as ""genetic arks"" for big cats and other charismatic species. Are zoos an important part of the strategy for protecting big cats? Is it at all possible to give a zoo lion or zoo leopard a fulfilling life? How hard is it for zoo cats to adapt if released from captivity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1168?context=5)|Most zoos are not good genetic arks.  The best genetic arks are those few facilities that are actually trying to harvest genetic material from large numbers of individuals of large numbers of species.  Zoos do little to protect big cats in the wild.  The animals in zoos cannot usually be reintroduced.  They are genetic dead ends.  Animals, like people, need to be taught how to hunt and take care of themselves.  It is not instinctive.  As to the question of whether or not a captive lion or leopard could live a fulfilling life, I am afraid I don't have a good answer for that.  I would ask a person whether they could lead a fulfilling life if they were under house arrest for their entire lives.  Perhaps some people could, while others, including myself could not.
[I have your National Geographic documentary on DVD. You talk about a bad cancer scare. How did experiencing what you figured was an expiration date at the time affect your work? Did you find yourself cramming as much in as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3sl0?context=5)|Yes.  I still have the cancer but it is slow and chronic.  What that means is that I just have to work faster and harder before my time is up.  If the cats can fight, so can I.
[At what weight can a really really fat house cat be considered a ""big cat""? Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ros?context=5)|A ""big cat"" is very broadly defined as a species averaging more than about 45 kg or almost 100 pounds.  I have never seen a house cat reach that size.
[You doing really great work.You have mentioned that animals saved you. May I know how? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg103z?context=5)|I am a stutterer and it was debilitating to me as a child.  I closed off from the world of humans at a young age and my only sanctity were my little pets at home that I could talk to at night, in the darkness of my closet.  For my entire childhood I thought I was broken because adults thought I was broken, even putting me into special classes for disturbed children.  But animals let me be me, they gave me a normal world.  To this day I feel more comfortable in the world of animals than the world of people.
[Great answer. What is one thing about wild cats that impress you. Any secret that very few people know about them that you know as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2492?context=5)|They are incredible gentle and caring beasts with an indomitable spirit.
[Your description of the broad areas of importance sound not dissimilar from the type of work I can be involved in as a civil engineer.  What graduate programs can you speak on behalf of that would be highly recommended for continuing education, whether US or abroad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg22sj?context=5)|You are right.  Your job as a civil engineer could indeed play a big role in helping save wild cats and wild places, given the right focus.  I am sorry that I cannot recommend any particular programs because my work keeps me mostly in the field.  I am not up to date on what is happening in the academic world as much as I used to be.  But there are numerous good schools and good programs in the US.  What I have seen among the best people I have worked with is that it is not the school that matters as much as the passion of the individual.
[Thanks for your very informative reply! I've read about the work of Lion Guardians and the seemingly successful projects aimed at tiger conservation in Nepal. Inspiring local communities to help protect the big cats seems to be hugely important. It also seems that key community members are the ones that need most investment. What techniques have you found that worked best for engaging those key community leaders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg378e?context=5)|People asked to protect or live with wildlife, particularly potentially dangerous wildlife must see benefits to their own lives and that of their families if they are to be expected to do what is asked of them.  This is why people living with or protecting wildlife in key areas need to have special benefits such a better schools, scholarships for the kids, extra jobs as rangers or community patrol leaders, etc. - all of which are clearly linked to the continued survival of the animals.  
[What have been some of your favorite big cat stories? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0tux?context=5)|Some of my favorite stories have been about the man-eating tigers and leopards and lions of Africa and India.  I wanted to know why these cats killed people and what happened to finally stop them.
[Thank you for your response. I think you're right - education about conservation is the key to protecting what we have. I know you have worked a lot with the Snow Leopards - do you feel like we have done enough to save such a beautiful animal? Also, in species that are facing certain extinction, are we as a human race taking measures to preserve their DNA in the eventuality that cloning techniques become viable? Is this the right thing to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg31ex?context=5)|Panthera is launching a big snow leopard initiative.  The good news is that there are more than we thought because they occupy such vast remote areas where people don't live in large numbers.  Now that we are surveying more of these areas, we are finding more populations.  But the biggest range of habitat is in China which remains a challenge for conservation.  Regarding the DNA, you are right on target.  This is hugely valuable and there are a few projects and a few facilities trying to collect and store DNA of not only endangered species but all species.  I truly believe this is the right thing to do.  If humans cause the extinction of a species, why not try and bring the species back when we are able.
[Long time admirer of your work. I too was considered the dumb kid growing up and found solace in animals, and that appreciation has never left. I feel like I owe them something and I'd like to work in the field, be it conservation research or animal care.  I was an NIH-funded clinical research specialist w/ 13 yrs experience at UPenn and Pitt. The rug was pulled out from our industry when congress cut $2 billion in NIH research and I've had trouble finding regular work since, so now's as good a time as any to switch careers because I have literally nothing to lose in trying.  I'm a 36 yo fit and healthy Philadelphian, and will work for free since...well...I'm not making money consistently right now anyway. Any advice to get my foot in the door? Office work, field work, whatever... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg227i?context=5)|I admire your tenacity and I also think someone should move towards what they are most passionate in life.  This is a tough road but I never met anyone who didn't get what they were after in my field if they continued to persevere.  If you can afford to do so, start volunteering or taking internships for any zoo or wildlife organization in your area.  Get to know people and make contacts.  Someone else who recognizes your passion will find a way to help you.
[This may be outside of your area of expertise, but I am wondering if you have any knowledge about the possibility that the mountain lion (a.k.a. catamount\) is returning to northern New England.  Sightings have been reported, but the state's Fish and Wildlife people believe that these sightings are lynx or bobcat, not mountain lions.  Are they secretive enough to remain unseen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2yke?context=5)|Yes, I am absolutely convinced that there have been and probably still are some mountain lions in northern New England.  Where I live, 60 miles, north of New York City, I have been shown tracks of what can only be mountain lion.  I know bobcat well and I have them on my property.  There have been enough good mountain lion sightings in my area by reputable people to convince me that they are likely re-colonizing from the west and midwest.  People often say, why haven't I seen one if they are here?  I ask them how many bobcat they have seen, which are here in good numbers.  Usually the answer is none.  Cats are very secretive and very capable of stealth.  There is enough good forest in the NE for them to remain mostly unseen.
[I'm amazed that mountain lions would have a range only 60 miles from NYC.  The sightings here in Vermont have been sporadic and, AFAIK, all unconfirmed so far.  I *have* seen a bobcat.  Once.  It didn't see me.  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3m2h?context=5)|We have a lot of green in this area.  In fact coyotes have made their way into Central Park in New York.  Cats have shown themselves to be amazingly resilient.
[How often are you recognized on the street by the general public now? Any interesting fan stories? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2hxd?context=5)|I am only recognized by people who care about wildlife conservation and especially big cats.  Perhaps the most interesting fan story is that of a young woman musician who dedicated an album to me.
[Conservation obviously has many challenges, but what's something the average person (i.e. me\) can do to help out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1gpk?context=5)|There is no average person.  If people as a whole truly pushed for politicians and legislation that created protected areas and protected endangered species more, than my job and that of others would be so much easier.  It is up to the children now.  People must truly understand that a world without wild animals is not a healthy, stable place for us.  When politicians or others say that we can't afford to have a cleaner, better environment they are part of the problem not part of the solution.
[Your picture book is a great way to introduce your work to kids! What have you found most rewarding about the process of writing and publishing a book for children? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3nkr?context=5)|Writing for children has been the most difficult writing I have ever done because I had to go back to the sad, broken boy I once was.  However, it was also inspiring and rewarding because I could speak with complete openness and honesty - no masks, no barriers.  You speak with children the way we forget to speak as adults.
[How have your experiences working with big cats influenced your picture book, A Boy and a Jaguar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg25h2?context=5)|A Boy and A Jaguar is an autobiography.  So everything in that book, and much more actually, happened to me.  The stories I have about being with big cats are endless.  I find comfort in their world, and I find meaning in helping save them.
[I didn't get it when you said world won't be healthy if there are no wild animals. can you explain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2cbr?context=5)|The forest and the wildlife that inhabits it are the equivalent of computer firewalls for the human world.  Most of the emerging or re-emerging diseases that we are now dealing with (ebola, sars, west nile, lymes, etc.) are zooinotic, that means they have an animal host.  These are not new diseases, they have been around a very long time.  But what has kept them and other diseases from sweeping across the human landscape has been healthy forests and healthy wildlife populations.  If big predators like cats are wiped out, and smaller animals like deer, civet, rodents or others get out of control, that contributes to the spread of disease.
[Pantera rules!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg20q4?context=5)|I guess they do.  I hear their music is good.  But Panthera rules also.  I hope that is what you meant.

25f3g8,2,2014-05-12,Feeling so frustratingly stuck; the next forward step seems as close as rock bottom does. Please help.,serotinelle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/25f3g8/feeling_so_frustratingly_stuck_the_next_forward/,"(Hoping this is the best place for this, but please direct me elsewhere if you can think of something better.)

I am at a weird point in my life. I'm in my mid 20s, moved back home after attending school in another state for three years, have one more credit to go before completing my degree (which I was supposed to officially have done two years ago, oops). I was going to take a class online to finish that out, but that fall ended up being a dark place for me, and I ended up dropping the class the last day of class (after not completing enough work and wasting all of my money, of course). So, that college credit, and then obvious going to college at all means student loans, et cetera…all that stuff have been stressors, and straining my relationships with my parents on top of that.

(I had several health complications pop up while in college (seizures, after which came a diagnosis of and treatment for epilepsy [though I was un-diagnosed 3 years later; that still meant 3 years of unnecessarily being on a strong neuroleptic], and then narcolepsy my senior year) on top of the ebb-and-flow of dealing with depression/anxiety-related issues, as I have for the vast majority of my life. Had some other very serious personal issues pop up my senior year, and on top of me overworking myself {over the course of my 3 years, I completed 4 internships, held an on-campus job the whole time I was in school, and was president of my major's on-campus student chapter} and being burned out, all of these things culminated together to cause my grades to slowly plummet, which is why I was in that tenuous situation academically to begin with.) 

When I originally came back home a year and a half ago, I was applying to jobs with fervor, went on one interview, but the longer things kept not happening for me the deeper I sunk at that time. I started doing some minor housecleaning to bring in a little money, and I'd had the good sense to look into volunteer opportunities alongside the jobs I was applying for, so I was getting out of the house a lot and being able to look outside myself and my problems until I (hoped) things would blow over and look more in my favor.

That didn't happen, and I spent the next several months trying to get my health back on track. Meds, therapist, blah blah blah, and once I felt like I'd ""solved that problem"" (as if compartmentalization or a laser-like focus on your health ever really works out to begin with), and then it was six more months of me not employed and not a college graduate. I'd lost that (however naive) sense of confidence I had at the beginning of my job search, and even though I feel like I'm in a way-better place, it's basically been a year and a half since I've applied for any jobs relating to my career, I still cannot technically say I have a college degree since I'm one credit away, and working on other career-relevant items I need…they've all just gone by the wayside. All of these things, I haven't touched in so long, and another day just turns into another week and so on.

So, finically for a year and a half it's been getting money together piecemeal. One of the volunteer opportunities (with a young special needs child) ended up turning into a little bit of babysitting then something more with her family, and I'm providing care services for her for usually no more than 15 hours a week for the last several months. I'm feeling so burned out of the little amount I do work, because I'm at a point where it's hard to keep giving yourself to others when you feel like you've got so little left to give. This is not what I went to school for, and even though I love her and her family, I need to start my career and I need a real job. (So, there's some additional anxiety about that, too; this family, who have enough struggles of their own, see me as a ""godsend"" and often remind me how much I mean to them, so the more I think about how much I really need to stop doing that job the guiltier I feel. I don't know, aaa. Anyways.)

I know this is quite rambling and vent-y, but I just needed to start somewhere, and put it all down in one place. There are a lot of other little pieces that make up my puzzle, but I think I covered most of it. I just feel stuck. I feel like I'm at a crossroads, where a lot of things are moving in some direction that I'm unaware of, but moving nonetheless, but I want to move faster. I feel like a failure, but I still have bouts of hopefulness, and this itching restlessness is getting to a point where I have to do something about it. But, yes, stuck…that sums it up. I don't know how to un-muck myself; even if I see glimpses of it here and there, nothing seems to stick.

I'll finish there, but thank you for taking the time to read, and I appreciate in advance any advice or words of kindness you might have."

I have an internship in Atlanta this summer and I'm looking for a place to live from this Friday until mid August. I'm pretty flexible about the last part if you need your place back. I want to live somewhere near the campus of Georgia Tech which is why I'm posting here. 


I've had 2 different subleases fall through and I'm kind of at my wits end. I'll be at work 9-5 and probably out of town most weekends. I study electrical engineering at Florida State University so I can understand the importance of studying if you require peace and quiet. 

Let me know if you personally have a place you're looking sublease and hopefully we can work something out.

25f6th,11,2014-05-12,"I need to vent. I’m a frustrated IT security job seeker. Sorry, long post...",mnwild1985,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25f6th/i_need_to_vent_im_a_frustrated_it_security_job/,"I need to vent. To be frank, I have good job. It pays decently, has good benefits and I like the organization I work for. However, it's become a dead end job. My current job as well as my last serious job never got me completely into security where I want to go. I left my previous job to come to my current job where I was promised a role in the security team they were working on building. That team was awesome. When I was on that team I was happy and loving my job. 

Apparently, management’s spending priorities changed. Instead of a dedicated security team, we now have one dedicated security person, IT (but it’s not their priority) and a new director that doesn’t care about security because we aren’t “producing money”. Despite countless discussions on the values security provides, they don’t want to spend money to help mitigate dangerously sever risks posed to the organization. It’s their decision to make but they won’t be able to get by much longer without serious issues. 

The one security guy is awesome but he’s gone through the phases. Initially he was very excited to still be a part of security and wanted to make a difference. He quickly came to realize the work was really all on him so he became very stressed and regularly worked 60+ hour weeks trying to get everything done. That lasted about 2 months. He was desperately trying to get help but management wouldn’t approve bringing me or anyone else back. We both saw management not caring. They continually expected him to get more and more done than he ever could and kept adding to his workload. He worked a couple 80 hour weeks and then he was just done. He’s still great, and he works hard when he’s here but he stops working after 40 hours now and doesn’t check back in until next week. That’s been the case for about a year now. Every now and then he gets yelled at because he's not getting enough done but he doesn’t really care anymore. He’s looking for work as well. 

Several managers and other people that are at least somewhat aware that I’m looking for a new job keep telling me things are in the works. I pretend to be happy and excited that things will work out but after saying that for a year, I don’t expect that to pan out. I’ve been actively looking for new job for a couple months and passively asking around and networking for several months prior to that. 

I don’t have enough direct experience to get into the entry level security roles I can find but I’m over qualified for intern roles. I have a BA in Information Security, 5 certifications Security+, CHFI, CISSP, GSEC, OSCP and I’m studying for web app pentesting now because I don’t know what else to do and that’s what I enjoy most. 

My options seem to be to leave out huge portions of my qualifications to appear more “qualified” for intern roles. This is what I’m currently looking at. Or embellishing my qualifications and hoping that I can make up the difference in experience before I get fired/laid off. 

My last several interviews have boiled down to them wanting a super Linux security admin, firewall configuration expert, Incident Response, Pentester for either network or web and SIEM. I have some experience with all of that to the point that I’d almost be confident in picking up a couple of the roles and running with them. The people hiring disagreed. Plus they’re probably able to find someone that has more direct experience than me. So I was disappointed but I understood.  The most recent was a security internship that generally gears candidates for web pentesting. I was practically drooling when I found this role. I thought I would be perfect for this. As aside from vulnerability assessments my closest actual pentesting experience was the OSCP and I really love pentesting.  I love learning and I’d be more than happy to learn everything as an intern knowing that I’d have a place in a pentesting role.

After about 10 hours’ worth of interviews and assessments, they decided that I was overqualified for the internship role. They thought that I would get bored and want to move on. There’s some truth there but I’d of been happy. I’d likely hit things I already knew. However, I think I’d learn a lot too. I’m bored at my current job but I still work my ass off and smile at a job that I’m starting to hate. I only want to leave because I want a job in security. I explained this but they had already made up their mind. Not wanting to let this die, and since I was “overqualified” for the intern role, I asked about their open pentesting role. I was told I was under qualified for. To their credit they did point me to resources to study and asked to follow up at a later date on my progress. 

When I went back to college to get my BA, I went because I wanted to get into security and I didn’t have the experience. I thought that by getting a degree and some certs that I could get into a career in security. I certainly know a lot more than I did then and I’m able to actually get interviews now. However, now instead of just under qualified, I can now be over and under qualified at the same time. 

Thanks for reading, I know it was long. I feel better putting this out even if it doesn’t change my situation. I’ll be doing the only thing I can think to do….have a few more drinks and hack things. /cheers"

Should I give applying online another shot, even though it has never given me any results? And are companies even looking for interns in August/early September?

I graduated in the fall of 2010 with a degree in industrial and systems engineering and was hired in the winter/spring of 2011 by a large and well known company for a traditional IE role (although my title was process engineer).  Although my degree is in ISE I very much enjoy programming. At my job I had requested projects that suited my skillset; an IE related project that involved programming. After practically begging for quite some time, I was finally given a project that I was very enthusiastic about. Unfortunately about 2 weeks into it a major departmental change went through and I was yanked off of it. I was put on other projects that felt more or less like mindless busy work so I started looking for work elsewhere. I received a response from what seemed like my dream job (SpaceX). I passed several rounds of phone interviews and was flown out for an in person interview. I felt like the interview process went well, but I was told I didn't get the job because I was told they were looking for someone with experience in a very specific focus (which I only had minimal exposure to). 

Following this a very good friend and mentor of mine had just purchased a few new businesses and was looking to organize things. He knew I was bummed out about not getting hired at SpaceX and disliked my current job so he suggested I work for him. We worked out the details and a month later I quit my job (just under a year ago from now) and I started working for him developing software for his businesses. I've very much enjoyed my time but it's almost been a year and my duties here are starting to wrap up. 

I'm just as comfortable working as a programmer as I am in an IE position. I had 2 internships while in college in manufacturing positions, 2 years of professional experience in a manufacturing position and the last year doing web-based software development. I'm not opposed to traditional IE roles, but I like the software/control side of things of manufacturing. I have minimal exposure to PLC's, but I'm very comfortable with other IO embedded devices like arduino/raspberry pi. I'm also very comfortable on web stack environments (mostly LAMP, but I also know ROR, Django and front end frameworks like Knockout.JS and Angular)

With all of that in consideration, what kinds of fields or positions could use an industrial engineer with programming experience that I may have not considered? I could go either way: IE or programmer/web developer, but I'm trying to find some options that I may have not considered. I have minimal exposure to PLC's, but overall I am very comfortable with programming. Are there any controls/automation jobs that I would be suited for, or are employers looking more for EE/CS graduates and engineers?

**tl;dr**

Studied industrial and systems engineering and have been programming for a long time. Worked for 2 years right out of college at a very large company in an industrial engineering position, got bored with work. Friend/mentor hired me to work for him doing software development. It's been almost a year and my duties are starting to wrap up. Looking for opportunities (especially outside of traditional IE roles) for an ISE graduate with a few years of IE/manufacturing and programming experience. "

25fp2v,1,2014-05-13,I can't go to sleep because my mind keeps writing my suicide note,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25fp2v/i_cant_go_to_sleep_because_my_mind_keeps_writing/,"The suicide note is bringing up bad memories.

I'm pretty sure the biggest contributing factor to the fact that my mind keeps writing my suicide note is finals stress. I have 3 consecutive finals starting in less than twelve hours, and I'm going to do poorly on all of them. I've been an irresponsible fool all semester long, ruined my grades, and learned virtually nothing. Instead of just taking a math midterm, I got shitfaced and didn't turn it in. Instead of going to class for multiple weeks throughout the semester, I annihilated my sleep schedule to the point at which I woke up after my last class was over. I know that in six months time, I won't give too many shits about what grades I get tomorrow, but telling that to myself isn't helping.

The fact that I've been having a shit time at what I imagined to be my dream college ever since I got here probably isn't helping. I stupidly expected my social life to be as vibrant and interesting as my junior and senior years of high school, my grades to be as effortless, myself to be as assertive and confident as I was by the end of high school, and to be having as much fun as I did at the end of high school.

UC Berkeley was my dream school. I've been an uber-liberal atheist since I began thinking about religion and politics in 7th grade. Obviously it was going to be easy for me to find my place at one of the most liberal schools in the country.

I had plenty of friends from my high school's class of 2012 coming with me, including the closest friend I've ever had. My oldest friend, from a neighboring high school's class of 2011, was already attending, and doing well. Not to mention the many friends from my own high school's class of 2011 who were attending Berkeley. Obviously I would have prebuilt connections everywhere that would make finding more friends insanely easy.

I had glid through high school with pretty much straight As and A-minuses and was nearly a valedictorian. I had taken and passed so many AP tests that I would start college with Junior standing, making registering for classes much easier. I was our school's Academic Decathlon captain and highest scorer, and was among the top ten scorers in county, despite the fact that our team barely tried and never took the studying seriously. I had scored a 2320 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT, both higher than the average freshman accepted into Harvard. Obviously the academics, even if challenging, wouldn't be too much to handle.

Furthermore, the last two years, my Junior and Senior years of high school, were socially fantastic. My reputation preceded me--people I had never met before had heard of me, and had heard interesting and mostly positive things about my intelligence and personality. I had made friends in tons of varying social groups, hanging out with stoners and jocks in addition to the geeks and nerds with whom I had always fit. I could make most people laugh. In AP Government, my presence in a group project nearly always presaged my group's winning the class popularity vote. In my extracurriculars, I was always a leader. None of this was true two years prior--those two years were a natural uphill climb as a result of a highly increased confidence and a burgeoning social IQ. Obviously I would be able to fit in with any club at college, my social circle even wider, and my social skills would continue to improve.

Nope. None of those 'obviously's ended up being even remotely true. Looks like I peaked in high school. My freshman and sophomore years of college have been pure downhill. I tried joining some liberal and atheist clubs, along with some activities I excelled at in high school, but the inconvenient hours and slightly uninspiring people turned me off. I was no longer taking all the same classes as my best friend, and we both knew that we needed to hang out with strangers to build new social lives, so we grew somewhat apart. I meshed ok but not great with my roommates or the rest of my dorm's floor, so I didn't make any close friends there. I probably hung out with the people I already knew before entering college a bit too much, so that didn't help either.

Every dimension of my life is considerably poorer than they were two years ago, on the cusp of graduation. My social IQ has definitely diminished. I've grown farther from all the people I knew before I came to college, and the few new friends I have made are about as close to me as the people I considered close acquaintances in high school. I'm fucking up academically--I'm definitely failing Linear Algebra this semester, and doing extremely poorly in my two philosophy classes. I have 3 finals for which I am woefully unprepared coming up in less than 10 hours.

Berkeley sucks. I'm not smart enough to make a ton of friends through classes. I'm not fratty enough to join the Greek system. I'm not motivated enough to tryhard. I'm not good enough to get any research. I'm not responsible enough to look for internships.

The future is no longer bright. This fucking school has made me realize how dumb I am compared to virtually all of the human beings who will contribute meaningfully to humanity. If I continue on my current path, I will be become a shitty code monkey working at a company with low standards, doing nothing for the world and committing suicide as soon as my grandparents die. My grades are too shitty to go to any legit postgrad program. There's no way I have the endurance and determination to become a scientist, as I once dreamed.

When I try to go to sleep, my mind keeps writing my suicide note. It's racing through my head, with a tentative layout already built. I'll start with a Dear Best Friend letter, which will thank him for making my high school years the best years of my life, lament our growing apart in college, and say sorry for the times I have used him, which definitely outnumber the times he's used me. It would proceed with a bunch of thank yous and sorries to all the friends I can remember who made me happy at some point in my life, with longer messages for those to whom I have ever called close. Then there would be a bunch of thanks yous and sorrys to all the K-12 teachers who I remember.

At this point, I would explain why I am committing suicide. My future is dark, yada yada yada, blah blah blah, a few of the problems in my life may be fixable, but I don't have the fortitude to fix them, blah blah blah generic suicide reasons.

I would save my family for last. I would thank my grandparents for all the love they've given me, and give condolences for burying myself before burying them. I would thank my cousins for the times we hung out together, all of which I've enjoyed. And I would save the worst for last. I would thank my father for paying for my last two years of college and for being solidly middle class, which has surely afforded me a large number of advantages and opportunities not given to those less economically fortunate than my family. And then I would start the ""Fuck You"" section of my suicide note.

I would say, ""Fuck you for not being there when mom abused me as a child. Fuck you for not knowing what she would become. Fuck you for marrying her. Fuck you for not divorcing her when I asked you to at the tender age of 8. Fuck you for doing nothing when you knew full well what she had become. Fuck you for allowing her to live in our home. Fuck you for caring more about your love for her than for the abuse going on under your roof. Fuck you for fucking her and conceiving me. Fuck you for allowing me to be born. On top of these things which you can at least partially blame on mom, fuck you for being a below average father in general.""

As I started the note with a letter to my best friend, I would end it with a letter to my mother. Dear Mom, ""Thank you for the memory I have of looking up at the night sky with you, sitting by the poolside of one of the hotels we stayed in on our move from Texas to California. That is one of my earliest memories, and it is also the only memory in my brain which is both happy and contains you. Fuck you for being the reason I could never bring classmates over. Fuck you for the mental, emotional, physical, sexual abuse you inflicted on me when I was too young to understand or fight back. Fuck you for denying that any of it happened. Fuck you for implicitly acknowledging that it happened when you say, 'Everything mommy did for you was for your good.' Fuck you for being crazy. Fuck you for locking me up in the bathroom for 'making bad noises' which were actually just your hallucinations. Fuck you for saying that my breathing was too loud which was actually just your hallucinations. Fuck you for slapping me for moving my lips 'incorrectly' when I was never actually moving my lips at all. Fuck you for forcing me to repeat the same word or action for hours on end, whether it be picking up a pencil, saying a word, merely opening and closing my mouth, letting tears streak down my face, or countless other random movements you thought I was making 'incorrectly'. I would always ask you 'What do you want me to do?' and you would always answer 'You know what you should do'. Fuck you for doing all these things and worse, countless times throughout my elementary school life. Fuck you for being mentally ill. Fuck you for your delusions. Fuck you for continuing the emotional abuse through middle and high school. Fuck you for being the source of the vast majority of my life's misery. Fuck you for raising me instead of aborting me.""

And now I have 9 hours until my triple final gauntlet begins. And I'm still writing this post instead of going to sleep. I don't even care that this post isn't on a smurf, even if this post contains way too mu'ch of my life story. Maybe having spent three hours writing this post will make me tired enough to fall asleep. I doubt it, but I must try. Plus, I think I'm approaching the 10k character limit.

A bit of background, I'm working as an applications developer with a research company for a third level institute. Technically I'm an intern, but there are no other programmers here so take that title for what it's worth (i.e. if I need help I go to the internet, which is why I'm here).

The previous software employee set up a server for the guys to do backups and run the intranet etc. It is also hooked up to prototype wireless receiver system for benchmarking that the guys use occasionally.
The hardware receives data packets every few seconds and drops them into a MySQL database running on the server. The intranet site can be used to graph the data that is stored in there.

Which would all be great except for one problem, there doesn't seem to be any constraints on the data being graphed, it's graphing everything. The system has been running since about 2010, receiving packets every few seconds, it's graphing, what I can only imagine, is several million data points. So if anyone tries to graph anything the server grinds to a halt for 10-15 minutes and the intranet freezes up, I've been asked to see if I can fix it.

My programming knowledge is limited to some VB, Java and C#, from my rummaging around on the server this system is set up using a combination of Python, Django and Javascript (which is why I wasn't sure which subreddit to ask in). I'm trying to figure out what I can but it's slow going with no one to ask for help. I've been going trough the python and javascript stuff I can find, seeing what references there are and get a rough idea of what each script does to see if I can narrow down where to look.

Ideally if I could find where the SELECT query for the graphing is written I'd just modify it to put some limit on the data, but I don't know where to look.

I think I'm on the right track looking at [this piece of javascript](http://jsfiddle.net/RrD5F/), but any pointers or suggestions on where, or even what, to look for would be most appreciated.

I also wanted to take a class this summer so that I could hurry up my graduation date. I started my major late, and if I take summer classes, I will still be graduating a year late. 

My dilemma is that I've just been offered an internship with a (seemingly) great company and I can't help but be tempted to take this internship. The repercussions of accepting the offer would be that I'd have to quit my current, lower-paying, job and I would probably have to add another semester even though I'm already going to be a year late,  or squeeze more classes per semester. 

I've just completed 3 semesters of my computer science major, and I think it would be impressive if I had this internship experience early on in my education. 

Here's a summary of pros and cons of each choice:

**Take the internship**
-19$/hr
-Great experience in signals processing software
-Not specifically interested in signals processing, but 
i think it'd be cool to learn about
-Taking it would mean I would have to delay my graduation or take 
really big course loads throughout the school year. 
-Opening up more doors for me in general, since this experience would give me an edge I think

**Stay in class and keep part-time job over the summer**
- 11$/hr
- I would be able to work towards my CS degree and not delay it any further
- Schedule is more flexible
- I would maintain good relations with the people I work with on campus since I wouldn't be leaving them over the summer (Summer vacation is starting next week, so it would be short notice to tell them I can't work for them anymore)

So what's more important? Getting the internship and experience early on? Or graduating in a timely manner and maintaining a good relationship with present employers?

* How much RAM is sufficient? Which brands to get and which brands to avoid? What is a ""good sale"" in $/gig?

* Which motherboard should I get for my i7-4770k?

* Are all SSD's created equal? From what I've been reading, it seems like the Samsung Evo 840 is the way to go.

I was on site and got a chance to chat with what I was hoping would be someone who was interested in learning or education. I hope this spurs some discussion as well. 

&gt;Intern #111: Dr1nfinite! You're our hacker guy right? I have a few questions for you!

This should be good.

&gt;Me: Sure, what's up?

&gt;Intern #111: How easy is it for someone to hack my email?

&gt;Me: Oh, it depends. If you enter your username and password while someone who wants to steal it is watching, say from a camera, a keylogger, over your shoulder...

&gt;Intern #111: No, no. I mean, how easy is it for someone to HACK my email.

&gt;Me: What is hacking to you?

&gt;Intern #111: Like, a criminal. On the computer.

&gt;Me: As long as you only use your email at work you don't have to worry. We keep the hackers out.

&gt;Intern #111: So if someone was using their email outside of work you could hack it?

&gt;Me: As in, stand over their shoulder and remember what they typed?

&gt;Intern #111: No, as in HACK it. Like, with a flash drive!

&gt;Me: Sure, I don't see why not.

&gt;Intern #111: Could you hack someone for me then? I need their emails.

At this point, I should have seen where they were going. But I thought it would be bad manners to just walk away. So I continued...

&gt;Me: Sure, but I charge $1000 per hour.

&gt;Intern #111: Wow, that's a lot. Hold on a second.

The user turns back to their computer, and goes to bing. They types in the following:

2 times 1000

&gt;Intern #111: It would only take you less than an hour to get to them and less than an hour to get back, so if you did it I'd be able to pay you next paycheck.

&gt;Me: Look, I'm not going to judge. But did you honestly just require a calculator to find out the final pay of 2 hours work at $1000 per hour?

&gt;Intern #111: Oh. Yes.

&gt;Me: Essentially, don't ask staff to hack random people for you. That's illegal. I'm going to pretend like you were joking and just write this off. I was joking about being able to help you, because I only hack systems I have permission to hack.

&gt;Intern #111: I wasn't joking. 

*cue deadpan stare, and a pause*

&gt;Intern #111: My emails at home got hacked and sent out spam to my contacts. I think it was my ex and I want to hack them back! I'm just computer illiterate.

The next 30 or so minutes involved me and Intern #111's cubicle neighbors joining in and getting a talking to from me about common Hollywood hacking myths. It seems like incompetence with technology pairs commonly with incompetence with all skills requiring critical thinking. "

All I really need is for someone to tell me that I'm going to be okay. 

I'm a good student. I never miss lecture, always turn my homework in on time, as well as study hard for all of my exams. Lately, my exam performance has been less than desirable. I feel like every time I get to an exam, I look at it and my mind goes blank.

The fact that I work hard, yet still do not do as well as I hope has led me to believe that I am just not smart enough. Im a very highly motivated person who truly truly loves engineering, but I'm constantly afraid of getting to my Junior/Senior classes and simply failing them. 

I don't want to graduate with a garbage GPA, so to compensate I've been building my resume like crazy (research internship, technical projects). Adding to my frustration is the fact that I hear of students not doing their homework or even coming to lecture, yet they still manage to get better grades than me.

tl;dr My lack of academic success is making me feel inadequate, and I just need a confidence boost.

Career advice?,natetheskate28,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25gq09/recent_graduate_of_civil_engineering_career_advice/,"I recently graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering at the top of my class. I also got a lot of honors from being on the track and field team for the University. 

I can not find a job anywhere. I can't even get people to respond back to me. People keep telling me to have patience but, it is a little worrying. I was searching for advice and that eventually led me to this subreddit. 

My problem is that I don't have work experience. In college, I wasn't allowed to have a job during the school year (coach's rule) and track went well into the summer so I was never able to apply for summer internships. Instead of internships, I would do manual labor for people I knew, work for my grandparents, work for my parents, etc. But now, it seems like not having work experience relating to engineering has really hurt my chances of finding a job. Here lies my question.

Should I pursue an internship? Can you even apply for internships when not a college student anymore? 
This would allow me to get some work experience for an actual job. 
I would just like some advice on what I should do.

Some relevant info:
I have already talked to Career Services on campus many times. They aren't the most helpful to say the least.
I'm in Texas and I'm hoping to stay in Texas.
I know people who are high up engineers in various firms trying to help me find a job. So it isn't for a lack of knowing people.


The only thing I can point my finger to is work experience.

What is the program generally like?

Does the fact that it is a Jt. Major hinder employment oppurtunities for me as opposed to if I got a pure CompSci degree in terms of the kind of work I'll be able to do?

How are the internship oppurtunities for CompSci kids at McGill?

Does it just take time or should I start looking for something different?,AhhhBees,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25h7k4/at_what_point_do_i_change_strategies_does_it_just/,"About five years ago I had a job I really liked as a Marketing Associate/ Customer Service Manager. I had been in it a few years, found it really interesting  and wanted to grow. I decided the best way to do that would be to finish my degree. So I quit my job (once it became unworkable due to conflicting class times and lack of employer flexibility) and finished my degree. While I was in college I worked part time doing customer service and logistics for a small business. Just before I graduated I got another part time job as a receptionist at an investing firm. It was originally a three month project, but because of some staffing changes, they took me on full time and I’ve been here about 1.25 years now. The position has no work. The company has no work. I’ve tried to grow my role, but no one has enough work to do as it is, let alone any for me to try to help with. The company let me know at my December review, that they would like to eliminate my position by summer. Great! A lot of notice! I could just start looking. 

I started looking in January for entry level marketing and sales positions. I’ve sent out a ton of resumes and have a pretty good interview rate. I would say for every 8 resumes I send out, I get an interview. Some have gone great (at least that’s what I thought) and others not so great. Either way, no offer has come my way. I find that I am either too experienced and they are looking for someone they can “mold” or I am not experienced enough. 

I am a little frustrated with the process and am not sure what is the best way to go forward. Am I being unrealistic in the jobs that I am looking for or is the job market such that this is just going to take a long time? I know I would have a better shot with an internship (which makes no sense because I’ve already held a paid position) but I can’t tell if it’s worth it to work two part time jobs, just to do an internship.

What would be the best approach for learning Visual Basic in just a few days?  I start on Monday, and despite the time constraint, I feel confident I can do this.  Last summer I interned at the same company, and they had me learn php in 5 days so I could get their website up and running. 
 

Can you recommend any books or specific websites for tutorials?  I will be going through the Microsoft docs tomorrow, and want a good book/site to use after that.  


As a side note, I am unsure whether or not we will be using ASP.NET for web apps, or if I will just be making Desktop Applications.  Perhaps recommend resources for both?

Like majority of young Indians,I also belong to the vast pool of students trying their hands on engineering  in not so reputed college. The decision to become engineer was my own. However, despite my full blown preparation and hard work, I could not find my way into IITs  or NITs. Hence, ended up taking admission in one of the private colleges of Delhi . Currently doing b.tech in IT  ( 6th sem)   
I have high aspirations and want to do something on my own. Sadly,all these exam oriented subjects with little or no practical approach, I feel all my past semesters have been utter waste despite scoring well as I hardly remember any of the studied stuff and I hardly know anything about the practical implementation. 
Few nights back,I decided to take my education in my own hands and not depend upon useless course of the college . I did whole lot of research on Internet and within 3 days, I was equipped with the knowledge of current technological trends. I surfed through coursera courses and was stunned by the quality of courses and how primitive the education in my college was. 
I have decided to put my remaining 2 semesters to use and exploit as much of online resources like coursera, udemy, mit OCW, YouTube videos etc to expand my technical and practical knowledge. However, with the summer vacations approaching,I am in a dilemma now. Everybody is doing an internship in some company or doing a course in some institute. I couldn't manage any company as majority of them had their all internship seats filled up or required good jugaad to get into them. I did java from NIT and let me tell you,they were pathetic. The teacher didn't know java well, all the time he was confused between the syntax of C and java,Skipped loads of important topics and didn't help with summer project. I didn't want the repeat of last year. I,therefore, have decided to do the training own my own from home. I am worried about the certificate as I won't have anything to show for at the placement time. I would love to hear you people out about my decision and please suggest me which course should I pick up,I am thinking of either android programming or Web development from coursera. Please suggest me a way to obtain certification through some online  test. Also, I am very dedicated towards making my summer vacations productive and I am ready to study day and night and explore and grab as much as I can from online resources.



edit 1: I did java from NIIT. I,bymistake, mentioned it as NIT. 



Tldr:instead of doing training from an institute, I am planning to study own my own from online resources. Worried about certificate. Planning to do either android training or Web programming from online. "

 |One thing I can say is that the area I live in is one of the biggest fields in the country, but we haven't had any reports of pollution like that occurring.

A pulling unit would take WAY longer, which is one of the reasons I don't see them very often.
[So your referring to the coil method where the pipe is not joined in segments?

25jsdl,3,2014-05-14,I now have two job offers. How do I make the right decision?,fruitblender,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25jsdl/i_now_have_two_job_offers_how_do_i_make_the_right/,"I think I've reached the point where I have to choose the one I'll regret less. There isn't an obvious answer here, at least which I could tell. But I'd love some input that might make this decision easier. 

Both of these jobs are in IT, which is the direction I want my career to go. I currently have a little bit of support experience and am just looking to get my foot in the door and grow from there. On to the offers. 

First position is with a health insurance company. This position is a 10-week summer internship. The duties included in this job are a ""little bit of everything"", as I was told in the interview. There is no guarantee of a job at the end of the internship (which gives me a feeling its very performance based, but I haven't done an internship in a long time-and never one where I was looking for a position at the end, so I have no idea if this is a standard thing to say in internship interviews or not).

Second position is with a telecommunications company. It is contract to hire, and external customer support (read: call center). The call center is located a lot further away from where I currently live-this would give me a pretty sucky commute and I don't have a car, just a motorcycle.

The second position pays just a couple hundred more per month. I'd likely end up buying a car if I get it, which would pretty much cancel out any extra money I'd end up making. The first position is something I'm more passionate about and a work environment I'd feel a lot happier in than the telecommunications one. However, the telecommunications position is pretty much a single track into IT, performance based (which I know I can achieve). Its a lot more ""corporate america"" feeling though, which I find a little impersonal. There's also the added stress of dealing with outside customers instead of just dealing with people in the company.  

So, any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

25jvzx,1,2014-05-14,23/M Australia -&gt; Europe,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/25jvzx/23m_australia_europe/,"Hi all,


I'm about to finish University here in Australia with a double Bachelors in Law and Legal Practice and International Studies (International Relations and Italian majors) as well as a Diploma in French. From the end of the year I will also be able to practice as a lawyer. 

Because of the massive amount of my law graduates my odds of getting a graduate law job are slim to none. In my current city, it is estimated that there are 5 graduate lawyers for every graduate job and the odds aren't much better for other major cities. Additionally, because the current government has announced 16,000 jobs are to be cut from the public service, I have little shot of getting a job in my other area of expertise despite great grades, good extra-curriculars, great language skills etc. 

In all this was not a problem as I had previously planned to do a Masters degree in International Relations should I fail to get a government job this year in order to make myself more competitive. With the announced uncapping of University fees from 2016 here in Australia, however, it is likely that the cost of this would become excessive (&gt;$100k vs the current ~$43k) and I would never be able to pay it off in addition to my existing student debt. Although I would pay the current rate of $21k/year for the 2015 school year, the odds of the cost blowing out when the uncapping comes into effect in 2016 are quite high.

I’ve studied abroad in France before and travelled extensively. I decided long ago that I would like to move to Europe (ideally permanently) in the future, and these recent developments have sped this up. I would therefore like to know what the chances of me getting a job or paid internship in any European country in my areas of expertise (law, public policy, international relations etc) are like given that I have little professional experience. Quite low, I imagine. 
 
The other solution I thought of was to instead do a Masters degree in international law, international relations, governance or something similar in Europe, as even though I’d have to pay non-EU/EEA rates I’d probably still end up paying less money than if I were to do it here in Australia. I am aware that Germany, Norway and Finland all offer free tuition for foreign students for most programs, but the cost of living might pose a problem in that finding a job may be difficult given that I do not speak the local language. I have considered getting TEFL or CELTA certified and teaching English part time to support myself, but I have no idea about the feasibility of this idea nor whether doing that would unduly interfere with studying. 

So that leaves me with a bunch of questions I’d like some help with:

* Would it be possible for me to find a job in my areas of expertise in any European country given that I have little professional work experience? If so, how might I find these jobs?

* In the alternative, how is it best to support yourself while studying as a non-EU/EEA student?

* For countries that do charge tuition fees, are there any loan or grant schemes in place in any particular countries to aid foreign students? It is unlikely I would be able to pay 12k+ euros upfront otherwise, as I do not presently earn enough to have any savings at all. I do not have any preferences for countries, rather I would prefer a university which is decently ranked.

Thanks in advance!

25k2ih,6,2014-05-14,Should I give up on my career?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/25k2ih/should_i_give_up_on_my_career/,"Kinda a long story to explain why I'm asking this question.

Got a BSIS in 2007; Specialized in Network Administration and Security. Had a 6 month internship in 2005 as IT manager's assistant for a medium sized company doing sys adminy things.  Got first real sys admin / tech support job in 2008, had job for 6 months when the market crashed and I got laid off.  Couldn't find a job for 9 months; desperate and starving got a shit call center job doing hardware support.  Stayed there a year and a half, no opportunities for advancement, $11 dollars per hour.  Was offered a contract to hire position for a company that supported in house POS software and server/terminals, fun in SQL.  I was promised to be hired in 3 months, company gets bought and they go on hiring freeze, contract extended 3 months.  Working over nights and weekends, not seeing light of day, no social interaction, starting to go a little crazy I ask to not extend my contract another 3 months and I'm on my own again.  At this point the only jobs interested in me are POS support or customer service.  No Sys Admin jobs.  Nothing ever over 30k per year and all expect me to give up my weekends and in most cases working 3rd shift.  I get a job selling sell phones and all of the sudden I'm making 45k and I finally am offered health insurance.  I only last 6 months because I suck at sales, I'm an IT guy.  Another 8 month block on unemployment, only offers are  customer service call centers. Starting to give up.  Old college friend feels bad for me and makes a position where he works, no benefits $15 dollar per hour data center specialist for a one year contract. I'm told after a couple of months that for budgetary reasons I might have to be let off before my one year is up.

I don't know what to do with myself.  I keep getting told about ""red flags"" on my resume and how I'm not loyal to anyone.  I've been struggling ever since the economic crisis of 2008 and my career has not gone anywhere.  I'm really good at what I do, but no one will hire me to be a jr admin or anything.  I tried selling phones to see if maybe I'm good at something else, but I'm an IT guy.  Right now I'm very happy because I get to work on server administration and maintenance, but theres that cloud hanging over my head that the conversation about the budget is going to happen and once again I'll be unemployed and unemployable to no one but the customer service call centers again.  Taking one of those jobs would be like I've completely accepted defeat and said I'm worthless to my field; I would rather kill myself.  It's been 6 years and I haven't anything to show.  Is it time to throw in the towel and get a job ringing up groceries?"
25k3db,2,2014-05-14,"I fear that one of the offices in my school has acted unprofessionally towards me, what should I do?",ufotofu906,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/25k3db/i_fear_that_one_of_the_offices_in_my_school_has/,"**WARNING: LOTS OF READING AHEAD, TL;DR BELOW**

So I'm a student currently part of the co-op program at my school. For those who don't know, Co-op basically means the co-op office at my school will help you find internships and you swap semesters taking classes and working. One of the employees at the co-op office (not the head) has been acting in (what I consider) an unprofessional manner towards me and I fear it may have jeopardized my relationship with the co-op office as a whole. 

To provide some context, we had companies coming to the school and this specific employee sent an email offering a time slot to various students, myself included. I already had four interviews that day and wanted to devote the time I had to practicing for the positions that I had personally signed up for and wanted. Due to a busy week, I really only had the day before to prepare. Thus, I politely refused the offer though I did not specifically mention why (I wasn't aware how this action would affect me later on). He replied to the email, stating various reasons about how it was a bad move in an mildly agitated tone.  

My friend who happened to be in the co-op office, refused the offer in person. My friend told me the employee was visibly angry, as it appeared quite a few other students had refused as well, and he felt he was being put in a ""lose-lose situation"" as students always ""complain about not having enough interviews"" despite his current efforts. According my friend, the employee said ""he felt like he was gonna punch somebody"". My friend's reason was he had class at the time, and was also already signed up for a fair number of interviews himself but due to the employee's current disposition, thought it was best to just get the hell out of there. 

To set the record straight, I understand the employee's situation, but I believe he also generalized every student who refused his offer and it appears he took it very personally. I do not believe this is a professional way to handle things, especially in a work environment, with student's career opportunities at stake. After my friend told me about what happened, I thought it would be best if I just kept my email brief as I didn't think he'd be very receptive to any reasons I had to say. So I thanked him for his response, and told him I unfortunately had to decline again. He then replied saying how he hoped ""this decision wouldn't haunt me"". 

I was bothered by what happened but I didn't think that much of it. I was sure that he was just caught up in the moment and that this would soon become a distant memory. Unfortunately, next time I was up in the co-op office I saw two fliers (A4 size) with a picture of a doghouse and my name, my friend's, and various others underneath it. To those who don't know, ""putting someone in the doghouse"" is an idiom for saying that you're annoyed with somebody. These fliers were hung up in the middle of the office, not the employee's specifically which made me even more concerned. I had a pretty good idea what it was about, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions so I asked another employee at the office what it meant and she told me to talk to the employee that sent out the offers. He quickly said he was angry but not anymore, so I let it go because I assumed that it was going to get taken down soon if it no longer bothered them. 

A few months later and those fliers are still up. It looks like a new name was added to the list as well. I happen to walk in during lunch so most of the employees are gathered together (though not the employee I'm having problems with). The head of the co-op office is there as well. I bluntly let the group know that I'm concerned if those fliers are impacting my future career opportunities. I tell them I feel like I'm being blacklisted, and I want clarification about what those fliers are about. One of the employees then lets me know that this is a collaborative list that all the employees handle, and they put up students' names that they have difficulties with. This is so the other employees can be aware when they have to deal with them. Or something along those lines. Basically they made it sound like it wasn't a big deal, then the other difficult employee showed up, and I continued the conversation with just him in his office. 

He said the same things about how it wasn't a big deal, and how it doesn't affect my placement with future companies through the co-op office. He then goes on to clarify again about the importance of accepting interviews, which I completely agree with. I also used this opportunity to explain how I had a lot of interviews that day, and it wasn't my intention to cause him so much headache (he had to reschedule a bunch of things due to people rejecting, though in all fairness I wasn't aware of the fact that would happen, and I'm not sure why he would schedule things before people confirmed their time slots). Finally, he said he would take them down but they've been up so long that they aren't really a concern anymore. He even commends me on being one of the students to actually stay visible within the co-op office and notice the fact that those fliers are even up. For some reason I felt that this meant that the fliers were coming down he just didn't have time yet. I unfortunately don't remember too well or perhaps I just confused his statement, but his surprisingly friendly tone put me in an optimistic mood. I left the co-op office feeling like I got what I wanted.

Half a week later, so today, I come back and they're still up. I see him right away, and kind of bluntly say ""the fliers are still up, I thought you said you were going to take em down"". He then gets upset and says ""that's still on your mind? don't you have finals to worry about?"" I tell him I'm not worried about my finals (kind of rude of me but I'm pretty upset too), and he then says ""fine, I'll take em down"", he then somewhat aggressively tears the fliers down and pushes them towards my chest and says ""here take em"", I tell him I don't want them, fold them up, and place them in the trash. Then I left and went back to my apartment, unsure about what will happen the next time I go to the co-op office and what will be of my relationship with the co-op office as a whole.  

That's the last thing that happened.


---


**TL;DR:** Co-op office employee gets upset I refused his interview offer. Takes it personal, puts up two fliers with a short list of names (mine included) and hangs it up in the middle of the co-op office. I confront the co-op office about it. They say it's no big deal and that I shouldn't be worried. Nonetheless the fliers are still up. I talk to the co-op office employee in question, he says it's no big deal too and that he could take them down. Time goes by and they're still up. I bring it up again and he gets upset and rips them down and gives them to me. I place them in the trash.


---


I fear that all the employees are very close, and this includes the head of the co-op office. I believe this is not just an isolated incident with the employee I'm having problems with as the fliers were up for all to see, and not just in the specific employee's office. All the employees say there has been no effect on our job placement, but I feel that their actions indicate otherwise. There is no way of knowing about their true intentions but my current direction is to do my best to find internships on my own, and if they manage to find something for me great, but I don't plan on expecting anything. Is this the best course of action? Maybe I should confront them again? Though I'm afraid I'll just get the same responses, especially if this is something they're all in on. 

Secondly, am I right in saying that they've acted unprofessionally? It just troubles me that it seems the whole office is in on it. I'm not sure who else at my school I can talk to? A dean maybe? 

On one occasion, I've also been referred to as ""that student"" by one of the employees, which greatly troubles me since I had no intention of causing them any grief, but they seem to look at it differently. Any insight into how I should proceed would be greatly appreciated.

**Episode 9: Honey, I called the Electricians**

__________________________________________________________

As I walked in today with my coffee and cream cheese bagel in hand I felt a calm that I had not felt in a long time, but I should have known that fate was about to take that calm, throw a burrito at it's face, stick it in a glass box of emotion, and then shove it catapult it back at me.

**2 hours to incident**

Sitting at my desk drinking coffee and reading over the ticket queue, I see a motion in the corner of my eye over by the door. I think nothing of it. Then I hear loud foot steps approaching followed by another motion by the door. Still, I think nothing of it. Next I hear 2 pairs of loud foot steps approaching. This time I look up. I see two men walking by. They are carrying a ladder and one is also carrying a large tool bag. 

Electricians.

I don't know how your electricians are, but the electrician company we use is notorious for hiring and sending us horrible... electricians. (Almost said ""techs"" there for a moment) So my general attitude towards hearing the busy boot steps of electricians in hallways is... oh how do I put this nicely... negative.

I felt a disturbance in the force.

I dropped my bagel, set down my coffee, and walking out of the room I patted USER real quick. (If you don't know who ""USER"" is, read my previous tales) I then went to find IT Head to discover the nature of the visiting electricians.

&gt;Me: Hey, IT Head, what is up with the electricians?

&gt;IT Head: Oh, they are installing some ceiling mounted projectors in the meeting rooms.

&gt;Me: So that means they will be cutting holes in the walls and ceilings huh?

&gt;IT Head: Yup.

&gt;Me:*oh god*

&gt;IT Head: Could you please go make sure all important drives have been backed up today.

&gt;Me: On it, boss.

In anticipation of typical electrician failure (power outage due to lack of intelligence) I set out to back up important images and network drives. Unfortunately we had decided to switch from Microsoft Word 2007 to Microsoft Word 2013 so some of the techs and an intern were busy with the drives I needed.

**30 minutes to incident**

I am finally able to get in to start backing things up. A boring task that I was luckily able to draft my friend who is also a tech and helped me get this job to help me. Unfortunately he was called away to go help some drivers with a work station issue (Read Episode 3) and I was called away to go help some $users in the Marketing department with the new way MS Word looked. They were ""very confused and didn't understand the new layout"" as I was told.

I walked away from my task. Going out the door, I turned and looked back at the room. I could almost interpret the humming of the drives as ""Professor_Derpsalot, please back us up to save us from the electricians!""

**3 minutes and 45 seconds to incident**

After having finished dealing with the Marketing $users I began to fast walk back to my helpless network drives. I walked by one of the meeting rooms and could hear the buzzing of a jig saw cutting dry wall. I had gone down the stairs and was on the opposite side of the level containing the network drives.

*click*

Lights go out, fans stop spinning, and you could hear all the hard drives spinning down.

**Shit**

25kyt1,3,2014-05-14,Journalist/Receptionist/Dead-Body-Hauler (and more!) needs help transitioning to a real career path...,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/25kyt1/journalistreceptionistdeadbodyhauler_and_more/,"27F, just got back from an epic backpacking trip all around South America, and now I'm trying to figure out what to do with my ""life""/how to transfer my skills and experience into a workable career plan. I have enough money in savings to continue to not work for a few months if I don't want to, or to work for little or no pay if necessary to build some skills/experiences and connections, so in that respect I am VERY lucky and can (for now) afford to be a bit of a dreamer.

Please help me brainstorm some possibilities for positions/companies I could explore and techniques for getting a foot in the door!!! (I know I need to network, but I think I need help targeting my search a bit first, and making a plan so I don't get totally overwhelmed.)

Areas of interest for work:


* Nightlife (specifically all things EDM-related -- clubs, concerts, festivals)
* Travel/Tourism
* Hospitality (hotels mostly, but maybe bars/restaurants too)
* maaaybe Alternative Fitness, eg. soulcycle, pole dancing, etc.

Specializations that have been suggested to me or that I'm curious about:

* Marketing
* Public Relations
* Event Planning (Operations/Logistics?)
* Sales of some kind?
What else??? This is the hardest part for me -- I know SO LITTLE about the specific jobs/titles that would be a strong fit.

Experience (some of these overlap/come from the same job): 

* customer service and food service (2-3 years)
* receptionist/administrative work (4-5 years if you count internships; 2-3 if you don't)
* journalism/editorial/writing work (5-7 years, on and off, but a lot more if you were to count the college newspaper)
* marketing/event planning (some summer internships and such, and for certain events at certain jobs)
* transporting human remains for a funeral home (1 year and 2 months)
* online tutoring/grading SAT essays (i think 3 years)

More about me:

* I love and am good at working with people and with words.
* My written work has been published a lot of times online and in print locally in a major major city, and I've freelance written/reported a teensy bit for two major national tabloids.
* I'm very good with computers and have worked with a LOT of different specialized software programs (music and video editing, e-mail marketing, newspaper layout, more) and will happily use this skill to a point, but I find that too much screen time kills my eyesight, my waistline, and my desire to live.
* Room for GROWTH/CHANGE is really important to me. I like to work my butt off to master every job, and it's really frustrating when that work leads to a whole lot of nowhere.
* I would LOVE to work abroad or to have to travel abroad a lot for work, specifically in Spanish-speaking countries, but I know this makes things a bit harder...especially since my Spanish is only basic-to-conversational.

Any and all suggestions or pieces of advice are appreciated! Please don't tell me this is too general or too wild or that you hate me because I don't absolutely have to work right now. I know I'm privileged and I know I'm asking a lot, but I really need help figuring stuff out. My last post was a LOT less accurate and a lot more scattered and I already got reamed out for that :) Thank you in advance."

I know internships are a huge part of getting a job, any good internship programs in a school in Georgia?

The project manager reached out to me again this March and asked me if I can participate in another project in May, which I accepted.  However the project was pushed back to late-June.

Today I received a call from the HR at company A, they gave me an offer to their IT department internship, they gave me till next Monday to consider the offer.  On the phone I told the HR about the creative department project that I accepted ahead of time.  I thought its better to let them know about it instead of letting them figure out that I was working in two roles.  

The HR thanked me and said will discuss this will the project manager from the creative department, and said it shouldn't be a big deal.  Since that position does not require me to work onsite and only has a maximum of 40 hours.  

So now I am wondering if I said stupid things...I just don't want this to cause a conflict and want them to know ahead of time.  Will this hurt my internship offer?

25lcxs,1,2014-05-14,How do I bring up my depression/suicidal thoughts to my parents?,throwaway5123612,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25lcxs/how_do_i_bring_up_my_depressionsuicidal_thoughts/,"I'm probably among the some of the luckiest college kids there are in terms of building a foundation for a fantastic career. My parents are helping me pay for my college degree, I just started a full time internship with an IT company over the summer, and when school starts again, I'll move to part time where they will work around my schedule. My parents have offered to let me live at home for free once I'm finished with school, in order for me to pay off the student loans quickly that I had to take out (they couldn't pay for all of it). I'm basically set for a wealthy and successful life come 20 years from now. I'm grateful for everything my parents have done for me, and I recognize that thousands of other kids would gladly trade places if they were given the chance. Yet, not a day has gone by over these last two years that I haven't thought about suicide.

6 years ago, I lost my faith and started to consider myself an atheist. My parents, who are extremely religious, have embraced my decision and don't bother me about it (again, I am so lucky to have such amazing parents). My depression started when I finally realized that if there is no afterlife.....then whats the point of living? Ever since that moment, I've lived in this never ending depressed state; yet I guess you can consider it a mild depressed state. I don't miss class, I keep my grades up, and I go to work every day. But I still welcome the thought of death; the eternal sleep where I can finally stop worrying about all of the meaningless stresses that life throws at you. I sometimes lay awake at night thinking about all of the stupid things that I care about and worry over, such as getting an A on my project, or finishing my report for work. None of it matters in the long run, nothing that I do now takes away from the fact that I will die some day and everything will be for nothing.

The reason I've gone all of these years without a single suicidal attempt is because I don't want to throw away all of my parents hard work they have put into giving me the best shot possible at being successful. But just because I haven't attempted suicide yet, doesn't mean I won't in the future. I am sick and tired of living every single day of my life with the thought that nothing I do matters. I want desperately to be happy, and to get this depression and these suicidal thoughts out of my head. Right now, I only live for the sake of other people, but I want to live for my sake! So I want to tell my parents how I am truly feeling, and hopefully go to therapy or something. Keep in mind they are extremely religious, and I'm not sure how they will necessarily react to the news that I want to kill myself (suicide is a no-no to Catholics). 

What do you think would be the best way to talk to them about finding a therapist?"

25n3lm,4,2014-05-15,Advice Needed for Job/Career Path,Holstein30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/25n3lm/advice_needed_for_jobcareer_path/,"Hello Reddit,

I just moved to St. Augustine, FL a little over a week ago and have been searching for a job/career path. I am currently 23 and have a Bachelor's Degree in History with a 3.64 GPA (not great but not awful). However, after completing my degree and really thinking about the future I have discovered that I am more interested in a career in technology and have been taking the first steps towards teaching myself computer programming. In the mean time I need to find a job that pays enough to pay the bills. 

This is where I have run into a problem. I am unsure of the best way to go about searching for these jobs. I have been using online resource such as monster, careerbuilder, etc. but since I am new to the area and have absolutely no connections to anyone down here I am having a tough time. I have landed a few interviews that have went well but haven't heard anything back yet. I am also unsure about what the best career path is for me to take. As I mentioned I am more interested in a technology/computer science career now and I am unsure of how to break into this field. 

So far I have come up with 4 options at the moment:

     1. Find a paralegal/legal assistant job (have interviewed for one so far)

•	The reasoning behind trying to find this type of job is because I possess many of the skills necessary for this type of position. (Analytical, Research, and Writing skills long with quite typing skills and a fair amount of computer skills)

•	The con's would include: fairly difficult to land a job (especially since it seems that there are very few positions open in my area), possible lack of interest in job (I would not consider this a deal breaker at all though as it would last more than a couple of years), most likely long hours (once again not a deal breaker as I am young and have the time right now), possibly a rather steep learning curve at first considering I would likely have to become nuanced in whatever aspect of the law the firm covers 

     2. Get a job in retail or go back to working as a server at a restaurant

•	The reasoning behind this path is that it will be somewhat easier to find a job in retail and I'm certain I can find work as a server quickly

•	The con's to this path include the fact that I have been a server for the last 2 years or so and I can honestly say that I did not enjoy it at all. Another con would be the fact that I may not be able to start out with enough money (in retail) to be able to pay the bills.

     3. Enroll in the local community college (http://www.sjrstate.edu/workforce/computers.html) 
     and get an associate's degree in computer science – Or enroll in the University of North Florida  
     (http://www.unf.edu/ccec/computing/Computer_Science_Program.aspx) and get a 
     computer science bachelor's degree

•	The associate's degree would hopefully help me to get my foot in the door for a career in computer science while the bachelor's would certainly help me in starting up my career in the field while also helping me to land internships and other opportunities while enrolled

•	The con's include: how would I pay for this and pay the bills (idk how much I could get from loans for the community college but I would definitely get a job at the same time to help and pay but I'm sure it would not be enough) especially if I decide on UNF, it will take at least a year to complete the degree at the community college, and likely will take 3-4 years for the UNF program 

     4. Go into the military (Air Force or Navy)

•	The reasoning for this is that it would pay the bills, I would get good benefits, I would be able to get training in IT fields and also take courses that would supplement my bachelor's degree and possibly give me the qualifications necessary for getting into a master's program for computer science, and it would either pay of my college loans (I don't have all that much), or I could get the GI Bill and get a higher degree, and I would also have a chance of starting out as an officer since I already have a degree

•	The con's include a four year commitment to a branch (delays life), chance of deployment/chance to die, not being able to decide where I live/being away from my girlfriend for very long periods (who I live with and who is getting her doctorate in physical therapy). 


This sums up everything that I have taken into consideration so far. I would really appreciate any advice or feedback that the Reddit community could give me and I am open to any and all suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I have to say, that travelling itself can be very exhausting, especially when you have long flights and a late night show. However, when the crowd gives so much energy it reflects on me.

Sometimes it creates a sort of unity, which is nice. I wish people would stop throwing kandi at me during the shows though. That hurts. ;)

I don't know where the music and parties will be in 10 years from now. Things evolve so fast in this scene, which is awesome, but it's hard to predict which direction it will go. One thing is for sure, it WILL be around for another 10 years.

It's short-sighted and naive. It discredits all the people that don't take drugs and have a good time. Drugs are everywhere, you cannot tell people what to or not to do. The best way is to keep educating and communicating with people about it and let them know what risks are.

I wish you the best and I hope to see you on the EDC line-up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7ra?context=5)|Thank you. Actually Paul and i produced this one together before he passed.
[Hello! If you could work with any DJ you have never worked with before for a new track who would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy2s5?context=5)|I would love to do something with Daft Punk or The Prodigy. They are a big inspiration!
[Hi Maarten!  Thank you for answering our questions. I'm a big fan of Bingo Players work.  My 2 questions are: - How do you see the future of Electronic Music? - What is the best way to get recognition for your tracks (for up&amp;coming producers\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy6oz?context=5)|Re: future of electronic music, check out an answer i gave somewhere earlier here.  The best way to recognition is to make something unique! We get some many demo's that sound like Tsunami copy no. 2189763. Don't get me wrong, i love Tsunami. But one Tsunami is enough.
[What are your thoughts on Ghost Producing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8ol?context=5)|I don't know really... There is so much controversy about it. I just love that feeling when you make something yourself in the studio and people go crazy when you play it live! If you buy ""your"" tracks, you will never experience that feeling. :) At the other end, people have been producing tracks for other artists for decades.
[Hi Maarten,  if you had to spend the rest of your life in one city, where would it be and why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9i7?context=5)|Probably where i live now, because i have my family here!
 |But, i have a weakness for San Diego. I love the vibe over there. Tragic to hear about the big fires now...
[What do you think about the rise of dance music? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy2x9?context=5)|What happened in the last 5 years (especially in the US) is amazing! There are so many great festivals and clubs nowadays. No complaints here :)
[Hi Maarten! A big fan here as well. I've got a simple question, where can we send demo's for Hysteria Records to? The link on your website seems to link to a dead facebook app?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7i5?context=5)|Please send to demo@hysteriarecs.com  Looking forward to hear it!
[How do you see the dance music boom in the USA over the past few years effecting the rest of the world? Have you seen a change in the music? The types of people getting into producing? Has the neon color and light up culture of the USA started showing up in other places?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy869?context=5)|Actually, the whole neon thing was already big in Europe many many years ago. Don't see it anymore though! We did get trap in the clubs now! :)
[What has been the craziest thing a fan has sent to you or said? big fan by the way! keep those tunes coming :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy805?context=5)|Once there was this kid that puked in his drink and wanted me to drink from it too. That was awkward!
[What do you think is the next big sound in house music? melbourne? deep? something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7gj?context=5)|I have no idea!

[ I wanted to thank you and Paul (R.I.P.\) for being such an inspiration to me as an electronic artist!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7r0?context=5)|One of our most memorable moments was when we played Nocturnal Wonderland a few years ago. It was the first time playing for such a huge crowd. After the show we were over the moon about it.
[, I have a few questions :\)  What is your most memorable moment as a DJ/producer? When did you realize that you had made such a difference with your music? What advice would you give to brand new producers/DJs trying to start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7r0?context=5)|Like i said before here, be unique and take risks while producing. Only that way you will stand out from the rest.
[What type of toothpaste do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyap8?context=5)|I don't, i just use soap. Forgive my breath when i do a meet &amp; greet. ;)

[Which free plug ins would you recommend for a mac user?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8c8?context=5)|To be honest i don't use free plugins and never looked into it...

[Who are you favoring in Rio this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyal5?context=5)|What do you think... Hup Holland Hup! :D.

[Who is your favourite producer? What got you into electronic music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9un?context=5)|The Prodigy really got me into electronic music, the Experience album is my favorite of all time. Next to Daft Punk's Discovery.
[Hey Maarten! I've been really curious lately. What equipment do you think is most beneficial to have in a studio? What synthesizer do you use? Do you think its worth having a mastering compressor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy99w?context=5)|Actually a powerful computer and some good speakers is the basic setup. You don't really need all the extra analog gear, only if you want to reach for a specific sound. I bought a Roland Juno2 because i love the unique sound it has. Besides that, most of the i just use softsynths. Not saying analog is obsolete!
[Do you have any plans to work with Showtek? I could see a killer track! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyaud?context=5)|Not yet, but i love their stuff!!! Maybe in the future...
[Whatsup Maarten - thanks for hopping on Reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9jq?context=5)|The technique itself didn't change that much.
[How has your production technique changed since your loss of Paul?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9jq?context=5)|I do miss his feedback and ideas though.. He was great at re-arranging the tracks and thinking totally different than me. It's hard to not have that instant feedback and somebody sharing that ""eureka"" feeling when you hit a great idea!
[Why is there such a big difference between the Dutch / european crowd and the crowd overseas? To me it seems, the Americans wil jump on anything ( even a breakdown \). What is your opinion about this?  When are you playing again in your beloved homecountry ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyain?context=5)|Yes there is a difference, US crowds tend to be more loud! But, we have great crowd in Europe too. Really depends which venue/festivals you play. No plans for Holland yet!
[What do you think of the new security measures for Electric Zoo 2014?  Always Plural.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy44c?context=5)|I haven't read about it yet actually. What happened last year was very tragic...

[Miami, Ibiza or Vegas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7sa?context=5)|Love all three of them, no way to choose between them!
[Thanks for all the great tunes Maarten.  ""Cry "" was a game changer and my go-to song for that summer after it came out.  What did you think of Flo Rida capitalizing on the same sample and ending up with a more famous and much shittier song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiydbq?context=5)|Ha ha, well nothing we could do about it. At the same time, because of that version we got a lot of attention too. People started to look into our music when they heard that version.
[What was it like working with Far East Movement?  Did have any part producing the music video for rattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyg9p?context=5)|Actually during the process we never met them. It was all by email. I met them about a year later, when we played at the same festival in France.  The idea from the video came from our manager!

Would love to do some funky tunes with him!
[Good tips for writing melodies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiye5r?context=5)|Best melodies are simple and can be played on a flute. Sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Think about all the melodies you love and you'll see you can play them on any instrument without losing it's touch!
[Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA. What's your favorite moment with Paul? Much love from Norway. &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyaro?context=5)|There are many favorite moments.

[Can I ask, regarding EDM, do you think artists at the moment and in the future should look toward making new sounds all the time, or look back more to discover new (and even reuse\) amazing samples from the past (most notably the Electric 80s\)? (Also any chance appearances at Glastonbury 2014?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiya5g?context=5)|I think it's good to look to future AND listen to old stuff, it broadens your vision on music and ideas! I've been really inspired by Depeche Mode actually (hence the track ""Mode"") ;)
[What's your stance on big DJs who use ghost producers? Do you use ghost producers yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyfvp?context=5)|Answered this one earlier here. And no, we produce all our stuff on our own!
[BIg fan! I'm very sorry about your loss ;(  I have just one question:  When did you start making music, at what age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8g8?context=5)|I started making electronic music when i was 13-14. 
[Back a few years ago when Cry (Just a little\) was a huge anthem, did you ever get sick of hearing your music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy4py?context=5)|Sometimes yes, but when you play it live and people go crazy, that feeling is gone instantly!
[Hey man, really respect your work .  Curious as to what you enjoy more. Playing Night Club vs Festivals. Also Favorite Club and or Festival/year you've played.?  Thank you, and all the best for a great future !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9zj?context=5)|I love both! Clubs are more intimate and festivals are awesome for the big crowds and nice weather! Don't have a favorite club or festival, there are too many to choose from!
[Do you think you could lay down a dirty techno/minimal set if you were booked to do so/ do you take these bookings  ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyan2?context=5)|I love some techno and minimal stuff, but i don't think i could do a set, i'm too unexpierenced with that genre. Would love to try it once, maybe as a late afterparty set!
[Hi Maarten, I'm a massive fan, your remix of 'Muzik' got me into house/electro around 5 or so years ago and I was lucky enough to speak with you and Paul at a few different shows in Melbourne, Australia a few years ago.  Me and all my friends were devastated when we read about Paul and I am so sorry for your loss, we always talked about how you two were easily the nicest, most grounded music producers we had met.  My main question is how do you get your bass so tight? I've always admired how snappy your kick drums are yet they always deliver plenty of punch, which frequency do you try and get them to really shine at? How much sidechain and/or regular compression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizkme?context=5)|Wow that's an old song haha! For a good basskick well, i just use the right sounding samples. High quality samples are essential! Have to say i love the Sonic Academy plugin for this too!
 |One of the things i tend to do is pull up the volume for the kick a bit more than what people perceive as ""usual"". It sounds so simple, but that's actually what i do. No special stuff there. :) Ofcourse sidechain your bass synth with the kick.
[How did you begin producing/DJing and get into the scene? What tips do you have for an aspiring DJ/producer?  Feel free to not answer this one but how did you meet Paul?  Can't wait to see you live!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyjla?context=5)|See for producing/DJ'ing tips an answer somewhere else here. I met Paul at his home. I was attending the same school as his little brother. When i came to his home, Paul was producing music, just like me. We became friends immediately.
[What are your views on the definition between a DJ and a producer? Are they two completely different things? Or have the two terms come to mean similar things over time? Thanks in advance man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy6kr?context=5)|They are completely different, but nowadays they go hand-in-hand. As a DJ it's almost mandatory that you are a producer too today. If you would look at the most literal description of a DJ and a producer, it's so different!
[Why you decided to continue without Paul, and not delete bingoplayers for ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj1gta?context=5)|Paul and i talked about it before he passed. He told me, if i could find the strength to continue, i should do it. I want to keep the music alive. We've worked so hard where we are right now and had so many plans for the future. I want to carry on his legacy.
[Huuuge Bingo fan, thanks for taking the time to do this! 2 questions. 1\)Whose one producer you would like to collab with if given the opportunity? 2\)Will you be at EDC LV this year?

[Nocturnal Wonderland 2012 in Texas was my first rave, and Bingo Players was one of the performances our group ""had to see"". I had no clue who yall were back then, but Rattle is still to this day one of my all time favorite songs. I've been a part of the ""rave scene"" ever since, and it seems to me there's a growing divide between the different subgenres. I don't pay much attention to the gossip surrounding EDM in general, but any time I look at pictures from different DJ's during festivals I see A LOT of bickering and shit talking about this or that subgenre. Have you come across anything like this? Or am I just seeing the loud minority?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz86o?context=5)|I'm just like you, i don't pay attention to gossip and all the bs surrounding genres, people, etc. I focus on the positive side of the music, not let negative things distract me from doing what i love most.
[Hi Maarten, I'm a huge fan of early Bingo Players (You're not alone remix, When I dip, Get on the move, etc...\) Do you plan to make similar track like above mentioned in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyd6x?context=5)|Thanks! I don't know, music evolves and our sound too. Just finished a remix which sounds more like an older BP song. Stay tuned!
[I want to say I respect you, and look up to you for continuing you love for music after the tragedy that happen. I am cancer survivor and look up to you and Bingo Players music. Thank you!

I'm glad to read you've beat cancer!  The best software to produce music doesn't exist. It's all about what feels right for you. I'm currently on Ableton, but Logic, Cubase, Fruity Loops. They are all good, it's what you do with it!
[If you were not in the music industry what would you see yourself doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiydo4?context=5)|Probalby doing motion graphics/video stuff. Like i did before we started DJ'ing.
[Hey Maarten, saw you in Melle in Germany this year, it was incredible, just wanted to point that out first. My question is: Do you like the current state of EDM? Anything you'd like to change/introduce into EDM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyasz?context=5)|Great club! I love the current state of ""EDM"", it's evolving so fast and exciting things happen quickly!
[Hey Maarten, I've been following you guys since Devotion came out. Keep up the good work, now for my questions.  What happened with the whole Palladium situation the last time you were supposed to play L.A?  and any chance you'd play a classic Bingo Players set with just your old stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz7jj?context=5)|I cannot remember exactly what that was in LA? When was this? Yes, i've been thinking about doing a classic Bingo set somewhere in the future for a special occasion.
[How do you feel right before performing a show, and how does it make you feel when you hear the roaring of a crowd? Also, Are you playing in LA soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj2asj?context=5)|There's no better feeling than hearing a crowd roar! Yes, i'll be in LA end of june!
[Any chance of a return to the classic Bingo Players sound like Devotion, Disco Electrique etc? Even for just one song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizyd7?context=5)|I like to look forward and just produce what i feel at the moment.

I thought the vocal hook would sound cool when you speed it up, especially with all the disco house that was around at that time.
[Hi Marteen your tracks are the best, you think to emerge as dj, would help to do a collab? thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyhz5?context=5)|I think you are mixing up being a DJ and producer. Those go hand-in-hand today, but before doing a collab, try to evolve as a producer. If you feel a collab could give you that extra element, why not?
[Hey Maarten you guys were my first ever show at Governors Island last year, and it was amazing. Ive seen you 5 time since. Do you plan on playing in New York this summer other than at Ezoo!? thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7o7?context=5)|There are some plans, more on that later! ;)
[Do you think that any significant changes in music production will happen in the near future, and if so, how do you think they will affect how music is made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiykwo?context=5)|Yes, but music production changes so fast. I mean, if you hear the soundquality that young kids can produce nowadays, it was impossible years ago! It's great that the technique is there, but also risks that less attention will be spent on the music side of things. We'll see!
[How do you find new tracks that you love?  what outlets do you use frequently to find those tracks?

Most hardstyle producers are great engineers!

Obviously other music, but also movies, reading or just being outside.
[, you're a boss.  Second, what do you think of big EDM producers like Afrojack and Avicii producing tracks with big name pop artists? Do you see it as selling out? Do you see yourself doing any big collaboration like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizz2k?context=5)|I don't consider it as selling out. Some collabs are great, others are not. It's all about what a producer feels at a certain stage. I see myself doing a collaboration if i feel like it and the result is something i'm satisfied with! :)
[Do you think the whole festival culture is a fad that will die down? What about electronic music as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyh2x?context=5)|Nope, both will keep going. Maybe in a different form, but it won't go away!

What does it mean to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizybg?context=5)|We let a designer make a few logo's. We loved this one. It reminded us of the old acid smileys!
[Hello Maarten! What are some future colabs that we can await from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy4as?context=5)|No collabs in the making yet!
[Hi Maarten, thanks alot for this ama. I'm really sorry for your loss earlier this year. We all, (especially you\) lost a good friend.  My question is that when Bingo Players and Hysteria Records was started, it was both you and Paul doing the work together, so you guys were able to do so many things. After Paul passed, how easy or difficult has it been to produce, play the shows, manage the label, and everything else you guys did. Do you do it all yourself now, or do other people help you out in different areas?  Can't wait to see you live someday!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj211n?context=5)|When we started the label, we started small. The last year(s) it became bigger and bigger and now we're at a point that we have a A&amp;R/labelmanager running it, while i'm making the final decisions Besides that, i have a great management team that helps out a lot. 
[Congrats on your baby! How are you balancing doing shows, producing, and spending time with your family? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj0ipy?context=5)|Thank you!

[It looks like all famous DJs/Producers play an instrument since they are little (I don't know in your case\), and this give them a music background.  For someone who wants to become a producer, do you think is important to have this music background before starting to produce music? Do you think is never too late to start producing music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiylwz?context=5)|And no, i don't think you need to learn play keyboard or an instrument. Many producers can't read notes actually. It's all about if you can translate what you have in mind to an actual song. So, it's more important to learn the software and how synths/sounds work so you can put your ideas to actual songs!
[Hey Maarten! Have there been any clubs that do not allow you to smoke cigarettes while spinning? When I saw you spin at Prime in Boston, I noticed you were smoking throughout the set (if a club-goer lit up a cigarette, this would result in them getting kicked out\).. Keep up the great work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizdd4?context=5)|I try to kick the habit! Yes many clubs do not want the artist to smoke. I respect that rule and don't smoke in that case!
[Maarten! I LOVE Bingo Players and so many of the Hysteria Rec releases!  1.\) how much input and influence do you have when it comes to your show's visuals?  2.\) I agree with the other comment I saw on here that said it would be awesome to see you at Paradiso in the Pacific NW this Summer.  Do you have a preference between big festival crowds and smaller more intimate venues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz8gh?context=5)|1) We met up with the company that produced the visuals and they showed us some ideas. We immediately loved it! I travel with a great VJ to many shows. He knows what to do in each venue 2) See for answer another post i did in this thread.
[Just wanted to say Rattle is one of my favorites! I love shuffling to it. I recognize it within seconds any time someone drops it at a show.  Anyway, what do you enjoy most about travelling?

Thanks for doing this AMA and see you at Spring Awakening!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj0pb9?context=5)|The best thing about travelling is to meet people everywhere and see a lot of the world!

[Just like you, im from The Netherlands, and i sometimes got the feeling you are a bit ''underrated'' here if we compare you to other famous dj's from our country.

25o8pa,3,2014-05-15,Need advice on what certs / jobs after college,km0t,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/25o8pa/need_advice_on_what_certs_jobs_after_college/,"I just finished my junior year at my university.
I am going to be a senior next semester and I haven't gotten an internship yet.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems.
My professors are horrible at teaching and when I asked my advisor what jobs I should be looking into after graduating she just went on google and typed ""top jobs for computer science majors"" ... i was like wtf...
I can do some small java programming and i'm not really that good at programming but I was thinking maybe look for a career in IT / IT project managers(?)
I need some help looking for something that will fit my major as a career. As of right now I have no clue what to look for or what to do after my college career is over.
I honestly think it's too late for me to start learning how to program ""well"" now. I have a year left of school and I'm sure someone in high school can out-code me...


------
Should I go after certifications now? This summer I don't have an internship and will probably do some retail job to make some money. 

What should I be looking into to start a career in IT after my last year of college next year?"
25ohbi,1,2014-05-15,Is my job trying to promote me or replace me?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25ohbi/is_my_job_trying_to_promote_me_or_replace_me/,"So my team at work is as follows: 

COO: In charge of the two brands I work on, as well as a third. Is really annoying and condescending.
Account Executive: My direct supervisor. She is really awesome and we get along well. She has a ton of responsibility.
Sales Assistant 1: My coworker. He has been with the company for 2 years, and is well liked and super analytical.
Sales Assistant 2: Me. Have been with my company for a year and nine months, and am also well liked and good at my job.

Sales Assistant 1 and I approached our Account Executive over the summer about getting a raise. She told us it would probably be the industry standard of 5%, and would take some time to get approved. She was also pushing for it to be retroactive to our start dates. In February, we each found out we were getting a 15% raise that was retroactive. We mentioned wanting our titles changed as well, but that conversation was shut down. 

Which brings us to now. We also have an Analyst position open on our team, and there has been a ton of turnover within in it. The last analyst was 100% useless, and EXTREMELY well compensated. Despite the fact that she spent all day on gchat, wasn't a team player, never completed work on time, and then left us with a bunch of uncompleted projects and files that crashed, she was not let go. She left for a better position with another company after 7 months.

Her responsibilities were subsequently shifted to me and Sales Assistant 1 while they searched for her replacement. 

Anyway, last week, Sales Assistant 1 and I spoke with our Account Executive separately regarding title changes, as our jobs have grown so much. We each received different responses. I was thanked for not just turning in my two weeks notice, and instead telling her I needed a change, so we could work on it. She also said that if we left, she wouldn't be far behind us.  Sales Assistant 1 was told that if he wanted to leave, they understand, and would give him a glowing recommendation.

The 3 of us then sat down with COO. We pointed out that our titles are the same as the retail store associates, which is the total opposite of what we do. We said we were taking on a lot of work, and wanted to be involved in more meetings so that we could see a process through entirely. COO was very condescending in this meeting. He told us that it wasn't about the title, and was instead about the learning experience. He said that he wanted to narrow our jobs so that we are less involved in everything and more focused on a few tasks. We basically were like ""Well we are fine with the workload, and that isn't what we are saying, but its your choice.""

Fast forward to yesterday. Account Executive and COO went into COO's office for a long time with the door shut. When Account Executive came out, she had two pieces of paper that were folded. I got a glimpse of one and it looked like a resume. I was going into a meeting with the two of them, so told Sales Assistant 1 to take a peek at the papers.

He took a picture, and we looked at them later. They were both resumes for people who would be qualified to take our jobs WHEN WE WERE HIRED. They couldn't do our jobs now. For example, 1 resume was a girl who had worked at a major brand for 5 months, and had clearly been let go, since she was no longer there and on the job hunt. The other resume was a former intern that was really great. 

Account Executive let us know later that day that our conversation last week was not forgotten, and that we would all chat about it again Friday (tomorrow). We asked if it was going to be a good conversation or a bad one, and she wouldn't say. Then today, we said we were worried about it, and would like a heads up as to the conversation. She said not to be worried, but that was all she could say.

Just today, I completed a 500k package for a client and our global headquarters, and both COO and Account Executive said it was amazing. Sales Assistant 1 built a report for both of us that will streamline a major part of our job, without being asked. Account Executive e-mailed us each individually to praise us on our wonderful performance.

What is going on?? Thanks reddit jobs!

25ooqm,1,2014-05-15,Reaction to lowball job offer? Advice needed.,CEjobseeker,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25ooqm/reaction_to_lowball_job_offer_advice_needed/,"Background: Recent MS in Civil Engineering - Environmental Focus - 2+ years relevant internship experience

I received a job offer today for a part time (~25 hrs) ""Supplemental Engineer I"" position for a local city government. City population about 60,000. They offered $18/hr, which made me balk a bit. No benefits and the position is funded until the end of 2014, but I cannot exceed 1040 hours total in a year. I told them I was expecting a bit more, closer to $25/hr as I had been earning $18ish at previous internships. There was no further negotiation attempt on their end and I told them I need about a week to decide, and that I am going to continue interviewing for a couple other positions.


This seems like a pretty lowball offer to me, there isn't a lot of data available but my research seems to show that something closer to $25/hr would be more fair. With 600/mo rent, student loans etc. their offer would leave me with a pretty tight budget.


The type of work is what I have been looking for (water resources/environmental) which makes it tough to react this way.


I have two more interviews this week for full time consulting firm positions, but I still don't want to reject this offer because I may not get offered these other positions. Did I react appropriately?"

Obviously these are all good ideas, but which is the ""Most impressive""?

On a side note, I live in the area of NYC and was wondering if anyone knows of any Engineering firms, or companies, that would like to hire an electrical engineering intern for the summer, or might want to for next summer? I also program in java, so any firm that would do that would be awesome as well. Just names, so I know who to talk to next year!

[I block and delete cookies. I use ghostery. I add new fonts to my browser. I uninstall and reinstall my browser periodically. Sometimes I use TOR although it's a pain. When i can, I get my isp to change the IP. What else can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjf6jv?context=5)|First of all, not all cookies are bad. Some are simply helpful.
 |For example Gmail will remember who you are so you don't need to enter your details again.
 |In my opinion, you area already quite a bit. In terms of being more secure, deleting your cookies is a great start. TOR will make it even better. Changing your ISP will only mean that your IP address change to a different range for a small period of time.
 |However the industry recognises that the reliability of cookies is diminishing.  This is due to people using multiple devices, deleting their cookies, browsers not accepting cookies, automated cookie flushing etc.
 |So as cookies becomes less reliable, what can the profession do? Develop 'finger-printing' techniques that will identify the user to good accuracy. A company called Experian is doing a lot of work in this front.
 |With the fingerprinting techniques, only using TOR will help. 
[The EFF has a site that checks your browser fingerprint for you and tells you if you are unique or not. I go there every month or so, and usually mine is new and unique. I interpret this to mean that I have made sufficient changes in the month so that I won't be uniquely identified as the same user who tested it last month. Is that the right way to look at the result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfi8s?context=5)|So this is the type of finger printing that Experian are trying to develop but remember, they have a live database so you will need to change your browser details, ISP fairly regularly for them to loose track.
 |Or use TOR. 
[I alternate browsers. TOR is a bit slower and kind of clunky in my experience. My object is to make it more difficult to create a complete picture of my web activity. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfqe0?context=5)|Remember, we can't, don't and never identify individuals.
 |Everything is aggregated, and more than likely sampled depending on the site you visit. 
[Somebody out there is tracking individuals. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfy8p?context=5)|However the pregnant lady may search for prams or cots, in which there is an ad network that will serve targeted ads across websites using third party cookies. You can opt out of this fairly easily.
[How does one get started in the field of web analysis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjghlw?context=5)|I got into it at a very early stage and I'm usually working for very large companies so we would usually get A LOT of CVs from people wanting to work in a field they don't really know about.
 |That's fine because no one really knows what they want to do whey they first finish uni but they way we go through CVs is literally quite cruel.
 |Any smallest mistake, we would disregard. Why? Because all the CVs look the same and most people have similar experiences.
 |You may want to learn about Google Analytics, as most smaller companies use that. Also look at Omniture, Webtrends or comScore.
 |Don't be afraid to test your own tagging by setting up your own small website and put Google Analytics on it, and use a plug-in in Firefox called Httpfox to track if your GA tags are firing through. You should be able to see the figures in GA.
 |Lastly become a ninja in Excel. I can't stress this enough. Learn vlookup, offset, match, pivot tables and know them well.

[What's the most interesting part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjg06e?context=5)|Looking at how customers respond to different website changes, conversion rates and how the industry will move with the uptake of technology.
 |The industry is heavily trying to shift from a browser view to a user view so we will understand users that shift from an iPad to their browser or browser to a different browser on the computer. This part of innivation I'm very interest in.
 |I'm also very excited in linking up several databases. So for example, if we know that we've served you an ad and we also know your loyalty card details for Walmart, and a week later - you made a purchase for the product in Walmart, we will be able to do some amazing conversion analysis on that. 
[What was your best salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjggv9?context=5)|At around $150k USD. 
[By which I mean, at a certain point up until about five years ago, it seemed like the user experience was the focus of a lot of design development, and websites &amp; mobile interaction were developing in a direction of greater, more intuitive ease of interaction. I'm talking about page design, content delivery, indexing &amp; search services, etc.  That process seems to have largely stopped. Just my layman's opinion of course, but for example Facebook's ""timeline"" style seems extremely clunky to navigate, with a lot of counterintuitive features that make it hard to find anything specific you might be looking for. Facebook seems designed for a passive experience, channeling its users like cattle towards currently ""trending"" items of interest and cutting off user-directed search &amp; exploration. Netflix refuses to simply index their list of titles, instead forcing everything into duplicative categories, so that you'll see the same title a dozen times if you're browsing (You'll see *Aliens* again and again under scifi, thriller, action-adventure, award-winning films, etc.\). Obviously Netflix is trying to hide a lack of variety and make it appear their slate of titles is deeper than it really is. Youtube has become a virtual warzone of copyright infringement, so that thousands of videos disappear every day: 6-7 years ago it was an archive of everything in the universe, and now it's like a rotating news site where links die by the trainload overnight and you can't count on anything being there tomorrow. Google's search engine is infested with paid rankings, user profiling and other commercial &amp; legal distortions that make it far less useful and all-encompassing than it once was.  In other words, utility no longer seems to be driving web development &amp; user experience. Commerce, web marketing, legal challenges, new platform development (i.e. mobile phones &amp; touchpads\) and social engineering seem to have infested the entire system, seriously degrading the basic function of providing useful information to end users. Rather than increasing the end-user's access to information, it seems like today's web development seeks to limit and channel users into a far more passive experience.  I should add that this isn't a *new* style of web development: America Online was a Potemkin village from the beginning, designed to fool naive web users into thinking they were on the internet while herding them through transaction points like cattle. I guess I'm saying the entire web seems to be turning into America Online.  What's your view on this trend? Do you agree with me that things are deteriorating or do you see more positive developments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjgkhv?context=5)|I have to disagree with you there as a lot of what I do is to **improve** user experience.  It is very rarely (never) that an ad sales director would come to our team saying they want more clicks on certain ad sales and how we can optimise that. Not in the companies I've worked for anyway.
 |In fact, I work very closely with the UI team and also product team to drive a better product experience.  I know a few companies that would, Facebook for example is one of them and Dailymail (UK) also optimised their sites for an ad-driven revenue model.

However if it's a ecommerce site, and the change to increase ad space screws up the conversion rate. It will never be approved.  A change in 0.5% of conversion rate for a multi million dollar company is a lot of loss revenue.

( fresh out of college with a I.T degree, 1 internship under belt, 6/7 months help desk experience from work, experience with computer sales; SQL/Java?Python/Linux/Networking and Pen-testing tool classes from college).



Now, they have called back and want an on-site interview next week. 
The title of the job is : ""**Technical Product Support** (level 1) ""..................but I have no idea what to expect for such an interview as it is probably not similar to the IT Helpdesk/ Jr. Sysadmin positions I have been applying for so far.

The job requirements are a combination of some of these tasks:

1. Sales support

2. A HelpDesk position ( Remote and local Support)

3. A QA-Tester Position

4. Technical Integrations services tied to Database/Linux 

5. Customer Management and provide training 

I have enough experience and knowledge in each of them, but I have never seen a position before where all of these are required. Doing a Google search didn't turn up anything too solid for the preparation of the interview.  - I could just go over the topics that I listed above, but I am getting pretty nervous because I have not faced an interview like this before. Could someone here tell me what I should expect. 


- Also, it does not matter too much me, but, how much does someone in a position like this make ? 

Hope someone can answer my questions...it really will help clear things up for me."

I have one more semester at college needed to get my engineering degree. I used some connections to get an engineering consultant job nearby.

In fact I'm headed out of the country next week. 

While signing the contract I found there was no end-date. Is this some sort of tactic to get me to stay after I graduate? The pay is amazing for a cheme intern (32/hr) but I honestly want to make more when I graduate. If I get trapped here with some sort of non-compete I would be unhappy.

I plan to ride the wave and get as much experience as I can but I need to know if they are trying to trap me. Any advice? Have you been in this situation?"

Things are starting to look up a little bit for me though. I interned at a community based recovery center during my last semester in college. A lot of what I did was just hanging out with the members, listening to their struggles with substance abuse recovery, and offer any advice if they asked for it. I also spent time helping members find and apply for work, as well as get involved in any of the community help programs in the area. 

I loved what I did at my internship, it felt like I actually made a difference every day. On a lark I applied for case manager position at a homeless shelter for teenagers, it seemed similar to what I did at my internship and like something I would be interested in making a career out of. My resume was sent out yesterday afternoon, and today I received a phone call where I had the position explained to me fully and an interview set up for this coming Monday. 

The weird thing is, I feel completely unqualified for this position. I'm only 21 and fresh out of college, I almost feel like I don't have enough life experience to help these kids out. Does anyone have experience interviewing with a non-profit like a teen homeless shelter? Any advice on how to go into the interview and what kind of questions to be prepared for?

In October, I got hired at an engineering and research center to be a student sysadmin. Essentially, I serve as help desk support while also learning how to be a sysadmin and gaining real world work experience. It's equivalent in my mind to an internship. 

Anyways, I got hired to be a Windows admin as well as a Mac admin. I said on my application and in my interview that I had almost no real experience working with Macs but that I'd be willing to learn and use the system.

Fast-forward to now, and I'm comfortable efficient using my iMac and I think I may resolve more support tickets on the Mac side than on the Windows side. A problem with the macs in our building, however, is that the user accounts don't run on our Windows Active Directory, but our Unix and Windows accounts do. What that means is that every user's Mac is configured with local accounts, and that includes administrator and root accounts.

When we change our admin passwords, the Mac computers hardly ever get changed because we have to do them all individually. Which means that when I'm trying to remotely connect to a machine, I sometimes have to use admin passwords that were in effect before I was even hired. We've gone through three admin passwords in that time because of changing employees and the Heartbleed vulnerability. So our Mac machines are operating on at least 4 different admin passwords, which is a fairly large security risk.

I brought this up to my superiors and they suggested that a good summer project for me would be to create a shell script that goes to each Mac and checks the password for root and admin, and updates it if necessary. 

BUT, I don't know the first thing about shell scripting. My only experience using unix commands have been through the Mac terminal since I've been hired. Eventually, I'll probably be getting a job as a sysadmin after I graduate to support myself before I go to grad school, and so I'd really like to learn as much about the field as I can in the time that I have left here.

Does anyone know of any good online resources where I can learn more about shell scripting and unix in general?"

I'm looking to sublease a spot in an apartment for the dates specified in the title. I am an undergraduate student at UCLA, but I have an internship in La Jolla this summer. 

A little about me: I'm a pretty easy going guy, I love the beach and outdoors, skateboarding, cycling, and just overall having fun. I will be working from 7 AM - 3 PM, and sleeping from like 11 PM - 6 AM, so I am not looking for a place where other apartment mates will be raging constantly. I would like a relatively quiet place since I'll pretty much only be there while sleeping (I'll most likely be gone from the apt. 6:30 AM - 7 PM). I prefer a single, but am open to sharing a room as well. If you have a place, please reply here or PM me and I will give you my number so that we can meet up. I am going to be in La Jolla this Saturday, so it would be ideal if I could come by the apt and check it out then.

Thanks!"
25r1v8,172,2014-05-16,One File to Ruin Them All,UristMcStarblazer,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/25r1v8/one_file_to_ruin_them_all/,"I finally had it.  The coveted ""Senior"" title...Clawed from the grasping arms of stubborn tickets, sleepless nights and weeks well over 40 hours.  And not an extra penny in sight.  Though in retrospect that was probably a good thing, I'll save the story of the SD Card Piggy Bank for later.  After my promotion I had to ~~plunder~~ falsify my operations budget just to pay for new business cards.  Needless to say I didn't have one of those engraved name plates hanging on my office door.  I didnt have a door.  Or an office.  But from my cube I proudly updated my e-mail signature and continued to do the same work I had been doing for the past three years.

Fast forward nine months, the owners wife is about to pop, and the assistance from upper management that had been keeping my head afloat has been strategically reassigned to babymania.  At least my *nix kung-fu will save me from ever having to worry about that particular problem...But I digress.  The time has come to bring balance to the e-mail signatures.  We hired some Jrs.  Applications came from all corners of the city, interns and hipsters and retirees looking to make some extra money doing what they've always done, since computers haven't changed much since the mainframe and punch card days, amirite?  With all the power and glory vested in me by my Senior e-mail signature, I was excluded entirely from the hiring process.  My PFY's were foisted upon me to be managed, trained, or some combination thereof.  

The hipster wasn't so bad; anyone whom shares a flat with an ambitious baker and proceeds to bring the bountiful excess shall have a place in my cube farm.  For I am a magnanimous Senior Network Engineer, a fact I remind the hipster of only *six* times per day.  

The intern was eager.  To sit on facebook and pinterest, but in her defense googled every acronym she didnt understand.  And just as quickly shared her new found knowledge of the mysterious Server Sanctum Sanctorum with her twitter followers.  

The elder PFY could disassemble and reassemble a printer faster than any hands I had ever seen.  Though his coffee tumbler trembled as he sipped, the temblors of his liver spotted hands quieted when pinching a screwdriver between thumb and wrinkled index finger, and he became a surgeon on an anti-static operating table.  Him.  Him I liked.  He brought a bottle of whiskey in his briefcase at the end of his first week and tucked it quietly away behind the Great Wall of three-ring binders that enshrined his ancient knowledge.  He never opened them.  I suppose proximity alone was enough to convey their mysteries to him.

Which brings our story to the Great Nepotini.  Nepotini was a wiry, middle-aged man with wild hair and a penchant for plaid button-downs.  He was an architect by trade, but somehow landed the cube by the window on the other side of the office...Far from my governing eye.  He was not cowed by the bold formatting or helvetica typeface of my e-mail signature.  He did not partake of the nigh daily vegan scones, no-bake brownie bars, organic lemon cookies or whatever other peace offering the hipster had ported to the office in his environmentally friendly cookware, as if to apologize for his near total absence of technical acumen.  He didnt follow the interns twitter feed, or whatever the equivalent of pinning ones interest is.  As near as I could tell he didnt really do much of anything.  He sank par for my PFY putt-putt course, and was somehow connected to the great baby event of they who sign my paycheck, so he stayed and collected his twice monthly monies with the rest of us.  Except intern, that is.

Between the long weeks, sleepless nights, and endless tickets, we formalized some informal training hours.  Tickets became learning opportunities, irate clients had to be escalated through the ranks before my Senior title could grace the communique.  We were doing it.  We were making it work.  Even Nepotini found a niche - He could buy time.  Priority one, system down?  Well I guess another few hours is OK...

My PFY's, bless their kernel organs, began to work tickets autonomously.  For the first time in years I wasnt answering calls from panicked clients in the wee hours, just from my Jr. Engineers.  Well at least I'm consolidating, thats a thing people with Senior in their signature block do, right?  Consolidate?

Autonomy comes with a price though, and this one was steep.  One of the law offices we supported rang in a ticket asking to have a single file restored to their data drive.  Their ""server"" was a beefy workstation with dual 500GB drives, one for the OS and programs, and another for all their files and data.  Accounting databases, the repository for some legal discovery software, case files, you know just the life and blood of their firm.  Living in the shell of an old gaming rig re-purposed to run server 2k3.

The lone rack-mount 2U SERVER served as their onsite backup, taking deltas of the ""server"" drives and the few workstations on a regular basis.  The software it ran had a pretty slick interface for managing roll-ups, restoring a whole disk, or mounting as a .VHD so a server could be spun up in Hyper-V within a matter of minutes should the ""server"" suddenly find itself on the wrong end of functional.

The request was simple, just needed one file restored, and with that the lawyer client goes out for lunch and says to e-mail him its done.  Lowish priority, easy enough.  Surely the PFY's can read the meticulous documentation I had assembled just for this client.  But it wasnt to be so.  Nepotini takes the ticket and quickly fires off the restore.  

It was a few hours later, having just returned from lunch myself when I decided it would be good to review the queue and see where things stood for the afternoon.  Lawyer client had pinged the queue with a new ticket asking what was taking so long with his first ticket.  Nepotini had updated the work log, ""the restore is still running, looks like a few more minutes until its complete.""  Certainly a single office document couldnt take hours to restore, perhaps there was something wrong with the backup SERVER.  With a sinking feeling, I logged in, I saw, I cringed.  

Horror, oh the horror.  

DISK0 (C:\) restore, target DISK1 (E:\), -secureformat -purgepartitiontable:yes, -wrboot:replace.  

The restore hadn't even started, it was still on its third pass of random writing to the drive to ""securely"" erase it, which meant that even if I stopped it now I'd still need to zero the drive to make sure skynet didn't become self aware in the random 1/s and 0/s and then restore some 300Gb of data.  The tiny, annoying kind of data that is only 1k in size but actually 8MB on disk because some idiot before me set the block size to Derp.

From that day forward The Great Nepotini was no longer a domain administrator, ticket reviewer, or hunt group agent for inbound calls.  He did, however, buy more time with lawyer client.  I do feel bad attributing that small boon to him when four out of five days the lawyer client was an office of one.  Who played 18 holes of golf and organized legal lunchons the Hobbit folk would be jealous of.

The Elder and I sipped whiskey as we watched skynet be slowly overwritten with the cacophony of legalese.

25rbza,0,2014-05-16,Would a few years experience in a non-related field be more beneficial than a MS in aerospace if I eventually want to work in aerospace?,sts816,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25rbza/would_a_few_years_experience_in_a_nonrelated/,"I'm sure you guys know the story by now. Naive fresh grad still wants to work in aerospace even though he knows its a really tough industry to break into. He can't get a job so he's considering grad school yada yada yada. I'm talking to a few companies at the moment about possible jobs but none of them do aerospace stuff specifically. One is manufacturing at a tire production plant, another is mechatronics position and neither are in my ideal location. A kind of rule of thumb I try to follow when I apply for jobs is pick 2 of the following 3: location, interesting work, or good pay. I can't really tell about the pay thing so I just focus on location and interesting work. Might have to drop that down to one....Anyway, my point is all the jobs (which is all of like 3 out of 150) I hear anything about after I apply don't have either location or interesting work. Its *very* hard for me to motivate myself to work on something I'm not interested in (learned that in school) so I'm hesitant to apply for many jobs outside of aerospace. Part of wants to hold out for a job in aerospace but the other part of me simply wants to move on with my life and get anything to start making some money. All of my friends are starting jobs, buying houses, getting married and here I am wasting away in my mom's house. 

I'm torn between just taking the first job I can get and hoping to change to aerospace down the road or diving head first into grad school. My plan for grad school would be do dive head first in networking, conferences, clubs, research or anything else I could to try to get a good internship. I did not fully take of advantage of the opportunities I had in undergrad and I'm hoping grad school might be what undergrad should have been. 

A personal side note about myself that may or may not be related: I've noticed that I tend to take ""the path of least resistance"" through life. I subconsciously stay at my lowest possible energy level and I've only begun to notice it recently (hell of a lot of time to think about things when you're unemployed). I fear that taking any job I can find is just continuing down that road and then bam! I'm 40, fucking hate my job and wishing I had pursued my dreams when I was younger. But....like I said, I need to do something. I can't just keep sitting around on my ass with my thumbs up my butt hoping that the clouds part, a hiring manager from Lockheed descends down in a beam of light and hands me an offer. "

25rpmk,12,2014-05-17,I think I got into the wrong field.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/25rpmk/i_think_i_got_into_the_wrong_field/,"You hear about it all the time - I'm sure some of you even think about it when the word 'scientist' first appears in your mind - those evil people who do experiments on people as they shield the world from their unethical practices. When I became an intern at the laboratory after I graduated school for chemistry, they promised me months of learning and experimenting and generally understanding how cool of a job this was, but also how big of a duty it was too. The lab preached its new and amazing breakthroughs in the world of stem cell therapy and how its success was only around the corner. 

However, in a short time's notice, I realized that this was not the job for me. Most of the time, I became the lab's cleaning bitch. I was the youngest on the ""team"" that they made sure to never allow me to feel a part of after I was working there a week, cleaning up messes left on tables, sorting through papers. I found I was never getting my hands dirty, never assisting any of the scientists in their work, and they would shoo me away from their break time conversation as if I hadn't just completed gradate school and worked my ass off to get where they now were. Almost fed up to my head in this shit, I nearly quit. But one day the other intern, Nicole, approached me after being extremely quiet and under-the-radar for months. 

""You really need to understand what's going on here."" 

Her words shook me to the core. I'm from Pennsylvania and I'm not sure if any of you know this, but Pennsylvania is known at least by its residents for being sort of uptight, known for its small communities where everyone knew everyone and everything, known for being less than exciting on a scale that people from other states could never understand. I suppose that's why I stuck to Nicole like a giddy elementary-schooler when she explained to me that we would be exploring the facility. Since she was so small and was able to sneak around and make it look like she was doing what she was supposed to be doing, she was able to get away with shit like this. When our lab mates were very busy and we had a moment of downtime where we could sneak away, she would show me the halls and all the rooms where they would conduct research that seemed to be nothing involving stem cell research. 

There was a room at the end of the restricted halls with one-way mirrors, where a small and sad child sat inside. 

One day, my lab mates thought that I had left an hour prior but I was actually sitting inside one of the bathroom stalls and decided that I was going to do some wandering after-hours before I resigned from this fuck-job of a place.

I wandered back into the dirty, seemingly abandoned hallway of the giant laboratory, renowned for its amazing research, where this crusty little child sat hunched over, malnourished and frowning, barely awake. I knocked on the glass to get his attention and his mouth opened to the point where he would have shown fangs if he were some feral animal, but he only had three teeth despite the fact that he was of elementary school age. He was completely void of clothing and covered himself at the sound of knocking.

I peeked my head inside the room and when I noticed he had his eyes on me but didn't move an inch, I flicked on the lights to a bright room and closed the door behind me. I inched closer to him until I was about three feet away from this small child who could have been the spawn of Satan for all my fearless mind knew.

""Who are you? What have they been doing with you?""

I expected him to stay cowering in fear in the corner, but he lowered his face to the ground and said, ""I just want to go home. My parents aren't taking good care of me and I'm hungry. Can I leave?""

""How…long have you been here?"" I asked him. 

""I'm not sure anymore,"" his small voice came, trembling.

""Well, we're leaving."" 

Working quickly and planning the escape in my mind, knowing we would be stopping at the police station and needing to go undetected, I inched closer until I could grab the child's hand but he reared away from me like I had some sickness. ""You can't touch.""

We walked down the corridors as I attempted to shuffle him along as quickly as possible, promising him freedom. The place was completely black and security had never existed on the grounds so it was quite easy to make our escape. We broke through the doors and headed out into the cold of the night, success on my brain. I was the guy at the laboratory who discovered the sick child being used as some disgusting thing to experiment on. Who knows what they had been doing to him there, how long he would have lived if I wouldn't have found him. And the thought came into my mind for a flash of a second - this is not the life I wanted. My experience thus far had led to exhaustion, mistreatment, and now I discovered that the people I worked with were lying maniacs. I wondered if this is what my entire field was about but then one thing came back into mind. I only heard my footsteps pounding as I ran down the street.

I turned around and the child was gone. I spent two hours searching for him on the streets and calling out for him before I went home.

I never showed up at work again, but a voicemail was left on my machine the next morning from the boss who oversees all of the interns at the laboratory.

""It's fine that you decided to take upon yourself to do a good deed, but I just wanted to bring it to your attention that you left something very evil out of this lab. Watch the news over the next few weeks and take note of the fact that death tolls will undoubtedly be rising. Abel was our prime undercover experiment, a child who kills everything he touches in a moment's time. We assure you that we will be doing our best to retrieve the test subject that you released onto the world. Just be assured that even if he didn't hurt you the first time, you may meet him down the line if you aren't careful - he knows your face now.""

I never called back and moved out of the state weeks later.

I came here to share a short story that problably happened to some of you. Surely I hope not, but come on guys, we're not that lucky.

Quick background: IT head from local government. I have 3 people under my wing: 2 interns and a tech. I too handle some tickets, this was the last one from yesterday:

- Hello, IT. chrisnasc here, what seems to be the problem?

Guy: - Hi, I'm $someguy from $somedept. I am having trouble updating my system.

- OK. Your #dept does not have internet connection, so let me know what you did so far...

Guy: - Clicked ""install"" and next &gt; next &gt; next...

- Good, then what?

Guy: - Then it asked me to restart the machine.

- Yeah, unfortunatly it's necessary. And?

Guy: - I did, but it didn't worked.

- What happened?

Guy: - The screen turned black while I restarted but the system does not work.

- Weird. Can you please try to reinstall now?

Guy: - OK. *click* *click* *click* *click*. Now it's asking to restart.

- Do it.

Guy: - Done.

- What?

Guy: - Done.

- Already?

Guy: - Yeah.

- But sir, the restart process takes a little longer than 3 seconds.

Guy: - Not here.

- How?

Guy: - It's restarted. The system doesn't work.

- I'm coming down.

So I pick up my car, drive about 30 minutes and go to #dept to see this wonder machine. I see only a regular, 15-year-old machine struggling with windows XP, running as loud as an F-15 Eagle.

- Could you reisntall so I can see?

He did. I saw. I did not believed. To this particular user, since the machine turns off the video input while is restarting, and since the machine took about 3 MINUTES to boot up properly, he tried to *trick* the machine into thinking it was restarted... by turning the MONITOR off and on again.



**TL;DR: hurr durr I tricked the machine by blinding it a little!** "

It was spring in our fair city, and three of the four windows our squat, square office owned looked out over the blossoming merriment below.  The general queue was marked either *in progress* or *awaiting customer feedback*, and my PFY's busied themselves playing in the gentle ebb and flow of the springtime ticket tides.  I realized then that for Intern and Hipster, it was still a game.  They were being paid to use the technology they grew up with.  Rewarded for second nature; much the same way Baby must have been showered with affection each time he ate, pooped, or continued to breathe.  Baby was also probably paid better.

With season tickets to Babymania, Owner and his lady wife projected a distinct aura of absence, bordering on outright abandonment.  

I never told the Boss about The Great Nepotini's brief experience with the art of data restoration.  Of course, I never told the Lawyer Client what happened either.  Nepotism and Lawyers are two forces of (human)nature I have no desire to involve myself with more than absolutely necessary.  I'm not sure if Nepotini expected me not to tell, or genuinely didn’t care.  His demeanor was reflectant of status-quo.  In the end though, The Lawyer Client hadnt actually done any work since our last snapshot and I used the opportunity to show the Elder how to mount a .VHD and some symlink magic with file shares.  All was well in his world when he finally returned to his office.  If he ever returned to his office.  I removed the work-hours on the ticket from Nepotini, added them to Elder, and tidied up the symlink shuffle later that evening.

""Our website could really use some work.""  Nepotini had made the trek and rounded the corner of my cube.

""That's really the Owners Lady Wifes' territory, she usually handles marketing and advertising.""  I was sure those two words were in her signature block somewhere, when she didn’t simply sign -Her Initials.

""She said to check with you.""  Oh, Nepotini, thou art truly worthy of thy name.  

It was the perfect storm, the faces of my other PFYs began to appear over the low walls of our modest agri-cube zone, voicing their agreement that our website looked as if it had been generated by one of those ""host your website tonight!"" schemes.  

An e-mail alert was hovering low on my desktop.

It was electric, Hipster and  Intern were gnashing at the bit for an opportunity to express themselves creatively, and there just wasn’t enough work in the queue to avert their attention.  Like a stubborn garden weed, this project spread its roots in all directions.  I looked about the faces that had sprouted from their cubes.  Evidently the conversation had continued without me and now they were waiting for me to say something.  I glanced back at my desktop.  The notification from Owner had long since faded.  It was late afternoon.  I wondered how quickly I might spread that sample of Cryptolocker I had saved.  No...They were looking to me for leadership, eyes full of hope.  We needed supplies.

I stood, I spoke.  ""Elder, order up a pizza and then head down to the liquor store and get a case of beer.  Intern, go check and see if the downstairs conference room is in use - The one with the projector.  Hipster, Nepotini, you're on research.  Get a laptop and find some other websites we can use for inspiration.  Brainstorm meeting in one hour.""

It was as if I'd sounded a battle charge, PFY's moving in all directions.  The hairs on my neck tingled, but not from the electric atmosphere, from a coldness that had suddenly washed over my shoulders.  Nepotini and I locked eyes.  I gave him a Senior Nod and broke the gaze, sitting back down.  Sheltered behind the grey walls of my cube, I shivered.  The cogs that turned The Great Nepotini were in motion.

Three of the four windows looked out over the city, bright with the creativity that spring inspires.  The fourth window framed dark storm clouds on the horizon, billowing towards us...

25ts8y,5,2014-05-17,Negotiation tactics,OfferConfused,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25ts8y/negotiation_tactics/,"I have been interning with a company since late last year, working part time while I am at school. They've been paying me pretty good money for an internship.

We started negotiation for permanent employment after I graduate some time ago, and we agreed on a (small) moving stipend, plus wages equivalent to low starting wages in the area where I was moving. We were pretty firm on that for some time, and were discussing specifics.

Over the past week, they've suddenly said that they do not want me to move, that all previous negotiations are off the table, and will allow me to telecommute at a huge salary cut. The new salary represents about a 20-25% cut to the starting CS salaries where I am.

However, the problem comes about due to me graduating in two weeks. I've turned down all interview offers/existing offers due to my negotiations with them, and I don't really have time to find any alternative offers before I graduate.

I'm trying to find out my options and what people here would recommend I do."
25u9v7,0,2014-05-18,[Question] What sort of college degree should I get?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/25u9v7/question_what_sort_of_college_degree_should_i_get/,"Hello,

I'm considering a career in system administration. I'm graduating out of highschool in several years, so I guess it's an appropriate time to start considering college plans.

I currently have two years of experience as an ""apprentice technician"" at a technology firm. (it was a fairly catch-all place. They did computer repair, web apps, websites, and provided internet to a handful of clients.)
I also recently started as an intern for a fairly large web design company (they host around 2000 websites). However, my boss offered me the spot as junior system administrator and of course, I took it and I took the rise that came with it ;)

With all that being said, from my experience in the field and the general consensus of my colleagues, most people think it is unnecessary to get a college degrees now. However, I feel it would be gambling quite a lot to decide not to get any college experience and hope for the best. I can only see college helping me in the future. So, hopefully we can bypass the discussion as to whether or not I *should* get a degree, and focus on which studies I should focus on.

So, I enjoy the scientific side of computers, however, a degree in computer science doesn't seem to be a perfect fit for sysadmins. Are there certain schools known for good courses focused on the skills of sysadmins. With that being said, what are some prestigious schools that a sysadmin could attend?"

I'm a student who manages an IT department of six at a university. I'm leaving for an internship out of state in about a week, and I'm trying to write a manual documenting the processes/tasks that we do around the office. I'm currently using Latex for the typesetting because it looks a whole ton better than Word and have broken it into the following sections:

* Introduction/Conventions
* Description of Spaces/Equipment
* User Classes
* Printing (PaperCut and General Printer Repair)
* Network Operations (Active Directory, etc.)
* Common Tasks/Maintenance Scripts (including source with comments)
* Computer Imaging (How to build, install and connect a computer to the domain)
* Multimedia Setups (projectors, mobile carts, how to use our A/V equipment
* Workflow and Communications
* Policies &amp; HR Guidelines/Chain of Command
* Helpful Notes/Links

Is there anything else I should add, or any sort of other method/format I should be using? My colleagues don't have much formal IT experience, but are decent problem solvers.

Thanks for all your help.

I am a guy who goes to top school (MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Caltech, take your pick but I go to one of the schools) and have been majoring in Biology but I have started taking CS classes and was doing pretty badly.

I have finished taking 2 years off due to some personal issues and it's been a year I have been back. I am a senior, majoring in Biology. I have worked in 3 different med school labs, got 2 publications out, but I am trying to take more CS courses and have not been doing well. Currently I am thinking about taking bunch of summer courses and getting my GPA up. So far, I have taken 2 courses(2.3 GPA), am currently taking 2 courses, and will be taking possibly 3 courses. 

My major GPA is 3.4 and I feel horrible about myself because no matter how hard I tried, I would never do better than 0.5 STDEV + Mean. I was further discouraged by the fact that no matter what I do for Biology and think about going for Bio PhD, I would be doing the same thing for over 12 years even before becoming a professor . Plus, more and more fields in Biology started requiring computation-heavy data analysis, and I was ever wondering if my doing masters in CS could help.

Because I got back to school at the end of my junior year after 2 year hiatus, I virtually know no one and I could not get help from friends when I needed. That really affected my performance and further hurt my confidence. Now, I avoid coding and am horrified to just graduate and have no job whatsoever. 

I am taking algorithms, probability theory, and linear algebra now, and have taken C++ programming and discrete mathematics. I hope to take C programming class and database class and do well in them, but I was wondering if people like me could just start searching for a summer internship (part-time). My school has masters program that admits current undergraduate, and I need to boost my GPA for that as well, but now I feel like I am a failure."

25uitk,0,2014-05-18,Should I bother trying to transfer?,throwawaycstransfer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25uitk/should_i_bother_trying_to_transfer/,"Hi all, been lurking this sub for a couple weeks and everyone seems to be extremely helpful and friendly so I figured I'd ask a question that I've been thinking about for several months now. 

I just finished my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh, which is a state school in Pennsylvania. It's a decent school, but its computer science program isn't exactly very prestigious, unlike that of Carnegie Mellon's or MIT's. Out of high school my stats were OK but not exactly stellar, but since starting college I have been trying harder and have been more involved; I finished up second semester with a 3.65 cumulative GPA while taking mostly CS, natural science, and calculus courses, did bioinformatics research in the spring, and will be starting a research internship at the university's children's hospital in a couple weeks where I will also probably be doing bioinformatics work. 

So what I'm wondering is if it would be worth trying to transfer out and attend a school with a more prestigious CS program, with the intent of going into industry after graduation. I don't really want to up-and-move to a ""random"" location where I don't know anybody and I don't know the area, since coming to Pitt from high school was kind of rough the first couple months, what with getting to know people, and now I feel like I'm starting to settle in with people I would like to continue to be friends with, and so I would really not prefer to do that again. So the only two schools I've been seriously considering applying to are Carnegie Mellon and Cornell, since Carnegie Mellon is literally 10 minutes walking from Pitt's campus, and my brother and several friends attend Cornell. Both of these schools are obviously fairly prestigious with acclaimed CS programs, and consequently have extremely competitive admissions -- while my current GPA and other credentials are better than they were in high school, they are still by no means stellar and I doubt I would get into either one as a CS major. So if I were to transfer, I would apply as an Information Systems/Science major, since at both schools the acceptance rate for IS majors compared to CS majors is a good deal higher. From what I understand, the curriculum for IS and CS programs are fairly similar early on, and then later diverge, with IS being more business and Internet-related. So if I were to transfer and get in to either school after my sophomore year, I would be taking slightly different classes than a CS major, but if I didn't like it I could try to transfer into the CS school.

People often tell me that it doesn't really matter a whole ton where you go for undergraduate, as long as you do well. I'm fairly certain I will have managed at least a 3.5 from Pitt by the time I graduate, and would probably only have at least a 3.0 from Cornell or CMU, so I think those would seem fairly similar to a recruiter. The main thing I'm concerned about is work after my first job, since by then it seems that employers often disregard GPA and look more at just the school, where Cornell or CMU would look more impressive than Pitt. So if I graduate from Pitt with a BS in CS, I would probably look to attend graduate school at a more impressive/prestigious university with a more acclaimed CS program, ie. CMU, Cornell, MIT, Michigan, etc.

Currently, I'm leaning more towards not transferring, since I'm currently fairly comfortable at Pitt. But if trying to transfer out to a more prestigious university would be worth it, I would give it a whirl."

25v2n1,2,2014-05-18,Am I screwed? (Somewhat of a long post),IN_THE_KLOUDS,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25v2n1/am_i_screwed_somewhat_of_a_long_post/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm posting here to see if anyone can offer me some advice because I think I'm pretty much screwed in terms of job prospects.  Maybe there's something I should be doing or that I haven't thought of that someone will point out.  No matter where I apply, I don't get any responses or anything.  I've tried temp agencies with no results.  I've tried the standard job search sites as well...no luck.

Here's my scenario:  I graduated from a large university about a year ago with a degree in Spanish and Portuguese (with an Econ minor).  Since then, I've gone back home, and worked mainly at a retail operation doing something I really hate, and I make minimum wage.  I'm looking for a way out but so far haven't found anything.  I've decided to (partially) return to school - I'm doing a language program with Middlebury College for 8 weeks this summer with hopes that that could help me boost my resume.  I'm also working with a group on the side to develop a website devoted to e-commerce in the legal marijuana space...

I'd like to find a job doing whatever it takes to allow me to move out of my parent's home and make enough money to support myself.  


Here are a few things about me that I usually like to point out when discussing jobs, employment, etc...

~I speak 2 other languages (Spanish and Portuguese, as I studied them at University and taught English in Mexico during a gap year after high school) pretty well.  I can get by with ease.  I can also speak basic German, but not enough to really do much with it as there aren't a ton of German speaking people to practice my language.  I understand some Mandarin as well.  

~I invested my college fund at age 13 (with parental consent, obviously) and I made enough off selling the stock I held in Nintendo from 2003-2007 to pay for college (bought at 13/share, sold at 65/share).  I do stock research for fun.  I minored in Economics in college and have done lots of (personal) research on the drug war and its effect on and in Latin America, particularly Mexico and other Central American countries.   

~I've been told I'm a good writer.  I've actually done some editorials for a friend's sports blog, as well as covering a professional soccer tournament while in college for the city's newspaper.  

~Good with computers - I know it's standard these days but I'm pretty good with Excel, I've done some basic website development, I do audio related stuff as a hobby and dicked around with Photoshop and Final Cut while in college, made a few things.  I learned to program in Basic when I was in middle school, and have a few programming books.  


Here's what I think is holding me back:

~I'm from a major center of exorbitant wealth and naturally, ""connections"".  I interviewed for internships across the board while in college, but never landed one despite getting in contact with CEOs, Board members, etc... from all kinds of firms - banks, investment firms, sporting leagues, advertising agencies, you name it.  No dice.  My dad is an executive recruiter and constantly tells me that this is a massive mark against me.  My degree in Languages isn't very useful either, apparently, if I don't want to go into teaching (which I've done before, and hated it).

~See above - I'm from a very wealthy area and I didn't go to a great school.  This raises red flags, right?  I know it's more about connections and experience than school later on in life, but since I'm young and only a year out of school, it's all about the school, right?

~Lack of experience - the lack of a job during high school, during college, and dearth of internships.  I've done a number of odd jobs from working for several different retail outlets for a few months on end to working for the U.S Census department.  However, as stated earlier, nothing beats internships.

~I don't ""network"" very well.  This can be changed, but probably isn't the one thing holding me back. I don't use Linkedin, haven't been on Facebook since '07, etc...  


Here's a bit about me personally that still applies to a professional setting:

~I'm immune to office ""politics"".  

~Willing to relocate.  I hate living in the suburbs of NYC.  Just too damn expensive. 

~Extremely timely.  Being so much as a minute late is a massive pet peeve of mine.  I respect the hell out of everyone else's time, and the same for my own.  

~I'm pretty well-read (WSJ and NYT every day, baby!) and find it extremely easy to strike up a conversation with someone who isn't from my part of the world, just by talking about their local issues.  Strong interest in politics.

Any advice?  How screwed am I?  I'm 24, BTW.

25v3fa,3,2014-05-18,"I just want a job, what should I do?",inthegreenshirt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/25v3fa/i_just_want_a_job_what_should_i_do/,"Hi guys, I would appreciate literally any help/advice. 

First off, I am in the unique position where I can either graduate from college now (summer term, but without taking any extra classes) or do another semester. 

Either way, I would earn a Biology BSc degree. At one point I actually thought this was a practical major, now I feel like not being pre-med or going for a PhD it was a horrible decision. 

I have good credentials: a 3.87 GPA (from top 3 US public school, top 25 overall), special honors awards, some research experience, and an abroad internship experience. However, when applying for paid internships this summer (sending out 50+ apps by the end), I couldn't get a single one. Then having done web research and looking at some of the graduates I know, I am now officially freaked out about not being able to get any job whatsoever upon graduation.

As stated, I just want a job. I don't have very high standards, I would be happy with anything stable, 35k+ (livable wage here) with normal hours. I worked all through hs as a waitress and in retail and I just don't want to have to go back to that.

So here's where I ask for advice. Should I do another semester in which I take stats courses to try and gain real skills? (Classes in SAS, R, maybe Java too) Also sticking around campus, I might be able to go to more mass interviews/events.

Or should I opt for early graduation, and start out for a new degree/certification. I'm really interested in medical field related things. I've looked into grad school public health (I am interested in this, but fearful it is also a bad decision when one really needs a paid job at the end). I've also thought about doing a nursing masters or an accelerated BSN. I've also seen certifications for various hospital type jobs- should I go in that direction? (I really don't want to do more schooling but will if I have to, though I'd prefer two more years tops limit).

I feel like I was very stupid in choosing my major, doing it because I liked bio and had thought with no evidence that it was practical. I didn't actually think about what jobs are open at the end, and now I feel as though nothing is. 

TL;DR: Bio major wonders if she should graduate now or stick around and take stat/CS classes to attempt to be more marketable? Also keep applying to jobs or instead embark on second degree or specialized certifications?"

[Did you ever take a call from a lobbyist? If so, what was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9v0?context=5)|Lobbyists dont call the general number for a Senator. They have a relationship with the Legislative Assistants and come in for meetings. So they either have the direct lines of the people they need to talk to, or if they're calling me its only to direct them to someone else.
[So, it's worse than many people think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkykt?context=5)|A lot of lobbyists are former staffers. So they have a very intimate knowledge of the procedures and how to write pieces of legislation and had already existing relationships established with the elected officials themselves.
 |The lobbyists can write the first draft of the legislation themselves and work with the staffers in the office on edits and the language in the bill. 
[How enraged does the senator/lobbyist relationship make you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkult7?context=5)|Honestly the thing that bothered me the most was that I felt like although not everything that is done on the Hill is shady and bad, it could have been a lot worse because most of my generation is extremely politically lethargic (im now 28).
 |Obviously there is going to be a lot of people that are very passionate about the way that their government operates and the shit that goes on, but so far in my life most of the people i've come in contact with since i've left DC just chalk everything up to ""bullshit"" and dont care. I cant say I blame them because they havent seen too much reward for the time and effort it takes, but it just makes for an extremely vicious cycle that ultimately ends badly.
[What methods have worked to get a response from the Senator himself/herself, instead of just having a call screened and logged by you? For example, if I call in with an intelligent argument and present it reasonably, is there any shot that the Senator will actually be told ""one of your constituents, Flavor80 from Redditville, called yesterday and brought up a point that we haven't considered before""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9u7?context=5)|For starters i'd say start with the Senators/Congressmen that you're able to vote for. The only thing we really required from people to record their calls was their zip code. If they wanted a response from the Senator (in written form) we would take down their postage information. So if you recently moved. If you call a Michigan senator with a California zipcode and address you're not going to get any follow up from the office.
[If I'm registered with the other political party, or just moved to the state and therefore wasn't a registered voter for the Senator's last election, will that impact the way my question/request is treated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9u7?context=5)|For your first question, I cant obviously speak for the other 99 senators but I would almost always include a specific example of a call I received from a constituent when reporting it to the Senator. So if you voiced your opinion or concerns about an issue i took notes on it to bring to the meeting if i felt like it also captured a lot of what other people were saying.
[Have you seen house of cards? If so how accurately does it depict the real govt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkeh9?context=5)|I actually have not seen it. My friends have been screaming at me for a while to watch the show because they know i'll love it.
 |There are a couple of shows that I saw that had the most accurate representations of government, one was The Wire (more on a state level with Carcetti/Little Finger :P ) and I think all Hill staffers are obsessed with The West Wing.
 |Martin Sheen actually stopped by the Hill when i worked there and pretty much everyone that saw him as he was roaming around referred to him as ""Mr. President"" lol.
[Do you think West Wing was an accurate representation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkqo9g?context=5)|I only watched the first couple of seasons of the show, but I do think it was as close as anyone has gotten to the life on Capitol Hill. The kinds of relationships that are forged and the ways in which they function between the White House and Capitol Hill and between people that work in politics i thought was very well established in the show.
 |I've heard from former colleagues and many others that House of Cards also accomplishes this, but I cant say for myself.
 |My favorite show or medium that shows all sides of the coin for me was The Wire. I got in a few conversations about how accurate the show was with a lot of our senior staff.
[What demographic did you hear from the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk2yi?context=5)|Senior Citizens.
 |Also I worked for a democrat so the majority of people that called in tended to be more conservative.
[This is why we can't touch social security, Medicare, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chky2xi?context=5)|Senior Citizens are certainly a lot more active politically. They have a lot more time on their hands. So they're going to be a lot more vocal with their concerns.  
[On average how many calls did you get in a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk79j?context=5)|I would say it fluctuates but i'd say there were far more days that the phones literately wouldn't stop ringing from 9-5. (Granted I wasnt the only person answering the phones). 
[What was the most hilarious thing you saw/did/heard etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk79j?context=5)|Nothing really comes to mind. There was one guy that always came and visited the office dressed in a suit with such a massive beer gut that his bottom button was always popped and his gut was fighting to escape his shirt. I always found that entertaining. Oh there was a crazy woman that always called us after hours and left messages about her menstrual cycle...those were always interesting.

[What is your personal opinion on 'corruption in Washington'  I have seen AMA where former staffers/politicians have said that it's very corrupt, and politicians are generally trying to get re-elected and find a nice job for them when they leave, and others that have said it's just an extremely tough job with no good options and politicians just seem corrupt but are generally good.  What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkqnqb?context=5)|Honestly, i was not a fan at all of the way things operated. Here is the best way I could explain what I had an issue with (which I dont think is really eye opening or groundbreaking information)...
 |Every senator is going to be extremely knowledgeable and well versed in his/her core group of issues (usually directly relating to the state that they represent). Those are the issues that they ran on. So if you represent a state for example that has an economy that is extremely tied to Agriculture, you might have a Senator who is very well versed and knowledgeable on that subject. Or if you have a state that lost a ton of manufacturing jobs, you could have a Senator who ran on a platform based on manufacturing and trade agreements. So basically there are going to be a handful of issues that these elected officials are going to be experts in and from what I saw its almost always going to be tied to the people that put them in office. So when legislation or something came up pertaining to that issue they're going to be extremely educated on the subject and thus a lot harder to sway by lobbyists or their own political party.
 |Now there's nothing wrong with that, it makes sense, the majority of the people in the legislative body are very smart and well educated in a range of issues. But they're not going to be experts in every one of them. That is why you have a legislative staff. They go out and make sure that you have Legislative Assistants (LA) and people that they trust in the issues that arent really high on the list of the priorities of their voters. So a state like Utah for example (^I ^dont ^actually ^know ^what ^the ^top ^priorities ^are ^for ^people ^in ^Utah ^im ^just ^guessing ^here) Foreign policy may be really low on that list of priorities. So thats where the lobbyists or political parties do the most damage. It's a lot easier to convince someone to vote one way or the other on an issue. And ultimately the people with the most power are the people with the most money and can craft the best argument.
 |The main reason I had a problem with this, was because obviously whether a Senator is an expert or not on an issue they operate within a legislative body that has to cover anything and everything. And what i felt like got lost was that the issues that didn't necessarily seem like a high priority for them, but could easily effect people in other states/countries were up for grabs. And those decisions were based on who could make the best argument. Whether it was someone who claimed to represent a lot of your constituents, pressures from your political party telling you to just ride the party line and vote along your fellow dems/republicans, or people that donate a shit ton of money to your campaign. I just realized i'm typing up a massive essay here, so i'll tone it down. If you want me to clarify any of the points though let me know...
 |**TLDR - No I wasnt really a fan of the way things operated. I felt like too many very important decisions were being made for the wrong reasons.**
[This is great to read. It's such a fundamental flaw in the system that every person in power is capable of weakness just like the rest of us.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|It's not a perfect system, you're not going to get a perfect system when you're talking about governing the kind of population with the kinds of demographics that exist in this country.  When I worked on the Hill I would go home and watch the Prime Time shows on Fox News and MSNBC. Main reason I did this was not because I gave a rats ass about what they were saying. It was because I knew that without a doubt i'd go into work the next day, log into the phones and listen to call after call of people reciting exactly what they heard Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Ed Schultz or Rachel Maddow tell them the night before. It was disturbing to me, but unfortunately it's far too convenient for people to take a news story about legislation or an event that happens and only try to concentrate on the facts that support their ideology and throw away every other bit of information. At first I blamed the networks for this, and thought that they were trash. I still think they're trash, but i dont think they're the issue. I think the issue is the people that watch it and soak it up like a sponge. Fox News isn't bad for what they put on there network. The fact that people soak it up like a sponge is the disgusting part.
[How would you solve the problem you mentioned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|Ultimately I think the only solution to these kinds of problems are having a very well educated constituent base. And this is something that I couldnt be any more cynical on. The sources that the majority of Americans get their news from is in my opinion absolute garbage. Any media that tries to deliver news has become all about talking heads, and opinions. You no longer get a news story with any factual information you just get someone's reaction to a news story. People are not taught how to think they're taught what to think and they just want to remain comfortable in their bubbles.
[I'm a firm believer in a form of technocracy/meritocracy where the decision makers for a field are the best and most learned in said field. We should expect more from the people who control our schools, health and wealth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|Honestly I dont know if it's something that can be fixed. I know this quote gets beaten to death but I have to agree with Churchill when he said said...""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time""  And obviously I'm generalizing here, I know that there are is a large portion of people in this country that this doesnt apply to, but in my experience i'd say they are a minority. 
[What did you guys do with Larry Flynts monthly delivery of Hustler?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmuah?context=5)|We would recycle em. Granted if someone wanted to take them out of the recycle bin and take them home they could...
[How often would you get calls from enraged constituents?  What were the conversations like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkl0px?context=5)|Very often. The people that were enraged, usually just worked themselves up through the call and would end up just screaming at me about an issue. I always tried to keep the conversation focused on whatever the issue was so i'd make note that they were very enraged but if they weren't making any sense or didnt have a point to make i'd do what i can to just move on to another caller.
 |But those kinds of people generally just want to yell and scream and vent. I dont think they really cared much for the conversation to be honest.
[Do you have an example of one call that directly led to the changing of a specific policy or did that never happen? After working this job do you ever see yourself calling into a senator to voice an opinion in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkma1a?context=5)|I personally never fielded any calls like that, but i know that there have been instances where someone calls and references a story of theirs and  the office wants to use their story to help promote their stance on a bill. I wouldnt say it changes their perspective on the issue though.
 |I personally don't call a political office though. I guess i just got more or less burnt out on it.
[What information do you actually take down from phone calls regarding issues? Is it worth making a whole speech, or should I be as terse as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkcok?context=5)|I'd say its a mix. We have an internal system that helps us log all the calls that come in. We weren't able to log the call though without the zipcode so we needed to make sure that the person calling is actually a constituent.
 |That being said, when logging each call, we make notes on what the actual call was about. So as you're making your points my job was to write down a summary of what you were saying. I mean some people definitely went on a tangent and covered like 40 different issues as they were talking but i'd say its better for you to stay on point and stick to one issue with each call. 
[I know I'm a little late but if you're still around...  What were some of the qualifications for your position?  Do they run for any offices?  If so would that help their chances of election?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmhr1?context=5)|People usually stick around for a while and transition from the staff assistant role to a Legislative Correspondent (LCs). LC's will get a batch of issues for themselves and work along with the Legislative Assistants (LAs) that handle similar issues. So LCs primary role is to deal with the drafting of any correspondence to constituents and to suppor the LAs on their issues (whether thats writing Legislation or meeting with people). It does happen where an LC can move to LA on their own but most people that get hired as LAs have some kind of formal training in that issue. So if you're an LA that concentrates on military/defense issues for example it would help to have a military background, or if have a post-graduate degree on the issue at hand.
[Where do people often go to after they hold positions like yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmhr1?context=5)|I'd say the majority of people that get their start on Capitol Hill started as interns. One of the other responsibilities i had was the running of the internship program as well, and I can tell you that generally speaking most offices will aim to hire interns that are either currently in school or fresh graduates. There tends to be a high turnover rate on Capitol Hill so i got lucky that when my internship was done there was an open position and i applied.  There are certainly a number of people that hold office today that started as interns and I worked with a few that had aspirations to run for office. I think a few actually started as Capitol Police officers as well.
 |In terms of whether or not it helps in their election i'd say thats debatable. I think most politicians in this country have a more unfavorable reputation so you hear the word ""Career politician"" thrown around negatively when people are running campaigns because it leads people to believe they've been part of a corrupt process their whole life.
[How were you told to respond to constituents who disagreed with how your Senator voted? Engage in debate? Explain the reasons why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chklfvj?context=5)|This changes from office to office. At one point our office used ""Talking Points"" so people who handled the phones [Whether they were interns or other staff assistants] had a book with them that gave them the senators stance on a range of issues to gauge off of.
 |We weren't supposed to engage anyone on the phone in any kind of debate. I'd say the majority of people that called in disagreed on an issue and that was the reason why they were calling. If they knew the senator agreed with them they didnt feel the need to call.
 |That being said, obviously a lot of people wanted us to explain to them the senators stance, so thats what the talking points were for. As we got closer to election time, our office decided to scrap the talking points and move towards a written correspondence, that people in the legislative staff would write up. I dont necessarily think its the most effective in terms of communication, but I think it was done so the office can make sure they control the message going out. 
[Craziest conspiracy theory a constituent called with? I interned for a House member and we had a crazy guy who claimed the Chinese Government owned 3 of the local McDonald's and was poisoning everyone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkv9d?context=5)|I mentioned this in an earlier question but we had a woman who always called in and left messages with all kinds of crazy information. She would call in and blame the government when she missed her period and pretty much had a conspiracy for anything and everything going on.
[How do you folks deal with requests for nomination for the military academies. Is there a specific vetting process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chklzmd?context=5)|Yeah we had a specific application process for academy nominations. You could apply through the Senator's website as long as it was before the deadlines.
 |Most Senators have someone who works in the State offices and deals with casework that handles the nominations so i'd contact the local office of your senator to get more info. What state are you in? I can probbaly find a link for ya.
[If you had an issue that you wanted to get addressed by the senator and not just an aid how would you go about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmamd?context=5)|If you mean like a personal request thats regarding casework i'd say just say contact the State office. Say you're having an issue with another government agency (related to unemployment, social services, immigration, or whatever the issue may be). At worst a letter from a US Senator on your behalf to those agencies could help make a difference, or they might let you know of other programs available to you to help you with whatever you need.
 |Like I mentioned earlier, if you have 2 senators and a congressmen that represent you, cant hurt to call them all, but i'd aim for the one thats closer to re-election. They might let you know of a program or some kind of assistance that you might not have known existed for someone in your situation that could make a difference.
[Did you get a lot of threats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkjqyb?context=5)|Not really, ~~a few~~ a lot of people would work themselves into a fit of anger but other than cursing no one really would threaten the Senator or anyone in the office. 
[Could you describe your job as the punching bag between politicians and the public? Is there any reason to call them if you dont have a problem? Would people call just to check in or say that the senitor is doing great? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkvppq?context=5)|At times I certainly felt like a punching bag. But it was very easy for me to not take things personally.
 |But some of my favorite callers are the sweet old ladies that call in just to say Thank you and they love the work that the Senator is doing, or are just excited.
 |And on another note, I was a tour coordinator for a while (setting up tours for constituents to visit Capitol Building, White House, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Library of Congress, etc.) and although there were plenty of people that were hard to deal with, generally speaking it was a joy to be able to help a family out and make their vacation a little easier. Always loved meeting them when they came in to the office and showing them around.
[Yeah, but think where those party priorities come from. Do you think that still isn't ultimately determined in large part by what the big money donors want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chl01np?context=5)|Absolutely, i've grown to be a bit cynical but I do think that ultimately its all going to be traced back to money. But as Roman tells you in GTA, you wanted Capitalism...you got it.
[Did you ever take a call from a prostitute or an escort ?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkv50z?context=5)|No not while in the office. But I will say that anywhere with that kind of power is goin to have a thriving community of high class escorts. I heard rumors of some steak houses and nicer establishments around DC  where they go to try and pick up congressmen. But i never got to see any of this go down obviously, with the salary i had and the extreme cost of living in DC, i'd be lucky if i could have witnessed a rub n tug at a shady asian massage parlor. 
[Did the Senator actually care what people's opinions were?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkxtb2?context=5)|I'd say when it came to the phone calls, he cared a lot more about the overall influx of the calls and what topics dominated the phones.
[I call mine from time to time and get the impression that they really don't care what my opinion is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkxtb2?context=5)|But I will say that the Senator I worked for always talked about conversations he had with constituents whether in State or at events here in DC where they voiced their opinions on things. They certainly cared about what constituents said to them when they met them in person.
[Are you the guy who talked about the gay senator and then didnt come out about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkvx17?context=5)|I didnt know of any gay senators while i was working on the hill, isn't Tammy Baldwin a lesbian?

[The main thing that came across is that the politicians spend nearly all day on the phone ""dialing for dollars"". He also said that individual voices do little to effect change since the politician isn't trying for individual votes but to get blocks. Do you have any comments on this?

Hey guys!

I have a few questions for you guys who have been looking for at least 3 months to no avail for a CS job.

- What is your education?
- Do you have internships or work experience?
- Do you have side projects or a portfolio?
- Do you have specific skills you are strong at?
- What is your location?
- How long have you been looking?
- What kind of jobs are you applying to?
- Why you think you haven't found a job?
- Any other detail you think is relevant?

You can also include your resume if you want us to comment on it.

As for me, I'm employed now, but I've been fired of a 3 months job in the past for scummy reasons and it took me 2 months to get a new job, so I have an idea of what it feels like, though it certainly doesn't compare to someone who's been looking for a year or more. I'm curious as to how long-time seekers are doing and I'm willing to help.

Share your story!

I'm about to fail my operating systems class after dropping with a W another CS class.

I have two tabs of github and google code with other students implementation Nachos (an academic OS for students learning operating systems). In other words, I'm cheating because I procrastinated continuously this past week. I really have no excuse other than sheer apathy, laziness. I would continuously open up reddit when I knew I had to start my assignments. Very poor self control.

I'm stuck in a rut. In previous quarters I've worked very hard on my assignments with no cheating and I've done well. I didn't get straight As but I felt decent. The classes were challenging (for example, Computer Architecture, discrete math, accelerated intro to Java and some GE) and I studied and finished my assignments early. Barely had any time to even fap, lol. 

I did really badly this quarter. If I withdraw from this class, I'd be only taking 1 course, an econ class. But I did have some extenuating factors like, I work at my internship/coop where I program stuff for my bosses. It's only 10 hours a week but they take up two of my afternoons, sometimes on weekends. I feel satisfied with my work there and I think my bosses feel the same. I've been working with a friend programming a robot for a competition where we placed 3rd out of 27 teams. I don't want to make it seem like I'm rationalizing my failure because I did browse reddit extensively in my 'free time' which was still quite a bit of time. 

Is this what burning out is? I just stopped caring about my classes, missing lectures despite pop quizzes, doing shitty on my midterm and not starting early. Maybe because of my hubris because of my internship and sideproject? Idk I don't think I'm that type of person.

Anyway, I will be a 5th year soon and will likely need two more quarters. I need to hear it, whatever tough love or hate or just ignore me. How do I care again? How do I get my self control back?"

After clicking ""ok"" it repeatedly boots and fails over and over with the same or similar message. This is so strange. My previous test worked perfectly. The only difference is that the test image only had windows updates on it. The image I currently have has everything our company requires as a standard for each client. The default unattend.xml has not been changed in any way other than specifying the local admin account that pulls from our group policy after joining the domain. That way, our techs can easily make changes to the image before deploying the machine to the end user. This setup worked before with the test image, it logged in as local admin and reported a successful deployment.

If anyone can help me, I will be eternally grateful. I have been pulling my hair out trying to get this far. After my test image was successful, I was certain that the master image was going to work.

However, with more recent games I'm finding it hard to run at 1080p and 60fps with max settings.  I can normally get away with 30fps on more demanding games by turning down AA but with newer games coming out I'd like more power.

There's a link to my current setup.  The 9400 GT I have was just something I had laying around I use to run my two side monitors (my primary is a 27"" 1080p and my two side monitors are 22"" 1680x1050).  As much as I hate to admit, I haven't been following the recent GPU releases so I really have no idea what's good anymore.  Here is where I need your help!  In short, what would you recommend I upgrade to give me the best performance.  I've got an internship this summer so I could budget maybe $300 towards an upgrade but I need to save money for my senior year.  Sorry for being long winded.  TL;DR, I need to upgrade but don't know what to upgrade to.  Thank you guys!

Here's a little background on myself. 

I'm currently a grade 11 high school student in Ontario. I've decided that the best university for me to go to, is Waterloo as it's CS program as well as co-op program is one of the best in Canada! I've looked at what it takes to get in, and since my marks aren't too bad, nor excellent, I want to do more extra curricular's for the summer. 

I have come up with 3 options.

1) Going through with Summer Company (a program which allows you to start basically a risk free business by giving a small grant, and I'll try to make some applications as my business)

2) Doing a web dev job where I basically use wordpress to construct the site

3) Finding an internship somewhere in the GTA at a software development company where I can hopefully learn and help develop applications for them. (Doesn't have to be paid)

The problem with the 1st and 3rd option, is that I can't figure out how to go about it. For the Summer Company program, I can't think of many applications which will be good enough to sell to the public, because I'm not that experienced and I don't have enough time. 

Regarding the third option, I'm having trouble finding a tech company which would take high school students.

Please help me prioritize what I should try to do out of those couple options or any others that you may have.

Thanks for reading!

tl:dr
Highschool student in Ontario trying to find something meaningful for the summer which will help his application for CS into University. Need help deciding whether or not to start a business selling an application, intern at a company or do a minimum wage web dev job. "

I did not know where to ask this question so I chose CSCareer forum because it is related to leading healthy, strong career in IT.

As you probably are all familiar, sitting for hours and eating nachos with coffee as food is not good for you in the long term. I will start working at my internship and decided to take some kind of action over the summer. I decided to start working out, eat a lot of healthy meals, around 3k calories each day, 6 meals a day. At work, we have microwave and electric stove. I know that I won't have time to prepare foods from scratch, this is why I will bring prepared food to the work.

My question is how do you keep yourself fit and healthy because in my opinion, I function a lot better mentally after a run or some physical activity.

Even though this question is not about jobs, in my opinion, it is very important for healthy career."
25y8z4,2,2014-05-19,"Stuck in a rut, opportunity to get out, but one problem... advice please?",Raffles7683,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/25y8z4/stuck_in_a_rut_opportunity_to_get_out_but_one/,"Hi Reddit

Ok, never done this before, but I'll be buggered if I'm getting any objective advice from anyone I know personally. So, I'm turning to my recent finding of this odd little site for a bit of help.

Ok, context. I've been taught to fly since I was 13 years old, and for a hell of a long time it was the sole career I wanted to pursue. However, parents not happy. Mum though it was a waste of my brain, and Dad - through a combination of jealousy and annoyance (if anyone wants clarification on this please ask) - did his best to put my flying dreams to bed. 

Fast forward to me at 16, and 3 years of nagging and plain 'not interested' from the parents had made me all but give up on the idea. I studied law during my college (high school to any US readers) years, kinda' liked it, and went on to study it at university.

I graduated roughly a year ago, and - for the most part - was on track to get a damned good degree... that was until my final year. I met someone, shit went bad, I had a near complete mental breakdown, and just scraped a lower honours degree.

Summer 2013. At mum's/step-fathers house, get a part time job waiting at a local restaurant, and spend a lot of time in/out of various internships. All the while fairly pissed that my degree is acting as one big barrier to furthering myself in the legal field. 

December 2013: Holy shit, British Airways had relaunched their Future Pilot programme, a near fully funded cadetship for people of any flying experience to enter the pilot profession. Of course, I apply, thinking that I had nothing to lose. Further holy shit, they accept me within two weeks. 

January 2014: I go for my 'stage one' interview, as one of 800 for just 65 or so places. I didn't get it. But... the flight college who interviewed me were impressed enough with my aptitude and attitude that they allowed me 'on merit' entry into the unsponsored programme until Jan. 2015. That's near £84K of finance needed, all for a 'chance' at a job. No guarantee. 

However, parents had changed their tune completely. Mum realised I was still determined, and that BA giving me a chance must have meant something. She is now in full support. Both her - and my stepfather- have agreed to help settle my finances when they are in a position to so (approximately mid 2015). They are very clear on this, and we have talked extensively about it. So far as they are concerned, I'm already at the academy. 

My father, initially, was hyper supportive. He was amazed that I had gotten a chance with BA, and even more impressed that I had a place on merit. Since my initial interview I have done more of my part time job (getting a couple of pay rises and become a senior member of the staff), and applied for a few more cadetships with UK based airlines. I didn't get them, and was getting increasingly restless. I wanted change, and I wanted to grab the opportunity which I had been presented with. 

Last week, after a really shitty day at work, I snapped. I had spoken to mum the night before, who thought I really should 'just do it' and apply fully to the original academy. The very next day, I initiated the process to start my course in September 2014. 

The problem? My father. He is now against it, saying that to be landed with this much debt so early in life is insanity, and to at least wait until mum/stepfather's affairs are in order for certain. They ARE a certainty, but as yet haven't got access to what they are owed. As I said, sometime in 2015 is reasonable. 

As much as I hate to admit it (me and my father have never exactly seen eye to eye), in this instance I think he does have a point, and am now having serious jitters about what is possibly the shit scariest thing I have ever done or committed to. 

I want to start, I want to live my life and go for the career that I have dreamed of since I was a young teenager (even earlier, come to that). 

Any advice would be fantastic. I don't even care if it's along the lines of 'Man the fuck up and do it.' 

Thanks anyway Reddit. "

I'm going fill out the ""survey"" that I'm required to fill out.

--------

1 - Product or Service?: I help companies with their social media... whether it be from setting it up to forming campaign strategies for a certain target. I also consist of many sales methodologies I'm willing to consult to these companies that can possibly help them with their prospects. 

2 - What motivated you?: I'm a IT consultant as my full time job and enjoy helping and creating relationships with people. I love making money and have a passion in social media/sales and thought this would be a good idea.

3 - How long have you been working on your startup?: 1-2 months

4 - Plans for the future?: My goal to help companies with their social media and possibly manage it for them with interns. I'm not exactly sure, but I def want to keep doing this.

5 - Most memorable experience?: Getting my first client, helping them over the phone and join.me and getting paid! Not only that, but them coming back for more help and us settling for a long term deal.

6 - Advice to myself? Keep grinding

--------

With that being said, I'm looking to expand my services and am curious how you guys would market yourselves. I've been doing most of my work through Craigslist and have gotten 2 clients through that. All of this is from people reaching out to me. I haven't put time in to research local companies who could possibly benefit from me. What do you guys think? "

I'm a college student looking for an internship for the summer. 

Internship A is my dream internship, they do EVERYTHING in regards to CS. I would learn a ton, meet cool people and if i do well i would have a job waiting for me when i graduate. It is also a government job so i would get full benefits with a full time position. 

Internship B is a little web development internship that i've already been told is mine if i want it. Im okay with web dev but i dont necessarily love it.

Internship A told me they would let me know of a decision last week but they didnt. My friend who works there said the hiring manager was out all week. My friend said that i was one of the best interviewees and candidates however so to just wait it out. I emailed the guy who interviewed me yesterday and asked when he anticipates a decision because my summer is dependent on this.

Intership B called me today because i was supposed to start working there if i accepted. (i havnt talked to them since their interview so i havnt ""accepted"" yet). I've recieved no email response from internship A today. Should i just give up and accept the internship that i've had, or should i risk it and potentially end up with no internship?

TL;DR: Internship A is amazing, and i've been told i'm one of the best candidates. No response from them yet. Intership B is kind of lame but i've been accepted and i would have had to start today but i've been waiting it out for A."

[How does it feel to be the founder of the best comic company in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2ray?context=5)|A good translator is a key to the process. I'll tell you a secret. When Dark Horse was barely a year old, I secured the rights to the latest Japanese Godzilla book. The company at the time was basically Randy Stradley and myself. We did not know where to go to find a translator, so we divided the book into six issues and  I took issues 1,3, and 5 home while Randy took issues 2,4,and 6. We ""made-up"" our translations by looking at the panels. That is how we ""adapted"" the book. Surprisingly enough, we were pretty close to the actual translation.
[Wow!!! No idea I would get told a secret about a Godzilla interpretive translation! I shall seal up my lips and give no words but mum! Thank you for the reply and have a great summer! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm5ql3?context=5)|Great. Glad to share.
[I know that Dark Horse has more creator-owned characters, how does that affect film rights?  Also, has Dark Horse ever considered creating more adaptations of its properties? And would you ever consider creating a studio similar to Marvel Studios, where every work is part of a collective universe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2xsl?context=5)|Well, it might surprise you but Dark Horse has its own film division. We've produced over two dozen films and television series over the last two decades, projects such as The Mask, TimeCop, Mystery Men, Hellboy, etc. We currently have several projects nearing green-light status.  As far as a collective universe, see our Project Black Sky line. Some of those characters are currently being discussed as films and television series.
[Thanks for the answer! Are you guys ever looking for people to make sure the core of a character is properly shown in scripts? If so I'd love to work or intern for you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3wxb?context=5)|Yes but on staff already.

Boring answer, huh? My favorite villain can be found in the Marvelman series by Alan Moore. You'll have to look if you want to find his name.

Thanks for so many great reads over the years!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2kl4?context=5)|I assume you mean the ""un-authorized"" shirts I see at conventions? I don't care much if a fan has a home-made shirt featuring one of our characters or even if an artist sells a piece featuring our characters. We do have a problem if someone starts producing items on a large scale. I hope I'm answering your question.

Great stories with an unusual direction. Something I haven't seen before. Terrific art. Fun twists. Familiar stories or characters with unexpected surprises. As you might imagine, I see thousands of proposals. Pitches that appeal with very few lines. I'll always remember Steve Niles pitching me the entertainment rights to 30 Days of Night. ""Sun goes down in Barrow, Alaska for 30 days. Vampires show up."" I saw the entire film with those two sentences. Strong concepts can be pitched for comics or film with few words. 
[Comics industry heroes: any favorite first time meet and greets?

Geof told us about a book he was doing with Frank when we were maybe two or three years old. I asked Geof to let us have a chance at the book and he agreed to discuss with Frank. Many months later, Geof called and said Frank would meet with us at a specific restaurant at a specific time. We (Randy Stradley and I) hopped a plane and met with Frank at the proper place and time. He pulled out a pad and paper to take notes. I laid out a four or five page document itemizing every cost related to a comic and told him to tell me how much we could make.He looked surprised (had never received a P&amp;L from previous publishers), picked up the document and put the pen and paper back into his pocket. The while meeting lasted not more than 15 minutes. He told me to meet him at the same time and place the following day. We did, and he gave us Hard Boiled with Geof alone with Give Me Liberty with Dave Gibbons. I learned later that he called Dave Gibbons that night and told him he's met a publisher who gave him "". . . the keys to the kingdom."" He also insisted that I NOT give him so much of the profit, that our deal had to be fair to both of us. We've been working together now for more than 20 years.

Or you can come to a comics convention and stick it into my hands.
 |If you have talent, the odds are high you will get noticed. Have you thought of setting up your own website? We've found a number of projects and creators by searching the net.

As a result, I could read when I began the first grade. I was once asked how I felt about school and I answered that I was generally bored. I was then asked when the boredom began. I said probably the second day of the first grade . . . I read Fun With Dick and Jane while it was being passed out and then had to wait for everyone else to catch up.
 |I enjoyed certain artists before I knew who they were . . . the ""Good Duck Artist"" - Carl Barks, Steve Ditko, and of course, Jack Kirby. Hal Foster was my all time favorite from the comic strips and I discovered Alex Raymond later on in the Nostalgia Press editions. I actually quit comics late in high school and it was Barry Smith's work that brought me back in.
 |I've always loved comics. Majored in art as a result. worked as a commercial artist. Always planned to start my own business, so a  comic shop was a natural. It led to publishing and everything that came later. I've always tried too take a very personal approach to the creators we work with and felt invested in their wok. Works for most. I love to publish the stories of others as well as tell my own.

[What has been your favorite Comic Book to Film adaptation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm30c1?context=5)|Well, I'm going to have to be self-serving and say The Mask. After that is DC's A History of Violence. The first Christopher Reeve Superman film. Brian Singer's first X-Men.
[I want to break into comics. I've been writing comics for a bit, but recently decided to take it very seriously. I started a blog call Five By Five Comics where I force myself to write 5 pages of a self contained comic a day. Eventually I want to get these made by artists, but what should I do then? Should I collect them into a short novel and pass that out? How do I break in with no comic work under my belt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm57dn?context=5)|There are aspiring artists out there looking to team up with writers. You can try posting notices at colleges, joining blogs on-line, networking at conventions such as the San Diego Con, etc.. The artists are out there, get out there and do the work.
[Considering the upcoming releases of the new Alien-Predator comics, some of the writers have opted not to treat the AvP films as canon for their story, but what is Fox's stance on the AvP movies? Are they a canonical side-story or alternate universe in regards to the newer films (PREDATORS and Prometheus\) and new comics as far as Fox is concerned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2u9f?context=5)|We pretty much built the continuity for the AVP (which we created) and Predator franchises (the second film was based on our first series . . . a fact complicated when we had to license the film, making it the first comic based on the film that was based on the comic). We are looking mostly toward Prometheus and Alien continuity for our series. Where the other films fit, if at all, will depend on whether they fit in easily and if there is an advantage to including them. We've worked with Fox for many years and they are very supportive of our efforts. Current story lines are consistent with both the studio and the filmmakers.
[Just wanted to thank you for doing this AMA. Long time fan of Dark Horse, from all of the Aliens universe comics ever published to the good ole days of Concrete and everything in between. I wish you and Dark Horse the very best and I'm looking forward to the new Dark Hose Aliens universe comics! 4 new titles to choose from. When will they release or have they already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2lag?context=5)|Thanks much for the kind words. Look for them later this summer. The event begins with Prometheus, moves to Aliens, and AVP.
[Hello sir. My name is Todd, I actually write my own comic called Guardians. I would love to write for Dark Horse, whether it be through Guardians somehow coming under your banner (understand if that's not possible\) or writing one of your numerous properties.  By any chance, could I show you my work and possibly strike up a conversation with you about possibly working at Dark Horse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3o7w?context=5)|Please send it to Dark Horse, Attention Mike Richardson and I'll take a look.
[Thank you sir! It is an honor. I have a paperback version of the first four issues of my comic I'll send to you. I'll also send a business card with it as well so you can contact me if you wish afterwards. I thank you for this opportunity. It'll be in the mail tomorrow!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3wtu?context=5)|I'll look forward to it and give you my honest opinion.
[Does this offer extend to anyone? Because I have submitted to Dark Horse before and was coincidentally just preparing another pitch package today- would love to get that extra leg up by sending it straight to you.  Thanks a lot! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm4bbu?context=5)|Everyone?
 |I once promised in a promotion calling for submissions that I would personally look at and respond to every submission. It took me over a year to go through all of the projects I receive. If you want to send directly to me, I guarantee I will end up looking at it and responding. I won't guarantee how timely that response will be.
[Does Darkhorse do any portfolio reviews at conventions? Particularly on the east coast? I would love to get to talk to someone from the company at Philadelphia, Boston, or Baltimore Comic con. And in a portfolio review do you prefer to see Dark Horse material (Like the Ghost in Deadly Game sample script from the site- which I have done\) or is creator owned stuff okay? Thanks! -Andrew ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm4ld5?context=5)|We do set up portfolio reviews at some conventions. You can also set up interviews with particular editors at the same cons. In the end, you can drop off a pitch or submission off at the booth. They generally find their way to me if they show any potential. I can't promise everyone a reply, but if you are good, odds are we'll get back to you.
[What is your favorite part of your day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2oer?context=5)|I don't really divide my day that way. I'm lucky, I love what I do. I have a great family. Those two sides of my life blend together. I encourage others to find something they love that they can spend their life on. Life is short and the days are precious.
[In regards to submissions, assuming we're coming as a complete creative team (or at the very least writer/penciler/inker\), do the guidelines change? Do you still want a full script, or will 5-10 (sequential\) pages do?  Ditto for Dark Horse Presents -- Assuming we've got all the pages penciled, inked and lettered, would you still want the script? For that matter, is a proposal necessary/helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm40d7?context=5)|If you have a completed story, by all means submit as is. If you have a section of a book or story completed with the correct creative team, send it with a brief outline.
[What pops into your head as the most standout panel or page in all of DH's comics to date?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2q6i?context=5)|Yikes . . .too many to even pick. Single panels? It would have to be a panel/page by Geof Darrow.
[ of all, thank you for Dark Horse comics. Publishers like you made me stick with comics in the mid to late 90's.  I'm sure that you get asked this a lot but advice to breaking in comics.  And what do you think about web comics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm4ktw?context=5)|The best advice I can give you is to be persistent. Competition is fierce, so you have to be resolved and not discouraged easily. If you are good, someone is going to notice. For those who have problems with traditional comics publishers, I suggest setting up your own website. We've published many series we've discovered on-line. And I guess that answers your question about web comics . . . I love 'em (if they're good).
[Does Amanda Ripley from Alien: Isolation have anything to do with the new Alien comics that are to be releasing soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm32rg?context=5)|We've referred to the film cannon for our upcoming Aliens continuity. As a result, all of the information related to the characters exists in our upcoming event. As a result, every film character is somehow connected to our stories. You'll have to read the series to see who and how. That's the fun of reading the comics, right?
[Yeas ago, you published a a Legend line with Art Adams,  Frank Miller, John Byrne, Mike Mignola and more. Who are some of today's modern legends and is it possible you could bring them together to visit the line for its 20th anniversary this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2xe0?context=5)|Anything is possible, but all of the people you mention are in very different places in their lives than they were 20 years ago (which BTW, feels like about two months ago to me). A reunion is highly unlikely. If  I were you, I'd just take a look at their current work and grab some of the work from those good-old Legend days. What great comics they've created.
[Hi Mr. Richardson! Been a long time reader of Dark Horse (especially Hellboy and The Goon\) and I am absolutely loving the Project Black Sky line. After the phenomenal FCBD issue can we start expecting more team ups between the characters in this line?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm5osj?context=5)|Yes. And we have many surprises in store. We've been building this slowly and carefully. You can expect new books and a growing connection between those books with the Black Sky Project logo.
[When you still had the Star Wars license, and of course still possessed the rights to the Alien-Predator franchises how come no Star Wars vs Alien-Predator crossovers ever came about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3ega?context=5)|Neither company was interested in seeing their properties combined with the other. It would have been an interesting project since those films have such different tones.
[Dark Horse has done crossovers with DC, but how come no crossovers with Marvel were ever done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm45jo?context=5)|Quite honestly they had no interest in working with us. Paul Levitz, who is a friend, felt differently and we actually had an ongoing program with DC.
[How do you get in touch with the artists/writers as far as signings? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2eit?context=5)|If you'd like a signing, just contact us and we will help set it up.
[I recently had my first comic released through comixology. What would think would be the best way to get potential buyers and maybe catch the attention of a big time comic book company? I'm really concerned if it doesn't do well I may not be able to produce the rest of the series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3yr9?context=5)|We'd be happy to look at your strip. We are publishing others in your situation. I'd assume that you'd be paid an advance, so that would help you complete your series.

[I'll take that as a yes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm53yr?context=5)|Take it however you want. Also, take yourself to a doctor. He can help.
[Since Lone Wolf and Cub, and Samurai Executioner are both being reprinted as an Omnibus, should we expect Path of the Assassin to get the same treatment sometime soon?  Really looking forward to New Lone Wolf and Cub in June. I can't express how happy I am that DH publishes these titles!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm46gw?context=5)|I'm really happy we publish them myself. I chased the license for almost ten years before finally meeting Kuzuo Koike. I think I can safely predict that you will see Path of the Assassin in the Omnibus format.
[It's true, no one would ever trust a female doctor.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm5vjz?context=5)|Speaking generally. Please enjoy your life and find the doctor of your choice. Either sex will offer help.

Have you ever kayaked or canoed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm58gd?context=5)|Yes, but not for about six or seven years. I grew up rafting down the Clackamas river day after summer day. Much sun burn. Great memories.
[Dark Horse is probably your favorite company, but if you had to choose one company, would it be Marvel or DC?  Also, you are awesome, and thank you for all the great comics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm53lj?context=5)|So many great moments from both companies, too hard to pick. I grew up as the silver age of DC was blooming and at the same time Marvel comics began. What a great time that was for a kid who loved comics. We.re trying to capture some of that with our PBS books.
[Awsome ! Thanks for the reply, have you ever thought of creating ""kayak man""? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm64zg?context=5)|No, but I'd be open if someone had a great take.
[Is there any option for Dark Horse to crowd-source publication of final volumes of manga series that were stalled/cancelled because of low sales at the time? I am thinking Cannon God Exxaxion, Satsuma Gishiden, Eden.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm5a64?context=5)|We've thought about it.

A new version on the way.
[A lot of fans of the Alien-Predator franchises feel that the overall Expanded Universe (Video Games included\) continuity is discombobulated. Some even say there are alternate timelines or universes, others say just different continuities and liken it a Choose Your Adventure Book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm54bv?context=5)|We've gone to great lengths to preserve our own continuity. We've even gone back and re-edited books when the film continuity did not match ours. It's our belief that fans of the books want them to be extensions of the existing films, so . . .
[How would you describe continuity as far as Alien-Predator goes, especially how some stories go off in different directions than others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm54bv?context=5)|We're basically starting over with these new books. being careful to keep continuity in line with the Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus films.

Currently I just finished a project with artist Bruce Zick that we've been working on for about 5 years. I was so happy to finally hold copies in my hand.
[Just wanted to say that some of my first books were Darkhorse. A lot of those Star Wars novel adaptations are better than the new movies.

25zffb,28,2014-05-19,What is your opinion on Masters degrees?,aczJWSfan,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25zffb/what_is_your_opinion_on_masters_degrees/,"Hi, I'm an engineering student and there always seem to be a debate among people on the importance of a masters degree in engineering.

Some people argue that if you do a placement or internship then you'll do just as well finding a job and salary wise once out of university as someone who has done a masters without doing a placement or possibly even better as companies value experience. 

I was just wondering what the opinions here are? I know a lot of people might just answer ""well why not do both?"" and the reason against I guess is having to take loans for tuition and living for an extra year rather than getting that all important experience in industry (assuming a good job is found within a year after university)."
25zhbg,91,2014-05-19,IT can mess up stuff too,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/25zhbg/it_can_mess_up_stuff_too/,"Hi TFTS, first post here.

I work as T1 support at $nonprofitorganization (NPO). It's important to mention that the building next to us is another non-profit organization (NPO2) and we support both, while primary being associated with $NPO. However, just as we support both, users (and sometimes computers) switch between these organizations (depending on their work).

One day I get a call from $CEO at $NPO2.
&gt; CEO: I can't ssh to my computer anymore. Could you check what's going on?

&gt; Me: Sure, give me a second.

Some second later after checking the config files, assuming she made a mistake:

&gt; Me: Yeah, that's a windows machine and we don't support SSH for windows.

&gt; CEO: No, that can't be right. There has always been a linux installation on that computer. Are you sure about that?

She starts getting nervous. I remote to the machine and it is in fact a windows installation. Uh-oh.

&gt; Me: I'm currently connected to the machine and it's definitly a windows installation. Are you sure it's the correct name?

&gt; CEO: Yes I am. That's horrible! The work of an entire year is on that hard drive. Please figure out what happened and tell me my data is somewhere.

We end the call. I start searching in the ticket system what happened and find it out. It's like everything that could go wrong went wrong. 

$CEO had previously been a user at $NPO and switched to $NPO2 to become the CEO, while still working on her old stuff. The administrator of her department (budget and hardware) said she can keep on using the machine, meaning she switched the building and her computer was lingering around in some office.

A $luser found the computer, decided that she liked it and put it in her room(until today I don't know how that happened). Because she didn't like the linux installation (why the f*ck did you take it then?) she created a ticket to reinstall it with windows. There was no remark in our database that this computer belongs to $CEO and here's where the mistake happened: the $luser was a student and students never have their own computers - they use group machines. I missed that. $luser is sitting in the student room, but I ordered our intern to go and pick it up, meaning I didn't check the room and was unaware of that. Being a good intern he asked $luser if there is any data on the machine. $luser said no. Intern told me so.

Now, it's not completly my fault, and I only feel half bad for it. She was storing the only copy on a local drive while we offer project folders (including a daily backup) and an awesome backup system for normal machines, but she didn't use them. The same would've happened if the hard drive failed, but it was still me who deleted all the stuff. She ""luckily"" had a 6 months old backup on an external drive, but the rest was still lost. "

Im currently a fourth year Computer Science major, but I'm going to need another quarter to graduate(Dec 2014). During the summer however, I have no plans and a friend can get me an IT internship(basic stuff, help install windows/debug stuff/ tried turning it on or off). My other option would be to get a Java certification. I mainly learned C/C++ during school.

My question is: Do you guys think its more worth it to get experience or a certifcation? my money is with experience, but my dad, a retired programmer of ~5, thinks that getting a Java certification will be more benefical.

Any thoughts?
TL;DR : Intern at a IT company or take Java Cert class during summer?"

I'm currently transferring to University from community college, and I need to make a decision in the next few months that could cost me a lot of money and time. I have the options of 

1. BS in CS, finish school in two years, have a little free time to sleep and do research. 
2.  BS in CS and BA in Computational Mathematics. This would take 3 years of my time and would be much, much tougher to accomplish.

I am taking out some loans for college, getting some grant money, and have some parental help. To go to school for 2 years would cost me roughly 35k in loans. To go to school for 3 years would probably cost me about 55k in loans, maybe more. 

I like the idea of doing just the CS degree and getting out in two years because it'll allow me to enter the job market quickly and begin paying down my loans to rid myself of the debt burden, but I truly love mathematics and I love combining mathematics and computer science. I feel like I only live once and not pursuing the second degree in Comp. Math would be something I dearly regret down the line. 

Anyways, what I'm really consulting you fellas for is advice on whether or not having a Computation Mathematics degree in addition to a CS degree is beneficial, and if it is beneficial, does it outweigh the cost of 20k more in loans and a full year of opportunity cost in terms of building a career.

thanks in advance

- if it helps you at all, I have a 4.0 in all physics/math/programming classes I've taken so far. I've also participated in two internships for major research institutions. I believe I am capable in succeeding in either of the two paths enumerated above."

I have experience in programming in Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, Mysql and other related to it technologies; also other programming languages like PHP, C/C++ (although I already don't remember C++ STL). 


For now, money is not really important for me (I just need enough money to pay a rent and buy some food)."

Gpa: 3.3
Side projects:
-developed and sold multiple html5 games, but used GM:S. Still involved a lot of programming, but in the language the ide uses (close to c++) 
-developed Android game, but again using GM:S ide

Knowledge of languages : some c++, some python, some java

Edit: I should also say that although I want to apply to the major companies, I would also be applying to other companies.  I'd love to know if you think I'd have a better chance at a smaller company..."

In medical school, I suffered from stress and anxiety.  After my medical intern year - with 80hr+ work weeks and ironically really poor lifestyles - I made a commitment to myself.  I wanted to be successful, but I wasn't willing to sacrifice my personal health to get ""there"".

I started coming up with a new way to plan my day, that was very visual and focused on my health - as well as work and other priorities.  The American College of Preventive Medicine outlines 5 main activities we need to perform to have long, healthy lives, and I made those priorities for the planner: Exercise, Sleep, Nutrition, Managing Stress (i.e. meditation, yoga, mindfulness, deep breathing, relaxation) and Love/Social (i.e. spending time with family and friends).

A few friends and colleagues and I teamed up with a professional game and puzzle app development firm in France -renowned for making fun, easy-to-use games - to help develop the interface.

The result is here:

I'd appreciate outside input.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/262a2r/stuck_between_two_very_different_summer/,"I'm a rising senior in college. I've worked part or full time throughout college and every summer, but only low level positions because I couldn't obtain any paid internships and couldn't afford to do anything unpaid. I applied for a bunch of internships this spring and most didn't work out. Arguably the most appealing one is in my home city. I didn't hear back for ages until last week (despite cold calling twice to check my status), when I received an email notifying me that I was in the final selection group.

In the meantime, I had already committed to a sports opportunity in another city, thinking that I was not going to be offered the job. I'm a D1 athlete and this is a huge opportunity for me to advance myself in my sport and have a shot at the collegiate level national team this summer. I also have Olympic aspirations but I'm not sure if it's worth the years of full-time training and financial struggles after college when I could be getting started in my career.

I haven't heard the final word on the internship, and obviously if I don't get it I'm going to follow through on my sports opportunity. I've tried applying for internships in the other city but it will be difficult if not impossible to manage with my training and competition schedule. Besides, its late in the process and there are very few appealing or convenient openings.

I'm not sure when I find out about the internship in my home city, but if I am offered the position I face a serious dilemma. It's *very* well paid, to the tune of exceeding my moderate amount of student loan debt. I also had really hoped to get internship experience on my resumé before beginning to apply for post-collegiate opportunities over the course of my senior year. If I take the opportunity, I have to back out on my sports commitment and will let down 3 other athletes and 2 coaches who are counting on me to be there. They will be able to replace me with a less talented athlete if I back out, but that jeopardizes the other 3 athletes chances of making the national team. I report to the other city for training in 3 weeks. I haven't told the coaches about this dilemma yet because I'm not sure what to do.

Appreciate taking the time to read! Any perspective would be really appreciated."

Seeking help asking for a raise to market salary.",Thoonixx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/262pec/recently_employed_first_job_2_months_in_and/,"Kind of in a tight spot with my first job. Enjoying what I do, but struggling to get by and could use some advice. I've seen some really great suggestions on this forum in the past and would appreciate any input.

I just began my first job as a business analyst/systems analyst for a startup. The job requires a mix of programming, consulting, web development, optimization, and analytics. My main role has been working with an industry optimization programming language writing code to assign a distribution of vehicles within regions across the nation. They had been struggling with this for a while before I arrived, but with my background in applied math (and some relevant coursework) this has been pretty simple for me. 

Now I admit, I took the initial offer to start at $34600/year plus healthcare benefits covered up to $400/month. Being previously without work experience (no internships), and hurting for cash while on the job search, I accepted the offer. The CEO had interviewed me personally and I thought he was one of the better interviewers I'd spoken with which seemed promising. I now work primarily with him and the other owners, along with IT, on some of their larger projects.

Minimum salaries for business and systems analysts around here begin at ~$45k. These guys are very smart, talented individuals with other successful startups, which leads me to believe that they MUST know they are underpaying me. 

It's also been personally difficult moving across the country to LA and with student loan grace periods ending, I cannot afford to live at my current salary. I feel I should ask for a raise up to at least the $45k, but would this be too much given where I am now? Regardless, I can't afford to keep my current rate. 

Is it reasonable to ask for that much?

What's the best way to approach this?

And what if they say no?

What should I watch out for?"

To be honest, I'd much rather work for the company I had my internship with.  The commute would be MUCH nicer (Around 10 minutes rather than 30-60 minutes depending on traffic), and the pay would probably be better.

Should I tell him that I already found a job, but I'm still interested?  Should I tell him I'm interested, but NOT tell him I just started somewhere else?

Should I even apply at ALL?  If I DO apply, how do I handle scheduling interviews if I'm offered one?  I'm not really sure I can take time off for them right now, and I imagine it'd be a terribly bad idea to tell my current manager that I'm taking interviews at other jobs.

With all the experience that there is in this subreddit, I'd greatly appreciate any advice for a fresh graduate. Thanks in advance!

**Background on me:**

* Just graduated

* Currently living and wanting to work in Southern California area

* 4 internships of experience

* Wanting to work in mobile (specifically iOs development)

* Biggest factors in my decision (in order of most preferred): Salary, Location, Employee Perks/Office, Potential Career Development, Company Recognizability



**Here are the comparison of the two options:**

 | Option A | Option B
:--------|:--------|:---------
Company Size | Growing, well-known company | ""Startup"" Mobile app vendor company that is still small at roughly 30 employees. They were formed in late 2013, I believe
Experience With Company | I've been with this company for about one and a half years working as an intern. Started when the company was relatively small, and have seen the company almost triple in size. Currently have a lot of friendships with coworkers (although many aren't in the same department as me) | Met a few members of the team in an interview. Company is led by successful engineers from big companies. Both of the owners have patents and I get a good vibe from them
Company Growth | Job seems relatively stable and growth looks like it won't be slowing down any time soon | They're looking to bring on 20 more employees by the end of the year.
Company Office | Cool company office with modern designs | Typical small office in a commercial business building
Company Location | 15 minutes away | 40 minutes away
Employee Perks | Company parties/outings have been some of the best experiences I've had. Cool employee perks (discounts with partners/services, monthly lunches, yearly holiday party, stocked kitchen with snacks, free on-site cafeteria and gym) | Little to no employee perks, Low-stocked kitchen (free drinks is pretty much it)
Work Hours | Flex Hours | Flex Hours
Base Salary | $5,000 less, but a $5,000 signing bonus for first year | $5,000 more
Yearly Bonus | 10% dependent on performance, but from what I hear, you are not likely to receive it |  20% dependent on performance
Yearly Salary Adjustment | Usually 5-10% | Usually 5-10%
Health Benefits | Medical, Vision, Dental all paid for | Medical paid for, Vision, Dental are optional
401K | Matching up to 5% | No 401K with matching yet, but is expected to be setup by the end of the year
Profit sharing/Stock | Absolutely none | Yes, details after signing
Personal Career Growth | Now that the company has grown a lot in size, I'm not sure there's a lot of chance to move up in the company quickly, not quite sure the current structure would allow me to learn and advance my skills at the speed I'd like (My internship has taught me a lot, but mostly by throwing me into a fire and self-learning) |  Showed interest in mentoring me and developing me as a programmer, *Seems* like I'd have a greater possibility to move up in the company within a few years
Long-Term | Since I feel like the company has little opportunities for advancement, I feel like I would *have* to be moving on to another company within two years to advance my career (but it's two more years of perks, right?) | Unless the company grows large successfully, I can definitely see myself leaving the company for a better position elsewhere within two years
Negotiations | Firm Offer that can't be modified per HR's rules | Supposedly highest offer. The company said this is their best offer since they do not want to go back and forth with negotiations. I'm not sure if this is a negotiation tactic or an honest statement. From what I've read from the FAQ, it seems like I should still try to negotiate.


** EDIT 1: Thanks for the initial feedback. I was actually kind of surprised by the overwhelming advice for Option A. I guess there is a lot of advice against start ups. Anyway, just to provide a little more information that I should have elaborated on earlier.

* The commute actually will be similar, I will be living essentially 50 minutes away from both options until I buy a house (hopefully one year from now) in the location I want to live.

* I've asked for further details into profit sharing, will likely hear back later today.

* Yes, both companies offer the same PTO

* The offers are for roughly $80

* The interesting thing about Option B is that it is a startup, but isn't funded by VCs. Since it is a vendor company, it is running on the funds from its first client, which is actually helping out in the hiring process (since they are paying for the hiring). But then again, the company may also run out of funds if it loses its clients (although it seems like the first client is in it for the long run)."

After some thinking, I thought it would be absolutely amazing to make a decent 3d-""ish"" game that I can show them. For example a basic shooting game or a RPG But then I immediately thought; 

""Which programming languages/programs do I need to learn and use?""

I have 1 full year (5 days a week, from 9 till 5 (excluding free time)) to make it happen. I have about 2 years worth of experience in HTML(5), CSS(3), PHP, Javascript and I have been working with C++ and Java for a couple of months and made some simple things like a blackjack game etc. I've also worked with RPG maker XP quite a lot (I know this doesn't mean much).

I know this won't be an easy task but I'm looking for a challenge.

TLDR: Which programming languages/programs do I need to learn and use to make a 3d shooting game or RPG.

*""Come on, it's time you met the bastard himself.""* Motorcycle IT Guy (MITG) said, walking out of his office. He turned down one of the halls out of the IT Dregs and into the beige maze of offices. I was quick on his heel, since I was an eager little PFY. We turned into a larger bullpen styled area with about fifteen to twenty interns and assistants chattering away. The smell of Coffee and desperation filled the air, it was slightly off setting in a way. MITG didn't wait for me, he turned into another hallway and stopped in front of an office. He motioned me in, and I entered the room. 

*""Who are you!?""* The man screamed at me. He was in his early 70's, with a small stature. He didn't look threatening in the least, what with his artic white hair and glasses. His entire office smelled like cheap cologne, and there was paper littered everywhere. You couldn't take two steps without landing on a pile of papers, his desk was bowed with the weight of a small redwood worth of print outs. 

""I'm rstrt, the new IT tech."" I looked behind me to see MITG nowhere to be found. ""MITG told me to come see you, but didn't tell me why. So what seems to be the problem?"" The man didn't introduce himself, he didn't even look directly at me. It was as if once I said I was IT I became less than human in his eyes, his cold, dead eyes. 

*""The computer crashed!""* He bellowed. I was slightly taken aback by the volume and tone of him talking to me. I glanced at the monitor to see about a hundred Outlook messages open, along with several other programs. *""So fix it! Don't stand there like an idiot.""* I opened my mouth to reply, but didn't get the chance. *""Oh, so you ARE an idiot then. Great, just like the last one.""*

 ""Did you see a blue screen when it crashed? Did it restart?"" I decided it was wise to ignore his verbal attacks, MITG did tell me he was a bastard. 

*""No, I didn't see the blue screen.""* His response was patronizing, at best. *""I said it CRASHED. I was browsing the web and it crashed. Do I need to write this down for you?""*

 I reached over and moved his mouse, reopening the Internet Explorer window he had open, but hidden behind his copious amounts of Outlook mail items. 

""Was this what you were looking at?"" The screen showed an opera house, he was buying tickets for. 

*""God, it's about time you got to fixing it.""* He went back to his browsing and waved me out of the office. I rounded the corner to see MITG leaning against a wall, smiling. 

*""That's Dan, and he's going to be your best friend here.""*

I work close to full time (39-41 hours a week) at a Jimmy John's in my downtown area a couple minutes from my house in addition to school. I downright love it; the work, my coworkers, etc...

...but I'm looking to soon begin something more serious that could possibly give me some insight into a few different fields. With my current schedule, an internship (unless paid) isn't exactly something that I'd find myself interested in.

There's a local computer store called, ""[CLASSIFIED] Computers."" I've been looking around and talking to people, and their positions are in-store hire only (you have to walk in to acquire an application; no online submissions). I am perfectly okay with that, and I believe I'd do well in a considerably professional application acquisition situation. Dress nice, hair's nice, smell and look clean. Possibly a tie, just for the hell'v'it.

So, no problem there. But my issue is not the actual process of filling out an application, it's simply *getting* *hired* as a **sixteen** year old with only one prior job reference (amongst recommendations from current professors).

My background consists primarily of the construction and takedown of computers, but that is limited and I'd love to learn more. I've built my own gaming computer from scratch (purchased all the parts off of NewEgg, assembled it myself) and swapped out a few mobile hard drives on laptops due to file corruption. I can blaze through operations on a computer, type fast (probably doesn't matter), and have no problem ridding a PC of malware or running a defrag... I digress. The bulk of my computer knowledge comes from knowing design programs (Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, InDesign, and Illustrator). I have loads of projects I could possibly input into a portfolio. The last of my computer based knowledge comes from coding in C++. I've got limited experience (just took a semester long class at my high school) yet am furthering my own personal knowledge on it every day through examples and random projects I work on. Arrays, loops, conditionals, variables, functions... it's all familiar to me. I'm going to be taking an AP Computer Science (learning the extensiveness of Java in its entirety) class next year.

I ramble a lot. Sorry.

Nonetheless, here's what I'm asking...

* With my background and experience, what's the likeliness that I can ascertain a position at a computer repair/parts place with my age?

* With my experience, what should I be including in my portfolio with my resume? Should I include any of my artsy projects made in Adobe programs, or do those not apply to these kinds of positions?

* What's a reasonable wage to ask for? (I'm currently working minimum wage and won't mind working minimum wage for another couple of years)

Thank you so much for hearing me out and listening to me in advance. ^^^I ^^^love ^^^you."
2653ve,0,2014-05-21,Need some job advice.,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2653ve/need_some_job_advice/,"So I feel like I'm at the point of no return. Here's a little background as to my situation:

* Graduated in May with a degree in Biological Engineering w/ an Environmental Engineering focus with a 3.0 GPA from a well respected state university
* Internship experience at DOT doing drainage work, a bit of permitting, and some storm water
* Designed and Constructed a Bioretention cell for our senior design project for the City of Wilmington
* Lots of experience in AutoCAD, Microstation, Excel
* Passed the FE in October of 2013

I interviewed with three companies. Two of the three are large well established firms with offices nationwide. The other is VERY small (literally just one PE who owns it, with his brother working as a CAD tech). The company that I really badly wanted to work with does mostly water treatment work (the position was for civil/site development) and I really liked everyone I interviewed with, plus they had compensation for doing part time masters (which I was really want to do in the future). The second larger one seemed ok, but I got a very different vibe from everyone who worked there, the work was not exactly what I wanted to be doing (a LOT of site development for pipelines, oil, and natural gas), but seemed like a decent first job. The third one (with the small company) does a lot of LID projects, site development, and storm water retrofits, which I was very interested in, and got very high remarks from both our senior design mentor (who is well known within the storm water community), and one of the extension specialists who helped us out with our project. 

The first company (the one I really was hoping for) said it was a very tough decision, but they gave the job to somebody else. They did say that I gave a very good interview, and the head of the group said he would love to write me a recommendation if I needed it anywhere else (which was nice). ""Intangibles"" were the reason they gave for picking the other person.

The second company gave me an offer:

* $48,500 with decent benefits (heath, dental, vision, long term disability, life, 401-k)

Due to timing constraints with the offers, the day that I was supposed to give my final word on taking the offer was the day before talking with the very small company about salary and benefits. I ended up stupidly declining the first offer and today I met with the smaller company and they told me that they would be willing to do...

* $43,500 and pay $150 for health insurance/dental/vision, and match contributions into 401-k with standard 21-days off paid per year (including 9 holidays off automatically)

Starting I would be able to have much more responsibility over projects, and I feel like I, overall, would enjoy working there more, but part of me feels like I'm getting duped/I made the wrong decision. This is the only offer I have to work with now (and I already informally agreed to it/shook hands/went out to lunch). Any thoughts? I know this is extremely long and I apologize.

I graduate with a 3.9 in AE and continued on to the master's program, and so far it hasn't been going so great. I've been overwhelmed with TA/classes/research and had to drop several classes and only managed a 3.5 so far. 

If this trend continues and my GPA drops even more by the time I get my master's, how should I put these on my resume? I'd like to have my undergrad GPA on there since I don't have any internship experience, but then leaving off my grad GPA seems weird. I'm hoping I can pull my grades up, but I don't know about it given how hard grad classes are (undergrad was a total joke in comparison). 

I've also considered applying for full time jobs and just taking one if I get a good offer and finishing up my master's later when GPA doesn't matter anymore (I'm not enjoying grad school anyway). 

EDIT: I don't consider a 3.5 a bad GPA, I have only finished 2 classes including an undergrad math class I managed an A in. I'm worried about graduating with a GPA closer to 3.0"

Much of the work (at least my first project) seems that it is going to involve scripting and IDL in a UNIX build environment. Most of my programming experience has been in C++ and Python with some basic MATLAB and Java. I've never written a script let alone IDL, so I feel way in over my head.

Does anyone have any advice for an intern who feels way behind the curve? I'm looking for things along the way of resources, general advice for moving forward, and anything else you guys might have to offer.

What is entry-level, and how do I prepare for it?",Dante2k4,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/266pjk/without_college_how_do_you_train_for_it_what_is/,"Alright, so I have a couple of years sunk in to college, but in my current situation I just can't keep going there, and I *need* to find a job to move somewhere else. So, college stuff isn't in the picture right now... and honestly, I don't really want to accrue *more* student loans anyways.

I took a couple admin classes (Linux/Windows), a couple Hardware &amp; Repair classes, and started in to a bit of networking at the end. Right now, all I know is that I like working on computers, and I think I'd like being a troubleshooter guy. And system administration seems like it'd be nice one day as well.

Thing is, while I got some great info at college, I don't think I'm anywhere *near* trained enough for this stuff. I just applied for an entry-level help desk position, and these were some of the qualifications:

*""Experience setting up and troubleshooting internet conections, modems, routers, etc""*

Well, I've logged in to my router and changed settings a few times. I know how to plug stuff in, setup passwords, find a connection, etc. But that's all pretty basic stuff, yeah? I mean, I don't know if I really have the experience that they're looking for...

*""Comfortable with a linux command line""*

Okay, well, I am *comfortable* with it. I don't remember most of the commands, or the ins and outs, because that class moved through the material *really* quickly, but I know how it works. I mean... how much experience does this sound like I'd need?

*""Experience with Kaseya, Connectwise, or other MSP tools a plus""*

I... don't know what that stuff is. :/


I mean, I don't see entry-level positions pop up very often, but even when I do, they seem to call for a few things that I'm not really sure I actually know. I still apply, because fuck it, who knows? But still... I'm not very confident.

As it is, right now i'm just studying for my A+, because it's a baseline thing, and I see it as a kind of jumping off point. From what I know of certifications, this seems like the most attainable one right now, so I think it's worth going for. Not just for employers, but also for myself, to prove that I actually know something.

Right now I've been going through Professor Messer's videos, which are nice. I'd also like to find an A+ practice exam, but they all seem to cost money, which sucks.

I don't know. I'm in a bit of a pit right now. I sunk money in to those classes, but I'm not sure what I really gained from them. I'm more of a hands-on learner, but I can't get any entry-level jobs because they seem to require more than what I know... so what do I do?

Are there internships for IT jobs? Is entry-level *always* help desk? What knowledge do I *really* need to know for this stuff?

And most importantly, how do I learn it all? I have some spare computers lying around I could work on, but idk what to do. How do I teach myself to be a tech? How did *you* learn to be a tech?

I'm pretty aimless right now. I have no real skills beyond customer service/retail, but even that is hard to find decent work in. This is the only skill I have even the mildest of interests in, so I need to make it work, but I'm not sure where to go with it.

Lastly, I'm not sure where to actually *look* for these kinds of jobs. Right now I just browse Cragislist, but some fine folks pointed me to a site called Dice.com, which I'll be looking at more. I'm fairly close to Portland, OR, so if anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them."

I'm nearing the end of my first year of university and on track to a 2:1 although I despise my environment. Obviously there's some kind of mental disorder going on but I've got nothing to indicate so on paper. I need to seek out mental help, I am not oblivious to this.

Any interests I do have beyond computing are of little value to my impression as a person. I enjoy film &amp; television but I don't have knowledge of cinematography - just a plain consumer. I believe civil liberties are incredibly important but I don't do anything about it.

Something I definitely do enjoy is Java and softeng in general. Despite the lack of any extra-curricular activities on my CV and everything on it being immediately relevant to computer science I have been able to use my github and enthusiasm demonstrated within my cover letter to score a pair of (skype and phone) interviews for Java web development internships. I feel that an internship would do me wonders - I'd be doing what I enjoy and the strict schedule would be healthy. I'd come back to uni with real-world experience, knowing that if I got an internship the first year I can do it the next year. I'd have something to look forward to.

I'm concerned that in an interview scenario it will become immediately apparent I am not a well-rounded individual and simply broken by any standard. I'll be seen as no fun, odd or simply a bad investment and after all they're businessmen, not social workers.

My priority right now is to score an internship so that I may have a summer that is constructive towards my career and hopefully mental/emotional health. As much as I should, and I will, seeking out the help of a mental health professional right now will do nothing to improve my chances of an internship for this summer. The interviews need to be done within the next two weeks and this is already my final and last chance to get an internship for this summer.

I dread the thought of having no employment for the summer and fear I would spend it similarly to how I spent my winter and spring breaks, apathetically doing nothing at all. Maybe I'll produce something noteworthy in terms of programming, or finally talk to a doctor but that's not nearly as constructive as an internship.

Finally, I just wanna reiterate there is no one I know personally that I could turn to that is in position to be of any help. I'm not really sure what I'm up against in terms of other candidates but I don't think the outlook is any good. What could I possibly do before the interview to improve my chances?"

So I graduated recently from a top tier engineering school with a BS in Aerospace Engineering with a 3.62 GPA. All throughout my senior year I had been applying to jobs and had only had three interviews out of maybe 100+ applications. All of those led nowhere since they ""chose a more qualified applicant."" Since graduating I've been searching and applying to jobs every day but am getting really discouraged and desensitized. If I'm lucky I can find 2-4 job postings a day and usually I am not qualified for most (or all) of them. Many jobs seem to require experience and skills that I just don't have. A few days ago I even found an entry level job requiring ""10 years experience minimum"" -- ridiculous. 

It seems that everyone in my major who has gotten a job has gotten it from someone they know in the industry or because they had some really nice internship. Well I don't know anybody in the industry because I was always turned down from internships for not being qualified enough. I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle. I'm living at home with my parents while I'm trying to find a job and every day when they come home from work all they talk about is jobs. They ask me why I havn't found one and talk about how easy it was for them to get jobs when they were my age. The thought of paying off my student loans looms over my head every day as well, and my parents are sure to remind me of it. I wake up in the morning and don't even want to get out of bed. I know I'll do my job search and find that I'm not qualified. For the jobs that I am qualified for, I won't hear back because someone with internship experience or someone who knows an employee will get the job. 

This whole experience has made me feel worthless, like nobody wants me. Any advice on finding aerospace jobs? "

I'm about to graduate from Computer Science and to embark in the job market, hoping to get a moderately decent job and praying to get one of those unicorn remote gigs that will allow me to get something better than $3/hour. Though reading around all the files from this sub I still have a LOT to learn. Quite frankly some of you people scare me intellectually.

Anyway, as part of my coursework I had to do a 3-month unpaid internship at a bank, with the good fortune that I ended doing maintenance  work for one of their pages, usually that involved resetting passwords, deleting duplicate records, all that stuff. The redeeming quality of this was that because this site was internal I had less idiocy to deal with, I've yet to be broken by the idiot users I've dealt with so I still have some hope for humanity, most of the users on the bank use FF or Chrome, which is a good thing because the pages don't play that well with IE, and everyone has been told so. up to the fact that if they absolutely, positively must use the web browser of Satan that they at least switch compatibility mode on. One day back in February the phone rang..


&gt;me: Good evening, how may I help you?

&gt;$worker:Oh, Hi Imaani, I've been having problems around the page, I think it's down, can you check?

&gt;me: Alright *looks over to his monitor*....nope, working pretty well here.

&gt;$worker: Are you sure? I've tried closing the window and opening it again, opening a new tab. Everything.

&gt;me: I see...Tell you what, why you don't send me a screencap so i can check the problem

&gt;$worker: Alright, but I'd like you to check it with $imBoss first

&gt;me: Of course. *hangs up*

No way. $imBoss has me here to soften his workload, if anything I should be solving this. So I do due diligence on the whole thing before escalating it. Refresh the webpage, everything is well; ping it, response times are adequate; call $webAdmin to see if everything's alright, he checks it, it is. Then the E-mail with the screencap arrived.

Naturally, it is IE with compatibility mode off. The shortcut to Chrome is on his taskbar.

I ring him up

&gt;$worker: You solved it already?

&gt;me: Yeah, Open it on Chrome

&gt;$worker: WOW! it's working beautifully, why wasn't it working before?

&gt;me: You know how is it with computers, they do weird stuff sometimes..

&gt;$worker: yeah yeah.

&gt;me: if it happens again, close the tab then open Chrome, that makes it work better because the people at Google made it to work around problems like this.

&gt;$worker: Oh, I didn't knew that, thanks!

&gt;me: My pleasure *hangs up*

As part of the internship I have to submit a report of everything I do, I wrote ID-10-T-B(eginner) as the reason of the error. It passed the report revision

However, in my major (Chemical Engineering), I have noticed that next to no one in at my university gets an internship their first two years unless they actually know someone personally. This is largely got to do with the fact that employers who recruit at our college no what the curriculum is like, and expect us to have taken certain classes before they want us as an intern (i.e. the Thermos, Separation Processes, and Transport...). Sometimes the fact that they want these classes is just generalized as ""We are only looking for 3rd or 4th years,"" and after talking to numerous employers at two career fairs, that is what it ultimately came down to. I will be doing research in the fall regarding drug delivery systems and protein synthesis, but I do not want to run into this internship problem again come next Summer (note, I started applying for internships for this summer, last August, weeks into the school year, modifying my resume as I went and more opportunities became available)... How do I give myself a competitive advantage despite the clear disadvantages that I have with reference to classes?Essentially, other chemE's in my year have gone home and gotten a part time job, or taken summer classes. Either way, it appears to be much harder for my major, and I'm sure with other majors.

This is where it might get somewhat offensive so others, but isn't directly related to the question. How do I explain this to my other engineering major friends who have it much easier? I have a lot of ME friends, and they make remarks to me all the time basically rubbing it in my face that they have a summer internship, and I do not. They take their autoCAD and inventor class their first year, and that is one of the basic skills that employers are looking for.


tl;dr: 
-How do I gain a competitive advantage in getting an internship when the employers are looking for 3rd and 4th years students in my major, and I'm only a second year?
-How do I explain to my other engineering friends that the fact that they have it easier and that there is no need to rub it in they have an internship?

These are things that I wish interns had told me before I started interning (2 internships in at this point)

1. Network hard. So hard that it hurts. Meet so many people, shake so many hands that you when you walk down your office theres not a persons face you don't know. Sit down and schedule short 1 on 1 meetings with them to talk about their careers and role in the company. Go grab some lunch with them, you don't even have to talk about work things, just get to know people, and the sooner the better. I would strive to meet as many people as you can in your first few weeks of being at your company, it makes your conversations more meaningful (you learn more) and interesting for everyone. This is the most important tip. Thats why its #1.

2. Never turn down an opportunity. Whenever you are in a group setting and your boss comes in and says, I need one of you for X, Y or Z, be that person that volunteers to do it. No matter what it is. If your boss is talking to you and you are his only employee ASK for some opportunities that go beyond your traditional role and expectations as an intern. The worst that can happen is that they say no. You will be able to do some really interesting things you typically wouldn't be able to, and you get to add some more meaningful material to your resume which is key. Put yourself out there when looking for tasks from your supervisor. Its kinda like dating, except instead of finding love, you find money.

3. Get to know the other interns. Make them your friends. Go out with them after work, hangout with them, etc. Make these people your friends first and your coworkers second. You are going to be spending the next ~3 months with these people so you might as well enjoy their company. That being said, I would refrain from doing anything highly offensive, illegal, or sexual with your intern friends. They may be your friends first and your coworkers, second, but they are still going to be your coworkers at the end of the day. Don't forget that the next time you decide to get blackout drunk and make out with Jen the hot intern at the party.

Fourier. Listen to the old timers and line workers. These people may look old, sad, crusty, or defeated, hell maybe even all of the above, but they do know what they are talking about. These people are the ones that will be able to tell you wether the part you designed is even manufacturable, or perhaps they have some sort of insider knowledge about your process that could be optimized and you didn't even think about it. They are going to be the ones who make your good ideas great. No one knows better about your product line than the people who are working the line for 14 hours a day. They also probably have some pretty solid stories. 

Maybe you found this helpful, maybe you didn't. If you did, good, go utilize the information you just learned. If you didn't, well, why don't you leave a comment below with anything I may have missed. "

I am interested in applying for the IT internship position at your agency which is listed at Kopra from 2015 April to October 2015.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at the University of Konstanz, Germany, where I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in 2016. During my studies, I acquired a wide knowledge in programming, theoretical foundations and mathematics. During the bachelor's class ""Interactive Systems""‘ offered at my university, I gained various skills regarding web technologies, mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In a team with fellow students, I am also currently co-developing a web-based course submission system for university teachers to facilitate the evaluation of assignments handed in by students, which is the goal of the ""Software Project"" course I am taking at the moment. The university's computer science department focuses on data visualization and analysis. 

I am skilled in fine arts as well as design and took several courses of that matter at the local school of fine arts in order to improve my working techniques and abilities in that field. Since several years ago, I started learning and working with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to design and create flyers, brochures, websites, as well as posters for local clubs and societies.

Gaining more knowledge in web technologies, especially web development and interaction design, would help me to acquire the background necessary for a future job in this field.

I speak English fluently because I am learning it for ten years now, while I also have basic knowledge in French. Furthermore, I am very interested in Japanese culture and language. Since my vacation in Japan in April 2014, I started taking Japanese lessons and practicing the Japanese alphabets.

I believe that I am well-fitted for your program and this internship position would be ideal for me to improve my programming and design skills. Please contact me if you agree that my qualifications are a match for this internship. 

Thank you for your consideration.

26ay5u,1,2014-05-23,Dilemma on Summer Internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26ay5u/dilemma_on_summer_internship/,"Let me start with a description of myself. I'm a sophomore who has only been studying CS since last fall; so I have 2 semesters under my belt. I decided to pursue a summer internship to get any kind of tech experience on my resume. 

So I found an internship online with a big non tech company in my town. The position is IT intern. Basically it's sitting at the help desk and going out to units when there are problems with computers, printers, etc. I know this isn't an attractive job but it's tech related and a really convenient location for me. I found out after applying that I'd be interviewing with my friends uncle, great. So I interviewed and got the offer probably with a little help from my friend. 

Here's where it gets tricky. Another friends dad contacted me 2 weeks ago while I was job searching. He works at a big time tech company. I sent him my resume and he forwarded it to a colleague who was looking for a software dev intern. I should mention that my advisor at my school about a month ago told me to ""stay away from the IBMs and googles"" this summer (this company may or may not be one of those 2..... :p). 

Now fast forward to this morning and I get an email from his colleague saying that he'd like to have a half hour to hour phone interview early next week. As my programming skills are good but not great, I'm not sure how I would do at this job or even in the interview. But I do realize how it's an incredible experience and internship to put on my resume. 

But I also have already signed to work for the IT position. I would not want to terminate that especially because it would be unfair to my friends uncle. It kinda stinks too because it's only a 20 hour job with a lesser salary than the second internship. 

My question is how do I respond to this interview request? Should I accept/decline? What should I expect to encounter in the interview? And if I were to get an offer, what steps do I take after that?

Thanks!"

Talking to others in my year, I feel like I had a really good experience. I worked really hard to learn as much as I could, even during the slow days. I worked side by side with Chinese developers and saw how outsourcing is done. I sat in on the meetings with western clients and really got a good look at the other side of software development.

Even my friends in my year have noticed that outsourcing is a hugely relevant issue right now. Some of them told me their boss was always working to not have their jobs outsourced.

My question is, how much, if any, of an advantage does this provide me? I don't want to be a developer forever, and I think I have the skills to provide smooth communication between Western companies and Chinese developers. Are there many jobs for something like this? Honestly, I have never heard of someone doing something quite like this, so I'm not sure.

High school was a blast - well, most of it, at least. I wasn't the most popular kid, but I wasn't unpopular, either; I just kinda 'hung' with the general group of friends (which was pretty big, about 20 people, but tight), and had a good time. I liked it like that; I'm not a fan of drawing attention to myself (ironic, yeah, but bear with me) and would much rather prefer to be a sheep in a flock, rather than a shepherd.

Then, high school was over, and me and the friends parted ways.  
As an Israeli (boo, boo, f*** you and your country, yeah yeah.), there's mandatory conscription after high school for 3 years (minimum; can be more), but you can do a year of voluntary 'community service' (not the 'pick up trash from the street' kind, the 'lead youth groups and/or volunteer in other ways' kind) before enlisting. Another option is to go to a college of your choice for 3 years (financed partly by the army), complete your BA. or BSc., and then serve for 6 years - 3 mandatory, 3 more as a 'standing army' soldier, who receives regular pay and has some more benefits.  
Many of my friends went with option b (voluntary community service for one year, then enlistment for 3). I went with option c (completing a BSc., then enlisting for 6 years) and so, while they were in communes around the country volunteering, I was studying. This helped push us afar.

Another reason was, I don't really like my friends' style of going out; they're very outdoorsy people who like to travel and hike, and also party people who love going out at night. I'm a very indoor person, who's into movies and videogames. So that, combined with not being very notable in the group of friends, and my tiredness of calling people to ask them what they're doing tonight - why can't they call me for once, invite me? - Led to the fact that I haven't seen my friends for months, and then for a few years. 

So now I'm making an effort to return to the group - any group (as the large group has split) - of friends, through the help of one friend who has stuck with me, bless his kind heart. But every time I go out with people to pubs or cafes (not movies where I can just focus on the escapism), I am reminded of how lonely I am as they recall previous evenings, and the hang-out turns sour for me (though, of course, I never show any signs of that).  
These are usually the evenings where the hypothetical picture of me, putting a loaded gun to my head and pulling the trigger, comes to mind most.

Aside from that, I've never had a girlfriend (I'm shy around girls, and was fat - my highest weight reaching about 300 pounds - before I underwent sleeve gastrectomy surgery in order to lose weight; I'm still overweight, but I lost around 80 pounds since the surgery, and I feel great physically).  
I only kissed a girl once, at a party abroad with the friends from high-school. The way I did it was pretty pathetic, too; through the power of alcohol, I approached a girl who sat alone and after some mild conversation, told her 'my friend' - pointing at a friend nearby - 'and I had a bet, who could kiss the most beautiful girl in the bar. Can you help me win?'. That led to a quick 2-second kiss, the only one I've had to date (I'm 22 now, this happened at 18).  
I can't use Tinder or OkCupid or whatever, since I barely have any photos of myself that I like, or stand, to see, and of course, if I don't like photos of myself, which girl would like them? Even suppose I got a match on Tinder, I wouldn't know what to say, or what to do if the conversation slows down. I find myself boring. (That's partly why I prefer being at the outskirts of groups - I like listening to conversations far more than participation in 1-on-1 conversations, or being the center of an evening).

Of course, never having had a girlfriend means I never had sex, or anything close to sex (I don't want to use a hooker, for a myriad of reasons). But that's the least of my problems; if I have friends again which I can rely on, if I have a girlfriend who loves me (or at least acts convincingly enough), I can live without that.

What else? I'm constantly hounded by the thought of what would happen if any of my family members died; I fear for my dog, my adoring and wonderful dog, who's age 10-ish (we're not sure, since she's adopted) and already showing signs of age; I have imposter syndrome regarding my work (I've enlisted after finishing my BSc. and am working - or at least, am supposed to work - as a programmer) - I'm currently in an internship stage, but I fear my skills aren't good enough or that I'm too lazy or both. Oh yeah, and I have nearly no real-life knowledge of finances/cooking/anything (I'm not even entirely sure how to swap a flat tire).

My first guard duty is about to come up soon, my first time with a rifle since boot camp. I'm considering pushing the magazine inside, cocking and making a go for it."

At both meetings, they admitted they made a computing error and that my daughter should have been named valedictorian, but they refused to change the results and correctly name her valedictorian.

26dgza,2,2014-05-24,Boss wants me to study,Daylen,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26dgza/boss_wants_me_to_study/,"Hey guys,

Some time ago I accepted a job as a web developer. I get paid pretty much nothing (if you calculate taxes and everything I end up about €2 below minimum wage for people younger than I am, I don't think it's even legal), but it was a job and I needed it. I was promised that in 3 months I'd be able to sign a contract with normal pay as they just didn't know me yet and I had no references.

Now the 3 months are over and my boss sent me an e-mail with the following;

- July 1st they're going to upen up a new office (current one is at boss' home who just had brain surgery so that office can't be used until boss recovers (too much stress))
- They've been monitoring me, I'm a good programmer but planning and structure aren't good enough
- I can go study for developer
- If I do, I can keep working there to get more working experience

Basically, either I go study or they kick me out.

Now, I accepted the job purely because I was having a kid and I was unemployed. I would've said no straight away except my dad told me not to, and then they offered the below-minimum pay as compensation for the 3 months 'internship'.

Before that I was planning on simply expanding my own company. I had a base that was pretty decent and could've easily gotten that to a highly profitable business.

Now in the past 3 months I've had no time to work on my business; I have no new projects and the customers that use my services basically pay less than what hosting the services costs me.

So I have two options;

- Keep working for boss, boss is a cool person with a decent company. I'll have to go study, end up with a mediocre pay (the best payed programmer gets about half of average in the country, average of programmer in the country is twice average income). Until I finish the study I will simply be working my ass off for nothing, I can't even buy diapers from that. No risk, no reward.
- Take my company seriously. I have 3 customers but that's it. I have no website, no real administration, no portfolio, no nothing. I could build up a website with a way to easily gain customers in a week and I can hire my sister to to the administration. High risk but potentially very high reward.

For now my parents are very supportive. They let me, my girlfriend and our 3-month old daughter live in their house for free, they pay for everything we can't (including food, diapers and clothing) and they help us cover things like insurance. If I get a real plan my dad would help me build up my company, but he'd rather I just stick with my boss because it's safer.

What would you do in my case?"
26dlsj,1293,2014-05-24,TIFU by shutting down an entire airline in 1997.,BikerJedi,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/26dlsj/tifu_by_shutting_down_an_entire_airline_in_1997/,"While in college, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I got a job at now defunct Western Pacific airlines. It was basically a paid internship to do all sorts of computer related stuff. They were a small airline based in Colorado Springs, CO, and then later in Denver. They attempted to take over Frontier airlines and went bankrupt in 1998.

One day before I left work, my boss gives me several long Ethernet cables and tells me ""Go patch in the new modems into the computer network."" So I head down to the data room.

Now, I think it is important that you know that I had only been in a real data room twice before, and I had never worked in one. For those that don't know, they have raised floors so you can run cables under the floor tiles, lots and lots of racks of computer equipment, tons of AC to keep it all cool, etc.

Anyway, I walk in, find the modem bank, find several modems that have no cables attached. I look at the ones that are wired in, follow the cables, figure out where they are plugged into, and wire up the new modems just like those. Then I replace the floor tiles I pulled up and head home for the day.

The next day I come in to work after class is out and my badge doesn't work. The guard tells me to wait. A minute later my boss and two security guards show up and escort me to the CEO's office. Inside the office, besides the CEO, are the CIO, CFO, my boss and the two bosses above him. They start questioning me.

What did I do yesterday at the end of the day? Did I get the modems working? Did I remove floor tiles? Did I notice anything out of the ordinary? Long story short, I had somehow kicked loose the power cable for the main pyramid server that ran the airline. So for 45 minutes, WestPac could do nothing. They couldn't sell tickets, make reservations, board planes, take off, etc. Nothing. I was told I cost the airline somewhere near $200,000. I don't know if that is accurate or not. Eventually someone noticed that the server had no power and plugged it back in.

I didn't lose my job over that. They all had a good laugh, and admonished me to be more careful in the future. I suggested that they find a way to lock the cable down, but they rejected that idea.

My main interest is computers (built my own, used to be a frequent /r/buildapc poster if that tells you anything)

I have some experience in my field (mini internship with Toms Hardware) 

Since it's a summer thing, I'm looking for anything from sales to delivery tbh. From what I've seen, the only jobs in my area seem to be targeted towards females (nail salon jobs/hostess and such) or long term residents (delivery jobs require knowledge of the area, which I have none of)

I'm alright with minimum wage I guess (I won't be too picky, but more than minimum would be great)

Just looking to hear what some of you think, I hope you can help me with my job search by giving me some pointers as for what I should be looking for.

Me? I have been rejected from every single place I applied to and have been called a failure. Now I have given up.

Even those bloody ""non-profits"" and charities where they pay their CEOs 6 figure salaries and their interns nothing. Why? Because it is in human nature to be greedy and selfish. The very act of competition means to stamp out the weak and that is how nature functions. I am WEAK and I am scheduled to be stamped out sooner or later...  I have no desire of living in a corrupt and injustice world where where liars and sociopaths are rewarded and the rest are trampled on and exploited. I don't want the government to have the luxury of taxing me to death to continue to support their illegal wars and assassinations in other countries rather than attending to the needs of their own struggling citizens.

I have no friends who can support me. Not even my god damn parents support me. My parents said that if I can't snap out of my ""current mindset"" I might as well ""jump in front of a speeding train"". Yeah its always like that with them.  My parents always had high expectations and only ever saw me as a tool to support their desires so that they can gossip with their friends and family.

So here I am now. Alone in my flat for another week and thinking of ending it all...because whats the point of living anymore...? This world couldn't care less if I lived or died... I never asked to be born in this HELL on earth so why do I have to be obliged to keep living and pleasing other people?

I hope to take a grad-level CS class next semester on scientific computing (it includes molecular dynamics; my primary research interest).
Also not interested in MS in CS; even Google, Amazon, etc. don't appeal to me as much as modeling rxns for pharma companies or something.

The situation; I'm late to research:

- ~1 year of computational research (ChemE advisor). My first paper (probably not 1st author) will probably NOT be accepted by when I apply.
- Interdisciplinary computational research internship this summer at a federally funded R&amp;D center. No clue if it'll be publishable work.
- GRE: First practice tests showing around V: ~160 / Q: 165+. I have about two months to perfect this.
- GPA: 3.5x right now
- Web-startup, hackathon/code contest wins - who cares? See below

I'd like to believe my work in code could somewhat offset a ""lower"" GPA (BUT HEY, everyone's busy!). The difference is that I spent more time on that, while others (wisely?) spent their time on coursework and pure ChemE research. In the lab and stuff. A little regret here.

ChemE programs certainly won't care about my CS work! I'm wondering if the newer computational engineering programs WILL, though. These have been starting up in the past decade for engineering with a computing spin, and I love the idea.

- For instance: Stanford ICME (with chemE research) vs ChemE 
- For instance: MIT CSE (with a chemE option) vs ChemE

(Not that I expect to get into the above, but you get the idea now)

And would chemE letters of rec would be less meaningful for  computational engineering department apps? Though at both research sites, I do computational work... What if I have a chemE prof as my 3rd? Would a CS prof be better for computational engineering?

-also does anyone know any programs that really excel in chemE simulations? Perhaps outside the famous top10 range? :)"

I'm a student about to enter college this fall, intending to study Computer Science and I was wondering what advice you might have for how I could best position myself during my first semester to be competitive for some kind of software development internship during the summer after my freshman year?

I know it might be a bit early to start thinking about next summer, but from my research it seems programming internships are competitive to begin with, and of course I will also be at a disadvantage as a freshman applicant competing with upperclassmen with more experience.

For context, the school I'm going to be attending is an Ivy League university with a small but well-respected CS department. I also already have a few years of programming experience under my belt, with a few small side projects online and on GitHub. This summer I also will be interning (unpaid) with a very early stage (read: not yet launched) startup in my area, as a web developer.

With all this in mind, do you have any suggestions for things to do this summer, classes to take this fall, or specific internships to apply for next year (I understand certain companies have internship opportunities specifically for freshman and sophomores)? Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

This'll be my first build. I'm starting to plan it out now, but I'll actually be building it in August when my internship is over. I don't have any plans to overclock. I planned to spend about $1000 (flexible) not including monitors/keyboard/mouse. 
A few questions:
*Should I buy thermal paste?
*Do I need the CPU fan? Or will the stock one do?
*I noticed that Newegg's got a promotion going on for $15 off on the case, $20 on the PSU, and $20 each on the monitors that ends tomorrow. Is this something I should jump on today, or can I expect similar prices to pop up over the next 2 1/2 months?
*More generally, is it safe to watch for sales on these parts and pick them up gradually over the summer, or should I be worried about defective parts and expired warranties when I actually build in August?
*My school offers a Windows 8.1 Professional upgrade download for $20. I've seen some guides floating around for a clean install from an upgrade disk for Windows 7 and 8. Will I be able to do something similar?"

This'll be my first build. I'm starting to plan it out now, but I'll actually be building it in August when my internship is over. I don't have any plans to overclock. I planned to spend about $1000 (flexible) not including monitors/keyboard/mouse. 
A few questions:

* Should I buy thermal paste?

* Do I need the CPU fan? Or will the stock one do?

* I noticed that Newegg's got a promotion going on for $15 off on the case, $20 on the PSU, and $20 each on the monitors that ends tomorrow. Is this something I should jump on today, or can I expect similar prices to pop up over the next 2 1/2 months?

* More generally, is it safe to watch for sales on these parts and pick them up gradually over the summer, or should I be worried about defective parts and expired warranties when I actually build in August?

* My school offers a Windows 8.1 Professional upgrade download for $20. I've seen some guides floating around for a clean install from an upgrade disk for Windows 7 and 8. Will I be able to do something similar?"

I'm a 20 year-old female who is addicted to benzodiazepines, specifically Klonopin (but also have used Xanax and Ativan). I have really severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I quit taking drugs in late April cold turkey when I was taking about 10-15 mg of Kpin a day (I should've tapered, I know). I had really bad withdrawal that landed me in a mental hospital because the anxiety was so bad. I've been in a psych ward once before for something similar. I take Zoloft for depression/anxiety and Ambien to sleep.

 This past year has been the worst of my life. 1 year ago, I was a sophomore at a very good university with a really prestigious government internship in the field I would like to work in when I graduate. After going to the hospital 2 times and developing this addiction, my GPA, which used to be really good, fell, I lost my internship, many of my friends, and am now stuck at home for the summer. I was feeling okay at school, but now that I'm home I'm a mess.
I still have a lot of Klonopin left and want to take some so badly. I should have gotten rid of it, but I guess it was a way to subconsciously hold onto my addiction longer and have a safety net.
What do I do? I've tried so many different medications and Zoloft has worked best, but I cannot seem to shake this. I've done therapy (still do), never forget my meds, and try really hard. Sometimes the anxiety or depression is so bad I feel like I'm going to internally explode, jump out of my skin, something. I almost physically cannot bear this."

(xpost from r/cscareerquestions),[deleted],Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/26i0bz/what_to_put_on_a_resume_when_youve_switched/,"Hey guys! I've read through resume threads and haven't really found what I'm looking for. Basically, I'm wondering if experience in another field is preventing me from getting interviews for computer science internships. 

A little background - I'm a second year computer science major who switched to a bachelors in CS after finishing an associates in journalism (I didn't find writing challenging enough, now I'm right where I need to be with computer science).

The problem is... I have a ton of internship and management experience with journalism and a resume very sparse with formal CS employment. And I can't get an interview.

I completed two full-time internships with papers as a writer and editor. I also acted as an interim manager for a local paper after their managing editor suffered from a heart attack and died.

I've managed teams of 6-15 people, overseen operations, am competent and literate and can program. I know 4 programming languages, have project experience, have my own blog/website, etc.

Would I be better off taking all of my journalism experience off the resume? My resume is strong and can get me interview is any other field... but I need something related to my field.

I even applied for a technical document specialist where the qualifications were journalism/writing experience and working towards a degree in CS. Couldn't even get an interview there, when I feel like I was cookie-cutter what they were looking for.

Any help would be appreciated!"

During my internship I've been playing with frontend/webdev stuff (PHP, AngularJS, ...), but it seems to me that relative to the Java's and .NET's of the backend/enterprise stuff the pay really is worse. This appears to be mainly because webdev shops tend to be a lot smaller and relatively easy to get into. 

So I guess my question is this: what is currently the best bet to follow as a career in terms of income and stability ? Where should I really specialize ?"
26ivm1,12,2014-05-26,Stuck as a caretaker shut in at 22,sadthrowaway52514,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/26ivm1/stuck_as_a_caretaker_shut_in_at_22/,"I've been in this situation for 4 years now and I don't think I can do it anymore. 4 years ago, my disabled great aunt moved in with me and my parents. I could see that my mother was overwhelmed taking care of her, so I decided to go to a local university and live at home to help take care of her.

There have been ups and downs over the years, but the bottom line is my mother relies on me too much. She leaves the house for 6+ hours a day and I'm stuck at home taking care of my aunt. She refuses to hire someone to watch her even though Medicare would probably cover it. When I explain my frustration to her, she says that she needs to get out of the house and that I can go out whenever I want to. But whenever I go out, after about 1 hour, she seems a barrage of text messages asking when I'll be home.

I have spent my entire college career stuck at home in my bedroom. I have developed pretty bad social anxiety because I've been out of touch with the world so long. I don't know how I will find a job with no internships, jobs or relationships with professors.

I no longer have any sympathy for my mother because she doesn't do anything to help anyone but herself and refuses to hire anyone to help. I wanted to go on a short 4 day vacation this summer, but my mother freaked out and said I couldn't go alone. I'm 22. 

I want to see a therapist but I don't have health insurance and I only have $1000. Most low-cost therapists in my area want $75+ a session. I've been to my college counseling center, but they only offer 3 free sessions (and they weren't helpful).

Even if I graduate college in the spring, it will still take me several months to find a job and save up enough to move out. I can't take another year of this. I don't see any way out of this.

I am just so, so sad. I have no fight left in me and no desire to live. I know that things will get better in the long run, but I am struggling so much right now. I don't have my own identity anymore. I don't have the energy to say ""fuck you"" and go on vacation and do whatever I want. It's so hard to wake up every day. This house is literally a prison."

* Country of purchase: USA
 
* Budget range: $1000~1500
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Portable, Ultrabook class
 
* Screen size preference: 13"", going up to 15"" okay
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I plan to install Ubuntu (primary) and keep a Windows partition (secondary)
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Not a big concern. Awesomenauts at 30fps or PCSXR at a playable framerate would be nice but not necessary.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Toughest things I will be running are MATLAB code (graduate research) and working with a large Java codebase (internship).
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self support
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): Probably not Apple (generally frustrated with OSX), not HP (previous laptop has had 2 batteries die suddenly in 4 years)
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): The rMBP 13 looks fantastic (bar OSX), large click/trackpads are nice (I'm a tap-to-click guy)
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Low weight (slightly favored)

* Great audio: No
 
**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

One of HDMI or VGA, preferably both.

At least an FHD screen (Bigger is better). I'm sick of my previous laptop's 1280x800 screen.

~~--------------------------------------~~

A lot of my usage will revolve around having a half dozen chrome tabs open, a few Intellij or Matlab editors running, maybe an IRC client, jumping from workspace to workspace in Ubuntu3D. Intellij work is a lot of code editing, unit rest running, gradle deploying. A lot of the Matlab code I work with is resource-hungry, but I generally have a smaller dataset on my machine then deploy to a remote for the full runs. I'm not huge on note-taking during class, but I do like to be able to get some work done during/between lectures on battery.

The t440s has my attention for its solid build quality and price point. Specifically, I'm looking at customizing this from Lenovo (via B&amp;N discount):

* Processor: 4th Gen Intel Core i5-4300U Processor

* Display: 14.0"" FHD IPS

* Memory: 4 GB DDR3L - SDRAM 1600MHz Base

* Hard Drive: 500GB Hard Disk Drive, 7200rpm

* Micro Hard Drive: 16GB M.2 Solid State Drive Single

* Rear battery: ThinkPad Battery 3 cell rear

* Wireless Card: Intel Dual Band Wireless 7260AC

And dropping in a [Samsung EVO SSD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147249&amp;cm_re=Samsung_EVO-_-20-147-249-_-Product) plus 4GB of RAM after the fact for a total cost of about $1360 before tax.

However, as I mentioned in my title, I've been reading a lot of horror stories about shipping times on Lenovo customs being very drawn out (I can deal with it if I get the laptop before mid-August for the new semester) as well as unacceptable quality differences between LG (shite) and AUO (pretty good) screens being put into assembled units -- uncharitably referred to as the screen lottery because there's no way to control which you get and fighting support to get the AUO is a PITA (I'm not up for replacing the screen myself)

The rMBP 13"" line looks good as well (UNIX environment and I can use my company's AppleTVs for demos, yes please!), but I have a hard time stomaching:

* The price. With a student discount, the midline 13"" model comes in at $1400 before tax (plus a little to pick up mDP adapters for VGA/HDMI, plus a bit more if Apple has somehow locked out third party adapters). This puts it just above the t440s, and I trade 256GB of drive space for a Retina display. Potentially worth it.

* Interacting with the OS, coming from Ubuntu. I currently have a loaner from my work for the summer, and so far I'm unimpressed with the experience. OSX conflates the command key with the other modifier keys (see: ctrl+c, alt+tab, super == com+c, com+tab, com+space) although this might be fixable with some rebinding apps. I haven't found a way to do window snapping yet, the maximize button is weird, I can't middle-click to bury a window, can't alt+drag to move windows, etc. ... it's all really petty stuff but it adds up when I'm interacting with it all day.

Lenovo's t540p also looks tempting with the 3K IPS screen, but it's a bit heavy for my tastes and I really don't need/want a numpad (especially when it uncenters me from the screen).

Specifically, I'd be interested on feedback about the following:

* Shipping times with Lenovo custom builds

* Screens on the t440s line 

* Alternative choices that are comparable to the t440s and rMBP13 (in terms of specs or screen)"

During my time in college, I set up sights into 3 possible places after I graduate:

-------
Doing an internship with a state representative

Doing an internship with an advocacy group

Working as a local canvasser

-------

Of the three, 

I will need to contact the interviewer to say that I'm done with school and that I am able to bring my full undivided attention towards interning for their campaign for state representative.

The canvassing job was willing to hire me, and the things I need to do will be set up sometime next week, I can still decline the job if I choose not to work over there.

The advocacy job won't start until I get e-mails. Seems the e-mail will take some time... so not sure if I want to risk everything on that when the possibility of getting it isn't guaranteed, although I do know the people doing the internship (sort of.)

I would much prefer that I work under the representative's campaign as an intern and work my way up through there, but I am uncertain if I'll be able to get it for the current 6 months that the campaign will be going for. I would love to work as a fellow for the advocacy group too if the option to interview and such came out sooner. The canvassing job is basically my last resort (it is paid, and it'll be valuable experience in speaking.)

Of my favorable choices, it would be campaign internship&gt;advocacy fellow&gt;canvasser. Of the three, only the canvassing job would be paid, the other two will be mostly as internship and a possible leg up into the portions of the degree that I do want to get into.

The likely scenario, as time goes by, is the canvasing job, even though it sounds like something I don't want to do, do I really have a say in it.... and should I just take the job because it is paid?"

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for breaking into infosec. I am currently 28, and will be graduating with a computer science degree from an ABET accredited school.

I have plenty of unprofessional experience, mostly linux-based and am familiar with distros such as Kali. I have two listings on osvdb.net and in my spare time like to keep current with the latest threats and trends. I am proficient in GNU C, C++ (for windows), java, and python, though not an expert in any.

All that being said, I have no professional experience. I work for a surety company (think insurance) as an account manager, which is like a cross between underwriting and clerical support. I maintain tons of sensitive data - social security numbers, credit cards, bank statements, etc for our clients, so I'm hoping that gives me at least a nod  from a company that I do have good ethics. 

I am not sure if any of this helps any, which is why I am asking advice. I have kids to support and leaving my job for an internship is pretty much out unless I could do it over a couple weeks or so. I am not getting any younger and would like to get out of my current industry and do something I actually enjoy, now that I finally will have a degree. Would and certifications help? I know the big ones like CISSP require professional experience, putting me in a catch-22 situation.

Any advice?

26m9yf,2,2014-05-27,So this month has major ups and downs....,PattyQuake,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/26m9yf/so_this_month_has_major_ups_and_downs/,"Hey long time lurker, never felt the need to set up an account. That is until this month... happened. I feel this may be a long one so bear with me.

I am a senior set to graduate this December. I'm in the middle of spring term when at the beginning of May I get a phone call from my mom. Now my parents and I don't talk very much, they're well off and pay for my siblings education. But they don't approve of the college I enrolled in (They wanted me to go to a closer one, I'm still in-state though), so they don't cover mine. Which is fine. I'll make my own path. So I work full-time too.

Anyway, I receive a call from my mother and she informs me that my grandpa is now on hospice care and that doctors estimate he has 6 months. Needless to say but I'm crushed. Everyone loves their grandparents and this man is no exception. The next day I go to work and the soonest time I could schedule time off was memorial weekend. So I put in time off request, so I could go and see him. the next week goes off without a hitch. I attend a career fair, get some excellent job and internship opportunities. I apply, follow up with emails, and see if I get any opportunities. I get one email back out of the probably twenty I sent out. I've gotten an interview for a software development position! I'm ecstatic and excited (I've worked in retail for the past 3 years, and I've been working min wage since I was 16, the prospect of not living paycheck to paycheck is invigorating). 

THE VERY NEXT DAY, I'm sitting on the sofa after a very long day of school and work with my gf and roommate, my mother calls me again....

My grandfather passed away. 8 days after he was placed on hospice, he was gone. And I didn't get to see him or say good-bye. 

I called in to work and told my boss I needed a day which he was perfectly fine with. I emailed my professors and informed them, they also were very understanding, for which I am so grateful. His celebration of life is May 17th.  I cancel everything and reschedule.

May 14th, I have my interview. And it could not have gone any better! I'm not done but I've progressed to the next stage which is the technical interview. I feel confident in my basic skills and the company I interviewed for is rated high and they treat their employees well, with excellent pay. It's truly exhilarating. I've been working on my BS for 5 years (23M), been paying out the nose to achieve this, and I can see the finish line. 

May 17th I get up at 5 am, jump on a plane and arrive at my destination all fine without a hitch. My dad picks me up, I ask him how everyone is doing... ""not the best, as you'll see."" We get to the place where the celebration of life is being held and I see lots of familiar faces. Smiles, and tear stained cheeks. I joined them. I mourned the loss of my grandfather. But that wasn't the painful part. 

Listening to people talk to him, listening to my mother speak about him, her memories, the pain and loss in her voice. My family was in tears. Everyone. After the ceremony we went and visited his resting place. After that weekend I've had my fill of death mausoleums and cemeteries. 

A few days later I get an email. It's from my the lady who interviewed me. She says she'd be happy to help me plan and space out these interviews to coincide with my graduation. I take it this is a good sign. very uplifting. 

May 22nd, I got let go from my job. My boss let me go because I had the lowest numbers and ""it seems that work isn't a priority"". Well no, school has always been my priority. That was never in question. But I never brought my school to work. The company I worked for is bleeding. It's a sinking ship and all the bosses know it. They come up with all these plans to somehow save the company and cutting employees is one of those ways. Why was I chosen and not someone else? I don't know, maybe my attitude changed after my interview. Maybe I got caught looking ahead.  Fortunately I  have a small amount of money saved up but it won't last for long. Now I get the fun task of finding a job to last for the remainder of my college career. 

Today, I'm sick. I didn't sleep last night. even with nightquil. My nose was so plugged I couldn't breathe. This morning took dayquil in some vain attempt to relieve my symptoms. Now I'm pretty sure it's the only thing keeping me awake.

I apologize if this is lengthy. I needed to rant. thanks for listening.

TL;DR grandpa died -&gt; had great interview with greater feedback -&gt; celebration of life is easily one of the most painful experiences ever-&gt; poised to have a job straight out of college-&gt; lost current job-&gt; SICK AS FUCK. 

Have a good day."
26mgy2,0,2014-05-27,Negotiating pay for an internship,SnazzyOne,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/26mgy2/negotiating_pay_for_an_internship/,"I just received an offer letter from two companies I applied for an internship position for. 

Internship 1. 
Related to automotive audio technology. It is about an hour away from my home 30 mins from school (given I decided to dorm next year). I was offered 16 /hr 

Internship 2.
Computer tech which can lead to a sales engineer position later on around 20 mins from home 40 minutes forms school. Was offered 15/hr mon -thurs. 

I am a bit more interested in internship 2 however for both I expected a bit more around 17/hr for the first (given the distance I would have to commuted) and 16/hr for the computer tech position. 
The question is basically how do i go about possibly negotiated a better pay for either internships? I am a computer Engineer major with about 2 semesters left. "
26mihd,10,2014-05-27,My one year vacation as a Game Developer...,TigerX1,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/26mihd/my_one_year_vacation_as_a_game_developer/,"
Let me explain you my plan before you think that I'm implying that being a Game Developer is easy.

I'm from Brazil, and currently I have a pretty busy routine. I'm finishing my Bachelor Degree in Business Administration, will be concluding it by July 2015; At the same time I'm cursing a Two-year career college in Game Development, which will also be finishing in July 2015; I'm also working at two jobs, one Internship in the International Trade of an Import/Export company and as part-time Business Consultant for the Building Company of my family (Believe me it's the hardest one of them all!)

In two-year career college they are giving the Jack-of-All-Trades deal; We are learning 3D Modelling/Animation in Maya, Texture and Concept Art on the Photoshop(with NDO for Texture), Basic of C++ Programming aimed at game development, and we are learning the ins and outs of UDK(Probably will be changing to UE 4 soon); It’s a pretty solid course and there is plenty of subjects that I haven’t started(Audio, Debugging,…), it’s considered one of the bests here in Brazil and I’m pretty satisfied with it. Specially because I’ve been selected as a Texturer for a commercial project by the school itself. In my spare time I’ve also learned the basics of Good GDD elaboration (Business Administration is so similar to this you wouldn’t believe it) and I’ve been doing small tutorials in Unity(Pong, Brick Breaker, Mine Field,…)

Anyway, my goal right now is to gather enough money so I can take one year vacation, after I finish my colleges, where I will be only focusing on making my games. I’ve made a pretty decent personal finance calculator and I’ve established the amount of money needed for my personal living.

Now, I need you guys help me to estipulate the costs of working  as a self-funded Indie developer, in order that by the end of that period I can have my first published game.

Here some things I’ve already decided:

-	I will not make it alone, and have found one other partner who is willing to the same plan, so every cost will be split between us
-	We will be using UE 4, since is the Engine where I have more experience and seems as the better for option for the kind of game we want to make
(USD 19,00/month * 12 = USD 228,00)
-	We will be buying Ikinema license to substantially diminish the Time spent in Animating and Rigging
(USD 19,00/month * 12 = USD 228,00)
-	We will be buying the Quixel Suite, in order to have access to the MegaScans technology
(USD 249,00 Indie License)
-	We will be using ZBrush and Adobe Photoshop to 3D Modelling, Texture and other arts; It’s the more logical since I can get them free
-	We won’t have any expenses with location, internet and energy; Since I’ve already managed a sweet deal to use a friends office during the nighttime until the early hours, and I have second location, internet and energy with zero expenses as well in the bag, just in case something happens.
-	We already have work capable machines that we will move in the location as soon as we start, but I’m considering at least another five hundred bucks for maintenance, and that’s very optimist because he has some contacts in the Hardware department.

That’s what I have so far. I’m working on the marketing money and thinking the options we have, it’s what scares me the most because we won’t be able to be attending Indie events on other countries so easily. We are also deciding on three finalists GDDs that we have created; one as First-Person Arena combine with puzzle solution, the second one is a turn-based procedural generated urban post-pandemic survival and the third is an Open-world third-person story driven adventure. As you can see they are very ambitious projects, and one my current thoughts is to lower my goal to have a published goal by the end, to be able to make a playable prototype so we can get a pledge fund, be it private or public.

What your opinion? Are there in other costs that I’m not seeing? I’m doing something wrong? 
Please help us plan this dream of ours, so we can truly achieve it."

[Did you ever have a case where children clearly should not have been removed from household in the first place? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs9wb6?context=5)|All the time. The state has an obligation to try to offer services before they attempt to remove a child. That is one of my biggest arguments at the 72-hour pick up hearing - leave the kid in the house, let the parent comply with services, and keep an eye on the situation.
 |Probably the worst cases where there shouldn't be removal are with medical neglect cases. Kids have complicated medical needs, and social workers aren't always the best at identifying when there was issues. One kid of a client reportedly had scabies, but they were at the doctor two days before the removal and the doctor didn't note it. But the kid was removed anyway even though they had been getting on-going medical care for her. 
[What's the worst parenting job you've ever seen? Also, have you ever seen such an unfair trial that you were upset by it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7l1r?context=5)|Hmmm... tough to say. I think some of the worst have been people who live in houses with tons of people running around, doing drugs, and making drama are pretty situations to figure out are unsafe. One family was grandparents with adult children and other children. The adult children had kids. Everyone was doing meth together. Every kid in that house, regardless of parent, got removed.
 |Having 13 kids is rough, too. Pretty impossible to parent that many kids in a city and being in poverty.
 |But probably the worst was a delusional schitzophrenic. The kid was almost ten, couldn't do buttons or a zipper, and was convinced his mom was a terrorist. Like a real terrorist.
 |As for trials, you'd be surprised how few the issues are contested and trials happen. But I lost one and the decision was basically because my guy hadn't parented before. I thought ""you can say that about any first time parent!!""
[Could you elaborate on that one ? It seems abviously idiotic to render a decision based on that argument.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chseoya?context=5)|The case is on appeal right now, so we will see what a higher court has to say!
 |The problem was that this case went to trial and the state did a terrible job proving its case. There were allegations my client had other issues - for example, the mother said that they did drugs together.
 |Rules of evidence applied at the trial and I used that to my advantage. The only witnesses called were my client (no 5th amendment rights like in criminal cases because it is a civil, not criminal, proceeding) and the social worker. I knew the social worker hadn't done any work on the case and would be near worthless.
 |So the only testimony that meant anything was what my guy said on the stand. He didn't admit to having any issues.
 |But the judge knew there were other allegations and didn't feel comfortable, in her gut, to place a baby girl with a middle age dude who chopped wood for a living that she knew nothing about. So, she made her decision on what she wanted and tried to work through the evidence to get there.
 |But the state put on such a bad case that she had to make a very weak decision. 
[I was removed from my mother twice and placed into the Washington State foster care system. Each time I was removed, it was due to her drug addiction and neglectful qualities that often are associated with addiction. My mother wasn't present in my twin brother and my life much. I can remember times when we were both much younger, that she was around and very cheerful and loving. However, once she started doing meth and drinking very regularly, she hardly had the ability to care for us appropriately.  The first time we were removed from her care, it was due to her inability to care for us while visiting a local lake. She was drinking and drugging with her friends while my brother and I did our own thing. At age five, this wasn't a very good thing. I remember one of her friends, most likely on drugs, swinging me around in circles by my hands and dislocating my shoulder. My mother was so high and drunk, that another person enjoying their time at the lake grew concerned and offered to let us spend the night. This woman claimed she was a friend of my mother's sister, but I guess anything can be believable while intoxicated. My mother allowed it and long story short, the woman took us to her home, fed us, bathed us, and allowed us to play video games. Once we fell asleep, the woman called the police who came and took us to a foster home.  This foster home, in my opinion, was very mentally abusive. They had their own children (no harm in that\), but they clearly treated their foster children very differently in the ways they fed, punished, etc. Having been without food, many times that I could remember, my brother and I would hoard food. Rather than allow us to eat more during meal times, they would lock us in our bedroom at night and even went so far as to place an alarm on our door if we were to get it open. This made my brother and I have to find other ways to relieve ourselves when it came to going to the bathroom. We'd poop out the window and pee in the corner of the bedroom, which we were severely punished for, even spanked to the point where we developed bruises on our backsides. Long story short, we were in this family's care for three or four months while my mother got her act together. Once my mother was deemed as a fit parent again, we were released back into her care, though, the care she provided was not much better than the foster family we were placed with.  My brother and I lived with my mother again for the next four years. In that time, my mom had two more children. The first, being my oldest sister. There was a custody battle between her father and my mother, resulting in the father taking custody of the child. To make matters worse, my mother decided it would be good idea to have another child with the same man, who before took custody of my sister, her father.  My brother and I were eight when my youngest sister was born. My mother, never being around, basically left us to care for her. We changed her diapers, dispensed her cystic fibrosis medications and treatments, fed her, etc. My brother and I would go door to door asking to do chores to make money to buy the diapers and formula. The pharmacy would allow us to pick up her medications. Taking care of anybody with cystic fibrosis is very tough, let alone children. We often missed school because my mother was never around to care for my sister. Going to school would mean my infant sister was all alone at home and we couldn't let that happen.  One morning, my grandmother wrapped a belt around my neck and tried to choke me because I took a slice of bread from the kitchen. I ran away for the day and came back later that evening only to find her vehicle not there. I snuck inside through a window and began making myself something to eat and of course, my grandma comes home. She comes in screaming and yelling at me, asking me where I've been. I start running towards the phone to call the police and she takes a sharp knife from the kitchen and begins to chase me. I carried the phone with me as long as I could until the cord couldn't reach anymore. She cut the damn phone line. Luckily, she had another line in her closet, which she connected and proceeded to call the police herself, on me. She claimed I was crazy. The officers, having been to her property before, knew she was a little off so they took me into custody and put me into a group home. My brother was on a fishing trip with my cousin, so lucky for him, he wasn't home at the time of the incident. Unlucky for him, after telling the police he was gone but would be coming back, the police did nothing. My brother was placed into foster care six months later only after my grandmother beat him in the head with a cast iron fireplace shovel.  My brother and I aged out of the foster care system after living with three separate families and a couple of different group homes. Long story short, I had never met my biological father at that point though he was paying court ordered child support the entire time. He had his own family, now has two children of his own, a beautiful house, is very well off, in perspective.  My brother and I aged out of the foster care system.  I guess my question is, is why do you think my brother and I never placed with my biological father, although he knew we existed and paid child support? He didn't have issues with drugs or alcohol and had his ducks in a row. Can a biological father, who has no interest in his kids, just allow them to be wards of the state though he would be perfectly capable of caring for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsdgsa?context=5)|I'm sorry to hear about what you went through... I can't imagine life as a foster child in relatively stable homes, let alone in the mess you and your brother had to go through. Even though my job is to represent parents, I often find myself talking to clients about what we can advocate for their children for their best interest.  There is no easy answer for why your bio-dad was not involved. That is a question for him. If you were aging out of the system, you likely had a hand in what was going on and at least a little aware of what your bio-dad was doing to regain custody. In other words, I'm sure you remember if he was making motions or requesting placement. It doesn't sound like he was.  The most likely answer was that he did not want to get involved, as terrible as that may sound or as hard as it may be. It sounds like he had his family and didn't want to reach out for your brother and you. The state cannot force a parent to take custody of their children. If a parent admits they are not a parenting resource for any reason, good or bad, the most the state can do is offer some sort of service to help them get there. If they aren't interested in that, there is little or nothing else they can do.
 |I am sorry for what you went through and I hope you have spoken with someone or are speaking with someone to get the most out of it. This sounds dumb, but you probably have something going right for you if you can write that on reddit. For the other questions, you'll need to ask bio-dad what he did to take care of you and why he might not have tried to do more. 
[Do you believe that people have the right to (unlimited\) reproduction? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsccpy?context=5)|Woah boy. Didn't know I would get tough questions like this.
 |I'm going to say yes. And I am not coming from a place where I think everyone should be able to have 30 kids and do what they want - I have seen first hand what that does to families.
 |My problem is the other side - slippery slope and enforcement. Who decides when people stop having children? What is the criteria? How do you make sure that happens? I think the world has seen where this heads when the government intervenes with these decisions, and it isn't pretty. 
[What percentage of kids being removed would you say are valid and how many are due to an overreaching nanny government?  I'd be paranoid about this if I had kids.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs9tb6?context=5)|You should be paranoid. It can happen and go downhill a lot easier than it does.
 |But most are pretty valid. The line is usually where children should be removed or not. A lot of the time, the argument is ""keep these kids in the home, make a safety plan, have the parents engage in corrective services, and see what happens."" The issue isn't that the allegations are bogus (most of the time) - it is that removal from the home is a much more drastic remedy then is necessary.
 |The problem is that most removals happen *ex parte*, or without a parent having a right to respond to until after the pick-up happens. And once a child is removed, it becomes much harder to put them back. 
[Well in that case I think you have a valuable job. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsaejw?context=5)|Check out this one, too. It gives an example of a case where removal was not necessary.
 |[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsale9)
[Typically, how difficult is it to arrange an alternate guardian within the family in these cases? It seemed that we were not given the opportunity... How would one go about doing this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chssoml?context=5)|If it is before the case is filed, it would be relatively easy if the parties are all in agreement with the issues. (no pun intended).
[You have mentioned that an alternate guardian should have no prior relevant cps history. Does ""history"" include being a ward of cps? For example, I currently lead a stable life with my wife. Aside from the prior history outlined in my previous post, does this exempt myself from providing care for other family members?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chssoml?context=5)|I can't speak for Canada or other jurisdictions, but in my county, it depends on a lot of factors.  CPS history should not include being a foster child. Only reports or findings of abuse or neglect. 
[What would you say was your most shocking ""these parents are getting screwed, and they don't deserve it"" case/moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs979f?context=5)|But I have a new outrage every week. When I first came into this, parents, regardless of their issue of the child's age, would get two hours of supervised visitation of week. If someone physically abused there 13 year old, two hours per week. If a mother was a serious victim of domestic violence and was too afraid or not yet ready to leave her abuser, and spent every waking hour with her 15 month old daughter, it was two hours per week.  This was supposedly based on budge constraints by the state (they have to pay for supervision). But they had no proof of it, and they could pay for expensive evaluations from psychologists which did little but push their own agenda. I worked to get parents more visits, and now have moved our county to a whopping four hours per week average.  The other one was a trial I did recently. The state wrote my client off a long time ago. They have an obligation to provide her with corrective services, and they barely tried. Then they tried to terminate her parental rights, and I got a pretty good victory with that case.
[Ideally, I'd like to hear a story about total bullshit and complete tomfoolery, but I'll settle for less.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs979f?context=5)|Oh, boy. There are so many. I was shocked when I first started doing the work. I think one of the biggest shockers was relative placement issues. When kids first come into care, the preference is for them to be with relatives, usually grandparents, but it can range to cousins and far out.  But the state has a list of things that disqualify people. If someone has a shoplifting charge from like 10 years ago, the state can't put them as a relative placement. The judge can order it, and does sometimes, but very often doesn't go against the state.
[Also, could you tell me what your favorite type of bagel is? (Personally, as long as it's covered in cream cheese, I could care less what type of bagel it is.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs979f?context=5)|Oh yeah. Sesame. I ate them tons as a child growing up. With butter or cream cheese. 
[*two hours of supervised visitation of week... This was supposedly based on budge constraints by the state (they have to pay for supervision\).*  Interesting. Is this the kind of thing that you'd say privatization of some sort might be capable of improving, or due to the nature of the work, would you say the budget increases/reallocations are the only practical solutions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsb19k?context=5)|There are two real solutions in my eyes without budget increases - one, stop paying for services which are redundant or excessive. Not every single person needs a psychological evaluation. Second, decrease the extent of supervision. Not every one needs supervised visits (eyes on/ears on the entire time). If someone has a drug problem and thats it, monitored (checking in every few minutes) is fine. Its pretty unlikely they will pull out and use their drugs right there unless they are in a reaaallly bad position. And these people's only danger issue is drug use, not even abuse or neglect.  They aren't in a better position to do it. They have to take care of the kid, make sure the placement is funded and appropriate, provide the parents with services, provide on-going case support, provide visitation, pay for attorneys. And that is starters. It takes a TON of resources to ""prosecute"" or file one of these cases, whatever you want to call it.
[Ahh!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbefq?context=5)|Maybe. Its hard to ""regulate"" these situations - each is incredibly case specific. And you can take ten judges and ten social workers and have twenty opinions.
[Is it then regulation which is causing these problems, or lack of regulations, which in turn lead to the implementation of ""less risky"" policies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbefq?context=5)|It is a balance between taking a conservative approach to ensure safety vs. moving things forward and giving people a chance to prove themselves. And you just can't write that into rules. 
[False I work for a private agency and we supervise all of our visits (case workers, secondary workers, and interns\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chspgh9?context=5)|Oooo good! You can answer some of the other questions about non-state parties filing petitions! 
[Do you ever have qualms about trying to get a child who was sexually or physically abused by the parents given back to the parents?  I'm talking about cases where you are convinced they were abusive - does it bother you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7ohe?context=5)|Never. I've never lost sleep over getting something done for a client. Only for maybe not doing enough (but I always try my best).
 |Its hard to get kids back after physical abuse. Nearly impossible with sexual abuse. If they get their kids back, at least in my jurisdiction, they worked their ass off. 
[How would a parent work hard to get their kid back after abuse/sexual abuse? Have you worked a case where that happened? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsdxj8?context=5)|Services. Everything is about services.
 |I have had parents get kids back after physical abuse. Either you prove that the allegation isn't true, or it is and the person engages in services. Anger management, domestic violence treatment, more serious mental health counseling, drug and alcohol treatment, parenting classes, or any combination of those. Once they show they are committed to making a change in their life, you start to move slowly back towards reunification with less restrictive visitation and movement towards a full return home. They have to prove themselves to be safe and appropriate at each level of supervision.
 |None for me after sexual abuse. If sexual abuse is proven, there often will be criminal charges, and a lot of the time the person can end up going to jail or prison for a long enough time to make them not relevant to getting their kid back (for reasons more complicated than I am going to get into, parents have about 1-2.5 years to show they fixed there problems). It would be up to the other parent to show they can be safe. If its not proven, it is a contested issue and makes it complicated. The parent needs experts to sign off that they are safe. 
[What is the best lawyer joke you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8z4z?context=5)|The only ""joke"" joke I can't get out of my head is an old jewish joke.
 |An rich, old man is on his death bed and has no family to leave his money to. Instead, he brings in his priest, his doctor, and his lawyer, and says ""I am going to leave my money with you. I want to take it with me into the after life, and you are the only people I can trust. When my casket goes down in the ground, you'll need to put your share in there with me.""
 |At the funeral, each places their sum in the casket. At the reception, the three are talking. The priest breaks down and says ""I'm sorry! I have to admit something. I didn't think I was fair for him to keep all his money. I have been building an orphanage in the inner city, and it desperately needed money, so I took $200,000 out of my share to pay for it. I feel terrible, but the money shouldn't just sit in the ground with him!""
 |The doctor says ""oh thank god you said something. I have been feeling so awful. I took $400,000 and put it into an inner city medical clinic I have been working on. It where that money really belongs, but it has been eating at me!""
 |The lawyer looks at the two others with disgust and says ""I can't believe the audacity of you two. I placed a personal check in there with him for the entire amount!""
 |My favorite real life attorney joke has to do with a parrot who was trained to call social workers nasty names, and an attorney objected to the parrot's testimony as hearsay. 
[*But in order for foster parents to adopt, you need to prove that there are current parental deficiencies and they haven't been fixed.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbtd7?context=5)|In my jurisdiction, evidence rules only loosely apply in motions and non-trial hearings. The other side can talk about bond with foster parents all they want. But if a parent doesn't have issues anymore, the other sides will need to FIND an issue if they don't want the kid returned. And they do that all the time. They nitpick on issues that aren't big deals (a parent needs to be minimally adequate, essentially a D grade) so they can get what they want and keep the kid there. That is infuriating.  At trial, evidence rules applies. A foster parent's bond, at least to me, would be irrelevant to the issue of termination and whether a parent has corrected or can soon correct their deficiencies. It is only relevant to the issue that continuation of a parent/child relationship hurts a child's chance for permanence. But even there, only the existence of a potentially adoptive home is important, not how great that home is. I would fight hard to make sure that material was not part of the record. 
[Legally this is true, but I have seen some astoundingly liberal interpretations of that, especially when healthy infants and toddlers are involved.  What about the experts testifying about bonding with the foster parents?  I have seen that referenced in many decisions.  This is totally irrelevant to whether or not the bio-parents are fit, which should be the only issue.  Have you ever tried to exclude that testimony on relevancy grounds?  What was the result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbtd7?context=5)|The issue where I can picture this being most problematic would be with a relative placement. For example, a client wants their child placed with a grandparent. The state and/or CASA would come in a say ""this child has been with these foster parents since birth and is very bonded to them and should not be removed."" The parent would say ""the grandparent has known the child for a long time and is a suitable placement, and its family.""
[Are the foster care homes really that bad as they are portrayed in movies and on TV ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7qgs?context=5)|Depends. You'd be surprised how little I know about the homes. Its not even that common for me to even meet my client's kids. And there are lots of laws protecting foster care confidentiality.
 |That being said, there are some horror stories. Lots of good ones, too, though. In my experience, what is overlooked is not the foster parents - they go through rigorous tests. What is over looked is the other kids in the home. Those are the ones who are more apt for sexualized or dangerous behavior.
 |But there are bad foster parents, too. We just got a tape of one saying she would ""fucking beat the shit"" out of this kid if he were her child.
[Thank you for the reply, now I have more insight into the foster care program.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7zic?context=5)|Np.
[At what age are kids generally aware of why they are being taken away? Is there a pattern in how a specific reason would affect the way kids see their parents? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7rjr?context=5)|Its tough to say. Thats a better question for someone who works more directly with the kids, like the social worker. Like I said in another answer, I barely see my client's kids.
 |But its earlier than you would probably think. Kids are sharp. One time, a social worker came up to me to talk about an inactive, not participating parent. She said the kid, who was almost 5, said ""I think I know what I did wrong now... I think I know what I have to fix to be back with mommy again.""
 |So as much as they try to shield kids, they know.
[Can you elaborate on the ""private foster care"" part?  if I'm reading this right - some rich guy could, for instance, file to have a kid removed as long as he was willing ot pay al the associated costs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsechh?context=5)|But in my state, anyone can file a petition for out-of-home care for a child. And I don't mean alternative custody like a guardianship. I mean a full blown out movement towards termination of parental rights.
[Presuming, obviously, I'm a 'good' parent, but somehow child protective services or such shows up, what's the best response?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chseo03?context=5)|If you can't afford it, clam up anyway. Don't make admissions or talk about the allegations. But work with the social worker and state to engage in services.
[*Get someone who works in the field, like providing indigent defense.*  I'm confused...what does indigent defense have to do with trying to keep your child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsiz6c?context=5)|In criminal cases, if you meet the income qualifications, you will get appointed an attorney. A public defender, or an attorney who represents indigent clients by appointment of the court. If you can afford an attorney, you can hire a private criminal attorney at your own expense.  In this field, it is hard to find an attorney who specializes specifically in children being removed from care. Most are due to mental illness and drugs. It is rare that a person can afford an attorney at all. And because these cases can be multiple years long, practically no one can afford it.  In other words, while a private criminal attorney may have the expertise to defend you in a criminal case, you will be hard pressed to find a parent's representative attorney in the private field who has worthwhile experience. You might be able to get a private criminal or family law attorney, but they won't be familiar with the judges or the state's attorney.  You want to have someone who knows the field, and the only people who do are the attorney's appointed to indigent defense. 
 |Both have advantages and disadvantages. A public defender probably deals with your type of case all the time. They know the prosecutors personally and deal with them all the time. They know the judges and how they make decisions. But, generally, they have a high case load and cannot devote as much time to each individual as a person might like.  A private attorney likely does less cases than a public defender. They generally specialize in one area, usually DUIs or maybe DV, where their typical clientele may have money. They likely deal with the prosecutors and judges not nearly as much as a public defender. But they will be able to provide you more time than a public defender and may have more opportunities to present time-consuming issues and motions.
[I'm a social worker, and although I don't work with CPS/DFS, I have a lot of friends that do.  In your opinion, what can we do, as a community of social workers, to improve the treatment parents and children receive when we're brought into these situations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsev9r?context=5)|Great question.
 |#1 Don't forget why you got into it. Don't stop giving a shit about the people and their families. Don't drink the kool-aid if you get into an environment that talks down clients and people; work to change it. But at the same time, don't get burnt out. Some of the best social workers want to help out so much they can't do anything after 6 months because they put way too much time in.
 |#2 Don't stop trying to change things. Yes, the system is what it is and we need to work within it, but we all know there are issues that probably can be dealt with more efficiently. Just because you get back the bureaucratic push back doesn't mean you should stop trying to change things when you believe it is right.
 |#3 Talk to people and get the issues out there. It is very sexy to say ""I care about foster kids"" and all that, but most people don't know what actually goes on. Social workers are overworked, and in my state, they won't even give them over time. These cases stagnate (see some of the other answers) because social workers have too much stuff to do. If people really cared that much, there would be more support to help move things along for kids as quickly as possible.
[They would just cycle them through as each parent came up, I had to wonder how each lawyer kept up with so many cases at once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|You're right - there is a ton of attorneys and people sitting at the table for one case. One kid can have - the state attorney, the social worker, a CASA, the CASA's attorney, a kid's attorney, a mom's attorney, and potentially multiple attorneys for dads if paternity is not established for any one father. Add in multiple kids with multiple dads and it gets more complicated. Imagine my case with 13 kids in it!
[Some of these parents have to be difficult to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|Each lawyer has there own system. Where I work, the state's attorney has the most cases, but has the help of the social worker to keep there stuff organized. It may seem hard in court, but you know what cases will be on which days and you prep for that day. And even if you don't know 100% what will happen in a given case, you usually know pretty well based on the judge or the other parties. Just like you said - the course of the case is kind of known.
[Is there some common issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|Being respectful to parents is huge. It really bothers me when any party, or even a judge, isn't respectful. Yes, a lot of them have done bad, even terrible things, but they are still people. Most of them know they have screwed up, or they have serious mental health issues. They have been beaten down by the system - be it children's services, criminal stuff, or just growing up - over and over and over again.
[Lack of education?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|Yeah, some are difficult to work with. Mental health is the hardest - how do you show someone has moved beyond their mental health issues? How do you get someone with chronic mental health problems to go to treatment or even admit they have a problem?
[Drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|There is tons of overlap - drug, mental health, and domestic violence issues often go together. And these people have tons of issues.
[These people many times have no transportation, no money it seems, sometimes I viewed the lawyers for the parents more like baby sitters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs8h5b?context=5)|The role of the attorney varies from client to client. Like you said, we generally know the course of the case. Getting a parent to admit they aren't going to win is a difficult and long road. It takes finesse to convince them what the outcome will be and what the right thing to do is. But, there are parents who have made steps and should be changing the course of the case. And they need a good advocate to help try to re navigate the ship. 
[I couldn't imagine the court room with 16 kids...sheesh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsacvf?context=5)| 
[What was the toughest case you ever had to deal with and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7t73?context=5)|A couple. Tough cases aren't usually the facts - its the clients. These cases are on going for many years.
 |One client is a pain in the butt. She has mental health issues and yells at me. She wants everything done a particular way. She says she is doing everything, but doesn't actually listen to my advice on what to do. And once I helped stop her from getting arrested, and she later said I didn't stand up for her.
 |Another was where the kid, a little girl, was molested in care. I wanted her to go back to her mom so bad. I would lose sleep. But her mom's termination trial had come up, and even though she was doing way better, it wasn't enough just quite yet and she would have lost. We had to convince her to relinquish her parental rights to get an open adoption agreement. It was rough. 
[Have you ever handled a case where the parents were seperated, and one was clearly ""fit"" but the child still went into the system?  If so, could you explain why that might happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsdcwd?context=5)|All the time. On both sides (fit and unfit parent).
 |Theoretically speaking, the fit parent should get the kid at the outset. In our jurisdiction, the court and the state stick around to assist the fit parent in obtaining a protective parenting plan from the unfit parent.
 |Practically speaking, dads get screwed a lot. A lot of the time, there is a very unstable, unsafe mother, and a father who isn't around a whole ton. This could be because they don't have enough time and are deadbeats, or it can also be because the mother kept the kid away from the dad. Even though the state makes no allegations against the dad, the kid gets removed anyway and placed in care. Its very frustrating from my point of view as an attorney - how do I fight allegations of unfitness when there aren't any? And it puts me in a position where I have to prove fitness. In other words, practically speaking, the burden gets shifted for me to prove the guy is fit.
 |The same happens for women, too, but not as much. It is much easier to get a child placed with a mother when there are no real allegations than the father.
 |Why does it happen? Because these are cases that involve children. You can find dirt on any parent, anyone, if you want it. And often times, the state makes no allegations one way or the other - good or bad. And in an abundance of caution, albeit a completely unfair one, judges remove the children to give the state more time to investigate the presumably fit parent. (Note that presumption is a legal term - any parent is preemptively fit until proven otherwise.)
[Would love to know your thoughts on the Justina Pelletier case in Massachusetts.  I won't link any articles because I doubt I could find one that is unbiased in either direction.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs9w3j?context=5)|I never heard of it until you mentioned it. It seems complicated and tough to have an opinion on it when, like you said, the articles are all pretty bias.

26mlgz,2,2014-05-27,"New York for 6 months as an intern from the UK, aged 28 - advice needed.",LNDtoNYCviaDoubt,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26mlgz/new_york_for_6_months_as_an_intern_from_the_uk/,"Hello there.

Where to start.

I am a 28 yr old (f) living in London. I'm from London and have lived here for most of my life. I currently live alone in a very little studio flat almost bang in the middle of the city. Without wanting to get into it, as that's not what this sub is for, I lived with someone for 7 years until one day they left. So since then, I have been here sort of trying to figure things out and in some ways start again.


I work for an arts and culture publisher. I joined the company about four and a half years ago and via a graduate trainee scheme. At the time I earned about £12k and having worked my around a few departments (I can't really say I've worked my way up) I now earn nearer £20k. It's not been the easiest place to work and during the two winters before last I was working until 9pm many nights, in line with perfectionism of the company and the working culture there. It can be very negative. People will always point out what's gone wrong/artistic temperaments etc. So, having been there for a long time now and in some ways having never quite established myself (I've always been an assistant, in editorial and in digital) I have been starting to feel the need to get out.


I don't have a huge amount of confidence and faith in myself and often feel I don't deserve things/am worthy of things. That's one reason why I still live in this tiny room, I think (and yes, I have had therapy in the past and depression has been with me most of my life). Since the loss of that relationship, I have continually blamed myself, no matter what anyone tells me.


However, living alone has helped me in a lot of ways. During particularly good periods, I have done a LOT more - I don't own a television any more, I go to talks, I take photos, I started learning a new instrument, I read. I'm very good at going to things alone (music/cinema/openings) and have now travelled alone to quite a few places in Europe (and loved this feeling, for the most part).


So I had been considering a move to Berlin as I speak a bit of the language (and would love to learn), I spent a very happy time there 18 months ago, it's an arty city, it's relaxed, it's full of history, I just sort of took to it. Thing is, lots of other people of my demographic also want to move there so it's not really quite as simple as that. You also really do need to be fluent in German.


This year I applied for some good jobs that I wanted in the UK. In two instances I was told I was down to to final two, with no bad feedback but that 'someone more suitable was found' etc. I also applied for a couple of things in Berlin, but no joy.


Something else I applied for was an intern programme at a US arts foundation. I had a Skype interview. I had a further phone chat. I was then offered a place.


However, they had their initial doubts as to why I was applying, given my age and the fact that I already have experience. For anyone familiar with J1 Visas, they could have me on a Professional Training visa, rather than an intern visa. They find me an attractive candidate because of my experience but worry I would be bored. Other participants in the programme tend to be (though not *always) around 23/just finished school or finished with a little experience.


My answer was that I have never had the experience of moving to a new city, that being in New York for six months would be great in terms of personal development and that it is an opportunity I might not get again.


So. I could do this. It would mean using my savings and investing a lot but I could do it.


So why am I scared? Why am I wondering if I should go to Berlin? (which may just be a pie in the sky idea.) I am scared that because of my age I will be the 'weird older one' to others there or will struggle to connect. I am worried that the fact I have experience gives the impression that I know how to do lots of things - not really. As explained above, I've been somewhere a while but don't believe I've made a good impression or have lots to show for myself.


I have been to New York before (once) and obviously know what a cultured, exciting, insane place it is. I fear I won't be able to keep up and that everyone will be wildly ambitious and dynamic (especially if I am with 23 yr olds). Is the culture of the city just too much? (I'm someone with a love of the calmness and lack of population in Scandinavian countries [my favourite place in the world is Iceland] but also someone who often draws energy from the 'challenge' of London.)


But to do it would be a way to break a cycle, perhaps, of 2 and half years spent feeling very lost in a city I love but which is currently weight down by many ghosts.


I'm scared I will never find anywhere to live, that for all my 'being good at travelling alone', giving to live abroad is something quite different. I'm worried that I have bluffed my way into this offer and neither I am quite the candidate they think I am and they aren't quite the opportunity I hope they are. But if I didn't do it, is that a bigger failing?


Reddit, does they seem like something I have haphazardly engineered or a genuine chance? Or could one turn into the other? Has anyone moved to NYC in a similar way? Any UK redittors who have spent a good chunk of time in the city?

Apologies for not explaining that too well, I can try and answer questions about any of the murky bits.

In my first 6 months, I had already shipped apps in Rails, PHP (with Slim and Twig), and iOS.

I am feeling extremely bad in my life atm : no sport, lack of social contact, not enough sleep, neglected hygiene... I want to change this.

My problem ? I have no time for anything. A week day is waking up 7h - get prepared 8h - go to work 9h30 - work 12h30 - eat/sew 13h30 - work 17h30 - go back home 19h - take my clothes off, chat with family 19h30 - dinner 20h - use time for my passion or to play some game with my friends - sleep 23h

This is THE SAME THING everyday. No i don't shower, only 2 per week to wash my hair. Yes it's gross. 

Do you have tips or things to help me having a less repetitive week ? I end up crying at work everyday, hating my internship, being extremely anxious during sunday afternoon and every morning, and every night when I think about tomorrow... I don't want this to last anymore.

I plan to go running outside during my lunch instead of sewing to help me feel better and heal my body (i've stayed too long sit everyday and now I have huuuuge back problems), just need to go buy yogapants as I don't want anyone to see me with shorts in the office. 

Any other tricks to help me improving my life and getting back to normal? (During the week, week ends are another problem)."

Throwaway on the off chance my employer uses reddit.

Alright so heres the situation I'm in. For the last six months (since december) I have been working at a very small (2 employees) fiber optic fabrication facility. It is just myself and the senior engineer. The place I work is based in the east coast though and the owner of the facility lives on the west coast.

The facility is a small fiber optic manufacturing business that attempts to make fiber that can be used in high power lasers. However, the company is a bit of a shitshow having gone from 10 employees when the current owner purchased it in 2001 to just the one senior engineer prior to my hiring.

There is obvious friction between the owner and the senior engineer, the owner requires us to work in some pretty awful conditions (no disposal of waste chemicals, refusal to pay for repairs of equipment, hasn't given the engineer a raise since he started working here 7 years ago, etc.). 

Now this might be somewhat palatable if the company showed progress at all, but not a single sale of fiber has been made in the companies existence, the owner in constantly wanting to jump from one process to the next and expects us to solve issues in weeks that the large fiber companies spend years and $$$$ on when he refuses to buy separate tubing so that we don't cross contaminate our preforms with the different dopants we use.


Anyways for the past month and a half or so, the owner has been pushing me really really hard towards being able to run all the processes on my own. Which includes an MCVD lathe, Fiber draw tower, RIP analyzer, SAP analyzer, and fiber concentricity analyzer. On top of all this he wants me to research and understand (at a PhD level) the theory behind rare-earthed dope fibers so that I can solve the problems and develop his million dollar fiber for him.

On top of this each day he expects a daily report accounting for all of my time in 30 minute increments along with a work plan for the next day in 30 minute increments for both myself and the senior engineer. Along with determining daily,weekly,monthly goals for both myself and the company.

Did I mention that I only get paid $12.50 an hour?

He has a number of times mentioned to me that he wants me to be able to run the facility by myself if it came to it, and be able to train any additional employee that he hires. Giving me the impression that he intends on letting go the senior engineer and expects me to carry on at a fraction of the price.

Now I can run all of these machines at a basic level think I can push all the buttons and watch everything happen and understand what all is going on, but if anything were to go wrong I'd be fucked as far as troubleshooting is concerned.

I really enjoy working with the senior engineer and I don't want to give the owner the impression that he can just fire the guy and that I'll be able to take over no problem.

Right now I'm in the process of trying to negotiate my summer wage, I'm pushing for $20 an hour since I'm basically a full blown engineer at this point but that's beside the point.

So now that you have a little bit on the background of where I'm working here's my question: 

Should I just suck it up and keep working here for the summer/my senior school year for the experience/resume padding, at the expense of my sanity, or should I just go home, coach sports/bag groceries/whatever I can get for the summer?

Would going from being an ""engineer"" to doing something else for the summer hurt my resume?

TL;DR Internship has turned into an extremely stressful and unsatisfactory work environment due to owner having unrealistic expectations and demands, is it worth it to suck it up and stick it out for that sweet resume padding"

This last year I was searching for a summer internship and did not get anything. Instead I interviewed with a bank to be a summer floating teller. I did this because I thought it would look good to have something else on my resume that other than working for my family business for the past 7 years.

My dilemma: I absolutely hate it already! It has only been a few weeks and I am technically still training but I can not stand this job. I thought it would be good to try the banking industry because it could open doors for me in the future but I can already say with confidence that I do not want to work in any sort of bank setting in my future. I would really like to just say hell with it and quit and just go back to working for the family (where I also make more money) but there are a few things holding me back.

1.) A family members good friend who is high up in the bank put in a good word for me to get the ""summer help teller"" position.

2.) It is probably ethically wrong for me to waste their time and money from the training I have already received.

3.) I don't want to be the type of person who quits something they just started. That also looks bad.

..But on the other hand, I rather be happy than miserable all week at a job that I can not stand. And I also plan on never working in a bank after this.

I guess I am just looking for some opinions on the matter from an outside perspective..."

- Made a bunch of applets and other stuff in Java

- Made a pretty fleshed-out Flash game

- Made a small personal website with some light CSS and JavaScript

- Begun messing around with an Arduino kit


Where to next? Learning something in the C family? Making something more complex with JavaScript? Maybe something for mobile? I feel like my knowledge base is really rudimentary right now, especially compared to some of the people around me. I'm also not really sure whether I wanna go into web development, or software development, or what (kinda hoping I'll start to figure that out this summer), so I'd just like to get a good baseline that will convince recruiters that I know my shit enough to be worth hiring. If anyone can talk about what ended up being crucial for them, that'd be awesome."
26nq6u,0,2014-05-27,"Low GPA, startup experience, can't get internship",throwmyway1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26nq6u/low_gpa_startup_experience_cant_get_internship/,"This is more of a rant that I need to get off my chest.

I am a fourth year (going to graduate in 5 years) student at a top 20 undergraduate program. I am incredibly smart, passionate, and driven but I cannot get an internship no matter how hard I try. I see my classmates who are clearly no where near as smart as me getting internships and that makes me upset. How can companie pass up on an individual of my caliber?

The one negative that is causing me harm is my GPA. I have a 2.4 and I don't mention it on my resume. In some online applications, I have to state it; or during interviews it comes up and I feel like I get disqualified because of it. The reason it's so low is because I don't like the way CS is taught at my school. I understand the concepts perfectly, do decently on projects, but fail at examinations.

Also, for the last two years I was working with my friend to create our own startup company. Our company was working on neural computation and I was the CTO. My friend was the CEO, but I pretty much did all the real work. He handled some business stuff and did some programming, but I am a much better programmer than he is. I dedicated almost 100 hours per week to this company because I was dedicated and that's also a reason why my academics suffered. Last month, we stopped working on the startup because we couldn't get any funding or customers. I guess that's normal since many startups fail. My friend was able to secure an internship almost immediately and I still haven't been able to get one despite searching the entire year.

Over the year, I've sent out about 100 applications to both large and small companies. I've had about 20 interviews and for half of them, I've been invited on-site. During the interviews, I nail all the technical questions. There's only been 1 question which I haven't been able to answer. My solutions are the most optimum, written cleanly, and I honestly can't think of anything wrong with them. As far as cultural fit, I think I would fit in well into any company. I have a ""get shit done"" attitude and I work very extremely hard. I don't think I would even require much training if I was to intern at most of these companies. They have great products and I have ideas about how to improve them and how they do development. I feel that I am smarter than some of my interviewers and I've even been a CTO which is more than what some of them will be in their entire lifetime.

I'm also trying to network more now to improve my odds. I'm really at a loss as to why I haven't gotten a single internship. I'm not expecting a 6k/month internship from Google, but is even one too much to ask for? Just because I didn't get As in some classes, does that mean I am unworthy? I've done more in the last two years than most people accomplish in the first 10 years of their career. I just need one chance and I can't believe it has been this hard."
26nw0n,1,2014-05-27,Would working as a board operator for a radio station mean the possibility of being a target for on-air volunteering?,radioschmadio,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/26nw0n/would_working_as_a_board_operator_for_a_radio/,"When stations hire tech positions and board operator type-positions, is it generally accepted that the new hires should be willing to possibly be used for on-air discussions?

Basically, someone I know wouldn't want to become the center of attention for any kind of radio station broadcast, like being talked about as ""the weird intern, etc."" Is that perception of what it's like to work for a station a misconception?

26o4zv,2,2014-05-28,"Graduating in Fall with 3 years experience. At a terrible job now, what should I do?",DisposableCode,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26o4zv/graduating_in_fall_with_3_years_experience_at_a/,"Hey everyone,

Before I get into the specifics, here is some brief background info about me:

* I graduate this December from a state university in Florida with a Bachelors in CS. 
* I am currently in a full-time position as a Software Engineer making around 60k$ (Florida). 
* When I graduate I will have about 3 years of experience. (1 year as a full-time Software Engineer and 2 years in a full-time internship)
* All of my work experience is in VB.NET/C#

When I graduate, I would like to move into a more challenging position, preferably at a startup or at a Big 4 company, but I am quite worried about getting through the interview process. This is mainly because most of my work is very high-level in that I do alot of software architecture design and all of my code is in C#, leaving me isolated from both web technologies and lower level coding. Because of this I have been considering resigning from my current position at the end of August to focus on getting plenty of studying and more side projects coming along to boost my knowledge in all areas. I can survive financially for 3-4 months on my savings given my current expenses, but I would be giving up a 60k$ job to do this.

Now, I know in the long-term I am not going to be happy in my current position. I work at a startup software company providing enterprise solutions to other businesses; this is a smaller company of about 30 people, only 6 of which are developers including myself. I am not trying to sound pompous or egotistic, but all the developers here, save for 2, are terrible at what they do, and I regularly have to fight battles to do things in a professional way. It is kind of hard to explain so here is a somewhat brief list:

* One developer regularly deviates from design specifications and implements his own features without consulting anyone. This is done without reprimand. 
* Best practices are never taken seriously. Ex: Administrative plaintext passwords were being saved in text files. Homegrown encryption was implemented in the product.
* Another developer regularly walks out of design sessions and meetings because hes bored and hates meetings, again without reprimand. 
* Solutions are generally not vetted out by merit and it is looked down upon to spend time on researching what the best solution is.
* I have been told by an executive that they would prefer to be bought-out for their IP rather than organically building the business itself. This results in many short-sighted decisions and shortcuts being taken.

Should I follow through with resigning and focusing on expanding my knowledge base before graduation? Given my current experience in architecture design and coding, what kind of salary should I expect after graduation? What do you recommend I do in my situation?

26oa4a,1,2014-05-28,Is My Friend Using Me?,321man,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/26oa4a/is_my_friend_using_me/,"*Tried to obscure some details about us so he doesn't immediate recognize I'm talking about him, hope it isn't too vague.

I'm a 21 year old male, with a year left in college. One of my friends (21 Male) who just graduated from his university moved to my city, and doesn't have a job. His family owns (but doesn't live in) a place here and so he stays there and doesn't have to worry about rent. I've known the guy and have hung out with him on and off for about a year. We have a lot of similar interests, and we generally get along pretty well.

He seems to struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem at times, alternating between making remarks like ""I'll never have a girlfriend"" and then at other times spontaneously boasting about girls who have hit on him. He constantly gets down on himself about being anti-social and not really having friends, and at other times, he goes into explicit details about some of his friends from college, pointing out how cool they are. He's not a bad looking dude, and had a cute girlfriend two or so years ago, which didn't seem to last long. Other than me, he has one or two college acquaintances living in the city, but doesn't hang out with them as far as I can tell. He talks about how lonely he is here and it's only been a couple weeks since he's moved here.

I have a couple internships with music related companies we really like, and I've mentioned that I would be down to submit his resume if I ever hear about internship openings, despite his career focus being directed towards a completely different field. I also felt bad and said I would introduce him to my friends since he doesn't really have any other than me. Not sure if this was a mistake, because since then he's been really adamant about tagging along with me wherever I go each day. I like hanging out with the dude, but spending too much time with anyone can get tiring. He texts me everyday asking me what I'm up to, wanting to hang out, and what other people are up to. Lately though, I feel as though he's been hanging out with me primarily to make more friends and meet people working in my industry, rather than to just hang out as friends, given how often he tries to get me to introduce him to people, and tries to tag along to different events I'm going to.

He keeps talking about how he's going to apply to jobs related to his career path, but hasn't applied to a single one since he's arrived. He seems to be somewhat spiteful about me having the positions that I do, often making remarks that he's not working in my field because he is unlucky and never had the right connections like I have.

I'm not sure if I'm being too mean, or paranoid, but I have some sense that he doesn't like me as much as he seems to lead on, and is acting too desperately about trying to permeate my social life without even trying to establish a professional one. I've been trying to build a bit of distance to make things more comfortable. I was originally really excited about him moving here, but now I'm expressing some doubt. I don't know how I should build space and proceed, without severing our friendship.

TL;DR, friend is trying really hard to permeate my professional and friend social circles, sort of coming off as being manipulative. Dunno how to build distance without ruining the friendship."

[Using your knowledge of gross and dangerous parasites and other animals, what is the best pick-up line you can come up with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3t0p?context=5)|If you were a Nephilengys spider, I'd totally rip off my own genitals for you!

[Was your gig at Animal Planet something you just stumbled upon, or how did you get into that position? Something like this has always been my dream job ever since I was a kid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht410a?context=5)|I was working as a scientist in a basement, when the phone rang. A production company was doing a show about evolution (called Evolve, for the History Channel), and they needed ""an evolutionary biologist who is not an old man."" They'd gotten my name from someone who had seen me give talks at conferences. So the take-home for me is that my enthusiasm as a researcher drew me smoothly into being enthusiastic about science for a living on TV. A lot of it was luck, but I believe that you can totally get any dream job if you just try to be the person who deserves that job.
[What did you want to be when you were little? Did you feel inspired by Steve Irwin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht8o5d?context=5)|I remember thinking ""not scientist because they have to do math."" I didn't fall in love with math until part-way through my PhD. I sucked at math in high school and undergrad, but once I saw how it connected to bats (through biomechanics), I fell in love, and found out I'm actually pretty damned good at math. I wasted all those years thinking I was incapable. I always keep that in mind when people tell me they suck at Math. They probably don't.
[Were there any good (or bad\) practical jokes on set that you can relate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3y8d?context=5)|It wasn't a practical joke, but one of our craziest days at Daily Planet was when we had someone in the studio burning magnesium and he'd kind of eyeballed the amount and it ended up being way too much and suddenly everything was brighter than the sun and the cement floor had permanent craters in it. Also, our camera guy, Art, had to get new shoes because his were burnt. Good times.
[What parasite do YOU personally find the most interesting? Do you think parasites control / affect human behavior the way, say, Cymothoa exigua affects fish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3rau?context=5)|To me the cat's ass of parasites is Toxoplasma, because it changes behaviour in rats in a way that makes a lot of sense evolutionarily. Normally rats are scared of the smell of cat urine (and therefore avoid cats, on average). But when a rat is infected with Toxoplasma, it becomes SEXUALLY AROUSED by that smell, which makes them more likely to be eaten by a cat. So the parasite gets passed on, and wins. That, in itself, is awesome. The kicker, though, is that humans get the parasite, too, and it measurably changes our behaviour.
[Hey Dan! I saw you speak at Ontario Biology Day a couple of months ago and thought what you had to say about your PhD and Postdoc work with vampire bats was so incredibly interesting. It was amazing to hear how passionate you were about the research you got to do and I hope to find a project that I'm just as passionate about for my future work. I was just wondering since you've moved away from the research field, do you miss it? Or do you miss even certain aspects of it, like the travelling you got to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht44ki?context=5)|I do miss research, to be honest. As I said at OBD, there is no greater pleasure in the world than seeing some fact about the world before anyone else. When my PhD advisor, John Hermanson, and my then undergrad (now PhD student), Gerry Carter watched those vampire bats running on a treadmill, it was like finding buried treasure - no, it was like finding buried treasure that was put there by aliens. It was indescribable. We just laughed and laughed. Here's the video. [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukIZRD1mzLg)
 |I want to fill my life with more of that, and I will.
[Dan - your passion is palpable through the text. But I have to ask what was groundbreaking/new about the bat on the treadmill? The similarity to other mammals running? The fact that they could run? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chta8ii?context=5)|Common vampire bats are the only lineage we know of that lost the ability to run (bats can't run) and then secondarily evolved it again. The great part is that when they independently evolved that ability, they had all this musculature associated with the arms compared to the weak legs, so they developed a unique gait of running push-ups, which no other animal does.
[Hey Dan, I'm a huge fan of Daily Planet!  I love how Daily Planet is always at the forefront of cutting edge technology, and was wondering what new emerging technology/science you are personally most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3vb6?context=5)|Thanks. I'm really proud to work on Daily Planet. We have such a big team of talented and smart people on our team, and we cover some great stories. The stuff that gets me psyched right now is graphene. It's got such incredible potential. At the same time, though, I think of the plastics revolution that we're still trying to clean up, and I wonder what the ecological impacts of graphene might be.
[Two questions:   What do you like to do for fun?  What are some of your favorite adventures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3z70?context=5)|There are more than 1,200 kinds of bats in the world, and I want to see all of them. In my life so far I've seen 106. For fun I like to see new places, and looking for bats is a great way to do that. Some of my favourite experiences so far have come from those trips. Like the time I saw an endangered brown lemur while I was in Madagascar looking for sucker-footed bats. You know. That was nice.
[I assume you've had your rabies shots..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtag7w?context=5)|Yes.
[I just started reading your book. Congrats! How can we avoid having Mother Nature Kill us? What is your best health advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht50mp?context=5)|Thanks! One of the big things I argue about in my book is that companies manipulate you by calling things ""natural"" and then expecting you to think that means ""good."" That's insane. Sure, there are lots of healthy things in nature, but rattlesnakes are natural, too.
 |Get this: There are &gt;250,000 kinds of plants in the world, and humans get &gt;90% of our calories from just 15 species. FIFTEEN! That's 1/160th of a percent. If nature's so good for us, how come we only eat a select number of plants, which by the way, we've been domesticating for thousands of years to make them healthy?
 |Nature has lots of healthy things in it, but to describe nature as this loving basket of harmless fruit that is actively trying to take care of you is silly. If anything, Mother Nature is Trying to Kill You. Hence my title.
[What the most interesting animal to you and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5fnm?context=5)|I love bats. They can fly. Most of them echolocate. They hang upside down. They have incredibly diverse faces. They're enigmatic. Nobody is indifferent about them. Some people hate them (losers) and some people love them, but when there's a bat in the room, people notice.
 |When you study bats, though, you find out they're even more interesting than their first impression would suggest. There are scientific papers about bats giving oral sex to one another. There are scientific papers about bats peeing on themselves to cool down. The sac-winged bat fills pockets in its wings with urine, semen, and saliva, and then sprays that mixture onto other members of its species. Love that.
[My kids and I are big fans of Daily Planet and watch it every day.  Thanks for hosting such a great show.  My family is saddened by what happened to the educational content on TLC and History over the years (and even Discovery sadly\) It must be difficult for the team to walk that fine line between keeping it interesting and diving into the science details.  Do you get to contribute to the discussion of how in-depth a segment goes?  Any segments you wish you were able to dive deeper into?  Any regrets about airing segments that were more entertainment than science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5vbf?context=5)|(I love that your kids watch the show - thank you!)
 |TV is harder than most people think. A lot of incredibly great, well-researched shows get made but people just don't watch them. A lot of stupid fluff gets made that people can't get enough of. For those of us in the biz, it's NOT FAIR. We want good ratings for good shows, but it often doesn't work that way.
 |The game, then, is to make intellectually great shows that people will watch. Very hard. I think Daily Planet and Monsters Inside Me are both great examples of that working. COSMOS is another, and there are many others. But until people stop watching Honey Boo Boo hunting alien ducks or whatever those shows are, we've got no choice but to play this game.
[Hey Dan, big fan! Used to watch Daily Planet since I was a kid and it is one of the main reasons I am now attending university for engineering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3zfi?context=5)|That's so awesome to know that shows like Daily Planet really do turn kids into engineers. That's just awesome, and it's a big part of what gets me out of bed each day. Thanks for that.
[My question is: What's your view of STEM education in Canada and around the world. How can we convince more kids to get interested in Science and Math?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3zfi?context=5)|As far as STEM goes, I think it's a beautiful time because of places like Reddit/Wikipedia. Everyone is starting to question everything. Your teacher tells you something in high school and you fact check it. That's the spirit of science. Science isn't about knowing the periodic table, it's about questioning authority. In general, governments need to do more to help teachers, but I'm excited by the exponential increase in the number of resources available to STEM teachers through the web. It gives me optimism.
[Considering your hybrid background in the sciences and education/entertainment. I wanted to know your thoughts on, how has superhero ""Batman"" impact our society in viewing bats as a species?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht57cv?context=5)|I love Batman, but I think it's lame that he destroys what is clearly a large maternity colony so that he can park his car there.
[Dan! Thanks for doing this AMA.  What do you think is the most disturbing thing that goes on in nature?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4hvx?context=5)|Great question. There are so many answers. Bedbug sex (traumatic insemination - where the male just stabs a female with his knife-like penis and injects sperm into her abdomen) is a good contender. So is hyena childbirth (where the tubular, penis-shaped clitoris tears open in the process). That must hurt. To be honest, that's kind of the starting question I used when I wrote my book [he said, plugging his book]. So my full answer is there.
[I'm pretty disturbed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4uu9?context=5)|I did my PhD on vampire bats which are parasites of mammals and birds (they drink their blood), but my expertise is biomechanics and/or bat biology.
[So, follow up: how do you study parasites and other animals? Is it first hand or mostly through other sources?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4uu9?context=5)|For the TV shows and the book, I do a lot of reading, and talking to people who know more than I do. I've fallen in love with the parasites, though. They're super creepy and brilliant and awesome. What's not to love about a worm that comes out of your ass while you're sleeping to lay eggs, so you'll be itchy in the morning and then get those eggs all over your fingers? You couldn't make that stuff up!
[What can you do to scare us enough to take antibiotic resistant diseases seriously? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4p18?context=5)|I suppose if I infected you with an antibiotic resistant disease, you'd probably take it pretty seriously. That would do it.
[Morbid kinkiness of nature? Care to gives us your most favorite and/or most disgusting example of that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht9igt?context=5)|There's a flatworm on the great barrier reef that is hermaphroditic. When two of them mate, they have to pick who will be male and who will be female. The male just has to ejaculate and then gets to leave. The female has to incubate eggs. So both of them want to be the male. They settle their argument by penis fencing - each of them has two penises and they have a sword fight. The winner stabs the loser, injects it with sperm, and then swims away, the victorious dad. The loser has to be the mom.
 |It's a neat system because you will only ever have to be the female if you've had sex with someone who fights better than you do. In other words, it will always have been worth it, in terms of bettering your offspring's chances of being good penis-fighters.
[You ever heard of this bat expert called Roger Ransome? He's one of the leading experts in the U.K, for sure, maybe even Europe and beyond. Only curious because he's my great-uncle.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht40k8?context=5)|Yes. I like his paper that showed female horseshoe bats share their favourite lovers with their mothers. That's kinky.
[Hey Dan, if you were to get a bat tattoo, which bat would you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht69uo?context=5)|I'd probably get a stylized tattoo of no particular species, kind of like the Bacardi bat. And I'd probably get it on my left calf. Probably in 1997.
[Hey Dan, I'm a big fan. Would you rather study 100 bat sized horses or 1 horse sized bat? Also the bat spits acid. Thanks for Daily Planet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht60v3?context=5)|My man Lucas Cochran (Daily Planet's Future Tech guy) told me this question would come up in one form or another.
 |100 bat-sized horses. No question.
[ off, thanks for doing this AMA. I'm disappointed scientists don't get more questions on these.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5l1n?context=5)|The big thing that people always talk about with vampire bats is the ability of vampire bat saliva to prevent clotting. Every few years some new drug gets made based on vampire bat saliva (I think one of them is called draculin), which will ""save heart patients.""
[, on the topics of bats and parasites, in what ways do vampire bats combat potential blood born parasites or pathogens. And are any of their inherent defenses able to be applied to humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5l1n?context=5)|Vampire bats also spread rabies among mammals which is a really bad thing.
[Why is it ok for all species to take a pee/poo where ever they are when they have to go but humans have to hide?

That's the beauty of biology - there are exceptions to almost all of the rules.
[Why do orangutans eat the brains of lorises?(or is it lorisi?\) Is there any DNA we could potentially take from vampire bats to aid in other species or our own for diseases or other harmful things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht6xhw?context=5)|We think of orangs as the peaceful, wise, old orange things that are vegetarian peaceniks, but when slow lorises are available, an orang won't hesitate to smack it out of the tree, climb down, and eat its face, the palms of its hands, and its brain. That's the kind of thing I love about nature. Everybody thinks of nature as this gentle utopia, but it's actually pretty rough out there.

[Do you think it's fair to draw a parallel between reciprocal altruism in vampire bats and human kindness? I don't remember the source but I read a passage long ago about well-fed vampire bats donating the contents of their stomachs to those who didn't have the opportunity to feed on a given night, and the evolutionary forces that make this a beneficial behavior (the whole tit-for-tat game theory thing\). My understanding of the phenomenon is pretty limited but I often think about how it compares to apparently altruistic exchanges in humans.

I have the same advice if you're trying to find a good grad school advisor, too.

[Anyway, I do have a question; I'm really interested in getting into Parasitology (I think that's right?\) and I was wondering, do you know any schools on the west coast where I could pursue this? I've only been able to find majors in Biology and/or zoology with optional focuses. Can you major in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtdgzj?context=5)|You can study parasites as a zoologist, or as a doctor.

Joe Bahlman did past of his PhD at Brown on just that.
[Hey Dan, thanks for doing this. My question is about bat flight from a physiology perspective.  In university I had a prof that was explaining bird respiration to us and how the efficiency of having a continuous circuit of fresh air passing by the respiratory surface allowed the flight muscles to stay well fed with oxygen. When I asked him how bats were able to fly given their boring old mammalian lungs he didn't know. So, do you know how they can afford to fly without a steady stream of O2? Any special adaptation that help then achieve this? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtbjfr?context=5)|I believe that recently they've found that the unidirectional flow of air across the capillaries of lungs, which was thought to be unique to birds, seems to also be present in crocodilians, suggesting that while it might help birds out in flight, it isn't as important as we thought, and certainly doesn't seem to be the key to being able to fly. Birds probably had that long before they evolved flight. Bats fly without it and crocodiles (thankfully) can't fly even with it.
[Why are the TV-channels you are working for in a constant movement of devolution instead of evolution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht8sfv?context=5)|To be honest, it is hard to stomach some of the bad shows that get made, but I'm focused on making great shows myself. I don't imagine Radiohead gets depressed when they find out Nickelback is played on the same station as they are. Radiohead just keeps trying to make incredible music. So I can try to learn from them.
[Thanks for taking the time to answer questions! I spent January in Costa Rica for a study abroad trip and ran into a German scientist in La Selva who was studying bat foraging behavior. I was absolutely fascinated and ended up poring over books about bats for the rest of the trip. He even let me hold a bat!  Also, tell us some cool facts about the biomechanics of bats!

Pooped-out blood in your hair? Honestly.
[In my reading I gathered that the evolutionary history of bats is vague, at least. Can you tell us what your idea of where they evolved from is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht8mxk?context=5)|The evolutionary history of bats was a bit of a mess, but recent work by Emma Teeling, Nancy Simmons, and others has cleaned a lot of that mess up.  They were arboreal animals until after the dinosaurs disappeared. Then flight and echolocation evolved and boom. Bats exploded in diversity.
[I've been watching Daily Planet for over 5 years, and I think you're a great host, my question is; What was the best experience you ever had on the show or ever?(I haven't seen every episode\) I thought the CN Tower thing you did with Ziya was pretty cool! thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtcnlm?context=5)|Standing on the edge of the CN tower was a blast. I'm headed out next week to Spain for the show. They've got smart speed bumps there that only rise up out of the ground if a car is speeding, and leave the good drivers alone. That probably won't be so intense as the CN tower.
 |Greatest Daily Planet experience so far, though, has to be when I was at JPL in Pasadena while the mars rover landed. Those 7 minutes of terror were the most thrilling science-in-action imaginable. 
[What's your favourite bat and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht9thl?context=5)|It changes. The vampire bats kick ass, but the New Zealand Short-tailed bat is super-enigmatic, and in the absence of terrestrial mammals with which to compete has become a largely terrestrial animal that can fold its wings up and crawl around looking for food like a shrew. They also strangely have a second claw underneath every claw on their toes and thumbs. Why? No one knows.
[Hi Dan, I'm reading your book right now (not while writing this, but I've been reading it\), and I've got to say, since beginning it I have gotten a lot more respect for you as a scientist.  I liked you enough as the host of Daily Planet, but reading your book is what really allowed me to see you that way as well.  What is it, specifically, that you like so much about bats?  I know you like them, since that was the topic of you PhD, and you mention them a lot otherwise, but what is it that makes them so interesting to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtbug5?context=5)|Thanks so much.

In other words, if you hold your arm out in front of you, and try to touch the tips of your fingers with your tongue, you will only have extended your tongue 1/3 the distance that this bat can achieve. It uses that tongue to lap up nectar from very deep flowers that it visits, like a bee or a hummingbird.
[Also, a park visitor once told me that there are bats laying on their gravel driveway when they come home each day in the late afternoon. They fly away when the car drives by and then go back to the ground.

[I saw you give a great (entertaining, hilarious, and informative\) plenary talk at The Wildlife Society Conference in Milwaukee last October. Thank you for doing that, and for this AMA.  I was wondering if you had an opinion or comments on the relative value of publishing in scientific journals versus popular press. As a recent M.Sc. grad I'm feeling the pressure to be published in journals, but my writing for those is by necessity full of jargon, and will (generally\) only be read by fellow scientists with a paid subscription. Do you think there will ever be a movement away from those sorts of publications in favour of articles everyone can read and understand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtahbf?context=5)|Your value as an academic, for better or for worse, will be measured by your ability to publish in scientific journals. The outreach is great, but its value is hard to quantify. When I did research for my book, I didn't trust anything in the popular press. All of my facts had to come from scientific papers. They're all that ""count,"" as far as I'm concerned. The outreach has value, but if you're trying to get ahead in academics, scientific papers are what you need to publish. If you're not trying to stay in academics, just publish enough to get your degree and then write for the masses.
[Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. I'm currently in grad school, working on a PhD in Engineering. I'm interested in science outreach as well as science and technology policy.

Call up teachers/schools and offer to come in and talk to their classes.

Teachers love that stuff, students love that stuff, and bang. You're started.

How important would you consider opportunities such as internships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht9si2?context=5)|It's a great idea to get to know the profs whose work you respect. Internships are one way to do that, but there are others. In general, though, getting to know those people is a good idea. Then, when they're looking for someone to help them with some project or another, your name might come to their mind.

We want people to trust and love scientists, and to value them. We need them to like us. So go in there and tell them why you have the best project in the world and get them jazzed about it. I think that will address the mistrust slowly, but surely. At least I hope to hell it will, because that's been my strategy.

The replacement roommate did not meet the rental qualifications which leads me to this post. 

**Details-**
[**PHOTOS**](http://imgur.com/a/3JKBX)
The house is perfect. Right behind UCF in regency park. It's a 3/2 house with a 2 car garage.  We would prefer you take the master as it's much more private (private bathroom, quieter etc).  The second bathroom is small and shared which makes things difficult. However if you wanted just a small bedroom I would be willing to move to the master. The landlord owns the home and is very responsive to our needs. We keep the house clean 24/7, do not throw parties, and live in a very chill environment. Friends over is always encouraged but this is by no means a party house. However we do drink a lot of Jameson. The family room is converted into a living room and the living room converted into a large office space where we do our work. (photos below) 

**The roommates-**

u/thethirdlegend is a computer science and math major. He will be graduating this year from UCF. Loves; league, scifi, tinder, anime and of course all things code. Works from home at a non profit doing web design. 

I (u/blackwater22) am a Junior at UCF working toward a degree in Information technology. I currently have an internship with Picerne real estate. Personally I'm deeply into politics, edm, running and all things related to technology. 


**Financial details-** 

Rent is $1400 and it includes water and power split three ways. We pay for medium tier bright house speed which adds an additional $20 per roommate bringing the rent to either $450 if you want a bedroom or $550 if you want the master. (Master pays $100 more) 

**Rental qualifications-** 

This is where is becomes tough. Every Tenant must have their parents (or some adult) as a cosigner. This is nonnegotiable lease terms. I have close to 850 credit score and offered to pay 6 months of rent payments upfront and they still required a cosigner. The landlord is very protective of his home and it's reflected in his strict rental qualification. You can move in now or August 1st. The last roommate has already left though is still paying rent for the next few months. You can take over those payments if you wanted to move in now.

26q4qf,0,2014-05-28,I dropped out because college was getting in the way of my education!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26q4qf/i_dropped_out_because_college_was_getting_in_the/,"I completed approximately 3/4th’s of a CS and Math double major in two years before having a liberating epiphany.  I'm 20 years old and I've always been a little too clever for my own good.  Dropping out was a complicated decision and had many facets too it, but the gist is I know I can learn more and faster on my own!  


Why not learn on my own while completing a degree?  


Well I've always been a great learner, but a terrible student.  Educational systems are designed for the weakest link.  The degree program is designed to be passed by the least gifted student the university deems worthy of the degree, and thus not designed for me!


Since I was very young, school has moved at a snail’s pace and fills my time with fluffy or boring assignments.


And once I moved onto college I began paying out the ass for pressure to perform well in a system that places learning second to following the rules.  The reason school needed to go was to save precious time, money, and buckets of anxiety.  I'm foregoing a degree in the pursuit of a higher education, so to speak.


There are a lot of things taught and tested-on that seemed obvious, or that I already knew, or that could easily be forgotten in lieu of a google search.  I'm aware that through the whole degree process you learn some more subtle and subconscious skills that cannot be explicitly taught, but I believe universities have no exclusive claim to these skills.


So while I have major bones to pick with formal schooling, I’ve found a true passion in Technology!  CS, math, and the sciences in general simultaneously excite, terrify, and humble me every day.  I’ve been programming for less than two years but computers have indisputably become MY THING.  Humans are amazing; we’ve created so much and I want to learn about ALL OF IT!  This obviously won’t be possible, but I can try my best.


The dropping out is not in question.  It's already done.  So I'm NOT looking for advice on that (unless you have a thought-provoking case to make for going back).

With that in mind here is my plan -

Coursera, and similar websites, essentially offer university level education and courses with a lot of the fat trimmed off.  I’m going to continue “studying” through these free resources.  I’ll be taking a mix of core courses, stuff I’d be learning if I continued college, along with interesting or potentially unrelated courses that intrigue me.

I was learning the bulk of my college material the night before tests.  Essentially my semester consisted of three or four days of intense learning for each class.  This means I can (and have already done in the past) complete your average 9 week coursera course in about a week.  This sort of immersion and focus on a single topic suites my learning style and the furious pace makes me feel in control of my education.

All the while, I will be saving my code and cataloguing it in Github.

There are also many great text books I can work through to improve my knowledge in specific areas or technologies.

The second part of my self-education will be in projects.  I already have one big solo project near completion and several ideas for a variety of others.  Again, I will put these on Github and open-source them (unless they become commercially viable).

I’m going to be living in my college town for the next year, so I will still be able to leverage the resources of my university, which officially views me as a student on leave.  This means access to Hackathons, clubs, brilliant professors, and an awesome career fair where I hope to swing an internship.

If I can get a full-time offer afterwards I will explain that I want to begin working immediately.  I want several solid years of industry experience, while maintaining some extracurricular learning.  My ultimate goal however is to find or develop a business idea I can helm and to build my own company from there.


If you’ve read all this thank you very much for your time!  Now if you’ve got any more time, rip my plan apart as best you can!  Ask some questions!  Or just give me some honest advice!  It will all be appreciated. :)"

I am a 28 yr old (f) living in London. I'm from London and have lived here for most of my life. I currently live alone in a very little studio flat almost bang in the middle of the city. Without wanting to get into it, as that's not what this sub is for, I lived with someone for 7 years until one day they left. So since then, I have been here sort of trying to figure things out and in some ways start again.

I work for an arts and culture publisher. I joined the company about four and a half years ago and via a graduate trainee scheme. At the time I earned about £12k and having worked my around a few departments (I can't really say I've worked my way up) I now earn nearer £20k. It's not been the easiest place to work and during the two winters before last I was working until 9pm many nights, in line with perfectionism of the company and the working culture there. It can be very negative. People will always point out what's gone wrong/artistic temperaments etc. So, having been there for a long time now and in some ways having never quite established myself (I've always been an assistant, in editorial and in digital) I have been starting to feel the need to get out.

I don't have a huge amount of confidence and faith in myself and often feel I don't deserve things/am worthy of things. That's one reason why I still live in this tiny room, I think (and yes, I have had therapy in the past and depression has been with me most of my life). Since the loss of that relationship, I have continually blamed myself, no matter what anyone tells me.

However, living alone has helped me in a lot of ways. During particularly good periods, I have done a LOT more - I don't own a television any more, I go to talks, I take photos, I started learning a new instrument, I read. I'm very good at going to things alone (music/cinema/openings) and have now travelled alone to quite a few places in Europe (and loved this feeling, for the most part).

So I had been considering a move to Berlin as I speak a bit of the language (and would love to learn), I spent a very happy time there 18 months ago, it's an arty city, it's relaxed, it's full of history, I just sort of took to it. Thing is, lots of other people of my demographic also want to move there so it's not really quite as simple as that. You also really do need to be fluent in German.

This year I applied for some good jobs that I wanted in the UK. In two instances I was told I was down to to final two, with no bad feedback but that 'someone more suitable was found' etc. I also applied for a couple of things in Berlin, but no joy.

Something else I applied for was an intern programme at a US arts foundation. I had a Skype interview. I had a further phone chat. I was then offered a place.

However, they had their initial doubts as to why I was applying, given my age and the fact that I already have experience. For anyone familiar with J1 Visas, they could have me on a Professional Training visa, rather than an intern visa. They find me an attractive candidate because of my experience but worry I would be bored. Other participants in the programme tend to be (though not *always) around 23/just finished school or finished with a little experience.

My answer was that I have never had the experience of moving to a new city, that being in New York for six months would be great in terms of personal development and that it is an opportunity I might not get again.
So. I could do this. It would mean using my savings and investing a lot but I could do it.

So why am I scared? Why am I wondering if I should go to Berlin? (which may just be a pie in the sky idea.) I am scared that because of my age I will be the 'weird older one' to others there or will struggle to connect. I am worried that the fact I have experience gives the impression that I know how to do lots of things - not really. As explained above, I've been somewhere a while but don't believe I've made a good impression or have lots to show for myself.

I have been to New York before (once) and obviously know what a cultured, exciting, insane place it is. I fear I won't be able to keep up and that everyone will be wildly ambitious and dynamic (especially if I am with 23 yr olds). Is the culture of the city just too much? (I'm someone with a love of the calmness and lack of population in Scandinavian countries [my favourite place in the world is Iceland] but also someone who often draws energy from the 'challenge' of London.)
But to do it would be a way to break a cycle, perhaps, of 2 and half years spent feeling very lost in a city I love but which is currently weighed down by many ghosts.

I'm scared I will never find anywhere to live, that for all my 'being good at travelling alone', giving to live abroad is something quite different. I'm worried that I have bluffed my way into this offer and neither I am quite the candidate they think I am and they aren't quite the opportunity I hope they are. But if I didn't do it, is that a bigger failing?

Reddit, does they seem like something I have haphazardly engineered or a genuine chance? Or could one turn into the other? Has anyone moved to NYC in a similar way? Any UK redittors who have spent a good chunk of time in the city?

Apologies for not explaining that too well, I can try and answer questions about any of the murky bits.

Thank you, for reading, really thank you."

Some back story for those who care, I was originally doing computer science at my local university. After three years in the major it just wasnt for me since I wanted to do IT work but the school offered only a few courses and people I talked to said it really didnt teach them much. So I felt my only option was going to community college so I took that route, and here I am about to graduate next semester with a associates in computer science and a few certificates from the school.

Just before this summer break started I tried to apply for an internship hoping it would help me learn the ropes, but sadly after sending my resume out I got no responses. I was curious if this was because of my education or lack of experience, thus began my deep anxiety. So now I am looking into a certification with cisco for a CCENT or with microsoft for a MTA for now and move up later when I have the money. The problem for me to move onto certificates is a class in my state costs over $2000 and I feel its a big step to take.

Any opinions or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance."
26qftc,0,2014-05-28,Need advice. How was/were your internship(s)?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/26qftc/need_advice_how_waswere_your_internships/,"Hi /r/engineering,

I am an electrical engineering student with 3 years completed. I had an internship last summer at a major metal compagny and I ended up programming VBA apps and playing with databases for the whole summer. I was bored as hell, and I thought I just had a job that didn't suit me really well (although I love programming, I was the webmaster of our student association and I enjoyed it a lot). I just said 'Whatever, the next one will be more fun'.

Now, I'm currently working for a major power compagny and this time, I feel like I am doing stuff withing my field. After a month, I mostly did data parsing and analysing within Matlab and I am currently writing procedures for electricians and technicians on replacing equipments. Sounds good, right?

The thing is... I find myself bored to the bones.

I don't understand... I love the field a lot, I have a whole lot of fun making circuits and playing with my Raspberry Pi, I absolutely love to learn stuff (I easily spend complete evenings on Wikipedia learning about anything physics related). I have good grades, I love learning in school, but when it comes to work, I don't enjoy it. 

Is it because this is only an internship and engineers mostly give the boring tasks to their interns? Are all engineering jobs boring? Am I in the wrong field? Am I lazy?

My boss (engineer) says I am doing a good job, but I end up doing what he asks me to do in a short time and then I browse reddit for the rest of the day.

I feel lost, I don't know what to do. Were your internships like this, and then it changed when you had your first job?"

If this isn't the correct subreddit to post this in, let me know and I'll move it.  Otherwise, here's the scoop... if anyone could help me, I will be forever in debt.  I've been researching every how-to on Access I can find and I think I've reached the point of being paralyzed with too much information.  A guiding hand of someone who knows what they're doing would work wonders!

I'll give whatever details I can, without giving any confidential info.  If you could help guide me through the big picture of things and how to even begin this, I'd be happy with that.  


1.  This company keeps an excel sheet (A HUGE Excel sheet) containing their service tickets that track bugs, enhancements, and other things that need to be completed on their systems.  The Excel sheet has well over 600 rows, and it has 30-ish columns.  The columns are along the lines of Ticket ID, Date Added, Description, and tons of very granular descriptive things.  Also, there are multiple types of ""Priority"" rankings that are put into an equation in their fields to come up with a total ""Priority"" ranking that helps them determine what jobs get done first.    

2.  They're tired of the excel sheet because it's cumbersome.  They want an Access database that will do the following... 

      1) Import new Excel sheets as a means of reconciliation and updating the Access database with new tickets.
    
      2) Export printable reports on open tickets in the database to various formats.  (Top 10 highest priority, oldest open tickets, tickets related to bugs, type, category, etc, etc)

      3) Display the information in a clean, but informative form that is easier to use than the Excel sheet.  (They will utilize this in virtual meetings with developers on what jobs need to be done and which ones can wait)

      4) Enter tickets directly into the Access database.  (In the case of individual tickets, not existing excel sheets of tickets)

      5) Perform calculations given the different types of priorities.  In the excel sheet, there are different Sub-Priority rankings.  (Customer impact, financial impact, etc)  These columns are put into an excel formula to come up with a total Overall Priority number.  This calculation should be performed in the Access Database, the same way it was done in Excel in the past.  


       If you read this far, thank you!  I'll take any help I can get!

The local library's internet doesn't allow for League and every other WiFi spot in the godforsaken town isn't fast enough to play League and I have disconnected in almost every match. -.- So, I was going to upgrade my data and use my hotspot(which works surprisingly well!).

When I went to Verizon the sales people told me this was a really bad idea because hotspots are horrible for my phone and would mess the battery up permanently and do other damage. They said if this was my plan for just browsing the internet, it would be mostly okay...but since my plan was League, they thought it was a really bad idea for my Iphone.

So my question is: Is this true or just a way for them to try to get me to go with the more expensive option/maybe are uninformed? Is there another way to get internet connection for 2 months? Help!

I thought I wasn't limited by social anxiety- I studied abroad, joined organizations, did internships, ect. and was able to do well because I leaned into my writing and creativity.  I didn't make friends or get close to anyone because I was ""too busy"".  I did really well in my interviews and was hired over people who have more experience because of a gut feeling my bosses had about me.  

Now I have this job and I feel like a wreck a lot of the time.  I am around the most important people in my region and I can hardly speak.  During meetings I can barely make a sound.  I've encountered a lot of these important people in different settings where I feel more confident, but I keep freezing in the workplace and making myself look like a fool.  The office setting is another nightmare- everyone says hello and directly uses your name- I feel so uncomfortable using other people's name.  Small talk is so important and yet I can't seem to even make a sound in some situations.  I know a lot of my coworkers forgive this and brush it off as youthfulness or inexperience, but there are people not much older than I am in positions of ""power"" who are social and friendly.

I don't expect to become a pro overnight, but I need help surviving and thriving in the workplace.  It has already been six months and I still feel immense fear as if I just started.  I spend a lot of time hiding in my office working and hoping no one stops by.

Any help would be appreciated."
26rg27,2,2014-05-29,Scared,nahob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26rg27/scared/,"So I have been afraid about my job recently. I'm not even exactly sure why. I tried to explain to someone earlier today but I don't think I got my point across at all.

I guess, put simply, I'm afraid of not being good.

I have no reason to be afraid of not being good... I mean I've done well at school and I've done well on my own. I've done well with projects, for school and outside of school. And I enjoy doing it, I get things working. I've helped other students. There's not a reason as to why I should be scared of not being good.

It's just the work environment. I am afraid of not being good in the work environment. Not being able to fully understand everything I need to in order to be a productive member of a team. I try though, I really do. I'm at my first internship now and I think... I'm doing ok. Not fantastic. For example, this week I'm aiming at getting ~20 points (Keep in mind I wasn't even assigned 20, and the points are arbitrary, and the rest of the developers aim for getting 50...) for my first full-time sprint.

Okay, all that aside I am still scared. Like Office Space and all those software engineers just not making money or just not liking their job and stuff like that. Is it really like that? If it is, how do I avoid that? I feel like my current job is like that... Jesus it's sort of identical to it. Low pay, irritating office environment, and I'm even writing bank related applications to top it all off.

I'm just afraid of that. Of not being able to support myself in this career. Of being dirt poor even though I'm working. I know my skills are highly demanded and they take a good amount of knowledge and skill! BUt there are those people saying you don't need a degree to get a job in this field. Isn't my degree worth something? 

It's just.. that is what I am afraid of. Of going nowhere and of having a useless skill. Of being a waste.

Working what I think is a dead-end, soul sucking job as a bank teller. Stuck at a fork. I don't know which route to take. Would love to hear some opinions with folk in either industry.

**Programming Route**

I'm currently in the process of sealing the deal for a temporary internship as a data analysis/programming position at a startup. This was the route I wanted to take initially. I figure, get my foot into the tech industry. Study as much as I could on my own (Excel, SQL, and a programming language) while I absorb as much as I could at this company. Then potentially get proficient at programming. Proficient enough for me to land a job in San Francisco. I've always had a thing for computers and I figured this ""would be the one"" career I'd be happy with.

* Cons: 
* I'm not sure how far I can get without a BS in CS.

**Loan Officing Route**

Now I have an older friend (almost like a mentor) who is a successful loan officer in LA. Makes quite the living for himself. We recently had lunch and he is more than willing to take me under his wing and teach me the ropes. Its something I think I can be decent at. He told me to think about it and contact him if my internship falls through. 

* Cons: 
* Not stable. Unsure of market outside of LA.
* Not sure how sustainable it is (long-term)
* Want to move to SF in a few years. Not sure how mobile this career is

i'm not generally an anxious person. 

but i had a phone interview the other day and my heart was exellerated which made my breathing uncontrolled and my voice shaky. my hands were shaking and i was blushing badly.

i am a young adult so ive not had too many 'serious' jobs in my life. i know i am capable of interviewing decently and 'faking it' (confidence) as i have done it before, however that interviewer was relatable/welcoming and i was feeling confident at the time.

i left my last job (only 'serious' one- in corporate) recently, which i was at for a year and i interviewed terribly there. i remember thinking it was so formal as there were 2 interviewers and it was downhill from there. looked so uncomfortable, blushing, barely answered q's, umming and ahhing. they gave me the job which was ridiculous, but i guess they saw on paper my potential and were willing to give me a chance as it was an internship.

so yeah, it seems i do have anxiety under interview situations when i dont feel confident? plus now as i said, it has been over a year since my last interview, which was shit anyway.

can anyone relate or offer advice about minimising my nerves,  controlling breathing, looking less uncomfortable??

The break room was well-stocked. Its spacious interior had enough room for fifteen tables, dozens of chairs, four coffee makers, a pair of refrigerators, and a state-of-the-art food printing machine. 

In the corner of the room was a small couch made of compression foam and covered in expensive hand-stitched leather. Upon it sat a ten year old boy with unruly black hair that hung well down his forehead. 

He sat motionless, save for his breathing which was slow and relaxed. His grey eyes, which everyone was quick to say matched his mother's, were transfixed on the opposing wall. 

The entire wall was alive with motion and color. The nano-circuitry meshed into the wallpaper let you change its design to whatever you felt like. Normally, a singular setting was chosen: a meadow with chirping crickets and grass blowing the breeze or a window looking out on a famous city which allowed the workers at Ethereal Concepts to watch real-time footage of what was happening across the entire planet as they ate their lunch. 

Displayed on the wall today, however, was a podium. Flanking it were two huge flags colored red, white, and blue. Behind it was a great eagle embronzed upon a seal. 

Across the front, a red banner repeated ""President to Speak about Crisis"".

Erik Wren wasn't scared anymore. When his father had changed their destination and called his mother, Erik was so afraid that he could hardly breath. 

""Karen,"" his father had said over the XLR's built-in phone, ""I need you to pack up everything now.""

""What do you mean, Thomas?"" she had asked him.

Glancing at his young son, Thomas pressed a button on the console of the car and the conversation was transferred to a small silver and blue speaker in his ear.

""Turn on the news."" He said, with a strange expression on his face.

After a few moments of silence he spoke in response to a prompt that Erik no longer could hear.

""Honey... Karen... calm down."" He paused again. ""Karen, look at the pictures. There's no way they...."" 

Thomas's face looked pained.

""I know... darling, I know. Karen, please focus. They're gone, Karen.""

Erik reached up and grabbed his father's datapad from where it sat, forgotten, on the front passenger seat. Displayed upon it was the same picture that his father had received a few minutes earlier. Erik looked at the burning buildings. 

""Whoa"" he said, with an awe that only a child can muster.
Then he read the caption at the bottom of the picture: ""Los Angeles Annihilated"".

*That's where grandma and grandpa live!* He thought. *I wonder if they got to see what happened.*

His father's voice grew louder and interrupted Erik's thoughts. 

""Karen, you need to listen! There isn't anything that we can do about that now, I need you to pack our things."" his voice dropped down again, ""Darling, please, for Erik's sake.""

There was a long pause as Thomas listened intently. Then he spoke again.

""Ethereal Concepts....""

""Yes, we'll be there....""

""I'm sure he'll be safe Karen.....""

""Ok, see you soon....""

""I love you.""

His father pressed a button and ended the call. For a few moments he stared blankly out the front windshield at the passing suburban landscape as the car made its way out of the center of the city. Soon it would pass rolling hills and then rocky edifices on its way to his offices.

""Daddy?"" Erik asked, his voice small. ""What's going on?""

Thomas gave his son a helpless glance. Then he took a deep breath and began to speak.

Now Erik knew and he wasn't scared anymore. As he watched the news, he wondered if Grandma and Grandpa had made it out alright. He was sure they had. Grandpa was  a tough old man, he had been in the military. He'd give these aliens a fight, for sure.

""Stay right here."" His father had told him before leaving to find anyone who hadn't yet fled home to their families. Erik had heard him muttering something about needing to ""accelerate preparations for departure"" as he left the break room. His balding head shining in the white fluorescent light.

""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" a voice sounded from the screen, ""the President of the United States.""

A woman with long red hair walked with a stately stride out from the right side of the screen. Erik heard the shutter of clicking cameras. She took her place behind the podium at the center of the screen.

He thought she looked tired. There were lines on her face and bags under her eyes. Her suit looked wrinkled. He was certain that she could have fallen asleep standing if she had needed to. 

""My fellow Americans,"" she said, sounding exhausted, ""to fellow nations, to all of the people of the world."" 

She paused and took in a long breath, lifting herself higher off the podium.

""As of this morning, we found out we are not alone in the Universe.""

""Something terrible and malicious has found its way to our home. These beings have shown no mercy.""

""As I speak to you, Bejing, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, Manila, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro...."" she paused, ""Los Angeles, and San Fransisco have all been destroyed.""

""The death toll is in the hundreds of millions. Perhaps even greater.""

""Our military responded rapidly and appropriately alongside our allies, but this foe has an insurmountable technological advantage over us.""

Erin saw tears well in her eyes. Soon they were rolling freely down her face. She didn't seem to notice.

""So far, none of our conventional arms have been able to significantly impede their assault. However,"" she paused, and something flashed across her face. It looked defiant. ""a secret project instated by my predecessor has been re-purposed to fight these aliens. A Lunar magnetic acceleration cannon has been fired at the alien vessel in low Earth orbit. It was a direct hit.""

She paused, letting the words sink in.

""As of right now, it appears damaged and shows no signs of activity. Clearly, these things can be damaged and destroyed. To that end, I have ordered the First, Third, and Fourth Fleets stationed near Hawaii to begin their assault on the ship still near San Fransisco. These brave men will be joined by the entire home-based US Air Force as well as several thousand surface missiles.""

""We are going to bring that fucking hunk of metal out of the sky. We are going to retake the initiative. They may have started this fight, but we are damn well going to finish it.""

There was thunderous applause that came from somewhere off screen. Erik clapped excitedly from his spot on the couch. His grey eyes were wide with interest.

An intern ran up to the President from off-screen. He leaned in close to the President and attempted to whisper in her ear. He spoke too loudly, and Erik heard what he said.

""Madam President, the ship has powered back up. The Hammer is not yet prepared to fire another round.""

The room was still roaring with applause, but Julia Edwards suddenly looked anything but excited.

I was 13 and taking my annual physical for football (american), and it was the first time my mother allowed me to go into the doc's office while she waited in the lobby. I had just started going through puberty and was extremely proud of the hair i had sprouted around my business, and in a fucked up way was somewhat stoked to have the doc see the man I had become.

So I get escorted back to the exam room where I wait for 5-10 minutes for the doctor to come in. He comes in with a smoking hot 20 something intern with clipboard in hand. I'm thinking to myself, ""all good..shes just taking down my vitals and she'll be outta here""...that thought lasted seconds, up until the doc said ""Hey Badbrained, this is such and such my intern, are you ok with her being here for your exam?"" Inside, I was screaming FUCK NO IM NOT OK, but in an effort to not look like a bitch, I agreed to her attendance.

Knowing that I'm moments away from exposing myself to a drop dead gorgeous intern, I end up wigging myself out to point that my 13 year old junk had completely turtled inside my pelvis. I panic, and start thinking of ANYTHING arousing to pop the guy back out, but to no avail. I was so nervous, I thought I was gonna puke.

Doc gets to the hernia exam portion of the party, and both he and the intern crouch down to inspect my tackle. He's facing me on one knee, while she's off to the side slightly...but RIGHT the fuck up in there. He tells me to turn my head and cough, and I oblige. Evidently I didn't cough hard enough, so he asks me to do it again. This time, I cough so fucking hard I twist my body along with my head, and accidentally blast her right in the face with an out of control fart. Doc looks up and says ""Yeah son, not THAT hard"".

I was so embarrassed that I made up some bullshit months down the road to my mother so she would be down with me switching doctors. Good times. "

I'm doing a 3 months unpaid internship ending in july and it was one of the worst things that could happen right now because I I literally don't do nothing in it, I could care less about that area, I wake up at 6am, see that girl on the subway sometimes and think to myself I would never get her because I would never talk to her and if I did I would dissapoint her.
I wonder on my way to home if being alone and wait for the end of the internship is worth just to go to the university.

I have very good friends, we talk about almost anything, we often hang out, get drunk and relax together.

I don't know if I'm making sense but I get angry, sometimes about nothing at all, I just show it more physically when I'm drunk, and in bad mood during. I'm really agressive on my soccer play style, I have this friend who is 1,90m and +150kg, when I'm in bad mood I usually doesn't stand a chance and sometimes he gets some injuries. Btw I'm lilttle, 1,75m and 75kg.

I just can't find a reason to live if all I do is wake up, study/work, get sad about don't finda that girl, get home, do something for 2h and sleep. It can get better but the sun is shining and I'm often not smiling while I think about my pathetic life.

I think about suicide often and would do it if he it wasn't for my close family and friends. Is all of this normal or I should get help? I don't want some profissional help because my parents would flip if they found out I think about all of this."

Is there anything I can do to increase my chances?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/26t94c/not_happy_currently_as_a_business_systems_analyst/,"I work for a Fortune 200 company and I was hired on from an internship after working at the helpdesk for a year.  I am currently working as a Business Systems Analyst but the position doesn't really seem that ""IT"" to me.  It's more customer facing and not what I envisioned doing for my job.  

I held an internship back in college where I put up server racks and did networking and other hands on support which I LOVED but it was only for 3 months.  I also held a job as a computer technician at my university for 1.5 years which was less involved but I still got to play ""hands on"".  

I'm just not happy with my job.  It's not terrible and in fact I probably sound ungrateful because they pay me very generously.  The thing is I AM SO BORED.  I literally do maybe 2 hours of work a day.  Some people would call this a dream job, but even redditing for 6 hours a day is boring.  I want to go somewhere where I can do hands on stuff like a System Administrator job.  

I am afraid to start applying for System Administrator jobs because while I am working in IT, I'm not getting the ""experience"" I should for that positions even though I've held those types of positions in the past.  I know I can go through training and learn quick but I don't think a company will see that, unless they see something in me in an interview.

I expect to get a lot of responses regarding certifications but I'm not sure how to go about those or which one to get, let alone if I want to do all of the studying and paying for the test.  Does anyone have any tips?"
26tgus,3,2014-05-29,Did you switch to Web Dev from an entirely different career?,NoobPwnr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26tgus/did_you_switch_to_web_dev_from_an_entirely/,"I’d love to hear what it was like if you switched to Web Development from a completely unrelated career. 

I ask because I’m slowly considering it and would like to limit any unrealistic expectations – that the grass is greener, so to speak. 

If you did, what was it like? What's different about your daily work life, your metrics, your work relationships, your overall happiness? For example, I ponder what it will be like working with people who are more technically-minded than I'm used to. What it will be like having metrics that aren’t based on sales number. What it's like to be in a situation where my output (code) must sync with a group (back end, UI, etc), as opposed to something like sales where I’m an ""individual contributer"".

About me: 30 years old, basically been in sales since my degree in business. This includes retail sales, some retail management, web startup sales, and now a web startup position where I’m responsible to build traction via customer acquisition, product feedback and innovation, marketing, you name it. 

I love computers, am creative at heart and enjoy building things. I have a knack for design and web products and actually serve as a intermediary between our sales team and the Product Manager. I considered pursuing it but feel that I'm more creative and less analytically than the PM role requires. Over the past year I’ve been spending around four hours a week familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS and JS via studies and projects. I feel like I’m reaching a point where I’m starting to imagine the realities of pursuing it as a career, and this is causing these questions to arise. 

I might have lofty expectations, but I figure I should also explain how I foresee the future looking. Feel free to critique: *continue studies and building out small projects. Get into boot camp here in SF in six months. Land intern or junior position at a company that doesn't ask for highschool GPA / what it was like working for McKinsey. Snag a role model at work, work hard, continue my education, and either work my way up there or find an entry level position at a new company. Either continue on that path, or try my hand at freelancing / starting my own small web development company.*

Thanks in advance for sharing any similar experiences and words of advice."
26tln0,4,2014-05-29,Why is the UW screwing over students so hard in tuition?,[deleted],udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/26tln0/why_is_the_uw_screwing_over_students_so_hard_in/," Why is the tuition a whopping $12.5k a year when the UW is sitting on an endowment bank of 2.3 billion dollars up 235 million on last year? If they took the 235 million dollar increase from last year and put it towards lowering the tuition of the 29 thousand undergraduate students they would  have lowered it by over $8k meaning it would instead cost us only $4.5k. They would still have their 2.1 billion dollar bank that they had last year.

And to make matters worse despite the overpriced tuition and large endowment the university still won't get its act together regarding the abysmal acceptance rates of its engineering schools and other programs. Computer science and engineering has dropped below a 28% acceptance rate and other programs are having similar funding issues.

What the fuck is going on and why the fuck are we getting screwed over so hard? What happened to this being a public university? I don't know how they expect students like me to be able to afford $27k a year costs. The only reason I'm able to keep attending is because summer software internships pay well and I work 40 hours each week while going part-time(which doesn't save much on tuition...). Which is pretty pathetic for a public university. By no means is the problem only relevant to the UW. It's an issue across the entire American public university system at the moment. However that doesn't make it any better."
26txlt,1,2014-05-29,Financial Woes with dad. How do I deal with this and the stress.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26txlt/financial_woes_with_dad_how_do_i_deal_with_this/,"I just need to vent and see if there's anything that I can do. I graduated college 6 months ago and my dad did all of my financial aid, which likely includes forging my signature on paperwork and god even knows what. He never discussed my financial situation with me even when I've asked. 

I saved some money by being an RA. I didn't have a car until I was about to start my junior year of college so getting a job was not really an option because my father refused to let me take public transit and university transit went only to a very limited number of stores. I was unable to get an internship.

Now that I'm out of school I have a double major in psychology and Spanish in an area with a decent sized latino population. Well, it's been hard finding a job as you can imagine. I figured some businesses would take psych degrees and I could get my foot in the door in business but that hasn't happened. I did land a job which is in mental health and is 30 hours a week. Well, the job is extremely demanding and as you can imagine I'm barely getting by with the insane amount of time I put into this job. My job in mental health is finding people with disabilities jobs and things with that have been going really poor the last month or two because of a new manager and some really bad policies that are taking up our time.

So my dad is trying to get me to take a second job at a grocery store or something but my first job doesn't have a reliable schedule so it's not been easy to get a job like this because I don't have stable availability. I can't even find my client's jobs so how can I get a second job?

So I've been living with my mom (parents divorced) for the last six months and now the loan payments are coming in and I'm so stressed out. My dad didn't realize that he is 38K in the hole with MY student loans and just dropped this bomb on me 2-3 days ago. I also have my own 29K in my name. I stood up to him for the first time in my life 

I had no idea my dad put himself in this kind of debt for my education. Why the hell did he not build me a college fund? He takes my stepmom on nice exotic vacations. I was supposed to housesit for him while he goes to Cancun or something next week. Now he's getting my stepbrother to do it because for whatever reason suddenly I'm not responsible to him. And he doesn't want me spending time with my boyfriend that I've been with a year and he supposedly likes alone. They're super conservative Christian parents. I really needed that week away from my family to de-stress and now he's taking it away from me as a punishment whether he admits it or not. I have no outlet for my stress. My boyfriend just graduated school and is in the unemployment boat himself.

Very obviously my father is stressed out because he did not manage my student loans well and never spoke to me about them. He still has financial control over my car and cell phone because I'm poor right now. He seems to think a job is just going to magically appear and it isn't. So now he's taking out his poor management of money onto me and driving me deeper into stress when I'm already stressed out about the fact that I can't find a full-time job, my job is unreliable and I don't even get paid for the amount I work, and I can't even get my clients jobs right now let alone me. So how do I survive? I'd take any job that's full time. I'd really like to work for the county but I don't have any connections. How do I make him stop taking his stress out on me and punishing me for standing up for myself to him for the first time in my life? My mother is just blindly following him on this and is talking about charging me rent on top of this horrible financial strain."

26ujas,1,2014-05-29,Request for Academic Advice from a Confused Post-Bacc,goodapollo901,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/26ujas/request_for_academic_advice_from_a_confused/,"Disclaimer: I fully realize that the path I take in life is up to me alone, and I should not depend on others to tell me what’s best. However, I deeply value the perspectives of others and believe that no matter what input I receive, it can only lead to more informed decisions. 

I’m posting here with the hope that some members of this community might have suggestions on how I should pursue my current interests. In the following, I’ll give a little background on myself and what I hope to expand on in the future. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.

 I graduated a year ago from a top university with a degree in psychology along something my school calls the “neuroscience track.” Basically, this meant that on top of roughly 12 psychology based classes (ranging from evolutionary psychology to clinical animal models to psychopharmacology), I had to take 5 “hard” biology classes, three of which had to be higher level. In addition to these, I took a number of classes outside of my major and got a very liberal arts type education. During my time as an undergrad, I only worked in one lab unfortunately.

I came out of school certainly happy with what I had learned—I garnered knowledge in a number of fields and found myself able to be interested in anything I attended to. However, I felt, and continue to feel, fairly spread out and lacking the ability to decide which of my interests I want to pursue and how. For the past year, I’ve mostly traveled, but am currently doing a somewhat menial internship with my state’s environmental conservation department. I know I want to go back to school at some point, but need more experience before I decide for what.

As of now, my strongest interests lie in cognitive science, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, environmental sciences, and complex systems (modeling self-organizing dynamics and studying emergent properties arising from the interactions of entities). My current thought is to find a cognitive science based internship to work once I’m done with my current internship in order to retest and revamp my skills in the discipline. Then, I think it would be great to spend a couple years in Boston U’s LEAP doing system engineering or a [similar program] (http://www.uvm.edu/~cmplxsys/teaching-learning/certificate-of-study-in-complex-systems/) that focuses on complex systems. My interest in this area mostly stems from a class I took in fractals my senior year that seemed to assimilate everything I had learned up to that point and I believe that knowledge in the field is applicable to any discipline—especially that of the brain. Subsequently, I would want to complete a masters or PHD in a cognitive science/neuroscience related field. 

In the area of cognitive science, I think my biggest interest lies in cognitive training—using what we know about the mind’s processes to create “training” software or techniques that could be used to help mitigate deficiencies in individuals, to improve education, or to simply sharpen and strengthen the different cognitive abilities of average people.


Here are a few particular questions I have in mind:

Do you agree with the utility of educating myself in complex systems to apply it to later studies that deal directly with the processes of the mind?

What type of cognitive science internship might I pursue given my interests?

I haven’t taken calc or pure physics since freshman year, would I be in trouble when it comes to trying to pursue complex systems? I assume I could take a couple of low level classes to catch me up before going this route.

Does anyone know of any post-bacc  general science programs similar to a pre-med program that might fit with my interests and be beneficial to pursuing study in complex systems or cognitive science?


Yes, that was fairly long winded. I hope that some of you out there have gotten through it and have the time to give your reaction—whatever it might be. Thanks.

I am a software developer from Germany with around 4 years of experience, mostly in (ASP/C#)DotNet + (MS)SQL, but a lot off little additional experience here and then (HTML ofc, ObjectiveC for my first app, a few lines of PHP and so on and so on...

After a few years of Freelancing I got a job offer for a normal position around 30km from me, what means no travaling any more, no hotels any more etc.

I'm in week 3 and I really like the ppl who work with me here and I like the boss, *BUT* (!) I am so much of underestamited and underworked. I have freaking nothing to do. It's not that the company hasn't work to do but the firms pay so much more hours then we need, what gives so big ""nothing to do"" holes... e.g. I got a little project which was estimated with 3 days of work and get payed 3 days (so 24 hours) of work. I did the whole thing in around 8 hours. So when I told my boss that, he smiles (not because I am such a good developer, because he knows we get much more paid then we have to do)  and tell me to ""educate myself"" what in fact is the company intern term to ""play diablo 3"" or ""surf on facebook""... yes, my boss ask me to do rifts in D3 with him... 

So in fact, I dont want to be a grinch but Im so hard bored right now here, I dont want a job in which I play D3 or surf on FB, I want a freaking job in which I can do nice software-development work! I was a freelancer and as a freelancer I was used to work 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, because that is how I make myself happy and how you earn money and get new customers... 

So, I really really need an advice... what should I do?"

26vuoz,8,2014-05-30,I have 2 very diverse job offers...,HansMoleman55,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/26vuoz/i_have_2_very_diverse_job_offers/,"**(tldr at the bottom)**


Some background on me: I used to play professional online poker for 4 years and did very well in the industry. I left as a combination of burn out and the online poker shutdown in the US, so I went back to school in my mid-20s. I have a finance and math degree, a couple of finance related internships, and a 1 year job at a New York City day trading firm. I have been unemployed 9 months, getting very few interviews because of my somewhat polarizing (and generally misunderstood) past. Luckily, I'm financially secure for someone my age, have been able to afford living without income the last 4 years and can continue to do so for a few more if it came down to it (I don't say that to brag; that fact is relevant to this decision).


**Offer 1:** temp job with a major bank to work in their back office. No benefits but with time-and-a-half I should be making around $20/hour and should be on pace to make around 45-50k/year (way above what I was expecting in an entry level job). 12-hour days :( I took poker off my resume to interview with them, so they are not even aware of my past. I'm really not all that interested in what they do, but the money and stability are a nice change.


**Offer 2:** an internship(!!!) with a commercial real estate investment firm. It is unpaid, although they have promised to pay me commissions on any properties I help them find. The appeal here is that I am very interested in real estate investing (I interned for a REIT in college). I was introduced to the president of the company through a friend, and we instantly bonded because we both play poker and both were entrepreneurs. He is not someone who I have to hide my past (a la the bank) from and actually views it as an asset. 


He wants me to shadow him on a daily basis so that I can get a crash course on learning the business inside and out. While there's no firm structure for parlaying the internship into a paid position (they are a very small, tightly-knit team), I truly believe -- through my conversations with him and the endorsement of my friend who introduced me to him -- that this guy and his family (it's a family run business) has my best interests at heart and is not just exploiting free labor. They just don't have a full-time opening at this moment and also want me to ""prove"" myself first. 


The risk-taking, entrepreneurial side of me from my poker days is extremely intrigued by offer 2. It's obviously very risky, but offers the most upside and the most freedom (in that I would not have to ""sell my soul"" to corporate America). I can afford to continue living without income, although obviously that's not ideal.


On the other hand, after almost 1 year of uncertainty and depression over my lack of job prospects beyond poker, it's REALLY hard to turn down a salaried position for a known company. It may not be exactly where my interests lie, the upside may not be the same working in an office with 500 people as getting a daily first-hand crash course from the president of a successful real estate investment firm, and I would have to ""sell my soul"" a little because I have to devalue my past accomplishments in poker, but it's a paycheck and a career god damnit!


I'd love to hear if anybody has ever been in a similar situation and what you may think.

-------------------------------------------------------------
**tl;dr:**


**Safe, yet soul-crushing corporate job with salary at a bank.


**Unpaid internship in an interesting business with someone I get along with very well, where I'd get a rare opportunity to learn the business by shadowing the president of the company. 


**While a paycheck would be nice, I can continue to afford living comfortably without income. Not preferable, but I could do it if I wanted to take a chance."

Which I know is a huge red flag for this field, but I was willing to take it anyway because I also know it's common for this field and fuck it, I like coding and want to learn everything I can. Cultural fit for me, open-source-focused, gorgeous office, relatively young company.

I gave my desired figure (the median for the title), just got the offer letter—60%. I just graduated last semester with a Bachelor's in CS, and I have a year of paid experience developing web applications from an internship at a major corporation. (Full web applications—I created/manage the databases, manage the server, wrote the backend and designed/wrote the frontend. My apps are used across the company and save them a fuck ton of money per year. Pay was just a little below entry level for a web developer, hourly, no benefits.) The pay they're offering me now is just slightly above what I was making in the internship, and from the sound of the interview I'd be working on low-level code in addition to web app stuff.

I was prepared to take 85% of what I asked for, but this seems really low. There's healthcare benefits, but I don't get any shares of the company. Not sure what to do at this point. I haven't interviewed anywhere else yet, but I've got a recruiter who thinks he can get me in at a couple other places that would fit me and he thinks I'm worth the figure I gave them.  I've got a good resume, I've been promised but am waiting on an official offer letter from my Corp as a contracted employee (that I'm hesitant to take, I don't like the corporate IT culture, but it's tentatively there), and I can stay at the student internship for another semester before they have to let me go (living with my dad right now, so I'm not at risk of ending up on the street). 

Not sure what to do. Part of me just wants to tell them politely to fuck off and just look elsewhere, another part wants to try and debate with them and bring the number up, but now I'm feeling like somehow I've got it confused and overestimated what I'm worth, like all the salary sites I looked at were wrong. Advice? I want the experience/pay ASAP and don't want any gaps on my resume, but I don't need the job to eat. It seemed like there was a ton I could learn there, but I'm feeling pretty damn insulted.

I have decent grades and just got back from a study abroad from China. 

I went into engineering because that is what a career test told me I would be good at and at the time I didn't know what I wanted to do and it didn't seem like a bad option. I then went into  mechanical engineering because I was always told it was the broadest of engineering majors and thus could do almost anything upon graduation so to me it sounded like it was a good fit until I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.

A few things I have found out so far is I do not want to work in thermodynamics or fluid mechanics. Upon searching for internships I am getting a lot of jobs that seem to be in the above fields which is understandable but I am not seeing the broad spectrum that I thought mechanical engineering would offer me. When looking for jobs/internships I now feel like my skill set is inappropriate or useless and am at a loss of what to do. I still don't really know what I want to do with my life and I feel like I need a job/internship so that at the very least I can see other people's jobs to start the process in my mind of ""oh hey that looks like fun maybe I want to do what he/she does"" but don't know what to go into or apply for. 

I also feel like I haven't progressed much in what I want to do and rather just have ruled out things I don't want to do. When people ask me what my interests are and I think about it I don't really have a solid answer for the question. My thought process usually goes ""well I did enjoy doing that class, lets try doing it on my own"" which then leads me to trying it and for some reason the spark is gone or for whatever reason I lose interest. I am at a loss for what my actual (job possible) interests are.

Help?,plipmaster,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/26x6gh/26_still_absolutely_no_clue_what_i_want_to_do_help/,"In a very deep rut now with what is currently a up and down and unstable career in professional audio.  It's been 4 years now, and I've been very miserable and lost on what to do.  

Backstory:  My biggest dream since childhood was to work in game development and go to one of the 4 year game design schools (like Digipen).  My family harassed me about this and made me feel like an idiot for wanting to do it so I (stupidly) went to a state college instead (Penn State).  I hated it, and I had a lot of issues with the system and professors.  I was always a high GPA student so I didn't have problems with flunking or what not, I just felt so much was wrong with the system in general and academia.  I spent three years at Penn State and felt like I wasn't learning anything, so I dropped out.  

After much consideration, I felt going to a vocational school was my best bet at this point.  I had already wasted 3 years so I wanted to make up for lost time.  Plus with so many college graduates not finding work and employers complaining they don't have any skills anyway, it seemed like the most well-informed decision at the time.  I went to a vocational school for audio recording and engineering.  

Well, I loved it.  Super hands on program that taught on the job and practical skills.  Very cutthroat and fast paced program, but it was excellent.  I even landed an internship in audio design while in school yet and thought I had done it, everything was going to work out.  

Welp, 4 years later and thousands of hours of effort put into the job search, my career has been nothing but up and down contract gigs.  My internship was extended for nearly 2 years but I never was able to get made full-time.  Gaps of horrible unemployment, layoffs, no benefits, contract work.  I am miserable.  I want stability so bad so I can finally settle down with my girlfriend and start a family, but it's hard to do when I've been draining my savings account every year to make it through this feast and famine career.  

So here I am now.  I've currently been unemployed 10 months and have only managed some part time freelance here and there.  I'm going back to school now for a Business Management degree, but to be honest, I really don't know what I want to do.  The thing that felt most right turned out to be a flop due to all the instability with it.  Other jobs that appeal to me are also generally considered unstable and feast or famine.  I've done career coaching, career assessments, and read several career books, and all point me back into the direction of audio and games, but I can't deal with the instability of it even if that's where my best skills and passion lay.  When looking at other careers based off assessments, I don't know if I can see myself doing any of them.  Some of the careers that appeal to me the most (engineering for example) I really think I lack the aptitude for.  Business management and project management is a top match on my career assessments, but you don't exactly just become a manager with a snap of the fingers...  

All and all, I am just extremely lost on what I should be doing with my time and energy.  I'm in my business management degree now, but I'm feeling like I should maybe swap into something more specialized like Accounting or Human Resources (but Accounting honestly doesn't seem like my thing... and I'm ONLY attracted to it because of the high availability).  I think I've thought of every job in the world, meditated and soul searched about them, heck even mock interviewed people about them, and still nothing seems to click except my audio and game development which I am so sick of.  More than anything though I want stability, but I just can't seem to settle on something to focus on.  

TL:DR No idea what I want to do for a career.  The jobs that felt most right have been too unstable and made me miserable.  I'm currently going back to school for a new degree and want to make sure I'm making the right choice. The smart choice that will allow me to finally settle down, buy a home, and have some financially security and a decent life.  

EDIT: Sorry this is a wordy post.  Even still I don't feel like I've even scratched the surface of my struggles just trying to get a career going and finding my path in life.  Sometimes I don't think even a million words can describe it... part of almost wants to write a biography on my soul tearing experiences the last 4 years.  All and all, I'm trying to make things better now by going back to school, but just nothing feels right, and things that do I don't really fit into.  You think I would have a clear answer from all the asssessments, tests, coaching, and soul searching I've done, but I'm just as confused as I've ever been.  "

I am a Junior ME student, will be senior when the next semester starts. I did not get a internship this summer. My GPA is very low and will likely stay that way. And as many say if I don't have experience I should do some project that I can put on my resume.

So

1) Should I do independent project on my own?

If Yes then:

Should I document them on a website, and put that website on my resume along with a little something about the projects?

2) If No then is there anything else can do?

-------------------------------------------------------------
For the Project(s), I have 2 mechanical heavy projects on my resume already that I did in the university with Creo. Now during the summer I'm planning to go through the book Make: Electronics to expand my horizons in the electrical side of things. Once I go through the book I plan to either use one of the projects from the book or build something what I learn from it.

3) Is this a good Idea?

Any help is greatly appreaticated.

Video Card: GeForce GTX 570

I’ve made quite a lot of hours at work this year, so I want to buy a very good card. Also I’m starting university in September, and I don’t actually want to spend a huge amount of money during my studies. So the card I am going to buy now should be able to suffice for around 4 years.

So that leaves me with my question, should I buy a GTX 780 now? Or should I wait a bit for a possible GTX 880?

I'm a college student.  About three weeks ago I started an engineering internship at a fairly large company.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to have a lot of work for me to do, and a lot of people in my group seem fairly apathetic that I am there.

I tend to be a little shy, but I don't think I gave them any reason to see me as rude or incapable.  Whenever I am given a task, even if it is ""busywork"" such as copying stuff into Excel, I always happily accept it.  I'll make sure to finish it quickly, check for spelling mistakes, and format it nicely.  I'll then double check with them to make sure I did it correctly and ask if there's anything I should fix.  However, it seems like most of the time I ask for more work, they really don't have anything for me to do.  

Whenever I talk to my manager, he always seems like he's too busy for me, or I'm keeping him from something more important.  I know I'm just an intern, but I sort of expected them to have more projects for me to work on; otherwise, why did they hire me?  The other day he was talking on his phone in the hallway and I overheard him say he doesn't have any work for me to do.

I have friends who are interning at other companies this summer, and I can't help but feel a little bad when I hear them talking about all the cool projects they are contributing to and the things they are working on.  I am worried that if the rest of the summer is like this, then I won't develop many skills to make me useful for future internships/co-ops.

I was wondering if any of you have advice on how I should handle this situation?  If things don't improve, what should I tell future interviewers if they ask me what I learned from this internship?

I know am being a little vague here because I am afraid of being identified, and I certainly do not want to badmouth the company.  The company is great, but it seems like I do not fit in well with my group.  If you would like to talk about it in more detail, feel free to PM me.  Thanks!"

Despite applying to literally dozens of companies throughout my senior year, I have only managed to receive two interviews (neither of which resulted in an offer). Despite this lack of success in my job search, I was an outstanding student in school: in addition to graduating with an overall GPA of 3.8+ (and an engineering GPA only ever so slightly lower), I also spent over three semesters gaining valuable experience in an engineering research lab on campus. I never received an internship but I feel that because of the nature of my work and how long I had this position, it was far more valuable than a brief summer internship would have been. Due to these accomplishments, I was granted what was essentially a free pass into the graduate program at my university. However, right now industry is where I want to go but it seems that all of my hard work and accomplishments mean absolutely nothing. Anyway, what gives? Does industry just hate high achievers?"

However, there is a TINY detail that might possibly damage my case...",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/26zjal/being_harassed_by_my_school_even_though_i_am_in/,"the Dean of career services has decided he thinks I'm lying about a summer internship offer, when I am not. He wants to force me to let him contact the people who gave me the offer and ask them if I lied. Obviously that would make me look sketchy as hell. There is only one possible inconsistency I can think of in all the statements they will be relying on to fuck me over...

So basically it comes down to these 2 statements I made:

When detailing my summer internship situation recently to the Dean I said:
""At that point (after I learned my first Texas choice didn't give me an offer) I really only had 2 unpaid job offers in texas but could not make them work for personal and financial reasons""

A few weeks before that, I had emailed an alumni explaining my situation and asking for advice on finding a job, in which I said:
""Unfortunately I had to end up declining my Texas job offer for personal and financial reasons which is why I am sending you this email last minute""

The only possible question in this case that I can see them asking is ""well in the email to the alumni you said you had to decline your job offer, then later when you explained your situation in detail to me you said at one point you had 2 job offers left in Texas...so is it one or two?""

First - I never said my ONLY Texas job offer in the email to the alumni. I was literally just trying to be as concise as possible in explaining myself to the alumni.

Second - I technically did decline one offer before the other, so by the time I emailed the alumni I had just declined my last remaining offer in Texas

Is this something I should worry about?

I'm seeing an attorney on Monday and just want to know if this is something I should focus on. It seems WAY too trivial but still I'm worried.

I was planning on getting an internship this summer as a web developer but never got an interview. So I decided to apply for a full-time position as a Front-End Web Developer for a retail store just to test my luck and lucky me I got an interview this upcoming Monday! 

While I was going through the requirements for the position it listed some of these:

- 2+ years of professional experience
(**Other than participating in my schools hack-a-thon to create a mobile app**)

- Knowledge of cloud-based CDNs (RackSpace, Scene7, etc.) (**Never before used**)

- A great portfolio of professional work. (**Don't have one**)

I know that I'm a really good programmer/web developer, I was even a tutor at my school for intro to Web Dev. But I have horrible interview skills and get extremely nervous about it. Like what are some of the questions ill be asked? I really don't have a portfolio of professional work other than class assignments, badass UI Websites I've created and uniquely interesting Photoshop pictures. I'm a really fast learner when It comes to programming. But I'm not necessarily a school person I've gotten really bad grades in about almost all my classes except programming, math, and art classes. So that probably makes up for why I didn't get an internship even through I stand at a 2.80 GPA. I feel as if they wouldn't want an amateur web developer working along side them. 

So if you guys could please help with some advice about Web-Dev interviews or any type of personal experience of IT positions to better my chances at getting this position I would really appreciate it.
