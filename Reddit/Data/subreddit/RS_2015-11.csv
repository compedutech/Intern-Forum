I'm a Sophomore Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. I'm currently looking for my first summer internship - preferably as a software engineer. My junior and senior friends have encouraged me to compile a list of companies I would be interested in working with, but I feel so lost with such a variety of companies to choose from - especially in the bay area. 

I'm asking for your help reddit. What companies do you suggest applying to? This can include start ups and larger companies. I'm down for anything, as long as there's an opportunity available! "

I'm pretty stuck at a certain phase in my life. So it would be nice if you guys could offer some advice for me.

I’ll appreciate if you could bear with me as what I'm going to share will be pretty lengthy.

I'm a 22 year old male who just got out of mandatory military service 1 1/2 months ago. I've been an intern working as a 'Software Developer' ever since. 

A year ago, I was pretty depressed that even my friends felt that I was having depression. The cause was basically because of me thinking about what should I do in life? I come from a country in Asia where education is pretty much the key factor in life. I had no skills, no money, no direction to go in life.

I must admit I’m not someone who has lots of friends, though I do yearn for it. As I look at people around me, I see people following the life cycle of an asian, study hard, get a good degree, get a good job, get married, carry on the family line, work till retirement/death.

I’m afraid to be someone who just has a meaningless goal in life which is to work to make end’s meet and then die.

I’ve been a Software Developer for the past 1.5 months, I’m not boasting or anything, but even though on and off, I did some on and off self-study programming before, but I would still say I’m pretty weak at it. So over the past 1.5 months, I do feel that I have improved quite a bit, and my CEO even gave me a ‘letter of commendation’ for this month. It’s pretty cool, as people told me that it was really fast that I got such a letter as I’ve only worked here for 1.5 months. 

I believe in working in what you are passionate in, I’ve been working 80-100 hours a week, losing sleep and working through nights to complete the project, but I honestly don’t feel like I’m working, I feel like I’m studying and learning instead, because I enjoy what I do. There’s this phrase “If you work in something you enjoy, you never have to work another day”. I feel that this is so true.

Career wise, I will be working here till I go overseas to study next year for a 1 year CS degree, to be honest, that degree is more of a fall back plan and a step for me to get into the western culture.

My plan is to get a degree, work a few years overseas before returning home to do my own start-up. After working here, when I look at the project that I’m working on and the amount that I’m getting paid. I know that entrepreneurship would be the way to go for me. At least I would give it a try in my 20s.

What should I do guys…?

I belong to the Leo zodiac, and I can say I’ve been a really ‘all about me’ person. I would love to have a career of my passion….

Thank you guys for reading this far, I really appreciate this."

I'm at the end of my first year of a CS degree (planning double major, software devlopment and artificial intelligence). I'm on the eve of all my exams for the end of the semester. First one tomorrow. I believe myself to be adept in programming after this first year and reckon i am a fast learner in this area. I have done C and Java both with high grades and good functional knowledge. Now after exams i will be on summer holiday for a couple of months and am trying to figure out a project or two to spend time on that will advance me in my programming skills and would be a strong asset when hunting for an internship. I plan to write and try and maintain my first website (however i am trying to pick up webdev from tutorials, and am going quite slow at the moment due to exam study). I was also planning to write a java program that interacted with Riot's API and gave you extra invaluable information for your current game of League Of Legends, however i have gone off gaming these past couple of months. So i dont think i want to spend time creating this app as i dont believe i will have the drive to complete it, well.  Aswell as the website creation are there any recommendations for a summer project, or is it more adviseable to create lots of small apps that have been written millions of times by undergrads?

Seeking some extra drive and some shoves towards a challenging but enjoyable project. I have also thought about instead of doing another side project to spend time learning a Lisp language ethier Common Lisp or Clojure as i believe they may be invaluable skills for my desired future in AI, thoughts?

TLDR:
Any good summer projects that wil advance me compared to my peers and that will take dedication to complete :)

Thanks for reading wall of text :P"
3r27g7,13,2015-11-01,Should I graduate in 5 years instead of 4?,rak3ng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3r27g7/should_i_graduate_in_5_years_instead_of_4/,"I'm doing alright in school with an average GPA in my major (Computer Science) of 3.40, but since I was placed in the lowest classes for both Math and English in my examination test, as well as coming in with no AP credit, I'm somewhat behind other students. I'm confident in being able to graduate in four years still, but the amount of classes I'd be taking and the difficulty of the classes would pretty much kill my social life (like I had one...) and all of my free time. Engineering majors at my school tend to graduate in five years instead of four, and most of my friends plan on doing the same even though some had the luxury of AP credit and being placed in standard classes.


Why I want to graduate in four years:


I'm tired of school since I still have to take general education classes to graduate. I also really want to pay off my debt and give back to my parents for helping me for so much and me being an ungrateful brat for the last 20 years of my life. If I do graduate in 5 years I'd have to pay about $10,000 - $15,000 more and will probably put my family in an even worse spot financially. Getting a job and getting hands on experience as fast as I can is also a plus since I can get onto paying it off faster and learn more.


Why I want to graduate in five years:


I'd love to have a social life and a girlfriend, but putting that aside I wish I could care less. What I'd really like is not being so stressed out and having free time to learn other things on my own. I want to be able to work on my own projects, research whatever interests me, and just have a couple more years to get my shit together before I'm actually thrown into the real world. I'd also like a couple years more experience as an intern. I'm not even sure if I can land one this year given my lack of any decent projects on my github and a very short resume overall. 


I really do not want to place a heavier load on my family since we're very financial unstable. Would taking a year or so (most likely less than a year -- more like one or two quarters) more to graduate be a good idea? I can't actually promise myself I'd use my free time efficiently but as of now I'm struggling to make the most of my free time due to the amount of work I have from classes. I just need someone to push me into making my decision. Thanks for reading!


TLDR; 4 years = hell, save $ VS 5 years = chill, lose $

I was later offered 2 options for this year, I could pursue an internship at HP, or I could go back to the place that I interned last for part time. The expereience that I had was mainly doing help desk type work, re-imaging computers, doing inventory, the typical low level tech stuff. What I am wondering is what would be the best route to purse system engineering, I already have a lab environment where I do very basic automation stuff and configure headless Linux boxes. If I where to pursue the internship at HP what would I be expecting, not only climate wise, but the extent of stuff that I would be doing. Thanks in advance!"
3r3wcn,8,2015-11-01,How to integrate Data Science in a Data Analytics role?,caught-in-suspension,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3r3wcn/how_to_integrate_data_science_in_a_data_analytics/,"Hello everyone! So long story short, I will be interviewing for a 12 month internship at an [eBay Classifieds](http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/) company for a Strategy and Analytics role - the role description is here: http://i.imgur.com/7pZqWvo.png

As you can see, it's a typical analytics role with SQL and Excel, which initially I was really happy with, since I have prior experience with both through school and my last internship. However, last week I interviewed with an Investment Bank and when the guy saw my resume, he basically grilled me for having Excel and VBA and told me I should not learn such backward, 90s technology and instead use fancy machine learning algorithms via R, Python, Matlab etc. to do my analysis or ""data science""

From what I've understood, data science is essentially a higher level of analytics and is used for prediction/forecasting/looking into the future? I wanted to bring this up at my interview, and ask whether it would be possible for me to explore some data science in this analytics role but I was wondering how I could possibly motivate it for this specific company (a classified sites)?

I was thinking of saying something like ""we could look at a user's previous purchases and then make recommendations"" but I was wondering if the rest of you could tell me, in very simple terms, **what can data science accomplish that analytics via Excel/SQL cannot uncover?**

Thank you!! 

**Edit**: I'm in my third year of Industrial/Systems Engineering with a focus in Information Engineering, so I've taken a fair bit of probability/statistics (stochastic processes, hypothesis testing, distribution fitting, regression analysis etc.) as well as programming, e.g. Java, C, VBA, SQL. I've also taken introductory operations research (linear, integer, mixed, network, dynamic programming) so hopefully my background is strong enough to (potentially) get started in ~data science~"

3r4hxt,1,2015-11-01,4th year undergraduate seeking advice,X14U2NVX,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3r4hxt/4th_year_undergraduate_seeking_advice/,"Sorry for the excessive background, but I believe it’s mostly relevant.
I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student, expecting to graduate in June with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics, and minors in Computer Information Systems and Physics.  I have been a 4.0 student during my time here and have done both internships and undergraduate research in the field of Computer Science. My GRE schools were upper 90th percentile and I am an English first language student.

My problem is, now that it's time to apply to graduate schools, I'm at a loss of what to actually apply to.  I'm interested in going to graduate school for computer science, (as opposed to computer engineering and/or software engineering). I'd rather pursue the mathematical/conceptual path behind CS rather than the business/management path of software engineering and the electrical engineering/hardware oriented path of computer engineering.  But the specificity of my knowledge ends there.

I have done one-on-one undergraduate research here for a few semesters with our head of CS department on classification algorithms and biometric analysis, and while I found the research process to be very interesting, I'd prefer exposure to more fields of computer science before committing myself to any graduate research programs.  
A major complication arises from the fact that I am currently attending (and about to graduate from) a small liberal arts college that doesn’t really have a department large enough to get the exposure I need to develop an interest in any specific graduate research programs.  This constraint came from the fact that my financial and family background made it very difficult for me to pay for any schooling (parents are too well off monetarily for financial aid, but  for reasons outside of the scope of this issue, I am unable to rely on them for help or take out large loans).  

It is for this reason that I essentially need to also get a Research Assistantship/Teaching Assistantship position (with tuition and living stipend) in order to afford graduate school.  From my understanding, these positions are generally saved for Ph.D. applicants over M.S. applicants, but I am unsure if I am willing to commit myself to 6 more years of schooling/research, especially in any fields of research that I do not have prior experience in.

So my questions are:

•	I need exposure to more Computer Science research fields for the application process, current school’s resources aren’t enough.  Is there a place where I could research CS graduate research topics en masse?

•	I am unsure about the specifics regarding whether or not I should be applying for a Masters or PH.D. Program in CS, (if I had to pick one to start in that would allow me to switch to the other, which should I apply for first?)  

•	What tiers of schools should I be considering?  Do schools like Carnegie Mellon take into account that I have been a good student so far, or would they dismiss my application the second they saw my no-name liberal arts school?

•	Many of my issues are stemming from financial issues regarding graduate school.  Are there alternate ways to fund graduate school? (one suggestion from advisor was to pay for first year out of pocket and apply again to research positions after I’d had more exposure to the programs there).

3r4r0m,0,2015-11-01,How do i deal with my anxiety?,jesuislola,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/3r4r0m/how_do_i_deal_with_my_anxiety/,"I'm new on Reddit and this seems like the right place to post this. Excuse my english, it's not my first language.

I have a slight panic disorder. This all started when i was 15 (10 years ago). I had to give a presentation in front of my class, everything was going fine but after i was done talking my vision started getting blurry and i couldn't hear what people were saying. I ran out and sat on the floor untill my vision came back. Back then i didn't know i was having a panic attack. 

Ever since that fking day i started 'getting' panic attacks everywhere. When i was standing in lines, when i was in the supermarket etc. After a while i started doing some research and i found out i was hyperventilating. I started reading books about it and listening to audio therapy. Now i understand the process of a panic attack and I can control it in most situations. I still can't give a presentation without taking a betablocker though. 

My panic disorder used to have nothing to do with people. But since my boyfriend left me (about 2 years ago) this changed, i don't exactly know why, maybe i lost faith in humanity?

In certain situations involving interaction with people i fear i will get nervous (getting a panic attack in front of someone is my ultimate fear) and make myself look stupid.

Here's a list with example situations: 

- Bumping into old friends or acquaintances. This is maybe the worst. I dread small talk. I am afraid i will get nervous and that it will show. By thinking of this i can feel that i am triggering a panic attack, but because i have to focus on the conversation i can't control my panic. I have had this before, i ran into someone and we were talking and i started getting dizzy so i just randomly said sorry i have to go, bye. I was very ashamed of myself afterwards.

- Presentations and speaking in front a group. I hate standing out in a group, i just sit in the back and keep my mouth shut. When a teacher asks questions to students i pray he doesn't ask me anything. I don't want anyone to hear or see that i am nervous about a simple question. 

- Family meetings or a party with lots of people i don't know. I worry about greeting them. (don't know why really?)

- Visiting friends i haven't seen in a long time. I am afraid i will get nervous and they'll think 'wtf happened to her' because they don't know me like this. 

- Internships and jobs. At my last internship it took me two weeks for my muscles to stop aching from all the tension. I was so nervous about all the new people and new tasks, the first month was hell for me. 

- Talking on the phone. I hate this. I always procrastinate if i have to make a call.

- Flirting. I used to enjoy this and i was quite good at it but i feel like i just can't anymore. When a guy is looking at me i just look the other way. This is super annoying, i just can't force myself to flirt.

- DANCING. I do dance after a few drinks, but i wish i could enjoy it more. I just feel awkward. 

Okay these are the worst situations i think. I have lots of friends and a loving family. I go out alot (i love going to restaurants, bars, clubs etc.) and people i know think i am a social person. I haven't told anyone about this. My nervousness rarely shows on the outside, so they think i'm fine. Sometimes i'll just say i am a little dizzy and they have no idea it's because of my anxiety.

How bad is my anxiety and how do i deal with this? 
It sucks because i used to like meeting new people, but now i just avoid it. I also feel like i will never be able to start my own business if i can't even make a phone call. All these negative thoughts really take the fun out of my life so i really want to get rid of them.


Sorry for the long story, thank you for listening! :)

3r4z4t,11,2015-11-01,Stay in Phoenix or move to Seattle?,TaylorHu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3r4z4t/stay_in_phoenix_or_move_to_seattle/,"Back story: I don't technically have a degree in Computer Science. I have a B.A. in Game Design, which turns out isn't the most practical of choices of majors. Also doesn't help that it's from what is basically an online degree mill school that's saddled me with $700/mo student loan payments (19 year old me was not very smart). Since graduating I've been working for a web design company, doing basic front end stuff, customer support, etc. It's a telecommute job, so I can take it with me wherever I move. Pay is not fantastic ($21/hr), but enough that I am not starving.

I've also been using the time to audit my way through my Alma Mater's CS degree program (as an alumni I can audit any classes for free). I'm now to the point where I've audited my way through all of the core CS classes. I've also done a lot of self studying as well (which has taught me more than anything I've learned in any of the classes I've audited).

I believe that, knowledge/skill wise, I am on par with or above most fresh CS grads. But I still don't technically have a CS degree. I don't have any internships, etc.

Currently I live in Phoenix, milking the rent free. My dad is planning on eventually retiring down here so he bought a house, then my sister went and had a baby so he decided to work for a few more years in Alaska close to her and his new grandson. So I am essentially house sitting for him. Not a bad deal, all things considered. Really nice house, free rent and utilities, has a pool.

But it is Phoenix. While there are some dev companies here, it's no Seattle or Silicon Valley. Cost of living is super low, but so are wages. It's also super conservative and a little bit racist. At the end of the day I think living in Seattle would be better for my career. Also I lived in Portland for a while and I love the PNW.

But I am worried about being able to find a job in Seattle. Yes it has a lot of CS jobs, but also a lot of competition for those jobs. A lot of fresh grads from top schools like U of W or UC Berkeley who did internships at one of the Big 4. A lot of people who have experience working in Silicon Valley who moved to Seattle to escape the insane cost of living. While, like I said, I think I am just as knowledgeable as any of those candidates, I don't know if I will be able to convince someone of that in a short 45 minute interview, assuming I can even get the interview. I don't think I'd have that problem in Phoenix as much.

So the question is, take the safe road (stay in Phoenix, milk the very affordable living conditions, and just apply for local jobs), or move to Seattle and try and find a job there. Like I said I can bring my job with me, but $21/hr doesn't go very far after student loans and all that jazz. I'd have to find a room for rent and live on top ramen until I found a new job. If I did stay in Phoenix, I don't think it would be permanent, maybe a year or so until I had some savings built up, as well as some 'real' work experience (which hopefully would help offset my lack of degree).

If it helps, here is a link to my portfolio site which has my blog, some of my code, and my resume. It's a bit out of date, I need tidy it up before I apply for jobs, but should give you a general idea.

But socially, I've struggled my entire life. I have Aspergers and social anxiety, so it's been so hard making friends. I have had fun with people in general, but I've never been able to have a consistent circle of friends. I know people and then they exit my life. Maybe I just don't make the initiative. I've never had someone I can rely on to be there for me and for me to be there for them. 

I can't even go out anymore because nobody ever invites me. I often have to invite myself, other times I go out and I have nobody to talk to. I feel like I'm the weird guy nobody likes and nobody invited. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but not necessarily for no reason.  

Honestly, all I want is to have people to be close to and maybe get an apartment with when I graduate. But it's more likely that I'm just going back to my mom's house when I'm done school, and I don't know anyone in her area since we moved after I graduated high school. 

I feel like I have made improvements, but I'm not even close to where I want to be. It's freaking hard. IDK what it is. I feel like I'm so paranoid and I never take risks. 

I also have problems interacting with women. I feel so stupid, because they're people too, but I'm just scared to talk to them because I'm convinced I'm just going to get rejected, because I always do. 

Honestly, I'm so sick of being an outcast. I never know what's wrong, or if there's anything wrong and I'm just too scared. Uncertainty is the worst feeling in the world. "

Naturally I packed my semester with CS courses because I don't want to be behind my peers, and I want to be ready for summer internships. I end up not getting any callbacks from prestigious companies, but I did land an internship at a pretty good startup (it's my only callback, actually). I now the problem is my resume - I have a lot of lab-related experience and only one semi-interesting CS-related side project.

However, I find it really hard to be thankful. I think I'm pretty lucky to be able to get an internship, but I feel like I would never be able to catch up with my peers who have been coding since HS/freshman year. I also know people who aren't even in the major who get offers from prestigious companies. I started studying a little late in the summer (since I didn't know I wanted to go into the software industry) and when the semester starts I was just hit really hard by assignments, work and my ongoing research project. Meanwhile the people I mentioned before who aren't engineering students manage to spend a lot of time for interview prepping and networking, and they're getting better offers because they're doing better than me.

Right now I just feel like there's no use to switching into CS since I'm still terribly behind and sinking among my peers. I feel like this is more of a game of interviews than the knowledge I get from classes - and now I'm just doubting why I do this in the first place and really pissed off that I didn't figure all this out sooner. I feel like I keep making bad decisions at every corner and there's no way I can make up for it. I'm even doubting if a CS degree is really worth it since this industry doesn't seem to require a degree as much as it requires professional experience.

I think the point that kills me the most is that I know I'm not a bad programmer. Not a mega-genius at it, but I'm good enough at it and I could've accomplished what my peers accomplished if I had started at the same time with them.

So what can I do to be better? Will I ever catch up to my peers? Should I drop the load for next semester and just focus on interview/internship prep? And does anyone ever feel the same way? (I don't want to graduate late. It's just not an option for me. I can take the load but I just want to be able to get a good offer when I graduate)"
3r60d0,1,2015-11-01,How can i help my mom? Long story inside.,falsepromises21,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3r60d0/how_can_i_help_my_mom_long_story_inside/,"I would really appreciate and it would help you advice me better if you read the whole thing. My formatting is crap so bare with me please. 

NOTE: (2012)My mom was in a not so friendly first marriage and after she got divorced and she moved to a new town and got a house, it was me, mom and my grandma that lived in her house. We lived in India. (2015) She has problems with her siblings and dont really have anyone she can depend on for a while. My step dad is unemployed but he had a great job for a long time and his saving are in millions so money is no problem.

So back in mid 2012 my divorced mom for about 9ish years started to look for a new partner for reasons im not really sure of. She talked to some of her friends and used websites to find people and kinda started dating. After a couple of weeks of searching one of her friends came a with a guy who she knew, this guy is an Indian who lives in the US whose wife died due to medical problems. So my mom starts talking to the guy and the guy seems nice, although he was slightly drunk (due to us being in India, it was evening for him) every time we skyped. They talk for about 5 months and they seems to go off pretty well. Things get serious and they talk about marriage and how crap is gonna go for passport, Visa and crap. Im in 8th grade at this point and i wanted my mom to be happy, so if the marriage was gonna make her happy then sure i have no problem, im good with people so i can adjust. Fast forward about 6 more months and he visits and meets us in person and he seems nice. So they decide to marry after talking for a while and once their marriage was done, the process for us going to the US began. Took about 4 months and we were good to go. We come to US in September of 2013, Im new to country and culture so i was like really nervous and crap. I went to school the next day after i landed because the school had already began i didn't wanna miss more. So couple of months go by, im dealing with school and trying to go with the ""Americanization movement"" and it was easy for me as i saw alot of people in school and when im out with friends, but my mom didnt really have anyone or anywhere to go so she was stuck in the house. 

After about 3 months, my step dad now gets wasted every night and starts yelling for no reason and shutting the door so loudly that the whole house might collapse for absolute no reason. They start getting into fights (my mom was an independent woman and she expected to be treated with some respect, which never happened and thus began the fights) now my stepbrother is the lamest and the most socially awkward person ever, so i could not talk to him either. I kinda ignored it thinking it was starter problems and eventually they got worse, no physical damage was done tho. So i try talking to them and telling them to get their shit together, after this he starts treating me like shit and we barely talk to each other. 2 years of this crap goes by, my mom was desperately trying to find a good job suiting her degree and crap, but she never got one. FYI my dad treats his son likes hes a king and hes always right and figuratively ""sucks his D all the time"" although they dont talk either due to his son being a shit at everything. So i finish my 10th grade and my stepB graduates and got in college in some other state, due to my Sdad figuratively ""sucks his D all the time"" decides that we all should move near the college hes going to so he can continue doing what he does best. The clashes between my mom and him are going on and there is no emotional peace in our house, my mom cant help it because she has no where else to go. We end up moving and hes still unemployed, gets wasted and the same yelling and close the door with all his strength and etc goes on. My mom is depressed because her life before coming to US was golden except for reasons she married. Being me i get along with kids, get a job and hang around with my new friends. My mom on the other hand has nothing new, she is still stuck in the house but she joined some internship like thing that might help her find a job. My dad, well hes still the same. Today i got back from work and hanging around with my friends and shit was going down in my house and she was crying while talking to me, she does not wanna go back to India due to it ruining my education and crap and everyone would kill her emotionally due to divorcing 2nd marriage, because ""Incredible India"". She wants to find a job, be economically independent and live in a studio apartment until in finish my HS and then when i get in college, she will go back to India without being in contact with anybody except me. Im fine with her doing this but her ""internship thing"" is gonna be couple of months more and her getting economically independent is even more. I really want to help her in anyway i can. I just want her to be not depressed and do something other than stay home all day. My Sbro, he does not really care about anything thats happening in this house. He barely has any friends and he talks to no one. I feel really bad for my mom and wanna help her out. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks! "

3r7rua,3,2015-11-02,"Contemplating returning to old job, need some advice",Thatonedataguy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3r7rua/contemplating_returning_to_old_job_need_some/,"First, if anyone cares, this is kind of a continuation to https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3obo8p/going_back_to_an_old_job/ but it's a bit of a wallotext and I'll be reiterating any important points. (this will also probably become a wall of text in itself, fair warning.) 

So, I graduated about 3 years ago from a state University (top in the state, but hardly considered a top tier school) with a software engineering degree. I had no internships besides a senior project I did with a local company, which lead to a summer internship after I graduated and then a full time position there. 

I stayed there for 2 years. The good was that I really liked the job and the people. I was very happy and emotionally healthy. The bad was that I hated the location (southern us) and the heat. The position was also a bit of a generalist. I worked under the business director and did a lot of data analysis, as well as programming for some internal Web applications. My manager not being a technical person, I had no mentorship and kind of just self taught everything I needed to learn and got it done. (no other developers in the area, they pretty much created the position for me due to the results I was generating.) the pay also wasn't the best. (just shy of 50k)

Right now, I'm in a position where I'm doing mostly sql development, which is at times interesting, but not that exciting. However, I hate it here. I have no friends, I dislike my coworkers, not getting any mentoring, and have been dealing with severe depression. I need to leave this place, and I've already decided on that. (as soon as I get a new job. For comparison, I'm making 55k here, I get an yearly bonus of around 5 to 7 percent, and there is about a 6% state income tax.) 

So.. I just got an offer for my old job. I negotiated as much as I could, and was able to get an offer of 65k. I was hoping for more, but because of the type of company, this is a really amazing offer all things considered. (local government, would be making more than people in ""similar"" roles that have been working there over 10 years) Also, no state income tax, so it would actually be a decent jump from where I'm at. 

My problem is, I'm just trying to think of my future. The two years I spent there hurt me quite a bit, and imo turned me into a less appealing candidate compared to new graduates. I have been applying to all kinds of positions for the past year with no success. (had an on site at Google for a data position similar to my old job, no offer. Same situation at a decently sized start up in SF, no offer. Failed multiple software development interviews, no offer. I even had a software interview that went REALLY well a couple of weeks ago, no offer.) 

I fear that if I don't take this job now, I have no idea how long I'm going to be stuck here. I guess I really suck at interviewing.

Now,the pluses of going back: while I won't have any mentoring, I can use that position to my advantage. I have a lot of freedom to basically do whatever I want. I will definitely be looking at all the new hot js frameworks and implementing them. I will start using Tableau and look at statistical softwares. I think I should be able to make the most of this position, and actually put myself in a place where I'm setting myself up for success in the next job hunt. 

I would also be able to go back to school part time and work on a masters. I'm leaning towards getting an MBA, though I haven't decided, and may just do statistics to get into data science? (another problem is I don't really know what I want to do. I enjoy working with data and solving business problems and stuff, but at the same time I also enjoy a good mental technical problem. I don't have any exposure to a full on software development role, though, so I don't know if I'd enjoy doing that full time. A hybrid role would be amazing, which is what that Google and Startup roles were.) 

If I do go back and also go back to school, I would be committing to staying there a couple of years. However, I've come pretty close to landing ""dream job"" type positions twice in the last year, and I just think of all the potential money I could be making (and saving to retire early) and it just feels like I would be wasting time going back. 

Anyway... I realize this is a long wall of text. If you read this far, thanks for the interest. If you have any suggestions on what you would do in this position, please share them. 

Personally, typing this all out was incredibly therapeutic and I think I've come to the decision of going back, but still applying to ""dream job"" type positions in case any go through, though I wouldn't expect it at all. (but you never know! And that not knowing was what was holding me back.) 

Thanks! :) "

I can see them verifying my criminal record again along with my change of address, but I've noticed I have to put in all my employment history again. Are they going to get in touch with all my old employers and re-verify my job history?

I ask because I would probably need to give them a heads up if so.

I'm a market research analyst who interned for a less than a year at a firm and got offered a position at the same firm.  I stayed on for another ten months after my internship full-time, and slowly began to realize my job there was dead-end.  It was a dead-end town, because of office politics and the way things were run the work turned from exciting to not challenging at all, there were many limitations and restrictions on growth.  It was mostly project management and not client-side or exciting enough.  I decided I wanted to leave, and after a few weeks of hunting, found a position at a different market research firm that was more client-facing than project management.

They offered me a little more due to my previous experience, but I'm only making 45K (just a 5k jump from my previous job). I've been working here for 6-7 months and although I like it here much better - a part of me feels like I settled in my job hunt.  I'm not making much more than I want to be making at this job, and now I'm worried if I leave after a year that it will reflect poorly on my resume as someone who skips jobs after a year.  I originally though a promotion would be after 1.5 years here, but have discovered it takes now 2 years to be promoted.  Also, I wonder if market research is even for me.  I'm passionate about it that I am certain about.  I like going into work and I""m good at my job for sure.  It's just I wonder if I can get a better paying job using the same skill sets I've learned as someone who project manages and now analyzes data.  Or perhaps if I could work in the b2b side of things...

Which makes me wonder: 
1) Should I keep my options open and a year later apply for something else 
2) Should I stay for one promotion cycle because at least it won't make me look flakey and someone who flip flops after a year is up
3) Or does it not matter either way because I'm young enough in my career that it won't reflect poorly.

I'm a junior in college, computer science major, and I just accepted a promotion from research programmer to lead programmer for a research group that is getting funding fast. I will be working remotely from home (a couple states away) and coordinating many projects with 2 programmers under me.

They said it's cool if I take a leave next summer to intern somewhere, and I just got an internship offer today from one of the top wireless companies as a technical intern (will have an internship-long project along with other daily duties). 

The pay for the internship is less than I am making as a lead programmer, but I'm not so much worried about the pay as I am worried about what will be the best career decision for me.

If I decide to move to the research group's headquarters next summer, I can work on-site and really get shit done. If I intern at the big wireless company, I will have an extra thing on my resume. Either way, I will return to the research group after the internship and continue to work there while I finish my senior year.

I have a week to respond to the internship offer. It's worth noting that I'm in the interview process with two other companies, and that I got employee referrals at a couple Big 4 companies, so I may or may not get an interview with them in a couple weeks. Aggressive recruiter-searching pays off.

What should I do? Intern at wireless company and take leave from research group, don't intern at all and work at research group over the summer, or decline wireless company offer and possibly intern at a top company (if I'm lucky enough to get an offer)?

My situation is a bit unique, so I'm unsure how I should proceed.

Pay and Perks aside, would choosing either of these companies give me an advantage over the other for my winter internship search? 

My reasoning is that Yelp being in downtown SF will give me better opportunities to network with Bay area companies, whereas Microsoft might have a bit better well-known internship program/name.

I am a recent UCSD graduate with a bachelors in electrical engineering (2.9 GPA) and a specialization in medical devices, power, and computer engineering. I have had 2 years of internship experience in R&amp;D, testing, and product engineering. Currently, I'm fully employed for about 6 months doing CAD layouts in an RF industry. Total of almost 3 years of work experience.

My GRE score is horrible (290) and I have never been a good test taker. I was wondering if my chances of getting into UCI, UCSD, or USC's grad program are low. I'm thinking of focusing in power electronics or computer engineering. I'm going to probably purchase the Magoosh plan and retake the exam to apply for admissions in Fall 2017. I believe this should help me score at least between 300-310.

My reasons to get a masters is to be able to do design work in the either the RF, medical, or power industry. On a side note, I'm kind of considering going into the comp sci realm since I fairly enjoy coding (work for blizzard one day :P). Overall goal is to hopefully get an MBA along with a MS and direct/manage an engineering team. 

With all of this in mind, would it really matter where I get my masters in ECE? Could I just go to Cal State Long Beach or Pomona and still do fine? 

Not too exactly sure where I should go in my life. I've always been mixed between coding (verilog/FPGA) and doing actual designing for circuits. Possibly considering to work for the city (ex. LADWP, SCE, etc).

I was a dumb eighteen year old white kid and I resented my folks and made a lot of bad decisions, so, selling all my shit on craigslist outside of a single backpack and moving to Beijing from the rural south of North Carolina was probably not one of my best ideas. I'm past it, though, I moved back to the States awhile ago, but over October I got back into reading NoSleep stories for the first time in a long time, and I was thinking about what kind of story to write, because it had been on my mind the more I read that I wanted to write one- and I actually considered making something up, and I actually kind of giggled when I realized I didn't have to. Like, as you read this you'll probably start to realize why I blocked a lot of this experience out; it really wasn't a good one, but whatever. I remember it, I just try not to think about it, you know? Anyway, moving on.

Especially because apparently, I'm expected to pay back the school for everything they spent on me for breaking contract, somehow. A typical scam. I could tell you the name of the school, but I signed that contract as an idiot kid and I'm not supposed to talk about their inner workings, and while I'm pretty sure there's nothing they can or will do to me six thousand miles away I don't want to hear from their fucking HR people again so suffice to say it's an English learning center with a ton of different schools over like, multiple countries including the US and that its head Chinese office was in Dazhongsi, a place I lived for awhile and liked.

Eventually I learned how to act like a grownup and how to lie to grownups and how to play the game, you know? It was rough and pretty scarring and my therapist diagnosed me with CPTSD when I got back, but honestly, it doesn't feel like THAT big a deal. Just the same old shit. Everybody has weird fucking 18-20s, I think. In any case, I went through a couple of jobs, because smooth-talk and fake papers can only bullshit your way to high places for small bursts at a time. But I was and am great at interviews and very charismatic, so every time I got fired I'd find a new job within a few weeks. The longest I ever held a job was three months, the shortest, a week. I was a pretty girl alone in a big city and I played that to my advantage. What are you going to do, right?

As you can imagine, this unstable life style coupled with owing my first school a fucking ton of money and my agent, who went by a fucking code name, not an English name, which is really common for people who spoke english as a second language, not like Alice or Envy or even Jeep, all names of people I knew, she had a code name I was supposed to call her, and I'm not gonna say it for the same reasons I won't say the name of my school, but it was like, one of those military letters they use as words to spell? Like, alpha is a and bravo is b? Charlie, delta, whatever? So I'll call her Foxtrot, because. Anyway, I paid them outrageous sums of money every month to save my ass from crazy situations and to forge papers and to help me lie to the police when it came time to renew my visa- I was on like, a bunch of different kinds- i got off the tourist visa and onto a work visa for awhile under this lie that I was an intern helping translate documents for this petrol company (Foxtrot had a bunch of papers and shit for this company that didn't exist, and a script for me to follow at the psb) and then I was on a student visa and then like, honestly I don't know what the last one was, but I had to travel like thirteen hours for it and a bunch of weird shit and frankly I don't think it was real, but, fuck it, this story isn't about that. I'm rambling, trying to give context.

So I moved out to Tainyanggong which is like a subburb of Wangjing, which is a district with a high Korean immigrant population so I generally was like, super an outsider cuz I didn't speak Korean and I barely spoke Mandarin. And I was fucking broke! I lived in this shitty one room apartment by the subway across from this mall and I got most of my food like, from dusty little markets or street vendors. I remember this one time I ate Chuanr, which is like barbecue kebab at a street vendor in Dazhongsi and later got super fucking sick like, puking into the toilet for a day and a half sick, and when I stopped puking I went back to work even though I didn't feel much better. I read on the news a few weeks later that a bunch of foreigners had been hospitalized after eating chuanr from that vendor with rat poisoning, and that the guy had been using street rat instead of chicken and because I was a weenie American and only Americans got chicken instead of lamb only foreigners got sick. I thought news like that would revolt me, but I was so fucking beaten down at that point I really just accepted it. Like it was bound to have happened. I didn't die, and I couldn't afford a doctor, or the questions about the validity of my visa, so. I moved on. That's independently verifiable, by the way, I'm sure you can find the news article about that if you look. I saw the link on the Beijinger. So. Yeah.

In September, I think, of that year, there was some kind of shit going on with Japan and some uninhabitable island they were fighting over. I didn't really know what was going on, but people were super up in arms about it and I was like, politely excusing myself from discussions with coworkers who wanted to go to war. The whole thing seemed stupid and childish to me, like there were more pressing concerns than some stupid island. In any case it set off some major anti-Japanese sentiments in Beijing.

Now here's something you probably won't find in the news. And frankly the real major reason I'm using a throwaway. Some bad shit went down during this time. People were vanishing. This wasn't like, super uncommon, I mean, as an undocumented worker I heard about people vanishing all the time. But I'd go to the expat bars and they'd be so quiet, and tense, like everyone was afraid- we shouldn't have been. Only Japanese immigrants were vanishing. Like, a ton. Japanese owned shops were turning up vandalized. I remember going to this 7/11 in Wangjing near the movie theatre to get snacks before a movie and the ground being covered in glass, the front of the store boarded up with plywood. There was a burnt up Japanese flag stapled to the plywood and some writing I couldn't read. It was in red spray paint though, and I remember that really scared me. Like I said, even while this shit was happening I never saw that much about it on the news- it made it seem tense, like people were about to do something scary but it never really talked about the disappearances or the break ins. Like, in the expat bars, among people like me who weren't students or tourists or people who were safe- among those of us afraid we were going to fucking vanish any day we called it the Japanese Krystalnacht, which is probably offensive but jesus, there was more broken storefronts every day and more people missing. We acted like we weren't terrified, but we were all burnouts and lost causes afraid that this was where we were going to die- kidnapped and forgotten, blips in no one's radar. And even now I wonder if there was a reason the news didn't talk about this shit- because I mean, China is notorious for its censorship. I still don't know but I won't take the chance.

So I stopped going out as much. I couldn't afford it, anyway. I'd taken to getting my food from this shitty little underground shop near my apartment- you had to take this tiny escalator that like was so skinny I had to squeeze my 120 pound ass into it, and I had to take it three floors down into the basement. I hated that escalator because it was a straight shot down, and there was no light between the top and the bottom, just utter darkness and the whir of the escalator. Then I had to get a patdown to go inside this dust half lit place and meander into the open air meat market in the back, past white buckets of chicken heads and rows of dried duck necks on hooks, slabs of unidentifiable animal carcasses and feet in jars- like every single part of the animal was buyable, you know? The more expat friendly shops didn't sell that stuff because it scared away foreigners. I didn't really mind, I was hungry and tired.

In the very back of the place there was this little like meat counter with these mix and match square plastic tubs that looked like the kind you would put shoes in filled with ground meat. Little notecards with sharpie-written prices taped to toothpicks stuck into them. I always went for the cheapest, because it was 5 kuai (a little less than a dollar) a pound. I didn't ask what it was at first, because like, I didn't want to know, you know? I couldn't afford anything better, so I just ate pounds of that shit, for like every meal. I tried to get creative you know, toss it into a tortilla or instant noodles or use some nice spices. Little things to break up the monotony. But I ate so fucking much of it, every day, for weeks, and one day I finally got up the courage to ask the meat lady what it was.

She was like, a normal looking lady in an apron and she seemed genuinely bored by my question and generally resentful of my existence, but she answered. The only word I picked out was ""dog"" because again, my Mandarin is and was kind of shit. I mulled this over, decided that I'd already had enough of it that I wasn't really allowed to have a problem with eating dog and bought another three pounds.

I was on my sixth or seventh job at the time and it was really weighing on me. Twelve hour shifts, six days a week, in miserable fucking conditions. I was definitely starting to crack. I was getting delirious half the time and sick a lot more than usual, probably from my fucked up diet and sleep schedule. It was killing my immune system, and the stress of it was making me really weird and spontaneous. I remember this one time a kid in one of my classes told me like a fucking knock knock joke and it wasn't even really that funny or anything, but I just started laughing, like, until I was crying, until I fell over. I scared them all half to fucking death, thought I was going to get fired. And in like the dead of winter I was always cold. Like, even in my heated school I could feel the snow under my skin. I was always shivering and shaking. I wanted to go home, but I didn't have the money. I was getting paid 1500 dollars a month under the table, 500 of which was going to my agent, 1000 of which was going to rent and 300 of which was going to my first school, leaving me a frightened hungry mess with 200 dollars living expenses a month. 

Finally i ate my pride along with that fucking tired dog meat and called my parents and begged them to help me get home. They did, of course. The last month I was there wasn't so bad- the disappearances had mostly stopped, I guess, or at least, people had stopped talking about them, and no one really cared about the island anymore I guess. I was sitting in the lobby of my school with my coworkers this one day and they were asking me about American foods and seemed baffled that I liked Chinese food. I thought that was kind of funny, actually, at the time, because people always seemed really surprised if I liked local shit. Like this one time all my coworkers were wearing these fancy school uniforms for parents day and they were all wearing like these beautiful silk Chinese jackets, blue, with pink flowers embroidered into it, and a peacock on the back. And I wasn’t in one? And halfway through the day I mentioned that I felt weird being the only one not wearing one and everyone was so genuinely surprised that I WOULD wear one- like, they gave me one right then and there. I still have it, it’s beautiful. 

So anyway, I’m telling everyone about weird American food, like, I’m telling them about frogs legs and fried chicken and pig pickings and shit and they’re laughing, and they ask me what kind of food I eat in China, and obviously I mention rice and chuanr and stuff, and since I’ve eaten so much fucking dog that of course I brought that up. Alice laughed at me and asked if the dog meat was making me go broke, and I must have given her a weird look, because she blinked and said that dog meat was really expensive. I shook my head and told her I got dog meat for five kuai a pound, it was cheap as fuck.

They all looked at me like I’d just thrown up a foot on the table. Alice told me that no, dog meat was like, a delicacy, and it was pretty pricey, and like, REALLY price for foreigners because they knew foreigners would pay stupid money to try the ~exotic tastes of a lesser society.~ There was no way I was eating dog, I must have misunderstood her. I hadn’t, though, like, my Chinese isn’t good, but there are a few words I know. Chicken, dog, help, lost, please, teacher. I know she said dog. I know she said dog. I stopped eating there. I started eating straight ramen for the next month and nothing else until I went home to the US.

These days I try not to think about what I’ve learned since I started reading horror stories on nosleep and the popular tropes and twists I’ve come to expect. I try not to give any thought to the way my hands stopped shaking when I stopped eating dog, and I try not to think too much about the names that really mean locals called the Japanese immigrants. I try not to make shit sound like a scary story with a narrative arc and a twist ending just because I can. I try not to think about dog meat tacos and dog meat stew, my shaking hands buried in a bowl of ground dog meat and cheese for dog burgers in the summer.

I have my own side project in python related to my minor that I *really* enjoy working on though.

An acquaintance of mine offered up this internship that people should apply for, and after seeing my resume the company wants me to ""discuss the internship opportunity"" with them. (28 days later they emailed me. It happens to be inside the same building that I work at doing part time data entry)

Playing the biggest role in my interview will be the fact that I try, and will have to, continue to self teach new languages and concepts to broaden my knowledge and usefulness to a company as well as keep up with my peers. I'm not well versed in mobile development or web development which is something the company does. My acquaintance said ""they will definitely be okay with that"" referring to on the job learning.

Provided I can at least interview and talk with them without sounding like a fool and if I nail the take home technical part, there is nothing major that gives me this huge pull over a similar candidate.

I suppose this is just pre interview nerves but I'm trying to justify gaining this valuable experience when I have only tidbits of it right now. Everybody starts somewhere I guess."

3rah27,3,2015-11-02,Long time lurker - seeing psychatrist tomorrow,seradezzo,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/3rah27/long_time_lurker_seeing_psychatrist_tomorrow/,"Hello, fellow internetians!

I'm a 26 years old guy from Germany. Not many people to share my problems with. Meh. Here we go:

I have always had problems going to school, parents had to drag me there. Making friends wasn't easy and most of the times totally successless. Had one friend in Grundschule (elementary school), who was really just my cousin. He hepled me out a lot during early school, because I didn't speak much German, only Russian.

Then there was this new guy who was my ""friend"", always sat next to me in school. We listened to the same kind of music, which was the only thing we had in common. He thought I was weird and made fun of me LOTS of times. Ridiculed me in front of the class, threw my doctor's attest out of the window, after I got my appendicectomy. I never found it. He pulled my boxers in front of the crowd, when we were out swimming with some girls. 

Lost contact to both of them, when I moved to another city and changed to a higher school.

My teachers, too, ridiculed me sometimes. One time, in religious education, the teacher was shocked that I, as a Protestant, didn't want to partake in the confirmation. I had no clue why, never was a believer, still am atheistic/agnostic. Another time I had a problem writing an essay, because I missunderstood one word on the subject. I didn't bother looking in the lexicon. Next class, the teacher took my work and read it IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS. Luckily, he did it anonymously. What an experience. After this class I knew the word meant something else, but well ... Then there was an oral exam in English class. We had to talk in a group of 3 people about a trip to London. Man, this one still haunts me. I don't travel a lot. I have/had no intention in going to London. I don't care about Big Ben or whatever. I was best in this class on paper, but this one i blew. The teacher gave me the worst grade of all participants and taunted me in front of the class, when we received the results. Teacher: ""This guy just doesn't talk."" Yeah, screw you Mr. Boring English Teacher. Give me a subject I can talk about, like Operating Systems, Programming, Techno Music, Psychedelic Music, Mathematics or Physics and I will talk as much as you can bear it ...

In the last 2 years of Realschule (middle school) we had to find a one week internship each. I was the only one who didn't. In the first year, one teacher found something for me. I worked as hard as I could, even if it was boring. Second year again, no job. I was moved to another class. Man, this sucked. 5 days in a class full of older strangers. They knew I'm ""special"". Even the principal came to me: ""What's wrong with you? Where will you work, when you finish the school?"" The hell do I know?

During middle school I had one friend. He approached me. We lived very closely and he was also Russian and liked playing video games. Very cool guy, best friend I ever had, is very tolerant towards me. Only person at school, who didn't think I'm a freak. I liked him, still like him. He was very successful in the friendship / relationship matter. He started dating at 13. Opposite of me. :) I thought I could learn from this guy. I had one chance at a relationship with a girl. We were 15/16. I blew it. The next day she was together with an adult. He had his own house and a car. I had no chance. I hugged her once, haha! Most ""progress"" I ever had with a girl. Forever Alone and FML!

When we turned 17/18 I moved to another city. I continued school. Then, all the students started getting their driver's licences. I chickened. Still don't have one. People don't understand, that I have a problem controlling a one ton machine with my arms and feet silmuntanously. Hell, even an ATM is a problem, when there's a crowd that might be waiting. Driving around the city with more than 20 vehicles / persons around me? No fucking way. I finished this school with very good grades. Math and Computer Science were no problem. I was in the top 5 students.

Then I had to search for a job, 9 months mandatory community service in Germany. Sucks! Then I started to get really depressed. I didn't know what to do. I wasted almost 2 years of my life sitting at my parents' place. I never found a job. I didn't get any help from the labour bureau. Well, I was too afraid and ashamed to ask for help. Not one person tried to help me. Parents? Nope. ""Find a job already. It's not that hard."" Thanks. Then something changed and the 9 months community service became volunteer. Best political change that could have happened, hurray!

Then I applied to an uni here in my city. I started studying Software Engineering / Bachelor Of Science at a well known University for Computer Science here in Germany. My brother also studied there Information Technology / Bachelor Of Engineering at the time. He started few years earlier. I was so happy and enthusiastic. On the first day, welcoming lecture, around 35 people started with me. We sat down and here we go. Most of them started talking, groups started to form. These people knew each other. I was a misfit from the start. I knew not one.

Well, I had an advantage. I already knew most of the material from my own studies and previous school. After a few days at the uni I gave up making friends. I only went to mandatory lectures and lectures without downloadable material. I was highly interested, but I had struggle learning. The most interesting stuff, like maths and theoretic computer science were easy. I could take the exams with zero effort and still pass. Then, after the first few semesters, the group lectures began and destroyed me. Finding a group on my own? Yeah, sure. Avoided those lectures as long as possible. I had absolutely no problem with the lectures, even doing the projects on my own, no big deal. Working with people, who always come unprepaired and don't understand the basics taught in the previous semesters? Give me a break. In the end, around 3 projects failed, because ""I wasn't cooperative enough."" The profs didn't care. Try next time.

In the last semester I had a lot of pressure from most of the lectures, from the profs, from my parents and I had to find an internship for the uni. I was broken. I only went to one exam I entered and even this one I didn't pass. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't learn, nothing. I chickened and canceled the study on July 2014. Since then I'm a total mess.

I went to a doctor, she gave me some Citalopram. It helped me a little, I was less depressed. Could go out with my brother. Could visit my friend. I even took some driving lessons at a driving park. After 6 hours of ""pussy mode"" I quit. My dad tried to teach me how to drive. He got angry at every little mistake. Every lesson lasted one hour. I drive ok-ish, until he starts correcting / insulting me, then the tunnel vision worsens. It all goes downhill from then.

The Citalopram only helped for 2 months. I went to the job center to get some financial and professional help. They began pressing me: ""What? You couldn't find a job? You couldn't even find an internship? What's wrong with you? What, you don't want to make money? Imagine, what you could buy. Next time you come to an appointment, we want to see, that you sent at least 3 applications ... and bring your resume."" Well, thanks for the help ladies, I'm out. I haven't returned to them since then. Dropped the Citalopram. I felt abandoned. I received some sanctions / payment reductions. Then, in June 2015 the payments ran out. I'm too much of a coward to crawl back to them and ask for help. I still live on the 300 € they gave me last time.

In August 2015 I decided to visit the doctor again. I was ready for another try. Got Citalopram and transfers to a psychiatrist and a daily clinic. It took me a month to make an appointment with the psychiatrist. I'm still too afraid to visit the daily clinic. I feel like a crazy person or hopeless case. The psychiatrist's appointment is tomorrow. Wish me luck. I hope he doesn't tell me: ""Just do it. Get a job. Talk to a girl. Take drivering lessons. Move out. It's no big deal. You aren't crippled or anything."" This would be the end and ruin the little confidence I can build up.

Last week I went to a barber for the first time. Finally got a REAL haircut. Was on a party this weekend; uncle's birthday. So, mostly family, still an improvement. Never been to a party of ~30 people. I only spoke to my brother, his girlfriend and my parents and cousins. Still couldn't ""come out"", didn't drink or chat with the ""cool"" kids. Today my dad reminded me, that I'm a loser compaired to ALL the people / kids, who were present at the party.

The only thing I actually do at the moment is music production and some web development. I finished some tracks and sent a demo. Release could be in a few days. Best thing I ever done. Only my brother knows about that. Dub Techno and Ambient music is nothing ""cool"" people would enjoy, so I don't tell my relatives directly.

The last few days I feel like moving out of my parents apartment. Problem, I don't get ANY money, so I have to go back to the job center. Moving out is almost as hard as getting a girlfriend, job or driver's license). My parents tell me, moving out won't help with my job situation. I don't know.

I don't consider myself lazy or ugly or anything. I am overweight and weird, yeah. I am a little interesting and humouros. I am not rude, I try to be as helpful to others as I can. I am not very stupid. :D The profits until now: non existent.

Well, thanks for reading. Sorry for the wall of text. Just wanted to write this down and think about my crappy life.

TLDR: 26 year old guy with social anxiety and crippling depression. Next to no friends. Lack basic social skills. Cancelled Bachelor Of Science after 3 years of study. Too afraid to get a job. No real chance regarding relationship / sex or even driving licence. Taking Citalopram. No support from anyone besides my brother. Psychiatrist's appointment on wednesday. Producing music and web development whenever I feel less ""down"". Planning on moving out, but no income. Everyone I know achieved more than I can do on my best days. I feel like a kid in an adult world.

3rcbxm,200,2015-11-03,"Children's virtual pet website freaking me out -- anyone with IT knowledge, HELP? NSFW",0yasumii,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3rcbxm/childrens_virtual_pet_website_freaking_me_out/,"All of this weird shit centres around an online pet game. Is someone fucking with me, Reddit??? If anyone with IT skills or experience with drugs could tell me what's up and if what I am describing is possible once you’ve read this recollection, that would be awesome. Just a heads up: I'm not going to explicitly name the website central to this incident in case they sue my ass or whatever.. But you get the gist.  It's a website where you have pets, feed the little bastards, make virtual money, and all the rest of it. On to my experience. 

Oh and I’m not a writer so sorry if this is shittily written. I just wanted to get this out there. Also I swear a lot - soz.

I'm a 22 year old marketing intern and in my spare time I love to smoke weed and unwind on this website. Pretty sad but whatever. Let's call it 'petsite'. I'm a long time player of petsite -- this is a dirty secret of mine and if my friends found out I still use it I would never live it down. Only my girlfriend knows. She becomes important later in this recount. 

I'm on petsite as per usual at midnight in Australia which is like peak time in the US where this site is thriving. I'm on the boards, looking for good trades and shit when this dude's advertisement catches my eye. He's leaving the site after years of playing, he explains. He wants to give away his pet -- a particularly rare pet that I have been after for a year now. 

'YAAASSSS' goes my internal monologue. The post is new, only 3 minutes old. Score. I quickly mouse over his user name to message him/sus out his profile. So there I am checking out heeeey123's profile. The first thing I think is, what a dumb fucking name. But who can blame this guy - he probably made the account when he was like 8. Actually for all I know he could very well be eight. Lol idgaf I'm a 22 year old in my underwear smoking dope and farming virtual squirrels -- I really should not be judging this dude.

I scrawl a message to him. 

'Hey man, it's sad to see you go but I am very interested in your [insert pet name here]. Would you mind leaving her with me?'

Quickly hit send. It's done! Chances are it's bullshit and he doesn't have this rare pet/isn't leaving or whatever but on the slight chance he was -- I had submitted my tender. 

Now it was time to sus out this dude to see if he was for real. I click on his profile and start scrolling. 'Welcome to heeeey12's profile'. 

In the back of my head I am pretty sure that there was something different about the name but whatever not important. I keep scrolling and eventually get to his pets. OMG HE ACTUALLY HAS THE ONE I WANT AHHHH. Now in writing this  I really think about it his profile was remarkably bear for a player that has been playing for years, like he professed. But at the time I didn't care -- was blazed out of my mind and keen as balls for this sweet rare pet! I click the pet's picture. 'This page cannot be displayed'. Fucking excellent. I click back again and try to enter Google. Yep okay cool the internet is down. This isn't uncommon for me because where I live in Australia has super shitty slow internet that is really prone to breaking down. 

Anyway, I head downstairs, turn the modem off and on again. Head back up. Jackpot, internet's okay again. I refresh the page. We're back on 'howru123's' profile. Wait... 'howru?' Okay at this stage I'm pretty sure the username is different. Bear in mind it is past midnight at this stage and I am really bloody tired after work. Did I somehow navigate off the page? Or am I just getting the name's mixed up?

I hit the back button in my browser. It takes me back to the message I sent the guy. Yep, definitely says recipient is 'howru123'. I'm losing it lol. Toomuchweed.jpg

I kind of bum around for a while and play some games, browse the boards some more while I wait for a response. And then I get one. It says its from 'wellhowru123'. 

The fuck. This is the part that starts to get fucking weird. I open the message and I shit you not there were a bunch of semi collins and commas and stuff that made a picture of a gravestone. That escalated quickly.  Why the fuck is this guy sending me gravestone text????? Is this the same guy? I click on the username. 'This profile does not exist'. mfw.jpg

I go into user search. Do a search for 'heeeey', 'heeeey123' and 'howru123' and whatever else I can think of at the time. Nothing comes up. My first thought is, that's fucking weird. My second rationale thought, was that this guy's advertisement did say he was leaving the site. Maybe he had deleted his account and sent me the gravestone because it was Halloween as a parting gift? Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that -- it was Halloween.  I should mention for context that at the same time as playing on petside I'd been watching that 'Babadook' movie (FUCK. THAT.) despite being a supreme wuss. So I was a bit on edge lol.

It was then I got another fucking message. Surprise, the username was different this time. 'imwatchingyou'. WHAT. THE FUCK. Whatthefuckwhatthefuckwhathtefuck!!! This sounds really stupid typing this sober and I can’t believe I’m putting this on the internet but yeah my high ass was pretty scared by this.

In fact I was so freaked out I rang my girlfriend at some ridiculous hour to ask if she could come over.

I ring her. She says she can't. I beg her. She's home alone with her little brother. I tell her to take him with her. She tells me that's ridiculous and asks me if I'm okay. I tell her the situation. She laughs, tells me the job is getting to me and that I need to sleep. Ok cool. I tell her I love her. She says she loves me. We hang up. 

I can't really blame her for that reaction. It pretty much goes like this so far: a username that kept changing on a CHILDREN'S WEBSITE sent me a text picture of a gravestone... Real scary stuff? Anyway, at the time it was and I was freaking the fuck out. 

I wasn't looking at my desktop during the time I rang my gf. Turns out I had three new messages. 

1.01AM from 'badmove'
1.01AM from 'youllbeok'
1.02AM from 'butshewont' 

SHE WONT?? IS THIS SICK PETSITE FUCK REFERRING TO MY GIRLFRIEND???

The paranoia is super taking over now and my heart is beating super fast. I try to think logically. Maybe he is referring to his pet. That was a girl, afterall! But… Isn’t his account deleted? Fuck! I’m so fucking confused. I end up clicking all of the usernames and they take me nowhere. Dead links. I don’t know what to do so I kind of push myself away from the desk on my swivel chair and then pace back and forth for a bit. I re-ring my girlfriend.

I tell her about the weird messages. She says everything is fine on her end. I ask her if she wants me to come over. She says her parents came home a few minutes before I rang her and that she’s not alone. Okay. We exchange soppy goodbyes. I am still worried.

I don’t want to look at the fucking computer but I do anyway because fuck it my high ass is scared and I don’t know what else to do. 

1.09 from ‘andrew’
1.11 from ‘iwarnedyou’

ANDREW IS MY FUCKING NAME. I SHIT YOU NOT, INTERNET. I’M OUT. I’M FREAKING OUT AT THIS STAGE I HAVE NO LINK TO MY PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THE SITE AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE FUCK THEY FOUND ME WHATTTTT 

I don’t want to wake girlfriend up for a third time because this guy somehow knows my name. Andrew is a common name, though. So who really knows? Not me at this stage that’s for sure. The rest of the night is random and unimportant. No more messages come and I manage to eventually get some sleep.

The next day was fucked.

I was thinking about this the morning after and ended up laughing at myself. It was weird. Fucking weird. But when I checked my petsite account, nothing was there. No recollection. Was this all just a bad fucking trip? I don’t think so -- I mean, I’m pretty new to regularly smoking. By regularly I mean maybe twice a week since I started this new business internship -- shit be stressful, man. But yeah I’ve never had an experience like that before. Is it possible to get bad weed??? I don’t know someone more informed tell me. I’ma ask my dealer tomorrow. 



 I go through my day just fine, and end up meeting with my girlfriend. We get talking about shit and awkwardly bring up my awkward bout of paranoia last night and apologise for waking her up twice. She looks at me weirdly. Oh great she’s fucking mad ahhh I’m such an idiot! 

‘What are you talking about?’
‘The phone calls… I rang you freaking out all stupid? You told me to go to bed and that you were fine?’
‘... Andrew, I broke my phone yesterday afternoon. Look. I was dropping it into the repair shop this arvo.’

She produced her smashed up phone to me. I stared dumbly at her phone for a while. Eventually I just sort of laughed and said ‘HAPPY HALLOWEEN JUST KIDDING!’ She looked at me funny again, and then elbowed me playfully. 

‘You big goof. Halloween was yesterday, and you know I don’t believe in that American shit! I will kill you!’

Reasons for my stupid reaction:

1. I was fucking scared
2. My gf doesn’t know I’m a dope user. She is a fitness yoga naturopath goddess strongly against drugs of any kind, even marijuana. She is my first ‘proper girlfriend’ in a long time and I don’t want to lose her (I play on fucking petsite-- it’s pretty self explanitory). If I was on a bad trip, she definitely, definitely cannot know. 
3. I don’t want her to think I’m crazy. We’ve only been dating for a month and I really, really don’t want to fuck this up. She already knows I play petsite for crying out loud. 

Girlfriend proceeds to tell me about her night and how she was looking after her little brother. I asked if she was alone. She said she was until about 1.00AM when her parents got home from their function. 

Mother. Of. God.

The person on the phone who sounded EXACTLY like my girlfriend pretty much said the same shit. Was she fucking sleep walking on the phone or...? How the fuck is that even possible when her phone was all messed up? Rest assured - I have no fucking clue what is going on. 

Fast forward a few hours to my girlfriend and I leaving the shops. She gets in her car, and I wave her off as she drives away. I decide as a spur of the moment thing to head over to my parents house (they live pretty close to the shopping centre) to go and visit them. I’m sitting at the table bragging my balls off to Dad about this awesome new job of mine when I get a phone call. It’s from an unknown number. I answer. 


‘Ahoy hoy?’

Turns out its my girlfriend’s mother. This fucking car pulled out from the other side of the road and smashed into my girlfriend as she was driving home. Right into the driver’s side. Where my girlfriend was sitting. Miraculously, my girlfriend is fine. She broke a few ribs, had a concussion and some internal (and external) bleeding, but for the most part -- completely fine. The other driver is currently in a coma. Apparently she is 8 weeks pregnant. I know right, the cherry on top of one fucked up cake alright! What the fuck?!

This is already long enough so I’ll wrap the story up here but HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. Reddit, this week has been a roller coaster and if anyone can offer some insight into drugs or programming or just offer me a fucking rational situation about what the fuck happened with my girlfriend’s phone that would be awesome because I am not doing okay and I’ve been pretty reluctant to recommence playing on petsite. Also I might lay off the weed for now.

Is this just my own bias or is it true? High GPA + non-trivial personal projects + internships = absolutely no life outside of school. Maybe companies like this because this means they will be used to having no life outside of work? Who the fuck studies all week and then spends all their free time contributing to open source projects because they find it to be so much fun? That sounds like some severe Asperger's to me. 

I just want to be able to go out and play sports or enjoy life a little without having to worry that I need to be working on useless projects (I know you're not touching that shit again once you get a job) and contributing to things I don't care about to impress some random people from the HR department who don't have the slightest clue about what they're reading. Also, how do employers even know that those projects are yours? I could easily go on github and copy an unknown project and put it on my resume. I've seen it happen in actual school projects where you're absolutely fucked if they catch you, so the likelihood of it happening on job applications is probably much higher. I just need to vent, fuck this shit."

I was asked to do a coding challenge online with HackerRank after I applied to a summer internship(more specifically, Riot Games summer intern)

I haven't started the challenge yet, but for anyone who have done a coding challenge for an intern before, what was it like?  was it similar to the problems in codeforce, or perhaps longer?(since the challenge is 3 hours)

Also, one thing that worries me is that if the past applicants had people helping them during the challenge(since it's online), would that increase the expectation of the employers? Or made the problems much harder? I just want to make sure that they're solvable by undergrads concept wise.

Thanks!  "

I'm in my second year of uni in the UK and l'm aiming for an internship/industrial year at a high end tech company (big 4, Twitter prompted this question).

I've been building and security testing websites for a few years in my own time, started developing desktop apps (Java, C# currently) and I'm looking to build a portfolio of open source and personal projects to show employers over the next year.

My question, as stupid as it is:

**where can I find open source projects to look at and potentially contribute towards?**

One of Twitter's requirements/advantages for internships was contributing to open source projects and it's stumped me. I haven't the foggiest idea how to find them, let alone find a project that I'd enjoy contributing towards instead of just a random one that popped up on Google.

Any advice guys?

Thanks."

First a year in Comp Sci till my funds ran out, later a year as an intern for a then-niche local developer with python/django, followed later by a year of sparse freelance and personal projects in C++, C#, and python, and finally a year of hard dedicated independent study into C# and Unity. in-between I would spend a few hours each week poking around as a hobby in eclectic areas of programming. 

I've found web programming to be filled with moving goalposts in both terms of credentials and skill sets. First I was told LAMP was the future, then django, and now MEAN stack. Each time I spoke with a company, the answer has been for years 'your problem solving is great as are your theoretical skills, but you need more experience with x/y/z for this position'. Application programming is even worse than web about this too. There is seemingly no such thing as an 'entry level' application programmer; only web still accepts such a position, and even then only if you have prior experience with their exact stack, or you have a thick resume (which isn't really entry-level then, is it?). I know that it's a fast-paced, ever-changing field, but it seems to be getting to the point that many won't be able to keep up unless they are already employed in it.

My point is: I've had the goalposts moved on me repeatedly by individuals, companies, and the industry's trends as a whole for many years now. The only tech position I have landed beyond a few lucky freelance web jobs is a network security engineer position, which I only got because I knew someone in the company who wanted me to be his subordinate. I know that programming is a fast-paced, ever-changing field, but it seems to be getting to the point that many won't be able to keep up unless they are already employed in it.

Each time I try to learn more APIs, frameworks, or languages, they have fallen out of favor, or the bar raised for entry by the time I can learn it. Is the 'entry level' of the programming world just drying up like all the other industries in America? Has anyone else noticed this trend?"
3redk9,2,2015-11-03,Advice on coop offer,EngThrow1234,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3redk9/advice_on_coop_offer/,"Any advice and questions are welcome. I was recently offered a coop offer for a robotics company. I have some doubts about taking it though. To give you an idea of my situation, I am a sophomore computer engineering students at a well ranked university in the United States. I have done 2 internships before; however, they weren't as technical as I wanted or in the field that I want to see myself going into (think documentation and testing).
Below are various pros and cons I have managed to think of.

Pros:
-Good pay
-Great company that I'd love to work for later down the road (in a different position). I really enjoyed hearing about the culture of this company, where it is heading, and the various industries that it works with.
-The work is only somewhat technical, it is more testing and documentation (similiar to my previous internships; however, more technical)
-Guarantees I have work to do over the summer
-Hands on work that requires some critical thinking

Cons
-It is not as technical as I'd like it to be. I really enjoy working hard on projects, so that way I feel like I get something out of it to advance my career in the field area that I want to go into. And I do not think this position will do that to the extent that I'd hope out of a coop.
-I will be giving up leadership positions on campus
-I will have to stay an extra semester at school
-By taking this coop I may get stuck in a career that I don't enjoy. For example recruiters may looking at previous experience from internships and notice that my work heavily goes into a field that I don't enjoy, and give me interviews/offers for positions in that field.

3reh9e,3,2015-11-03,"Transitioning into data science/analysis with a marketing background, advice?",ANCIENT-ALIEN,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3reh9e/transitioning_into_data_scienceanalysis_with_a/,"I've recently been looking into ways to get into the data science / analytical fields as I'm not entirely satisfactory with my current position in life and whatnot. As a newbie, I'm just looking for some career advice or experience from people who have a better grasp of the field. 



My main questions relate to how my current / desired skill set would fit for a job in data fields (perhaps specific sub-fields are relevant).



So let me start off by introducing. Currently I'm doing a PhD (one year in) in Marketing, specializing in Consumer Behavior. I have a  a Master of Science in the exact same field as my PhD, and a Bachelor in Business Administration (Marketing).  I'm based in Europe and aged 24; suffice to say I'd be looking for an entry level position. 



I should note that most ""true"" data science job offerings around here ask for quantitative degrees (math, comp sci, econometrics, physics) but I feel with the shortage of analytical talent and other supposed requirements (programming, business acumen, whatever) that's probably wishful thinking. 



So I don't have a technical or engineering degree, my background is mostly in business/marketing and consumer psychological areas (think more in lines of surveys/experiments and market research but then in a more academic view to analyse consumer preferences etc.). 



My ""field"" is relatively quantitative in nature (although it isn't exactly math/econometrics/machine learning), focussing on univariate and multivariate statistics (over econometric/Bayesian models, etc, although I'm not sure how big the differences are. Doing a PhD/having a Master's I am familiar with experimental designs and hypothesis testing. 



 I have knowledge of calculus (university level) and statistics (basic/multivariate and research methods). These include: linear and multiple regressions, t-tests and such, ANOVA (and variants), General Linear Models, hierarchical clustering (we use it for market segmentations etc), conjoint analysis, principal components analysis/factor analysis (used for perceptual mapping analyses) and some other dimension reduction methods like correspondence analysis. Usually, most methods are based on linear regression in one way or another. 



During my studies I've done internships in the online marketing, particularly in Web Analytics (I have the Google Analytics certificate). During those web analytics days I particularly did the metrics/dashboard reporting stuff paired with visualizations in Tableau.



I normally conduct statistical analyses using SPSS. Right now however I'm learning R (through DataCamp courses), including programming, statistics, visualizations, machine learning concepts and the whole shebang. 



If I were to stop my PhD programme, I'd plan to drop roughly 1000 USD on additional courses to get into the data field. I'd be including (probably):

- the Data Science specialisation on Coursera

- Python programming (to compliment R)

- a course on Econometrics/modelling (I don't have any experience with this) 



So to get to my questions:



- would this plan be a decent/feasible one to get me started a job into data science-esque fields?

- specifically, what types of jobs would I best qualify for? my understanding is ""data science"" atm is very multidisciplinary so I may be better suited for some functions over others. (personally I'm thinking a marketing/business oriented position in e-commerce analytics/science or comparable). I'm looking at this broadly, so really just any kind of analytical function that would fit with my background.

- do you have any other recommendations of courses or similar that are important to further develop my skillset? Unfortunatel I can't do another Master's (really expensive and most ""pure"" data science require Bsc's in mathematical/comp sci. fields.


I realize this is a wall of text, sorry, I just wanted to be somewhat thorough :)"
3rek31,2,2015-11-03,Any summer 2016 GIS internship leads you can provide?,IoPan,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/3rek31/any_summer_2016_gis_internship_leads_you_can/,"Hi r/gis! 

I've posted on here before asking advice about GIS course planning, and you were all tremendously helpful. Now I've returned to ask if anyone who works for a company that provides GIS services has any leads for a summer 2016 internship! I've already searched this sub's history for previous posts similar to mine, and it seems like all the GIS professionals on here are very kind and helpful to current students and fresh graduates. 

A little background about me: 

- I'm a Junior studying Environmental Technology and Management

- My school does not offer a GIS undergraduate major/minor so I've been able to take graduate-level GIS courses, and will be applying to graduate certificate program upon graduation next fall (I'll be half-way through the program by then)

- I work in a lab where I have been fortunate enough to be approached by my PI to conduct my own research on applications of remote-sensing technologies (LiDAR and photogrammetry) to stormwater-caused soil erosion/micro-topography

- I have a background in programming and (in order of decreasing proficiency) have experience with Java, R, and Python. I took a course in Java, and had class labs/recitations where we used Python. I taught myself R because I needed it for data processing and analysis in the lab where I work. 

- I love what I've been able to research within my lab, and love the graduate-level courses I've been taking, but I'm really hoping to see how the GIS industry works in the professional sphere

- I'm interested in a wide range of GIS topics, including environmental remote sensing, environmental modeling, land use mapping, as well as digital map product development (I'm really interested in being able to learn more on the GIS development front- things like web mapping and application development). These are topics I've had the most exposure to, so I like them. However, I want to be exposed to and learn about more/other GIS applications! 

- I'm very willing and fortunately able to relocate for this coming summer

Any information or possible positions you can point me to would be fully appreciated!"

3rf79x,11,2015-11-03,Negotiating a raise after starting below average,mbthrow2015,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rf79x/negotiating_a_raise_after_starting_below_average/,"I have been at this company for almost a year now.  When I took the position, I made the mistake of not properly researching average salary and asking for a salary that was low.  I came to this company straight out of university, although I had 2 years experience by this point.  Well, it turns out that Boulder is not exactly a low COL location.  It actually seems to be a little bit worse than Denver.  


Now that we are toward the end of the year, annual reviews are coming up.  I have done great this last year and have produced a lot of material that is in production.  I am even directly responsible for managing one of our crucial products.


Annual reviews seem like a good time to bring up a raise.  I guess my confusion comes in the title and the average for that title.  My title is Software Engineer, but we dont have any I/II/III/IV/Jr/Sr/Etc classifications.  Titles seem to be arbitrary in this field.  


A couple things that I do know:

1.) The company pays market price or more when giving offers.  I made the elementary mistake of giving a number first and asked for a very low salary.  I acknowledge my mistake, I've worked hard for the last year, management knows that I've worked hard, and I'm hopeful in re-negotiating my salary.

2.) We gave one of our interns a full time offer at 60k, with no prior experience.  They offered this based on average starting pay for a cs major, not based on the title.  I am making 55k, with 3 years experience at this point.  

3.) The average salary of a ""Software Engineer"" in Boulder is 91k.  I don't know how to extrapolate that based on years of experience.


My plan of attack is to sit down with my employer for the annual review, discuss my progress, and then ask if they are open to discussing an increase to my salary.  If they aren't, and I just get the average 3-5% raise, I should probably start applying elsewhere.  I am fairly certain they will be willing to discuss it.  I would first talk about what I will be improving on for the next year and how my value will increase, including some details about how I plan to improve the service that I manage.  I would suggest that the average pay for my position is 91k and that I would value myself to be more than an average Software Engineer at this company and would like a number higher than that, and hope to negotiate to at least that.

1.) Is it uncommon for a company that pays market price to allow someone working well below average to negotiate to at least that average?  Going from 55k to 90k is a huge raise.  I understand this would be much more normal if I were applying to another company.

2.) How do I judge if 90k is the right price based on years of experience coupled with the fact that titles are somewhat arbitrary and there is no jr/sr titles here?

3.) I understand I should negotiate by asking for a high number and then settling lower toward what I really expect (what I expect the company values me at).  I already feel weird asking for a higher number due to starting so low, would it be absurd to ask 100k when I expect to get 90k when I am currently making 55k?

3.) Any flaws or catches with my strategy?  Any input would be greatly appreciated."

3rgmkj,2,2015-11-04,2 Internships in 2016?,cshelp321321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rgmkj/2_internships_in_2016/,"Hi,

I am currently a junior studying CS and I was fortunate enough to receive 2 great internship offers (big 4) for next summer. However, I'm really having trouble deciding between the two offers, and an advisor brought up the idea of doing one of the internships in the winter and the other in the summer, so that I would have the chance to experience working at both companies. I talked a bit with the companies and this looks like it might be an option for me.

I was wondering if anyone has experience on doing an internship during the semester &amp; summer and how this would be viewed compared to taking classes at school? I would be applying for fulltime opportunities during the end of my summer internship/beginning of fall 2016, and I'm wondering if it would hurt since I don't have coursework in a lot of important subjects like networking and databases? Or if having 2 internships on my resume would give me a significant advantage over just having 1?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm an ME and here's my ""dilemna"". Although I feel bad for calling it that.

After our school's career fair I interviewed and am about to get offered an internship at a medium size but respectable company in a field I'm interested in. I was definitely happy with that until a very prestigious tech company rolled in and swept me off my feet. They want me to do a co-op which would mean I either have to finish school the summer after I would regularly graduate (and hate my life with the more condensed workload) or just do another regular semester and graduate 8 months ""late"".

This co-op is definitely a ridiculous opportunity and tbh feels straight up out of my league, although it's not somewhere I see myself working long term. Not really sure what to do, and out of the people I've tried talking to, opinions are split."

I grew up in St. Louis, spending 22 years of my life there. Recently I moved to Dallas to live with my parents after graduating college (they moved here after I graduated high school). The main reason I moved here was to save money and not have to pay rent, but also because I recently went through a breakup with my longterm boyfriend of 4.5 years and felt like I needed a change.

I have been here about 5 months, haven't had any luck in finding a job, and am now reconsidering moving back to St. Louis. My whole life is in St. Louis (besides my parents) and I am constantly missing my friends and other family. I also had a very strong network of friends that included my classmates and friends from high school. I also left an internship that forced me to grow every day and that I loved working at. 

I have also recently reconnected with my boyfriend and we are working through our issues at the moment. Though this influences me emotionally, I am taking him out of the equation in order to make a rational decision.

The biggest issue is that I have no money in order to move back (to pay security deposits/first month's rent, etc), but I plan on securing a job before making this move (which would hopefully be at my old internship). 

My parents also believe this is a bad decision because of my financial situation, but there is just something in my gut that tells me it's right. 

My plan when originally moving here was to move back to St. Louis in 3 years, after working for a little bit and saving money. I am thinking now that if that's where I want to end up, why not move there now?

I had also made a decision like this before in the past when I went away for college at Mizzou. The atmosphere wasn't the right fit for me and I wasn't happy. I stayed there for a year, but ended up moving back to St. Louis in order to be with my boyfriend. While that decision was heavily influenced by love, it was the best decision I could have made. I ended up loving my new school and creating friendships that I will cherish forever. It also created opportunities that I couldn't have achieved at Mizzou. I had resistance from my parents then too, but eventually wore them down and I moved back to St. Louis. 

Thoughts?

3rijqi,1,2015-11-04,I think my friend is in a bad situation and I don't know how to help her,AirlinesAndEconomics,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3rijqi/i_think_my_friend_is_in_a_bad_situation_and_i/,"Sorry if this ends up being too long or is better suited for a different subreddit. 

For some background:
My friend is a good, smart person, but her judgement skills are lacking. She wants to work in bridal fashion, so logically moving to NYC or LA or one of those areas would be her best bet. She was going to look for jobs in NYC, when her old unpaid internship boss that she had two summers called her and asked her to apply for the manager position that was opening up. I was really proud of her for getting the job, but I always felt that it was a bad call and she should have stuck with NYC. She moved for this job and started it just a little over two months ago. Her dad paid her security deposit and first month's rent on her apartment (which is in her boss's name) and he believes that she should stick with the job for at least a year, preferably two. She feels the same way because she doesn't want to get a reputation in the bridal fashion industry as a job hopper- she's 22 and this is her second job since graduating about a year ago. 

Why I think she's in a bad situation:
My friend messaged me today, telling me how she's been so stressed about work and her living situation. Her boss is crazy (not the first time she's said that) and that she doesn't feel as though she has her own place because her boss treats the apartment as her own- inviting people to come and stay over whenever they want. I asked if my friend was on the lease since my friend lives there, and she told me that she was never put on the lease and they never signed any agreement between the two of them for the apartment. My friend didn't find this weird at all because she works with her everyday (which is a big mistake in my opinion). 

My friend then told me that her boss has not paid her September or October commission like she was supposed to get, which is making her financial situation very bad. My friend told me that the store is currently doing poorly and the boss isn't paying for things. My friend also says that she can't be put on the lease because the apartment is being rented so the boss and her son can be in that school district. My friend also feels she can't say anything because she pays less than half the rent. I told my friend to email her about this, so at least there is a paper trail, but when my friend does, her boss does not respond or will say that they'll talk in person- that she doesn't like to have things in writing.

My friend, being the kind-hearted person she is, feels bad because her boss is going through a rough patch personally, but recognizes that she is kind of egotistical and name drops and is also kind of a bully. My friend's dad, while a good man, gives his daughter terrible advice, in my opinion, because he wants to keep her sheltered all the time. He told my friend that it's not a good idea. Her boss is vindictive and has told other employees that my friend better stay, that she's tired of a rotating door of employees, and that she will make my friend's life difficult.

I don't know what to really tell her or do for her, and I don't know what she can do. I'm really concerned for her, I really don't think the situation will get better. But my friend is also stubborn and doesn't want to move again or find a new job for fear of being a ""job-hopper""."

Anyways, I just wanted to ask a pretty broad question, but is college gpa relevant to getting your first career job out of college? The reason why I am asking is because currently, I have a 3.30/4.0 cumulative score (major gpa is at 2.9). I'm expecting (realistically speaking) my cumulative to go down to 3.1 or even 3.0 (hence major gpa down to 2.7 or less) as I am an idiot and decided to save all the hard major classes till my last two years (took mostly gen eds/electives and some major classes within year 1-2). This obiously takes a toll on me when I'm taking 3 math classes and 2 CS classes at once and probably the same for my next/last semester. Also to mention I am in my last year as a math and CS major (its just one major that is basically a glorified math degree with slight programming on the side emphasizing on mathematical structures and its applications.

Some more info on me is that I already had just one internship as working in the IT department for a financial trading firm in downtown Chicago for roughly two years now (technically two summers as I do not work during the school year). I would like to proceed with a career with something along the lines of networking/IT or being a system administrator or possibly something in data mining. Also, I'm not particularly interested in programming, I can get good/decent marks in my CS classes, but ultimately not looking for a career in that field and can't see myself enjoying it (I enjoy the mathematical side of my degree moreso than the programming side).

So yeah I just wanted your inputs about gpa and its relativity since mine wont be anything special, but at least I have some prior experience in the work place over the summers. Should I even put my gpa in my resume or just omit it? I'm assumming most employers prefer experience and personality and as long as you even have a degree for that matter, rather than grades alone.

Thanks a lot and sorry for the long post.

3rk61p,13,2015-11-04,The Mormons,WanderingToast,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3rk61p/the_mormons/,"-Mr. Miller

Ok, I'll just start again. My name is Ian Miller. I live in Salt Lake City Utah and you probably won't believe what I'm going to tell you, but I'll start again from the beginning.

It was a typical Thursday night for me. Work was uneventful and I brought my daughter from school to my ex wife's place, as she has her the rest of the week.

At around 8PM, I think, I heard a knock at the door.
Since everyone has cell phones these days usually you know when someone is going to stop by. Its just common courtesy to text beforehand. So the fact that I heard an unexpected  knock after 8pm on a Thursday night was  odd.

I put the TV on mute and went to the front door of my apartment to see two young men, dressed in white shirts, black ties, and dress pants.

I paused for a second, and struggled with the idea of them interrupting my show, versus being rude, as they definitely heard me get up and approach the door through the paper thin walls of my apartment.

So, curiosity pushed me off the fence and I decided to open the door. These kids were definitely Mormons alright. You can tell by the name tags and those eerily big smiles. Its just not natural to be that happy all the god damn time.

""Good Evening! I'm Elder Spencer and this is Elder Clark, we are representatives from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, some people call us Mormons"".

The other ""elder"" chimed in, ""Would you have a moment to share a message with you about how families can be together forever?"".

I returned a smile and responded, ""Thanks, but I can barely stand my family during our yearly reunions, I don't know about forever"".

They both laughed, way too hard and almost in unison, at what I said.

""Gosh, I'm sure they can't be that bad. Do you have 15 minutes for us to share a message?""
I wanted to say no, but I have always been curious about these guys, as religious study in general intrigues me.

So they sat down, I went and grabbed them both a glass of water and got to chit-chatting. I told them that since I moved to Salt Lake City for work I knew it was only a matter of time before they'd be around.

Most the people in Salt Lake were mormon, so I felt pretty comfortable around them at first. A lot of the guys at work would talk about church enough that I felt like I knew a good amount about mormonism, from a organizational stand point.

""So where is Mrs. Millers?"" Spencer said as to ask about my sex life indirectly. I told them a little about my marriage and subsequent divorce, and mentioned how our one daughter lives with my ex.

The conversation seemed normal, but I noticed that I said way more than I normally would to anyone who asked that question. Like just by posing it they just cracked me open like an egg on a frying pan and now I was spilling my guts to them.

After I finished what I was saying, realizing I just talked their ears off about my situation, they took no time to segway it into their message.

""Brother Miller, it's really sad that those trials happen in our lives, but god wants us to overcome them, so we can return to live with him. Can you imagine how great it would be to have joy, forever?...""

The question hung in the air for a few seconds. The smile on Clark's face looked so etched in that it could almost be brittle enough to crack.
There was something that made me feel uneasy or uncomfortable about it. I gave them a half hearted answer and started to let them down gently. 
I told them that I had heard enough to know that this wasn't for me and that I'd be glad to grab them a ice cream drumstick and send them on their way.

As I was getting up I could see the expression in their faces change. At first it looked like they were a little flustered, or deflated, but one more glance back and it was almost unmistakable that they were angry.

I smiled inside as I kinda get a rise out of pissing people off that aren't usually told No. 
I walked over to the freezer and started digging for their ice cream. I found one of the drumsticks when I suddenly noticed Spencer approached from behind and that his tie was off. 

I started to say, ""Did you spill something on your tie Spe"", but I heard the sound of my voice squeak to silence before I even felt the cloth around my neck.

I can only imagine that Spencer pushed my head into the side of the freezer as that part of my head was throbbing with pain when I came to.

I was looking down and I slowly opened my eyes to see the blood that had ran from that side of my face down the front of my shirt. I tried to move but quickly realized I was restrained.

Spencer pulled my head back violently by my hair. I screamed in pain and my own muffled voice told me that I wouldn't be able to call for help without solving my restraint problem first, as I was gagged.

My eyes darted in the direction of the sound of papers hitting the kitchen floor, which caused my head to rush with dizziness.

Spencer spoke as he loosened his grip, ""It was taking you longer to come to than I thought, so we started going through your documents and mail to find the information we need. I hope that you don't mind...""

He continued, ""This is the Lord's work, and Brother Joseph prophesied that NO unhallowed hand will stop this work. You people don't accept the gospel! We will convert you one way or another! See, here in the church one can be baptised to covert to the church after the age of 8, but our number of converts hasn't been rising, which displeases the brethren.""

Somehow Spencer maintained his toothy, cheeky demeanor while saying this. He turned to Clark who continued where he left off.

""There is another way to get people to the Lord... Its called baptisms for the dead. In order to do this, we need some information. Your parents name, your name, your place of birth, and your year of birth. And of course..."" Clark leaned in closer and started to stroke my hair, ""We need you dead...""

Behind me the sound of a blade leaving the knife drawer seemed to echo off every nerve in my body. I didn't want to believe that was the sound I heard, but the metallic reflection of my face was soon in my peripheral.

My eyes weld with tears. Tears of fear, of confusion, of sadness, I don't know. This was not something I could prepare for. My family, my daughter... I was trying to think of the last thing I said to her.

As I was closing my eyes against what I thought was inevitable, I saw the flashing of red and blue. Just two colors that made me sob uncontrollably now.

The Missionaries turned around, at the flashing lights. Spencer set the knife on the counter and motioned for Clark go to the window.
Just as quickly as hope filled me, it left. I was perplexed at how calmly Clark picked up his backpack and walked over to the window. He looked down at the lights and smiled.

I don't understand why, but he raised his arm up, perpendicular to his shoulder and bent his elbow at 90 degrees. He stood like this for about 5 seconds and the lights turned off.

""We have to go elder..."" Clark said, throwing Spencer's backpack to him. I felt the pressure ease in the tape they used on my wrists as the Elder cut into it just a little.

And just like that, they left. I struggled with my restraints a little and broke broke my hands free. Forgetting briefly about my head, I stood up far too quickly and collapsed.

I remember waking up about two hours later, according to the clock on my microwave. I took a second to bandage my head and made sure I was good to drive. After that I came straight here and now I'm telling you this story...

-Officer
""Well, Mr Miller... Its an intriguing story. But here in Salt Lake we love our missionaries, and we believe in aiding them. So where are going to have to settle to this off the record... Daniels, cut the tape.""

-Intelligible shouting from Mr. Miller. Gun shot. Mumbling between officers. Tape stops.

My name is Duncan and I work as an intern here in the salt lake police station, in the archive rooms. I took the time to transcribe the above story from a tape I found that was headed for the waste bin. The tape was labeled ""Ian Miller 2013 - Claims Addressed, Please Discard"".

A police station builds up a considerable amount of recordings and paperwork, and so when cases are resolved or go cold, they are archived. I don't think that is how every station does it, but that's what they have me doing here.

The only reason why this tape caught my eye is because It shouldn't be in the waste bin, even if resolved. So I set it on my desk.
Today I received a new stack of case files that just came down to the archive room, which I usually have to file alphabetically.

When I came across a Missing Persons Case for Ian Miller, I set it next to the tape, thinking that it must be a common name or something. I thought that surely it was a coincidence until I listened to the tape...

I read a lot of posts on nosleep, but I've never had something to contribute. I didn't know where else to post this.

Edit: Grammar stuff."
3rka2b,0,2015-11-04,Rejected from all my dream companies/locations :( What should my plan be?,ch0xi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rka2b/rejected_from_all_my_dream_companieslocations/,"Hey everyone! So I'm a UVA student about to graduate in May. I just started coding seriously about a year and a half ago although I've always had a little bit of exposure to CS in my family. For more specific background you can check out my other posts cuz I go a lot more in depth there.

I got really passionate about coding and the prospect of becoming a real life software engineer. And working for cool internet/app companies like Google, Facebook, or smaller ones like Uber, AirBnB, etc. Probably my dream company is Etsy.

I applied to a bunch of different companies and only heard back from 3 or 4 of my dream location ones and got rejected from all of them, after spending countless hours trying to cram and study. The only offer I have right now is a return offer from my internship company.

Even though I tried really hard starting from this past September, I really regret not starting earlier. I only wanted internships in my hometown last year because I didn't want to move away for over the summer. I really regret that now knowing how much of a step up a big name internship gets you. But beyond that I regret not starting to study for interviews over the summer instead of rushing in September. I was unaware of the recruiting timeline and thought I would have more time before having to start the job hunt (I thought that was more a Spring semester thing). So I was very wrong, and had to cram all this interview and algorithms knowledge in a month and a half, while having to take a week off here or there to not fail out of my classes. I definitely learned a lot, but I guess not enough. This one really bothers me because knowing just how much I learned between September-November, I know I could have done a lot better if I had started studying earlier.

But I guess there's no point in regrets! And you only learn from your failures, right?

It's just really hard to not feel so, so disappointed. It's hard to feel happy about the offer I did get from my internship company, even though it's really not a bad offer.

It's hard to feel good about it because all my CS friends aren't giving me any validation at all and are feeling sorry for me for only having that offer whereas my non-CS friends are super happy for me and think I should be really glad I have a job, and a higher-than-average paying one at that.

So I still feel like a failure when it comes to my peers or CS people around my age.

Why does it feel like this is the end game? There's still hope for me, right? None of my peers will answer that question - they kind of just look away awkwardly.

What should my plan be? Can I still work for those dream companies and move to those dream locations before becoming irrelevant? Or before growing too old to fit into the culture?

What I want to do is start really focusing my front end skills as well as starting to learn how to make user interface designs. I really wanna become a Front End Developer who is also a UI/Graphic designer!

How many years do I have to work at my first company before I can start applying to my dream companies again? Is one year too soon? What should I focus on during this time?

EDIT: Thanks for all your support guys. I guess my two biggest main questions are:
Is it too early to try to move to a different place after only one year? (And reapplying to several places?)
How should I study algorithms/data structures/interview stuff while also having to work full time? "

3rkizr,0,2015-11-04,My first hackathon [YALE],javaNoob69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rkizr/my_first_hackathon_yale/,"Hey everyone. I'll be going to my first hackathon in 2 days and I'm super worried about not being able to contribute to anything. I'm a first semester freshman CS student that only knows the fundamentals of java. I'm probably going to end up in a team with inexperienced people like myself or not in one at all? Anyways, I'm looking forward to the ride there, free food, t-shirts, people, and other activities. A lot of intelligent people will be there, so I want to get to know others and possibly learn from them. Anything I should do to prepare? Just wondering.. is presenting mandatory for everyone even if the project isn't complete or even started?

edit: Also, what should I do so that I'm more prepared for hackathons in general? At school we use the book Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects (6th Edition). I'm on the 5th chapter at the moment. Should I finish it up before the semester is up to be at a good standing for possible internships in the summer? The next semester is when we study beyond classes in the book and I think it would be better I go in having experience with the work."
3rku5m,5,2015-11-04,Suing a non-profit drum corps?,ThwAwy219348,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3rku5m/suing_a_nonprofit_drum_corps/,"
I’m looking to see if anyone might have any valuable information on this subject because, while I’m aware that taking legal action on a drum corps isn’t fun for anyone,  I was done very wrong over the 2015 tour. I also am not able to give the location of the corps as it could be identified by that alone as there are not many drum corps in the US. 

For those that don’t know what drum corps is, it’s tough to explain, but the typical drum corps is a non-profit youth organization that is essentially a professional marching band. Staff and students (members) move in to a location together, typically in late May, for a period of 2 to 3 weeks. During this time, commonly known as “spring training,” the members learn their marching show. After spring training, the entire corps loads all of their equipment onto a semi-truck and live on tour busses. They are fed via a mobile kitchen that is built into a semi-truck trailer. The corps then travels at night and rehearses and competes at contests during the day. The living/working situation is an all day-every day type of environment. 

I was contracted as a staff member for a drum corps that participated in the 2015 Drum Corps International tour. I was sent a staff contract specifying the dates to expect compensation, as well as a W-9 tax form and a direct deposit form. I turned in all of the paperwork on time to the corps as well as a voided check. 

Half way through the summer, the rest of the staff had been paid at least twice and I had not received any compensation in my bank account. So I emailed the corps operations director to which I was told they’d “look into it.” An entire week later rolled by (during the summer) and I had heard nothing back. I decided to ask the caption head about the situation, to which I was informed that my position was thought to be an intern position on the caption heads’ part, therefore there was no room left in that particular captions budget because the caption head thought I had been taken care of by the administration prior to the caption head being put in charge of that particular budget. (I know that was a little long winded, hopefully it made sense.)

I also need to add that I had not worked out an exact amount of compensation with the corps. I wasn’t expecting much money, but I was expecting something as they had led me to believe I’d be receiving some amount via direct deposit. This is where I’m stuck trying to figure out if I have some kind of angle here. 


The compensation portion of the contract I was given reads as follows:

“(Blank) hires our staff as independent contract labor. This
means that your taxes are not deducted from your paycheck. You are responsible for the payment of your own employment taxes. (Blank) provides each staff member with a Form 1099 at the end of the calendar year for all monies earned during that calendar year. Further, all income is reported to the Internal Revenue
Service, as required by law. (Blank) pays through Direct Deposit. You have the option of having the funds deposited directly into a checking or savings account.
(Blank) compensates once a month on the 15th of each
month or, when the 15th falls on a weekend or holiday, the next business day during that month. There may be the occasional time when the pay date is extended a day or two past the 15th. If this occurs, substantial notice is provided.
(Blank) will not compensate any staff member that has not
turned in the proper paperwork, which is included in this staff handbook packet. These 4 forms include the direct deposit form, the W-9 form, as well as a voided check or a deposit authorization form from your bank, signed by authorized bank personnel.
The Executive Director, upon discussion with either the individual staff member or the appropriate caption head, will determine the schedule of your payments for payroll. Any questions concerning the amounts or schedule of payments should be directed initially to the appropriate caption head, and then to the Executive Director.
(Blank) does not compensate in full until the contract period has been satisfied. If it has been determined by the Program Coordinator and the Executive Director that a contract has not been fulfilled, the compensation is pro-rated to reflect the actual time worked. If it has been determined that a contracted staff person has been compensated in excess of pro-rated funds, then the staff person is responsible for reimbursement to (Blank).”


It also doesn’t make much sense that they would outline payment dates then say that the payment schedule has to be discussed with the executive director. 


I was with the drum corps until mid-June, where I left early because of non-payment. I am aware that it is some months later, but it’s been really bugging me lately that a situation like that happened to someone, especially someone that spent multiple summers as a marching member of that group. 

When I informed the administration that I was planning on leaving early, they made no attempt whatsoever to try and work it out with me. All I got was the ""we're sorry to hear you're leaving"" response. 

I’m hoping someone will be able to either inform me of some possible action or let me know if I’m grasping at straws. "

3rleud,1,2015-11-05,I'm being paid $15/hr after a year of interning (?) at a startup. Am I being underpaid?,Smile_And_Wave_Boys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rleud/im_being_paid_15hr_after_a_year_of_interning_at_a/,"Here's the situation:

I graduated high school in 2014, and at the end of that summer I started interning at a very small company (this was August). At this point, the company was extremely small and was doing research into launching a new product. I was hired at $12 an hour, working full time.

At the time the company consisted of the CEO, his brother in charge of marketing, and their cousin also helping with marketing (they also had a sister company they were running), a bookkeeper who was let go soon after I was hired, and me.

I was still pretty inexperienced with programming at the time, but had some Java experience from high school where I had made simple applications and a minecraft mod. So nothing really that great, but starting out.

From August to November I was tasked to build prototype Android apps. My boss recognized that I was still learning, so it was an awesome low pressure environment where I spent most of the time learning. During this time, we were still designing the product and I was able to take part in these discussions and I like to think I had some influence.

We launched the beta product in December, and I launched a production Android app in February. During this time we also gained a handful of team members, growing the company to around 10.

From that time the company has grown by around 20 employees, and I have shifted from focusing on Android to building from the ground up an internal inventory tracking tool. I can't really get too specific on its function, but it's built on django, mysql and plenty of jquery / css / html. It's a critical part of the business.

So that brings us to now. I started my freshman year of college about an hour away from the office, and I work remotely about 20 hours a week and go down to the office once a week. I've looked online and see that at minimum, most internships offer $20 an hour, and I would say that although my title says 'intern', I feel I have made some core contributions that qualify me for higher pay.

Should I ask for higher pay? How do I go about doing so?"

I am planning on going to MSU when I get out to get a CS degree, even though I will lose a few credits from AMU in the process. I think that the actual environment would be better, and give me a chance to network, get internships, etc. But I am still debating if the online degree would be just as good. I am not sure exactly what sort of field I would like to work in. I've been in the military for 6 years and I'm not quite sure what is out there.

I moved to a city in Illinois about 5 months ago. I transferred to a different University and was able to land an internship in a local start-up (around 10-15 employees, 4-5 dev) Last week I was told my internship was gonna end in 2 months. But the other interns that were employed will remain with the company. My ""mentor"" said that I needed to see the ""big picture."" Most of the things that I developed in the front end were fine but I did not have any knowledge of the back end and took longer and sometimes got confused since my the development was on the fly(we did not have full details of what was needed just an idea of what may be needed.) I understand it was only an internship... 
But before I moved to the midwest I was hired by another start up in my original city. I was hired part time developing software as contractor. I only lasted 4 weeks in that place (the company was 3 people, 2 developers.) The boss said I was not developing at the speed that he wanted me to and he said that I needed to get the vision of the company, in his own words: ""The vision is to be the *best* provider of software."" That was my first job in software. I had a serious conversation and I told him that the little that I know is because I taught myself and that I was learning but it wasn't enough for him. 

It seems to me that both jobs that I have had in the industry is just start ups trying to get cheap labor. This has been very discouraging to the point of making me doubt if I picked the right career. "

My name is Student Seeker, and I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at Engineering State Tech, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I hope you will consider hosting me for summer research placement.

Last year, I conducted research at the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Engine Ear University under the supervision of Dr. OtherPstDoc. While there, I developed a novel approach to uniquely identify silver oxide nanoparticles in soil, using surfactants. Through my work at Engine Ear, I have gained proficiency in standard lab techniques including serial dilution, gel filtration chromatography, sterile techniques and general lab safety. I have also gained exposure to and learned how to use various pieces of lab equipment, including an ultrasonic cleaner, spectrophotometer, centrifuge and total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer. I was actively involved in all phases of research, including planning, preparation, data analysis, maintenance, and, when necessary, appropriate disposal.

My primary interest lies in Electrical and Computer Engineering, however, I used my internship at Engine Ear to gain experience and exposure, to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills, and to learn about a different field in Engineering that I might not have the chance to experience later.

I am eager to engage myself fully in a summer internship. Considering your work in the field of electrical engineering, I strongly believe I would be a great asset to your research endeavors. I understand that you are very busy with your research, but I would be very grateful for 20 minutes of your time and am happy to meet you at the most convenient location/time for you.

Respectfully yours,

I'll try to be succinct.  I got a BA a few years ago in Japanese, and I spent 3 years teaching English in Japan.  I came back to the US, as I'm from the Midwest originally, and have been taking prerequisite courses for entrance into a CS Master's program.  I'm pretty much set on the GaTech OMSCS because of the price.  I've heard and read that most Master's students no longer receive funding, and I refuse to take out several thousand dollars more in loans.  I have 20k+ of loans already, and while taking courses part-time, I've been working nearly full-time between two-three jobs depending on the semester in order to keep from having to take out more.

To put it bluntly:  I'm exhausted.  Regardless of where I go to grad school, it's going to be 2ish years until I have my degree, and I would much rather work full-time with benefits and a living wage rather than continuing my hodge-podge smattering of part-time work, no benefits, poverty-level wages, and an extremely irregular schedule.

After this semester, I'll have what my school considers a minor in computer science, and I'll have a 3.8-4.0 GPA depending on how these last few weeks of classes go.

I've been kind of lax in applying for internships for this summer, and there's really not much excuse for that other than I get bogged down, and I try to enjoy any free time I get.  I'm not really sure I qualify for most as I have no intention of completing a BS for the time/financial reasons listed above.  

I was curious as to whether or not I had a shot applying for full-time positions with my credentials.  As I stated, I have a 4.0, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on algorithms (I'm in that course now), I'm currently working as a TA for the intro-programming class, and here soon I'll be starting an hourly position for a few months working on some programming for computational physics software.  

One advisor at my school said I should just apply for a Ph.D, get funding, and bail after 2 years, but I don't think this is the most responsible/ethical solution to my problem.

I should add, my reasoning for getting the Master's is because it will satisfy a visa requirement for me to leave the country and eventually obtain permanent residence elsewhere.  

Any information ya'll could give me would be greatly appreciated.

I'm 19, I live on the Kentucky side of the Cincinnati area, and I've been working at my place of business for a little over a year now (~35 hours a week, but never 40). My prior experience is 3 years at my high school doing an ""internship"" with the SysAdmin there and essentially acting as a Help Desk role. I'd take the easier tickets for him, but the last 4 months of that ""internship"" I was paid and given full access with the sysadmin there. 

I'm a student and attend class 4 hours in the week total (the rest are online) that cuts into work. 

Right now, I'm making $11/hr which if I'm being honest, it's killing me. I have my budgets set and planned, but I have very little wiggle room on what I can just go out and buy/save. 

My role when I started was mainly doing the typical break/fix stuff. That includes some basic AD work (users, groups, permissions, etc.), some very light Exchange work, remote virus removal and general fixing of whatever problem. 

I have been the at the front of the company with this transition to LabTech. I started getting things organized about two or three months ago when I saw that a break/fix model wasn't optimal. I've solely worked on working with LabTech, getting to know the software better, and properly implementing it. 

We've started transitioning to it and have sold LabTech to multiple clients (it's already bringing in money). I don't like to play the card of how great I am, because I know very little about the world of IT and I know this. I'm confident in what I know so far, but understand there's a ridiculous amount to learn. That being said, without me we wouldn't have jumped to LabTech or had any of this income already. 

We went two weeks with virtually no calls coming in. I stepped up and started something that's going to get the company back on track.

I haven't talked to my bosses about a raise yet. I wanted to see if a raise is justified before I do.

I feel like I've proved my worth and have done enough to justify making more than $11/hr. I pushed for innovation, I did the work, and this is going to make us a lot more money. 

Am I justified in wanting a raise? 

Thanks. I'd be happy to answer any questions or concerns that you have. "

I’m not super proud of the result. It works perfectly fine and the resulting code demonstrates that I understand how an assembler works but I consider the code quality to be mediocre. 


My question is, would it be a good idea to include this project on the resume I’m sending out for internships and then include a post-mortem style document with the code on GitHub essentially picking the code as well as my process apart in order to show how it can be improved and what I’ve learned. 


What I am thinking of doing is showing my first try which is completely broken spaghetti code as well as the rewritten second iteration and then explaining why decisions such as using multiple source files and breaking down code into additional functions made the rewrite better and easier to debug. Following that I would like to focus on the rewritten code and explain my problems with it (variable names, data structures implemented in a half assed way, no comments, etc) and how I would improve it.


The reason I want to do this is because I think it would demonstrate some humility as well as the ability to write documentation and take the initiative to understand my limitations and learn from my mistakes. Is my reasoning sound? Is this a good idea?


Attached is some example code from the rewrite of the hash table I implemented as well as the source file for the functions I wrote.

I am unsure of what to do next. My mind is telling me to do dual credit courses (count for undergrad/grad) and finish my Masters in a a year and a half. If I took this route I was thinking of staying at my current school since my GPA is 3.6 and I don't have a lot of internship experience. 

I started really caring about my career recently. I feel like the extra year could help me continue studying for technical interviews and getting an extra 2 internships in order to land a job at a nice company. 

Appreciate any thoughts on the situation. Thanks!

I'm 28 and a junior in college. I took several years off after high school to pursue a career in punk rock, and within that worked a lot of different retail jobs and a little bit of food service as well. My most prominent job would've been at the Fruit Stand, but that was still retail even though it's a tech company. I've learned a lot about working in a team, project design and management, problem solving, collaboration, etc. and I'm a ""people person,"" which are all wonderful traits that I'm proud to have developed.

So how exactly do I translate all this into my resume for software engineering internships? Does it go under ""skills"" or into my personal statement? And how exactly do I list my coursework vs. the personal projects I've done? For example, I've got formal study experience in C++ and Java, but I started learning Swift on my own and I'm going to learn Python next, probably some others too. Do I need to list all the math too, or is that just expected with my degree?

My resume as a ""retail worker"" is wonderful, but I feel like I'm starting all over brand new and I don't even know how to narrow down all my work experience so everything fits onto one page. I'm a little overwhelmed, and there's a lot of applications for internships coming up due. Any help is greatly appreciated. "

2 internships with relatively well-known companies 
Average gpa (&gt;3.5)

I consider myself at least average in my understanding of basic comp sci concepts (data structures, algorithms etc.)

Situation:

Recently I got a job offer from a well-known bank in Canada. The pay is average for the job and low (by around 10K) if compared to some pure-technology companies around that area. I still have the end of this year and next semester to go. But, being an international student and absolutely needing a job at the end of graduation, the stress of a job search might affect my studies (I think I can do &gt;&gt;3.7ish in these last two semesters to 'help' with graduate school).

I like the city where the job is and the job cannot be bad (application development), though it might get boring after a while. I am passionate about CS and freedom from this job seeking stress should give me the time to get some serious open-source dev experience (let's assume I succeed in creating a very busy and attractive github profile over approx. 2 years). I have good connections in the 'Big Four'. 

Should I accept the offer? I will of course fully commit to my responsibilities at the bank but how hard will it be for me to use this job as a springboard and transition to a great tech company (FB, GOOG, MC, AMZ) if I am confident about getting better?
I do not care much for the pay (health benefits and all are included in the offer) and am willing to do all that is necessary. "

I just a mail from my recruiter that we will be proceeding forward with the recruitment process.

Background: I am applying for an internship during the summer of 2016 in North American offices. I finished three technical interviews before getting to this stage.

Anyway, here are my questions (these are mostly questions I don't feel comfortable asking my recruiter -- they seem very needy and desperate, you know):

* How long does this typically take?
* Does this imply an offer in the future? What are the chances of getting rejected *after* getting to this stage?
* How much work does an intern actually do? As in how many features do they actually ship over the summer?
* What are the most commonly sought after projects?
* Which projects have the highest chance of getting selected as an intern? (I know this sounds like a stupid question, but this is not so that I will put that first. I'm asking just so to know the full picture).
* The most important question: I like Google Search. I don't know why I like it. Maybe it's because it's purely algorithmic, maybe because it's their biggest and most renowed project (which means it will be the most respected kind of stuff). But I like it the most. **What are the chances of getting selected as an intern in Search?**
* What are the most prestigious products in Google. I understand that there may not be such a thing, but what do you feel from the back of your head?

How can i improve?",coding_redditor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rq9ff/got_the_you_might_get_fired_talk_to_boss_how_can/,"I'm a new graduate that's been at my first job for a few months. I've had some internship XP.   Last week my boss pulled me in to his office for a talk about my performance so far. Said he wanted to know what he could do to, ""take me go the next level.""

So far I've been fixing bugs on  legacy system over a decade old. I'll admit that's it's been a hard transition for me. In my internships I never fixed bugs unless they were my own. Most of the time I was adding new features. Also, the current project is several times much larger than anything I've seen before. I get very lost in the code and it takes me a while to fix any thing since I spend so much time trying to figure how things work. 

I work with a senior dev and almost always during a code review, I miss some edge case, forget to test something, or my fix just isn't satisfactory for some reason. 

I will admit that I need to get better at thinking of all possible cases in my code. However, there's things that I feel that make it harder for me. There's no documentation, nor comments for the code. While I understand this may be common, there's also no one that understands the program 100%. 

If I get stuck on a problem, I go to other devs. Some times they are helpful. However,  a lot of times they simply cannot help since they dont know about the part of program I'm working on.  A lot of times I feel very helpless. 

In my meeting with my boss, I explained that I agree there are places I can improve. I also mentioned the things I struggled with (no doc, lack of suppler, etc). He said he'd try to find a way to help me.

It was my 2nd phone interview for web dev internship with this start-up company. My 1st phone interview was just behavioural, which went really well. The tech interview ended with ""Great... I'll keep in touch"" from a previously very enthusiastic interviewer. 


I choked. I blanked out hard. I've seen many posts about people blanking out on easy questions, and did not understand how that could happen; now I know the feeling by heart. I was really bummed because the interviewer was a super enthusiastic software engineer, and she seemed like someone who could be a great mentor for me. It was also an internship during the school year, which would've been a great stepping stone for a summer internship as well as a FT after grad.

What bums me out more is that the questions were easy: Given a number n, return an array of odd numbers less than or equal to n, and few others along the same difficulty level. I did a for loop with i++ for returning odd numbers, not i = i+2; it was bad. But it was my first technical interview and I've noticed few of my mistakes and thinking process that eventually led to my poor performance:

- Do not rush. The interviewer called me late and said it would be a shorter than usual interview. This subconsciously put me in a rushed mindset, which really affected my thinking process, and made me write careless code.
- Ask about everything that you are even slightly unsure about. As soon as I did not fully understand the question at first, my mind was racing just trying to comprehend, when I could've simply asked and used my brain power on actually solving the problem.
- Ask what kind of assumptions you can make (ex. if writing a function taking in an input integer, can we assume the integer is positve/within a certain range etc.), or say aloud what kind of assumptions you are making. In the middle of my writing, interviewer asked but what if the input was this? And I sorta just answered ""well I just assumed it would be this and that"" - Bad.
- Do not worry too much about the interviewer's reaction - focus on the problem. Every time my interviewer fell silent for more than few seconds, my mind was more focused on is she not speaking because I did something wrong? But really there is no reason for the interviewer to chime in every few seconds. The interview is about ME, my abilities, my thinking process when solving these problems. She was there to listen to my thoughts on solving technical problems, and I was just too busy trying to analyze what was going on in her thoughts.

Sorry about the long post. Wanted to vent and did not want anybody else to make the same mistakes as I did. There are probably many other better advices that the ones I've listed, but I've listed the ones that I thought brought me down in my interview. I was really disappointed in myself earlier today, but now I am using it as a unique learning experience. For those in a similar boat as me, let's keep up the hard work. It's going to be tough, but I believe that if we work hard, it is going to pay off one way or another. "

Like all interns, I do the jobs everyone hates; fetching coffee and tea, delivering mail, janitorial work, etc. The hours are long, the pay is nonexistent, and the people are rude. All that said, though, I’m learning a hell of a lot. I get to work with some species seen nowhere else.

The other night, I was mopping the floors. Since the Center is in the middle of the of the rainforest, quite a bit of mud gets tracked in by the researchers and employees. So, every night, usually well after midnight, I’m the last guy in the place until it’s all cleaned up. One of the final rooms I clean is where *Scolopendra gigantea* are housed. I hate that room. Despite my love of insects and bugs and spiders and all manner of other creepy-crawlies, giant centipedes scare the hell out of me. They shouldn’t be so big and aggressive; something about them seems out of place in a rainforest that otherwise appears to have an equilibrium among the species. Maybe I’m just a wimp. 

Anyway, giant centipedes are a major point of focus for the Center. Something about their venom potentially having anti-carcinogenic compounds. Because of that, we breed them. The room is pretty big; maybe 50’ by 75’ or something close. All the centipedes are housed in a system of stacked tanks. They’re accessed by opening a drawer, almost like a post office box. There are 10 rows of tables across and 15 going down with 2 containers on each table. Each container has 20 drawers, with every drawer containing one centipede. 

Whenever I go in there, I start to itch. It’s the sound that does it: tens of thousands of sharp little legs scratching on the metal surfaces of their enclosures. This time, the room was absolutely filthy. I was annoyed; it’s like these scientists want to make my tasks more difficult. I figured I’d have to get used to it, considering I was trying to get a job working with them. 

It was about halfway done with the room when my phone rang. I’d left it on the desk near the front of the room. What I shouldn’t have done was try to leap over the mop and bucket in the middle of the aisle because the floor was still slippery. But, of course, I didn’t know that right then. I jogged and tried to jump. As I planted my foot, it began to slide. Without thinking, I overcorrected badly, flailing my arms and legs to stay upright, and I crashed into one of the tables, landing on my back. The wooden front leg snapped off and the table fell on me, the other front leg buckling as it fell. 

I tried to lift the table off my thighs, but there was no way I was getting it off without help. I was thankful it didn’t seem to break any bones when it landed. Then I looked up and realized some of the drawers had slid open with the momentum of the table pitching forward and stopping so suddenly on my legs. ""Oh no,"" I choked.

The first one to venture out was dark red and maybe 8 inches long. I watched, breathless, as it skittered out of its drawer and hung by its rear two legs. The rest of its body squirmed through space, about 6 inches above my neck. Its pincers were massive compared to the size of its body. I mustered up my courage and slapped it away as hard as I could with my right hand. It sailed nearly 10 feet and hit the ground with a heavy clatter. I turned my head and watched it, hoping it was dead. When it didn’t move for a few seconds, I felt a tiny bit of relief.

It didn’t last. There were six more of them coming out of the drawers. I batted away two, but the other four landed on my neck and chest. The room was filled with the sounds of me shrieking and crying as I tried to get them off me or kill them or whatever came first. Another one landed on my chest. It was the biggest one I’d ever seen; easily 14 inches long and as fat as can of Red Bull. I sobbed as I was forced to grab it in my fist. It bit my hand over and over, causing the worst stinging sensation I’d ever experienced. I tried to throw it away, but its legs dug into my wrist and it went nowhere. It kept biting. 

As I felt one crawl under my shirt and bite my chest near my left nipple, I punched the area with the fist containing the huge centipede. The midsection of the big one burst against my shirt, killing the one underneath. Thick, orange slime coated my hand, shirt, and had splattered on my face. Now I was able to throw the remains of the big one away and slap and punch at the others until they, too, were dead.

The whole ordeal lasted maybe a minute and a half. Two minutes, tops. I sobbed on the floor and tried to nurse the bites on my hand, chest, and neck. The pain was exquisite - like the sting of ten hornets. After another five minutes, I was fairly certain that whatever was going to come out of the drawers had already been dealt with. Ten minutes after that, one started to crawl up my leg.

This time, there was nothing I could do. I tried to thrash my legs around as best I could, but they couldn’t move much with the table pinning my thighs. It wandered up and up. It only bit when I squeezed my legs together, hoping it could be crushed between my knees. No luck. Upward it went. Eventually, it found the warm, dark spot it had apparently been looking for. I felt its hard body and pointy legs scratching the underside of my testicles before I passed out.

When I woke up, I was in a bed in the Center’s infirmary. Apparently the venom from the centipedes is more toxic than I even knew; that’s why I’d passed out. My hand and neck are terribly swollen and the welt on my chest is the size of a golf ball. My thighs ache from having the table on them all night. They said I was lucky I didn’t develop compartment syndrome. Lucky. 

I happily took the valium they gave me as memories of the night before slowly came back and brought horrible anxiety with them. I stayed in bed for a couple hours, chatting idly with the pretty med student who was in charge of the infirmary that day. She was horrified by what happened to me. She couldn’t stop telling me how brave I was and that the people who found me were so worried I’d die. I nodded and jokingly asked what they said when they found the one in my pants. She looked puzzled. “We wanted to get the antivenin in you quick,” she said, “we didn’t take off any of your clothing.” As she spoke, I felt an inquisitive antennae brush the tip of my penis. It took her a full ten seconds to realize why I was screaming."

We all sit at a big table in an open space floor with other employees.



I try to talk to other people, but I always get the vibe like I'm not liked.
Some examples:

-Employees give special assignments to other interns, when we are all equally qualified

-The female interns are always getting the attention of other employees, esp the guys

-Boss likes a specific intern because she is good looking and of same race

-I'm usually left out of conversations or whatever talk is going on that day

-Other employees go the extra mile to talk to other interns excluding me 

-I think it's because I'm Asian honestly. People always seem to have trouble getting to a friendly level with Asian men. They'll be professional with me, but be way more friendly with others. The others are white or latino and so they vibe very well with a largely white and latino staff.

It really gets me angry cause I just sit there doing work and I feel like it doesn't matter if I made this company a million dollars in a day, because they prefer the socializers. In return, it affects my work, I don't even want to work there anymore honestly, although its a great opportunity for me, I've lost all vision. 



Honestly, I've done some self reflecting and realize this is a problem that I've dealt with all my life. The fear of being left out. I've always been the oddball kid that's been left out of groups and social stuff so I think this may be the reason why I am in the workplace. 



I do try to meet new people in the workplace... but honestly, I'm not on the same level of social ability like the rest of the interns. I find small talk very unimportant but I know you can literally talk your way up to CEO.



I just watch these people talk and talk and I just sit there thinking, ""Are you ever going to work?""



There's one intern who has been here for two weeks but is appreciated by everyone. I just assume she is liked cause she's a female. At least all the men do. 



TL;DR

-OP is interning at a job and wants to be hired

-OP struggles with the fact that other interns are getting more attention than him although he is equally as qualified. It is also because he is Asian, and Asians men tend to have a racial stereotype going against them.

-OP also struggles that the workplace is all about favoritism rather than work, therefore he doesn't want to work anymore knowing he probably won't get hired

-OP wants to know what he can do in a scenario where he is left out of everything and feels like he won't get hired

-OP is not happy and is usually frustrated at work

I applied for different summer internship roles at MS and I honestly don't know the one I'm being invited for. The Candidates form has options for SWE, PM and ""other"" which I need to rate. I'm more interested in User Experience design since that's what my class choice has been based on, however , I worry that putting that as first choice might hurt my chances. It did when I got contacted for a Google internship interview in my first year of uni. I didn't interview because the recruiter didn't find a team plus I told him I was not ready after looking at the problems in project Euler. I'm lost here. The title of the email was ""... Service Engineer"" so I'm kinda confused about that too. This will be my first technical interview even though I'm in my third year of university and will be graduating December 2016 instead of May 2017. I currently work in I.T support and haven't had any real programming experience in the real world apart from side projects. My department is a great department but I go to an unpopular school, University of Saskatchewan. I was wondering if anyone knows about the process for MS internship for Canadian Students.

I'm in my final semester as a Computer Engineering student. I'm on the job hunt and I have an interview lined up for an embedded engineer position. Without giving too much away, the company deals with satellite communications. I'd be working as part of a small (maybe around 5 people) group from what I understand.

The job description and location are right up my alley. I really want this position and my confidence level is high. Embedded systems is an area that I've excelled at in school and it comes more naturally to me than some of the other stuff that I've seen in my courses (I'm not too crazy about the nitty gritty EE systems/controls stuff).

My reason for this post is to try to gather recommendations from any guys/girls that have been in a similar position, or that are somewhat familiar with the typical hiring process for positions similar to this. There is a 90 minute block carved out for the interview and it'll be conducted by two of my potential coworkers. A few specific things I'm wondering are:

- typically, how much technical evaluation goes on during these interviews for entry-level positions? Like I said, I'm confident in my abilities but for some reason there's this daunting image of myself frozen in front of a whiteboard with a marker in my hand, clueless as to how to solve some incredibly complex question thrown at me. Can anyone confirm/deny this as a possibility? Are there any concepts/quiz-like questions that I should be certain to be familiar with to avoid raising a red flag in the interviewers' minds?

- I plan on bringing some of my ""champion"" coursework (maybe one in-depth project write-up and a certain grueling CSC homework assignment that I'm proud of) with me so that the interviewers have some of my work in their hands. Does this sound like a good idea? I wouldn't get fancy, probably just a sleek little folder to hold the assignments plus my resume and maybe an ""about me"" page? Any thoughts on this idea?

- I plan on asking a professor, my pastor/mentor, and/or my supervisor from when I was an intern at a local startup to provide the company with letters of recommendation. If all three were to say yes, would that be going too far?

If you've read this far, I thank you! I do not come from a family of engineers... I don't have anyone guiding me through this. So I just want to bounce my ideas off of some people that can offer advice based on their experiences."

College engineering senior. I did a summer internship after my junior year which led to a full time job with that same company. Only trick was that I had to sign the offer letter 1 month after school started.  Company is relatively known and the work is interesting however the only negative is that the work isn't my top choice but still a decent gig for someone to do out of college. Long story short I took the job. 

A few weeks later I get a phone call for a interview with much better position with a company that is better than then one I already accepted. The location is great and the work is much more fitted towards my interests. Most likely if get offered the position, they will offer more salary/pay as well.

Now here comes the question, since I already accepted and signed the offer letter from original company, can I or should I still interview with the other better company? And what happens if I get the position, can I accept it and turn down company A?

After graduating from college in May 2014, I moved to Paris in September and lived there until June of this year. I spent six years of my childhood in Paris and am very connected to my European roots since my entire family, besides my mom and brother, live there including my father. I love Europe and largely prefer it to the U.S. 

After getting back from Paris, this past summer, I started experiencing melancholy and had a strong desire to return. I've always wanted to get a business master's so I applied to three business schools and got into all the MBA programs for this fall. My parents were kind of tight on money and in the process of selling our house so they told me that I had to wait until that was settled before they could help me pay for school. For the record, they 100% support me and think getting a Master's is a great idea. 

Today my parents informed me that they finally found a buyer for our house and they will be able to help support me -- I understand some people do not have this luxury and I am extremely fortunate to have parents who are able to help me like this. 

This is my dilemma: I just got a good job this month at a very successful finance firm. All the people at work said that the way I got my job was very lucky. So I don't know if I should wait until next fall to start my program or if I should leave my job after 4-5 months for the spring program. 

For some it may be a no-brainer that I should save up money from my job and just go in the fall. But my problem is that being and living at home has been making me feel miserable. All my friends left my town to live in the city so I am pretty lonely most of the time. I don't know if I can handle this for another 9 or so months. 

On the other hand, maybe the reason that I had no job prior to November, has been making me feel like I've been depressed and miserable, and after I get into my routine, I will feel better about my situation. Also, if I start in the spring, there will be that awkward summer break. But then again, I could get some kind of internship to keep me occupied and make some money.

What should I do?"

I am 19 from Northwest Indiana (up by Chicago) where the market is pretty slim, but Ill be going to IUPUI Indianapolis in Fall 2016 after taking a gap year after high school. I have gathered information from /r/personalfinance on general loan/college stuff. I plan on working for 1-2 years in Indianapolis after college to capitalize on the network I'll build and to gain experience which I then plan to take to Seattle as my home base. For what its worth in usefulness, I am a 3.0 GPA HS student with a 27 ACT Score and a summer internship at a production factory as a general IT/Data management guy.

**Now thats out of the way:**

Im making a very very rough estimate that Ill be taking about 70k ish MAXIMUM in loans (before interests, but also before grants/scholarships) when everything is said and done to live and go to school for ~4 years. Ill be living in the city year round, and hopefully be taking summer classes as well (hence the ~, trying to graduate a bit early if possible). This is for a B.S. in Computer Science, with possibly a minor in Mathematics (concentration on Applied Mathematics/Stats OR Linear Algebra etc).

I know that the general rule of thumb is to not take more out in loans than I plan on making my first year in the workforce. My question is, given the job market in Indianapolis, am I digging myself into too much debt and/or expecting to make more than I will? Im justifying my decision to move and attend college in the city because of the network I'll be able to build living in a metro, and the opportunities (internships etc) I will be around that I normally wouldnt have going to college at home. Am I overreacting, or am I really taking a financial risk that I should try and avoid?

I wanted to keep this somewhat short, so if there is any other information to provide, feel free to ask and I shall give it.

Thanks in advance!"

I am in my last year of my computer science degree. I plan to do an internship before I graduate, and was wondering if anyone has any tips getting into an internship related to game development. Most of the stuff I read here relate to web dev stuff, which I cant see myself enjoying. What is required for game dev interns? How hard is it to get an internship as a gamedev?

I've already completed a course in 3D graphics, and advanced 3D graphics. I have experience with cryengine as well as unity engine. I developed a script for unity that generates a modular map. I developed an app using WPF for texture artists. I also developed some complex shaders for both GLSL and HLSL, such as a shader that converts a height map to a normal map, with options to control small, medium and large details. I also have a background as an artist, and have many years experience with photoshop, maya and zbrush. 

Is it a risky move to bet on getting into the game dev industry straight out of uni? Im worried if I cant find anything, I will have a tough time finding any non-gamedev cs positions since all my side projects relate to game dev. Should I learn some web dev or sql stuff just in case it doesnt work out?

3rwii6,3,2015-11-07,Anyone ever convert a Co-op Offer to an Internship?,Acidom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rwii6/anyone_ever_convert_a_coop_offer_to_an_internship/,"Hey, guys thank's for checking out my question.  I applied through my universities newly implemented co-op program and wound up getting offer. It's from a company that pays ~6 figures to their engineers according to glassdoor and it has decent reviews there as well. The company culture is a little bit more business like than I would like but nothing that is too much to handle (AKA not that startup like wear jeans and t shirt vibe). Also keep in mind this is in the NYC area, and the pay is ~20/hour (which is low compared to the offers I see around here,but then again I didn't go to the same school as Tony Stark). 

Apparently with this co-op it would be full time, which would prohibit me from attending school full time as well. For some background I am a MS student coming from a STEM undergrad. So my MS is more of a sandwiched BS+Mid to lower level MS classes sort of thing. I am also on track to graduate December of 2016. I am also ~26 years old, so not that young whipper snapper most MS students are. 

The problem is I'm debating the value of postponing graduation another 5 months for 3 Months extra experience. I previously had an internship just last summer, and have a return offer there. I am also confident in my ability to secure an even ""better"" internship this coming summer. So one thing that is for sure is I will land some place over the summer. The question really boils down how much more beneficial 10-11 months (Coop+Last Summers internship) worth of internship time is over  6-7 months of experience (Last summer+This coming summers internship).

While the compensation component is nice, in terms of buying new Xbox games, it doesn't reach that level of big boy pay that will get me paying off loans, apartment, etc. etc. So in the event this co-op is not worth delaying graduation and delaying big boy pay, has anyone ever heard of converting a co-op to summer internship. I know that they do this at this location, and it would be a definite upgrade over my last internship just in terms of commute. My commute last summer was ~1.5 hours each way, this would be 30 minutes each way. I also reckon that I must have impressed or done something correctly, because my last in person interview was yesterday and I got the offer this morning.

So I'd really like to hear any and all opinions you guys have. I've been using this forum religiously for a while, and have come to value the feedback I see here. Thanks for your time!

I didn't study very well for the first test and got a 60. I met with my professor, who is newer and seemed very helpful for a few hours. I felt somewhat prepared for this second test, covering related rates, differentials, first and second derivative test, linearization, Taylor polynomials and concavity. On the surface it didn't appear to be difficult (I am also in Calculus-based Physics). And after the test he said our grades are online and if we had been visiting him we might have done well. I thought that was me, and I did answer every question but I didn't get an answer for some of them. I now feel like a stupid person because I got a 47. The class average was a 60. I thought I got at least an 80.

I don't know what to do at this point. I am a sophomore and had plans on getting an internship over the summer, and this class and Physics do not seem to be working.

Edit: I guess I should also point out our homework is posted on WebAssign, and that I would wait until the night it was due to complete and usually not have time to finish because I underestimated how much work was involved, and as a result, get around 50% for my homework grade. In contrast, during the Calc 1 class I took last semester, my homework was hardcopy and I consistently had around a 90%.

The add/drop deadline is Monday, but I know I can do better..."
3rwqcc,13,2015-11-07,What other companies can I apply to if I study outside the US?,Hauzron,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rwqcc/what_other_companies_can_i_apply_to_if_i_study/,"Where can I find companies to apply to? Can someone make a list of big companies.

I have a unique situation that rules out a lot of companies. I'm a US citizen but I live and study in the UAE. The CS industry is totally different outside the US. Here in Dubai I got paid the equivalent of $600/month for my internship this summer. I want to intern back in the US during summer 2016 and work there full time when I graduate a semester later.

I don't think small no-name companies will bother relocating me for an internship. I assume the ""unicorns"" (Airbnb, Uber, Dropbox etc.) are really selective and only hire from top 20ish cs schools. I decided that big well-established companies (big-4 and other big names like Nvidia, Ebay etc.) *might* not care that I'm abroad. I've applied to the following so far.



* Airbnb
* Amazon
* Apple
* Box
* BrainTree
* Dropbox
* Ebay
* Epic Systems
* Facebook
* Fitbit
* FourSquare
* Google
* Jane Street
* LinkedIn
* McGraw Hill
* Microsoft
* MongoDb
* Nest
* Nvidia
* Palantir
* Qualcomm
* Quora
* Riot Games
* Square
* Uber
* Unity
* Venmo
* Zillow

Amazon sent my a questionnaire to fill out and then silence from them. Facebook actually responded in *under* 24 hours (probably a fluke) and gave me an interview which I failed. Nothing from the rest.

Back to my question. I've run out of companies. Can someone give me a list of big companies that would probably interview someone who is abroad?"

I went through the internship program at that same high school about 8 years ago, and ironically enough interned at the same place I am working today, so I think that's kind of a neat commonality we'll share.

I plan to meet with her in more of an interview format to judge wether her skills are in a place that I can be useful.  Assuming I take her on, what are some good resources for early programmers (in the web development field)?

The local company I have an offer with is in a niche market with a great outlook, and has a small development team that gives me the opportunity to make an big impact. I love the area and I'm in a position where I'd like to stay here for a few more years. However, would staying local significantly limit my career growth and future opportunities? Moving to the bay area or another tech hub is something I'm interested in at some point.

More background: I'm graduating from a decent state school in December with degrees in computer science and math. I have a high GPA and lots of good internship experience, including an internship at a one of the bigger tech firms.

Currently, I have a few offers at well known companies in the Bay Area and one in Seattle. The local offer has pretty good benefits and beats the others cost of living wise, so finances aren't factoring heavily into the decision. It's more about the ease of finding future opportunities and growing my career... from my understanding it's much easier to build a network in SV or Seattle."

How can I underline and point out that this wasn't just 3 summers? I'm thinking of putting ""Software Engineer Intern, (3 Full Years) July 2010 to July 2013 "" as the entry on my resume. For LinkedIn, it already lists the correct timespan, but I wonder if someone might just think I was combining three summer entries and trying to cheat.

Intended Major: Preferably CS, but CE if its too competitive.

Academics: By far my weakest part. As of right now (freshman+sophomore year), UW GPA is a 3.51. UC is a 3.9.

Scores: Just took ACT, but I am confident I can get a 34+ by the time its time to apply.

Have a pretty rigorous schedule:
9th: english 9, creative writing, religion (required all 4 years), health (1 semester), geography (1 semester), biology, honors algebra 2, honors latin 3.

10th: honors precalc, world literature, religion, APWH, honors physics, robotics, latin 4.

11th (this year): calc 1 at local cc, (calc 2 next semester). AP Physics C, AP english language, honors chemistry, religion.

Extracurriculars:
- Internship at very well known and respected software company. 
- Started not-very-successful company that has website and app in app store.
- Attended selective summer camp at same company I'm interning at^.
- President of school robotics club (really put a lot of time into this) that competes. Done all of high school so far.
- Vice-president of school physics club (grade 10, 11).
- Other IT certifications and insignificant clubs/JV xc

- I'm also applying for several prestigious programs this summer, and I am confident I can get accepted into at least one.

Now i need to write an application...",Scaz0r,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3s1dnx/help_i_study_mechanical_engineering_in_germany/,"Hello guys,

currently i study mechanical engineering in germany, at the Fachhochschule Südwestfalen in Iserlohn (University of applied sciences, as they call themselves). My major is [""Automotive""](https://www4.fh-swf.de/de/home/studieninteressierte/studienangebote/stg_is/automotive/index.php). After completing, i will have the degree Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.).
I am 25 years old and prior to the study, i completed an apprenticeship as a ""computer scientist"" (translated via dict.cc -&gt; sounds really important, wow.)

Currently i am in my 5th semester. The standard period of study is 6 semesters. So far it looks like i will be able to actually complete my study in 6 semesters, as there is only one exam i did not write (postponed..).
Also, in the 6th semester, there is a different scheduling. Normally, one half of the exams would be around july and the second half in september. For the 6th semester, the exams will already be in july. This is so that one has the opportunity to go abroad or do an internship inlands.

Now that i want to improve with my english, i definitely want to got abroad! Reading and hearing english is not that big of a problem. No matter if video games or repair manuals for motorcycles, i couldn't (and didn't want to) escape english. Also it is not a problem to watch movies in english and still understand the movie.
Writing though is sometimes tricky. You can express yourself very ""detailed"". It's hard to describe, but everytime i think about it, the Quote from dead poets society comes into my mind: ""Avoid using the word ‘very’ because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don’t use very sad, use morose."" I just love the english language. 
My vocabulary could be better though.

This year, i was invited to a ""career day"" at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt by Kirchhoff Automotive. It was really great - i ended up talking to the personnel manager about if they offer to take a semester abroad. Normally they do only for their own, internal students. She said I should send her an email regarding this.
Because this was the first time they were organizing this ""career day"" for students (we got to meet the CEO and have a chat with him, walk around the IAA and see which manufacturers use parts of kirchhoff and also we had a ""speed dating"" with for example one student of kirchhoff aswell as someone from the engineering department and other departments), she also asked if I could give her a bit of feedback about it all.
It seems like the feedback I gave was impressive, because i was given the contact details for the person who is in charge of the whole ""semester abroad"" thing in Kirchhoff. So i mailed him and got a phone call a week or so later. I should write an application, CV and hand in my school certificates.

This is it, this is my chance!

So i don't want to screw up!
I have never written an application in english. In german, yes, for example for my apprenticeship or a job. But never in english.

I am now a little bit worried. I do not have a specific country i absolutely HAVE to visit, although for example the US or UK would be nice. But I bet there are differences in how an application or a cv should look like - in the US or in the UK.
How do i write it now? And what are the differences?

Also, i wanted to kindly ask if anyone would be so nice and proofread my application once i have written it.

ANY tips, even not specifically regarding the application, are well welcome!
This is a huge step and opportunity for me and i am very excited :)"

Bit of background:
I've been working for a pretty big company in the LA area as an intern (graduated in May) for the past 6 months and it's been going alright so far, but that's coming to an end soon and I need to make a decision about whether or not to stay with the company.

They're offering to bring me on as a contractor (hourly wage, with paid OT but no benefits), but I think the pay is pretty low for the area ($50k/yr) and the technology is really, really old so I'm worried that accepting this offer might not be the best for me.

I don't have many other friends working in this area with full time positions so I don't really know who to ask about this. It seems to me that while accepting this offer does provide me with a job, the pay is a lot less than what a starting dev makes in the area and there aren't any benefits. The stack they're working with is so outdated that I honestly don't even know if it'd be worth putting on my resume and if I wanted to work longer here I'm not really guaranteed a position since I'd be a contractor. I've also been tasked with working on a different part of the application than what I had wanted to work on (front end instead of back) so it's a little disheartening because the work doesn't involve the language I'm most comfortable in / wanted to work with.

Unfortunately, I haven't been looking for other jobs yet since I thought the offer would be different (full time, not contracted, etc.) so I don't really have any other options out there. Luckily, I don't have to really worry about rent for a while since I have more than enough in savings and can definitely spend some time brushing up on some things for interviews, but I'm not sure how long it would take to find a better job out there and I'm worried about being presented with a similar offer elsewhere.

Is this the norm for a relatively recent graduate or does it seem like I'm being taken advantage of since I'm a recent grad? Should I just stay for a year and move on or would it be worth it to just find a better job now? Any guidance would really be appreciated."

Quick background. I [21M] was diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed vyvanse going into my freshman year of college (I am now a junior). I started off at 20mg, and got upped 10mg every month until I hit 90mg. My time on vyvanse was easily the most productive time in my life. It was the first time I truly succeeded in school, and my confidence was at an all-time high (not because of the drug, but because of my successes while on the drug). I am a very anxious person, and vyvanse really helped manage those symptoms, as well. 



The problem was that my tolerance built up very quickly and I started craving more and more. I would routinely double dose, and by the end of my freshman year I had a prescription for 90mg. There were days when I would take as much as 120mg, and once or twice I even took 140mg. I was addicted to being productive. I am a perfectionist to the highest degree, and as cliche as it sounds, it is definitely my biggest weakness and strength. 



On vyvanse, I was able to achieve perfection in the classroom, and socially. But I became so absorbed in my school work, and I became a workaholic and spent hours on end on the library, perfecting my craft. I was so immersed in getting things done that I completely lost touch with those around me. 


I didn't realize the toll that this drug was taking on my relationships. I grew distant from my girlfriend of 4 years when she needed me the most (her mother was sick with cancer), and I essentially shut her off. It is hard to describe. I was never a dick to her in the traditional sense; even on the drug I treated her with the utmost respect. I just didn't give her my all. I didn't give her my time.


She went to school in PA, and I was/am in MA. Our phone calls grew shorter, and when I was on the drug, I became extremely irritable and wanted to end the call as fast as possible because I felt that it was wasting my time. Mid conversation I would freeze up and literally be silent. I don't know what it was, but the vyvanse literally made a zombie.


As my dosage grew higher, I began isolating myself from not only my gf, but from my friends as well. I stopped going to class, I made excuses to miss lacrosse practice (I play big time Division I lacrosse), I stopped going out at night, and I became incessantly paranoid. I would spent hours, absolutely fixated on meaningless little details. Looking back I definitely think that I was in a state of stimulant induced psychosis for a couple weeks. 


The craziest part though, was that I didn't realize that I was doing anything wrong when I was on the damn drug. Vyvanse made me a ""bad"" person, and completely changed who I was. All the while, I didn't give a flying fuck. 


The worst part was that I didn't even tell my gf that I got a prescription. I knew that she was against stimulant medications, so I kept this a secret from her. So she watched me change into an absolute blood sucking monster, and she had no idea why. She thought that it was something that she was doing, she blamed herself for me growing so distant from her. Little did she know that I was addicted to my meds, and was abusing them terribly. 


I continued to take vyvanse a few times per week over the summer, and then resumed full time once sophomore year started. She ended up breaking up with me at the start of the school year. At that point I was taking 90mg+ per day. After 4 years together, she told me that she couldn't do this any more.


I was abusing her emotionally, I blocked her out of my life. She had no idea why I was acting like this, and why I had seemingly changed for no reason. Being that I was completely blind to the unravelling of our relationship, I went into absolute shock when she ended things. I used to be her knight in shining armor, I would protect her from absolutely anything. I would never let anyone hurt her; I got sick to my stomach when I realized that I was the one that was hurting her. I couldn't even protect her from myself. 


It really hit home when she told me that she noticed all of these negative qualities emerge in me over the ""past year"", literally to the day that I started taking vyvanse. I spiraled into a state of severe depression, but I stayed on the drug. Second worst decision in my life, after starting vyvanse in the first place. That really fucked with my emotions because I was dosed so high that I would be ""happy"" while on the drug, but suicidal when off it. It was vicious. I was delusional. 


After she broke up with me I literally went from the highest - albeit, delusional - high, to the lowest low. My confidence was stripped from me. I lost the love of my life. 


I literally shut down. I was lost. I tried to quit the drug, but I couldn't. I ended up going weeks at a time without taking it, but I would sleep 20 hours per day and miss all of my classes. I literally missed every single one of my classes for an entire month at one point. I kept falling back on the drug though, and I was still able to salvage good grades. 


Spring semester rolled along and I was slowly recovering, and slowly trying to wean myself off the drug. I was still a total emotional disaster and there continued to be times when I would abuse the shit out of the drug if I fell into a bad depressive state. 


My grades went to absolute shit that semester. I went from a 4.0 freshman year, to a 2.1 sophomore year. Even when I would fall back on the drug, I wouldn't use it to get work done. I would literally just take it so I wouldn't be depressed for a little while. 


This past June (June 5, 2015 to be exact), I popped a pill before going to my summer internship, and it was the last time I touched the drug. Driving home that evening, I honestly saw my life flash before my eyes.


I realized that my use of this drug was entirely unsustainable, and that I would drive myself to my death if I continued. I did not trust myself to take this drug any longer. It was right then that I fully realized the effect that vyvanse had on changing who I was. I was going through some old pictures, some old love notes, some old memories, and I didn't even recognize myself. 


I used to be a happy kid, with high ambitions and a thirst for genuine success. I used to love a girl, and I would do anything to make her happy. I used to be innocent, happy, and mentally tough. I had consistency in my life. I had purpose in my life. I wasn't perfect, but looking back, I was in an amazing place. 


I looked in a mirror that night and saw a cold, soulless ghoul - a slave to vyvanse. I was terrified at the person I became. I vowed right then and there to never take the drug ever again. I quit cold turkey and haven't touched it since. I wanted to go back to who I was, and at that moment I realized I had to make a choice: I could either quit now, or forever regret it. This was my last chance at salvation.


I am now in my Junior year, and I am finally stable again, but I am struggling immensely in the classroom. I am clinically diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel if I start vyvanse again, even once, I will go back to square one. I still don't trust myself to take it, but I feel like I truly need it or else I will not graduate. I don't know what to do.



TL:DR: I was blinded by productivity, I was a slave to vyvanse. It changed who I was, and made me lose everything I had. 6 months sober, and I feel like I need it again. Getting prescribed vyvanse is my single biggest regret. 


2 options in my eyes. I feel like it is a lose-lose scenario for me. 


1. Stay strong, don't take it, struggle through school and fuck up my future.


2. Take vyvanse, do well in school, set myself up for a ""good future"" and career, and risk being miserable and falling into the same trap once again

Taking the semester off will have no adverse affect on my school. It is almost better for me to take off the semester because I will be in phase with the school calendar, which means I don't have to do course scheduling gymnastics and living arrangements are a lot simpler with less moving.

I'm basically considering taking a semester off for myself. My goal is to work on a personal project that I am passionate about and improve my comp-sci fundamentals. I also want to work on myself and improve my public speaking, among other things. Assume that I can do these things and have the self-discipline to do them.

My graduation date will be extended by a total of 2 years (4 semesters) as opposed to 3 semesters (2 doing internships, and 1 due to a reduced course load for a couple years).

Would taking longer to graduate in general affect my employability?

I always thought that having the degree would boost your options to work in research, not necessarily in academia. However, after many years of studying (my bachelor's was a 5-year program), study internships and a post-bac program, I feel burnt out of taking classes. Not only that, in written examinations, I am feeling very anxious, something that never happened to me before even in similar situations. Now I know I won't be taking classes forever, but I haven't been happy with my previous rotations as well. All three labs I've seen have great people and great research, I just don't feel engaged in working on a project for 5 years. I enjoy doing the technical work, running experiments, but I have some difficulty in developing ideas, hypothesis or digging around previous publications to explain my work. 

Socially, I haven't gone out much. My entering class is great, although not very social outside the classroom. My girlfriend lives 10 hours away, which is quite a strain in the relationship but we are doing our best to work it out.

I honestly don't know if it's just stress or if its something more than that. I feel ready to head out immediately, pursue a job close to my girlfriend and pursue another route. Maybe an MBA, while working in a lab or in a biotech company?

3s5xcd,6,2015-11-09,The Grove,CitedFTP,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3s5xcd/the_grove/,"My dog, Misha, loves to take walks. I adopted her a few years ago and after my internship in the city finally ended, I was able to take her and myself out of our cramped apartment and into a small hamlet in the upstate Maine. 



I ended up purchasing a small home on the outskirts of town, not needing to be close to the school or market. The privacy had made the cost of buying a bit steep, but working from home would be much easier without the constant hustle and distraction of urban life. Misha immediately took a liking to the yard and surrounding forest, spending hours running and playing in the greenery. I tried taking her into town to meet other dogs at the small dog park, but she grew anxious being away from the cottage. 



As the summer grew hotter, she began leaving for longer day trips under the shady canopy, returning at dusk and late hours at night. I began simply leaving the door ajar and finding her exhausted in the kitchen when I woke in the morning. 
As the days turned grayer and fall encroached on our paradise, Misha began to bring back “gifts”. The occasional dead squirrel or oddly shaped tree root was expected, but these items soon divulged into the obscure. Discarded, unreadable foreign magazines covered in dirt. Toy soldiers and cars, seemingly exhumed from the forest floor. A rusted spyglass, which, when I brought to a local historian, was estimated to have been dated to the Revolutionary War.



My curiosity grew, and I decided to go her on one of my days off. When she embarked after breakfast like she always did, she seemed more solemn than usual, yet still happy to accompany me through her daily routine. The path she took behind my house seemed overgrown and unblazed, despite her constant daily trips down it. Vines and roots grabbed at my ankles as I walked. We passed a variety of trees, changing color in the autumn time, a family of deer, and a gorgeous brook that decided to flow out of nowhere.  As we reached the heart of the woods, Misha suddenly darted over a hillside. I shouted after her as she disappeared over the steep cliff, but she didn't look back. I ran forward,slipping and tumbling over the edge. 




I awoke minutes later, covered in dead leaves and dirt. My body ached and my wrist felt sprained. I adjusted my glasses, thankfully unbroken, and gazed at the dip Misha had led us too. 


The glen was covered in a deep, lush moss that seemed to stretch up to my knees as I stood up. Before me, a house lay in the center of the grove. The home was covered in layer of vines, yet the brick gleamed strong and bright underneath. I heard barking from inside. I walked slowly towards the place, trying not to move my legs at any strange angles. Moving became harder and harder, and I felt the moss growing in height. A hand brushed my leg. I looked down, and a gleaming white skull peered back up at me. I let out a yell and tried to jump away, but the moss and vines grew tighter, restricting my movement. I looked around frantically. Other body parts stuck out across the tops of the greenery: a single leg a few yards to the left, a torso turned upside down around 20 feet ahead. The vines around my left leg grew tighter, stinging and cutting. 


The door of the cabin opened, and my dog walked out. Misha gazed at me from across the grove, with an almost bored look. I blacked out from the pain.


I awoke again, back at my bed. My leg was stinging and blackened. My back ached, almost like Misha had dragged me back from our trip. I heard my kitchen door creak open and my dog, my normal, happy dog, approached me. She licked my hand and nuzzled against me, jumping on the bed. I was unsure of what to do so I started instinctively petting her. She hopped off the bed and looked at me from in the kitchen as if to say, 
“Why don't we take another walk?”.


Weeks later and I still have Misha. The number of gifts have increased steadily, her finding rare and valuable ores and treasures from lost eras. She brought back a familiar set of keys just the other day, a pair I had lost at the grove. I'm considering returning.

I need some advice. Three years ago I graduated from a top university with an English degree. For various reasons I won’t get into, I decided to go back to school for CS, got into an awesome second-degree program at a school with a great CS department and will be graduating in December. My experience has made me genuinely fascinated with CS/software development, and I feel extremely lucky to have found work I’m so excited about. 

Here’s my problem: because of the accelerated nature of this program (I’ve taken courses straight through the last 24 months, summers included) I haven’t sought an internship. My attitude coming into this degree was “I’ll immerse myself in the degree, do the best I can and worry about employment later.” Since I was going BACK to school I just wanted to get it done (there were other factors as well). I now feel taking summer courses instead of finding an internship to finish faster was a big mistake. 

I’ve done fairly well (3.3ish) in my classes (I prioritized projects in some cases). I have a few pretty hefty projects (school and personal) under my belt, including one in which I was PM for a team of students working for a real client, which I still actively maintain. 

I feel highly anxious because I’ll be graduating with no internship experience to speak of. So if you were in my position:

	1. have decent (but not stellar) grades
	2. have some significant projects 
	3. have no internship experience 

What would be your next move? Seek a full-time position? Delay grad and find a internship (although this doesn’t really seem like an option for me)? Something else? Should I present myself in a certain way on my resume? Target smaller companies?

Any other general advice for how to get a first position w/o internship experience?

 I should also note that I’m working hard to prep for interviews (CTCI, Cormen, etc), and that I don’t have to find a job immediately because I can live with my parents (near SF) after grad for a few months if need be. 

Thanks, any advice is appreciated. And sorry for the wall of text. 

TL;DR graduating with decent grades, some significant projects but no internship. Advice on getting a first job?

EDIT: to clarify, I'm primarily interested in backend web development positions"

And for a second, I forgot what I was doing. I was looking at page... two? ...and I was reaching for something. Oh, right, my eraser. My eraser. ...where's my eraser? My pencil's eraser had worn down long ago, so I brought one of those hi-polymer erasers in, and now I couldn't find it. I felt the panic coming on once again, but then I realized I felt somewhat... relieved. I was going to fail this exam. Without my eraser, I had no chance, but even with it the odds were abysmal. I accepted this, and moved on. With limited space to write, checking my work was pointless, so I slowly worked through the rest of the exam, knowing full well that I'd made countless errors along the way.

Or so I thought. Ironically, losing my eraser was the best thing that could have happened to me. Although I got the first problem wrong in its entirety, I did remarkably well on the rest of the exam. In retrospect, it seemed obvious. My anxiety kept me from thinking straight at first, but once I'd resigned myself to my fate, I was able to reason more clearly.

This would have been a good life lesson, but it was far from a new realization. I'd suffered crippling anxiety for the better part of the last decade, and I was fully aware of how much of a hindrance it could be. Losing my eraser was just a lucky break that serendipitously helped me not crash and burn for once. Convenient, but rare.

Until it happened again. About a week later, I had an interview for an internship with a pharmaceutical company. Sitting in the reception area, I was a wreck. The sweat on my forehead was matched only by the moisture soaked through my shirt. I heard a door open down the hall, and a few seconds later, my name called.

""Phillip?""

I had to respond. I had to.

""Uh, yea! That's me. I'm Phillip.""

I reached out to shake his hand, and he did the same. Much to my dismay, he noticed my sorry state almost immediately.

""Are you alright? Can I get you some water or something?""

I didn't know what to say. I opened my mouth to speak, but I had no words in mind...

...and then my mouth was closed again. I was sitting in a nice office. My clothes still felt uncomfortably damp, but my skin was cool. The same man who'd reached out to greet me moments before was sitting across a large rectangular desk, and he was laughing. Hysterically. He had tears in his eyes and gasped for breath.

""Ohhhhaha! Ha! Ha. Heh... oh man. I can't believe it. I can't believe that was you! These past eight months, I've been telling that story to everyone I know, and the guy who did it is sitting right in front of me!""

I was at a complete loss for words, but the same nervousness that ruined my clothing also kept my mouth shut. Thankfully, the man kept talking on his own.

""You know, I'm really glad you came in for this interview. You have no idea. Well, I have to get going for another meeting, but I'll definitely be in touch. You'll hear from us sometime next week regarding the internship.""

He extended his hand, and I shook it as confidently as I knew how.

""Sounds good. I'll get going then.""

By the time I'd returned to my car, I'd found myself even more confused than I was in the office. Although this incident was of an entirely different scale, it didn't take long to connect it to my missing eraser the week before. Both occasions were branded by a unique sort of bewilderment that I'd never felt before in my life. More importantly, both times my anxiety had given way to a blackout that miraculously solved my problems. Was this some sort of trick? Was I on some messed up reality show? In the end, I had no answers. I drove home and spent the rest of the afternoon in bed before turning in for the night.

Over the next several weeks, I slowly lost more and more of my time to the blackouts. I lapsed my way through phone calls, classes, and social gatherings. I got the internship, as I'd come to expect. Annoying as these episodes were, they certainly seemed to bring results. By week six, my lapses had seemingly begun to coordinate with each other. I went to introduce myself to a girl in my statistics class, only to black out through the entire conversation. Then, two days later, I found myself driving her home from what I learned was a movie, evidenced by the ticket stub in my pocket. The only times I was guaranteed to be conscious were when I first woke up in the morning and when I went to bed. My bedroom began to feel almost like a jail cell, as I perceived myself spending a disproportionate amount of time at home in my room. Every time I left, I risked losing more hours of my life.

Eventually, I found myself spending the majority of my lucid hours piecing together my past. I was, apparently, quite successful these days. My grades were high, and my social life was booming. Judging from my bank account, I was doing very well for myself. Judging from the pictures my (assumed) girlfriend was sending me, I was definitely getting laid. Not that I could enjoy any of it. I was lucky if I could even step outside my apartment without finding myself right back in bed, six hours later.

I got married. It wasn't the same girl; it was one of her friends. I didn't even know her, but we had a wedding and it was apparently very nice. By this point I was sometimes losing entire days. I would, very rarely, have the occasion to actually speak with her. The first time I ""met"" her, she immediately asked me if I was alright. Apparently the real me didn't carry himself the same way as the... other... me. By the fourth time I'd gotten to speak with her, she'd learned to immediately recognize my change in demeanor. When the real me would poke through, she'd get worried. What a joke. To her, that impostor was real, and I was some sort of mental condition.

One night, after a long day of unconsciousness, I found myself in my house's kitchen. The house was completely silent. I realized very quickly that I was heavily intoxicated. That was fine, though; intoxicated me was better than no me. That was when I had the greatest idea of my entire life. It was such a good idea that it couldn't fail. I stumbled over to the knife rack and drew out the cimeter. I could feel the alcohol in my system buying me extra time as I fumbled with the blade to point it at my throat. I didn't know how long I had. I started to push it in. The pain was surprisingly easy to bear, knowing that this was all about to come to an end...

...and then I was lying in an ambulance...

...then in a hospital bed...

...then hooked up to machines...

...then in an ambulance again...

...and finally, in a nice room that was not my own, with a nurse sitting by the doorway.

My family visited me once in the ward. That was when I learned, in the forty seconds I had before the other me took over, that I had three children—one baby boy and two little girls, aged three and six. When I didn't recognize them, the middle one teared up a little in frustration. She thought I was pretending to forget about her, and she wanted me to stop. She was a completely stranger to me, but my heart broke just the same. I don't know what the other me said to them afterwards, but they never came again.

In my hatred of the other me, I used my time awake to claw and tear at my skin. The more bite marks and gashes, the better. I relished the idea of him waking up and discovering the bloody little presents I'd left him. But this didn't last long, as one morning I woke up to find myself restrained in my bed. The person sharing my body may not have liked it, but the hospital liked it even less.

But then, my other self played his trump card. With every semblance of my life taken away from both of us, he did the one thing that I was never allowed to do: he disappeared. The full days suddenly felt like eternities compared to the mere minutes I was afforded before. And every day was the same, spent in isolation or restraints.

He never showed up again… except for once. For a brief time, I'd convinced the staff that I was sane enough to be given some freedom. For four days, I was allowed to roam the facility for the first time in my conscious life. I was eating some soup with a spoon...

…and then I was in a stretcher. There were several people around me, arguing in an angry and panicked tone. The room was pitch black. As my disorientation faded, I felt an aching in my forehead, slowly intensifying. A minute later, I was screaming in agony. I tried to lift my arms to my face, but I was restrained once again. I felt thick, sticky tears trickling down my face. Something was wrong with me eyes. I strained myself to see beyond the darkness, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t see. My eyes. The impostor; the parasite; the me that was not me… it gouged out my eyes...

The first time it happened, I lost my eraser. The last time it happened, I lost everything else."

Basically I'm in 2nd year of a Computer Systems degree, the previous summer I got pretty lucky and managed to get an internship in a small app development company and loved every bit of it. Problem is now that I'm back in college I find it uninspiring and honestly quite stressful, so I'm actually a little torn. I have 8 months guaranteed work in the same place starting next June so I know they are happy to take me back, so I'm thinking of explaining my situation and asking for a long term position and delaying/dropping out of my current course.

Honestly even though I'm only an intern (but still doing ""big"" stuff, like getting individual apps to develop) it's pretty much my dream job so I'm happy to work there as long as they'll have me. My only worry is that after a few years if I get bored (unlikely, but still a possibility) or for some reason I get laid off, I'm unsure what my prospects of getting another job without a degree would be, even if I would have a few years experience in a workplace. 

Sorry for the filler, just wanted to give some context. My question is should I go for the internship or stick with a course I'm not too happy with and look for work after? Any advice or relevant experiences would be a huge help because I'm not too sure on this one.  "

We started out using UFT(QTP) and VBS which was incredibly boring and miserable, but in the past 6 months we've made the jump to Selenium and Java. I like it much more and I've since learned a lot and become a far better programmer. This would be fine, but automation at this company has essentially no structure. 

There's never been any senior automation engineers on our team to help guide us through best practices and me and the guys on my team (fellow interns and recent grads) have had to figure everything out ourselves, which I both love and hate. I've done a lot of footwork trying to research and implement best practices and design patterns on this team, and I'm always trying to take the lead on things. People on the team don't seem to mind this and often come to me when they need help. I feel more confident, we get to make all the design decisions which keeps us flowing and getting a lot of work done, but I've always wanted a mentor or at the very least somebody with more experience than me who has a clue what's going on. 

I graduated in August this year and was hired to be a full time contractor (to-hire) in October, my title is now Software Development Engineer in Test. This is honestly a good job, I'm making 63K in Florida and my internship was my only prior experience in the field. What's bothering me is I feel like I'm rapidly reaching my skill peak for what I can learn at this place. It doesn't get much more complex than Selenium, Java, TestNG, and Jenkins. I'm constantly applying to both software engineering, and software testing jobs, but I only ever get any callbacks for testing jobs.

When I was in school I put all my electives into AI, game development, and robotics, and I loved every moment of it. I know some of that stuff is really going to require a masters, and I'm willing to do that, or to work my way up through some lesser jobs to do what I really want, but I just can't seem to get anyone interested in me for anything but testing. Now I don't hate testing, but I feel like I'm hurting my career, and I want to pick up as many skills as possible. There are many companies I would keep doing testing for, but I just feel stuck right now and I'd like a change.

If anyone has found themselves in a similar situation, has advice, or just wants to tell me to chill out, I'm all ears. 

TL;DR I feel like I'm stuck being perceived as automated test engineer rather than a candidate for software engineering jobs. Help me or tell me to shut up. "

I took the 70-410 and a question threw me for a loop. It was basically ""You have a user named Admin1 and you want to limit him to create no more than 100 objects in a domain. How do you do this?"" It's been almost a month, and I still cannot find a utility, either in the delegation wizard or in the command line utilities or in Powershell, that will allow you to limit the number of objects someone can create. I see limits for type, limits for location, but not number. 


This is actually starting to bug me a little, not least of which because we may have some interns coming on over the next few months and this might be the perfect type of thing to apply to their accounts. I'm almost wondering if it is some kind of trick, like ""you grant the admin rights over only one OU that you can limit to 100 objects"" but I just can't crack it. Any help?"
3s7adz,9,2015-11-09,Experienced developer looking for advice to stop a dry spell of job searching.,throwies11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3s7adz/experienced_developer_looking_for_advice_to_stop/,"I've been a Chicago resident for most of my life, and have been at several jobs in Chicagoland as a software engineer. I have no formal CS education- my bachelor's degree is from an unrelated major (New Media at UIC). I've been a developer since 2007 and consider myself mid-level.

But I have been laid off last November due to company budget cuts and I'm facing a dry spell for jobs, unemployed ever since. I'd like some advice on what else I can do in looking for software developer jobs.

Here are the things I've already tried since January. I'll try to go into as much detail as possible:

**Recruiting agencies I've contacted:** JobSpring, Robert Half, Workbridge, Talener, Ashley Ellis, Volt, Aquent. I've been to some of their offices. These are the big ones in Chicago.

Usually the first job that recruiters talk to me about, I go on-site discuss more details about my work history, they get in touch with the company, I may or may not get an interview. Either way, no offer was made. After that, I get put in a holding pattern in waiting for another job opportunity. I feel like I have to constantly ""poke"" them to remind them that I am still looking for work.

**Job sites I've been applying to:** LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, Hired.com, Built In Chicago, 1871, Stack Overflow Careers, We Work Remotely.

Built In Chicago and 1871 are geared towards local startups. 1871 is an incubator for them, and also have job listings. For these websites, no companies have responded to my applications, other than generally saying ""we will move forward with other candidates"".

I have attempted to apply to the companies at 1871 three times. I go several times weekly apply at the other sites. Hired.com works differently- You send them your resume and other information and then they look for jobs that could be a fit for you. I did this twice and both times they told me the marketplace doesn't yet have enough of the right opportunities for me.

**Meetups.** I also go to some programmer meetups when I can, though I admit it's not very frequent. This year I've only went to three. I exchange contact information with some people who work at companies where they might be hiring. I've almost gotten close to an interview at one but they went on a hiring freeze. Meetups sound like a great way to connect with others, but it sounds like I'll be playing a long ball game when it comes to finding work.

**Friends.** Unfortunately I know very few people who work in the tech/software field and nearly all of them don't know of anyone who is hiring. The closest I have gotten to a job was from one of them, she introduced me to a friend of hers who runs a web shop startup. I went to two interviews with her company. She followed up with an email saying their tech lead will send me a technical test shortly. It never showed up, a week later I asked about it and she said that they don't consider me a good fit with my experience.

**Internships:** Is it even possible to get one when you're out of school? I know unemployment gaps can look bad on your resume. I only consider internships as a way to pad my resume with some kind of work.

The well seems to be drying up for other ways to find work as a web software developer. I am not sure what else I can do to expedite the process and hopefully start working before the end of the year. So suggestions on what I can do make myself more marketable for a developer in Chicago are welcome."
3s7cwg,274,2015-11-09,All of my exes are crazy. All of them.,thehappyhoopoe,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3s7cwg/all_of_my_exes_are_crazy_all_of_them/,"As far as luck in the love department goes, things for me have been...poor, to say the least. I have no idea why, but the only men I seem to attract are crazy. And I don't mean ""quirky"" crazy. I mean ""nuttier than chipmunk shit"" crazy. It's like I'm wearing an invisible advertisement on my forehead that can only be read by degenerates. It must read something like:

""Are you a felon? A control freak? A psychopath looking for a trophy girlfriend? Got an Oedipus complex and looking for mommy's spitting image so you can relieve your impotent male rage? Well then Shireen here is your girl! Apply today!""

There was Frank from high school who got mad because I wouldn't go to second base with him, got even madder when I broke things off and then stalked me until finally both of my brothers beat him up for having the nerve to show up at the house. Then there was Lyle from my college days, the one who tried to get me to move in with him after just three months of dating and started leaving bouquets of dead flowers atop angry messages written in red chalk on the sidewalk outside my dorm when I kicked him to the curb. Then there was Todd from my internship at E--- Magazine. We went out to dinner  exactly once, and had twenty minutes of heavenly, perfectly normal conversation before he segued into a long, rambling rant about how his mother was a whiny, selfish, lazy, wishy-washy, filthy, no-good, no-account, all around disreputable slag--but boy was she a lovely-looking lady, and didn't I just favor her so much with that flower in my hair... 

Yeah, bye. 

I wondered what I was doing wrong. What kind of signals was I giving out? My older sisters are settled down with good men and one is expecting her first baby in January. My brothers are both in healthy  long-term relationship with smart, nice, funny women. Was I just born under a poor star? Did my great-grandmother cock-block a thirsty witch who, in cruel revenge, cursed the maternal line so that the third daughter of the third daughter would be fated to die alone or be done in by some loon with crossed wires? I don't know. But I *do* know that it doesn't surprise anyone when I write that I am currently single. My sole companion and best friend in life is my dog Latte, the only good thing to come out of yet another dysfunctional grab at love. My apartment building doesn't allow pets, so I had to train him to be quiet. It was easy. He's such a good boy. But while he's a big sweetie,  I've trained him to attack any one who enters the premises without me. The last one, the one who left me Latte, broke in, you see and--

Well. Enough of that.  A few weeks ago I met another promising candidate who we'll call Glenn. We met at a mutual friend's birthday party. Said friend believed that she could thwart fate if I had no hand in the selection process and allowed myself to be set up. To my surprise it seemed to work. Glenn was was nice, clean, smart. Didn't drink (I've dealt with my fair share of lushes in the past, so that was a BIG plus.) And I couldn't lie: the man had looks that made my eyes pop. I couldn't find anything about him that set off any red flags. He asked me out. I accepted. I was happy. Everything was great.

Of course, it lasted for about all of five months before the situation degenerated. 

Glenn started showing up at places I didn't expect him; at a private lunch with friends, at my job  ""just to say hello,"" at the park when I went for a jog, at the library when I wanted to return a book. Once, when my car gave out on a trip to visit my mother, his car suddenly materialized behind me and he jumped eagerly out of the drivers seat, jumper cables in hand. This was all very suspicious, and I was already calculating ways to let him go as gently as I could. But gentle never works with some people. I said I was done, he heard ""let's take a break,"" and continued to send flirty text messages asking me out on ""not-dates"" even though I made it a point to ignore him.

He lost his mind completely when I took a trip to the Bahamas with some friends. I couldn't enjoy myself. I kept my phone on so that my family could reach me, but it was Glenn calling every five minutes. Every message he left grew nastier and nastier, until he began threatening to do horrible things.  ""You think you can ignore me,  bitch? Why can't you understand how much I love you? Pick up the phone. PICK UP THIS FUCKING PHONE! Do you want me to kill myself, is that it?...Or do you want to die? Is that it? Hm? I swear to God, Shireen, I'll fucking kill you. The second you step foot back on US soil, you'll get a fucking bullet between those pretty little eyes. Baby, please. **Please.** Call me back. I miss you so much.""

I saved every message and text, and began keeping a journal detailing his harassment. I made it home with no bullet in my head, but he was still escalating. If Iooked out of my window, he was standing on the opposite side of the street. When I went out to buy groceries, he would call me and tell me exactly what I was doing in excruciating detail, to put me on edge. I jumped at the slightest noise. I was a wreck. I would cry to myself in bed at night, Latte watching me from the doorway with sorrowful eyes. Understand this. I wasn't scared so much as pissed. Why me? Why was it always me? I hated Glenn so much that the mere mention of his name made me want to vomit. I swore that I would find a way to get mine, and make the bastard pay. If the legal system didn't work, then by other means...


I put up with this treatment for three months before I was started out of sleep one night by the sound of shattering glass. I reached for the bat I had been keeping by my bed and crept to the door. There was movement in the kitchen. A chill of excitement shuddered down my spine. I reached into the pocket of my pajama bottoms and curled a fist around my phone. I could have called the police right then, but that was plan B. Plan A was already scrambling out of his dog bed in the livingroom and barreling his way to the intruder. I heard a shout, a snarl. Something was knocked off a counter and shattered. Two bodies were warring for supremacy in my my home and I had a very good idea who was winning.
I darted down the hall to watch and made it just in time to view the end of the match. Glen was bruised and bloodied and torn, trying to keep his balance on the the kitchen table when  Latte sprang and sank his teeth into the dizzy man's neck. Glenn, unprepared for the attack and overwhelmed by Latte's enormous size, fell backwards with a brief shriek and cracked his head against the kitchen floor. He lost consciousness immediately. I had to pry Latte's jaws open with my bare hands to keep him from tearing Glenn's throat out. I wrapped my arms around him with a joyous sob. ""Good boy. Good, *good* boy...""


When Glenn came to, we were in the old steelworks a few miles away from my apartment. He was in a hole in the basement floor and I was looking down on him from above.  I have absolutely no idea why something like this would exist in steelworks, or what frame of mind the builder was in when he or she made it. Maybe it was made for storage, or some ugly business had been afoot before the place was shut down. But it was, for all (my)intents and purposes, a stainless steel oubliette. I had to hold open a metal latch to see and hear him. What a deep, dreamy pang I felt as I watched him slowly come to and realize where he was and who had put him there. When he looked up at me with a vicious expression, I knew the poor idiot still didn't understand his situation. 

""What the fuck is this shit?"" he barked. 

I said nothing. I just kept looking down on him.

""Oh, you ghastly bitch...Just you wait unitl I get out of here, and I will get out of here... I'll make you wish I'd snapped your neck. Crazy bitch. Crazy fucking bitch!""

All I could do was cock an eyebrow. I wasn't even mad.  ""*Me?* I'm the crazy one? Are you serious?"" I was holding the hatch to the hole above my head. It was heavy, and when I lowered it just a little to relieve my arms, it made a fierce grating noise. That caught Glenn's attention. No doubt because the lower I angled it, the poorer the quality of light was in his little space. He changed his tune. His voice was suddenly sweet and persuasive. I could let him out. We could talk things over. The police (!) need not be involved. We could go on like we had before or go our seperate ways. It was amazing how someone could be so phony and think they could get away with it. He vacillated between sweetness and rage before finally realizing that none of his sorry manipulations were going to work, and he spiraled into genuine fear.

""Look,"" he said urgently. ""I was wrong. I'm sorry. Please, let me out! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!""

I looked at him for a long time and thought, until at last the idea struck me. ""Au Lait,"" I said aloud.

He looked at me dumbly.

""Au Lait. That will be your name from now on."" 

He panicked, babbling in the dark. ""Shireen, for...for Christ's--""

""Hush. You've been running your mouth for a month of Sundays. It's my turn. You've been a bad boy. And if you act like an animal, you get broken like an animal. Do you get me? You'll be staying in here for a while until you can learn to act like you've got some sense. Just a year, if you're good--""

""Please. Please please please please please, I'll leave you alone. I swear. *I swear*!""

""--but it'll be a good two or three even if you keep up that racket,""I said sternly. Glenn balked and I gave him my most reassuring smile. ""But cheer up. Things will be nice by the time you come out. I'll bring you back to the apartment, and buy you a pretty new collar. You can be friends with Latte. It's high time he had a friend.""
He screamed hysterically. I stood back a few steps, and gave him one good lookover before letting the hatch door fall with a slam. It echoed harshly for a while until the floor I stood on was  filled with a deep, satisfying silence. I sat back on my legs, exhaled, and allowed myself a few minutes of perfect peace before making my way back to the car. Latte greeted me at the door when I finally made it home. I shooed him back and made a batch of hot chocolate on the stove. When I sat down on the arm chair, he shuffled to me on all fours and rested his head on my lap. Stroking the soft hair on his head, I just sipped my cocoa and wondered how many days I should wait before I brought Au Lait any food and water.

Another day, another crazy. That's life. You've got to get knocked down a few times before you can get what you want. But I think I'll be taking  myself  off the dating market for a while--just so I can focus on myself, you know? Maybe I'll pick up a new hobby, like yoga or meditation. Maybe put in for a nice, spacious new house. You've got to be in a good place emotionally before you can be any good in a relationship, I know that much. In the meantime, I'll have my career, my space and my pets."

First off, I am an international student from Nepal. I graduated with Bachelors of Management (3.75 GPA) and have a few internships under my belt. I graduated from a not so well known college but since I wasn’t eligible for federal aid, I had to go for something cheap. 

I would love to be able to work in the field of Financial Analysis (the research aspect) or work with the team responsible for the merging and/or acquisition of other companies.

Now here’s the issue, I don’t really know how to get there.
I currently work for a consulting firm as a research associate doing primary research which mostly consists of me being on the phone talking to people and interviewing them about their company.

This is not what I want to be doing for much longer.

So if you have any advice that you feel would help me out in my career, I Would LOVE it.

I’ll take anything from guidance to advice to your personal stories. Anything that you feel would benefit me.

I know Java, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, &amp; C#. However, my programming portfolio is currently mostly empty because I tend to be busy during the school year.

Here's my question:
So most internships have their deadlines due in just a couple of months (so i have to start asking my teachers for recommendations for certain programs now), and as a high schooler with a nearly empty portfolio, would it be more beneficial for me to pursue a cs internship/research project for the summer or to stay at home and practice my current knowledge and fill my portfolio?

tldr: should i pursue an internship over the summer or fill my portfolio as a highschooler?"

Last summer I worked a paid internship as a help desk position. It was fun, half the time I surfed the web, and the other half the time I was working on small projects for my boss, and other random things. Anyways, I got a Software Engineering Internship for a major company in another state that I'm really excited for. I chose not to work through the year since I had a bunch saved from my last internship that should last me until my next one this summer. Anyways, I have some free time, and was surfing craigslist for odd computer jobs, or anything, and I came across an ad for a small company that works with kids teaching them how to build their own computer, and how it works, etc. I emailed the lady my resume, and I talked with her today. It seems alright, although she says that she's the only one that runs it, and if I joined I would pretty much be leading the thing by myself (a small group of kids). And she wants to expand it to teaching different languages etc. So my question is, should I take it, even though it's volunteer based, and it sounds like I would basically be running a camp for this lady to earn money for her company. Although I did talk to her about if the kids were from impoverished areas, and it sounds like they're not. Although some of them are from churches, and it sounds like she also does a fair amount of fundraising for the organization. On one hand, it would be really cool to work with kids, because I love working with kids, but then on the other hand I don't want to run the entire thing for the lady while she sits back and makes money off me. What suggestions do you have for me?"

As the title says around the middle to end of September I applied to about 50 internship positions in software development/engineering. Companies from Google to Linkedin, Verizon, IBM, Intel, Uber, Twitter, etc...

I was lucky enough to get an internship 2 summers ago that turned into a part time (30hrs/week) job. So I have about 18 months as a developer(no longer intern) working on an agile team making great software. 

However I want to get some more varied experience so I have been applying to a lot of internships for next summer. Thing is...I have heard back from almost nobody. I mean I spent a lot of time putting together nice cover letters, working on my resume, putting together references, hell I even have some kick ass recommendations, but still little feedback from companies.

Here is an example cover letter and resume: http://imgur.com/a/FWUKM 

Palantir was at least nice enough to tell me they were not interested, no hard feelings, but only Verizon and IBM have gotten back to me.

Verizon seems to have completely forgotten about me, story here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3r8bts/havent_heard_from_verizon_after_4_weeks_post/

So I guess my question is where do I go from here? Is there some improvements I need to make to my process or my documents? While I am sure that there are still more companies to apply to I feel that I have a pretty good list that has a variety of companies from difficult to get an offer to what I would consider almost a safe bet. Sounds like I was being naive since I have yet to really see where I stand. Regardless, any advice would be appreciated. "
3sa5ub,4,2015-11-10,Can coders ask too many questions when they're graduates?,wandmirk,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3sa5ub/can_coders_ask_too_many_questions_when_theyre/,"My partner is doing his degree in computer science and his final project is an android app. He had some previous work experience for a big company (I won't name them, but they're a huge company that cross multiple sectors) and found it really difficult because he felt like he couldn't ask -enough- questions.

He mentioned that there was a ""just get on with it"" type of attitude and although he feels like he asks too many questions, my personal experience is that sometimes there are companies unwilling to really help people - especially interns - so that might be why he felt that way.

He's experiencing a lot of anxiety now, worried he'll ask too many questions or need too much help in the workplace. I think him wanting a bit of guidance is perfectly understandable for a graduate employee, perhaps even for a coder, but of course I'm not a developer and I have no experience working in development, just managing the content side and working with developers across offices.

So, if you have experience, what do you think? Are some workspaces more understanding of questions? Did my partner just have a bad placement experience wherein interns weren't very valued? Or is it rough to need guidance when you're a graduate developer? Where might he find it easiest to feel free to ask questions?"

She responded and was open to the idea, but stated she would speak with her co-founder and then get back to me. Well, it has been almost a month since then and I'm beginning to think she forgot, so I am planning on sending her another email to follow up, asking her if she has made a decision about taking me as an intern yet. 

The problem is, I feel that if I ask her this directly in an email it will come off sounding bad, and although I do have a sincere interest in the company, I already expressed this in my first email and doing so again would be repetitive. So my question is how do I word this email so it doesn't directly scream ""sooo.....about that internship...."", but at the same time expresses the message subtly and elegantly?  "
3sadwv,4,2015-11-10,Should I forgive him?,FeedMeYourCake,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3sadwv/should_i_forgive_him/,"So my ex and I had been dating for the past 5 years but we've known each other since elementary school. We were high school sweethearts and ended up going to different universities. Nonetheless we made it work, we'd Skype with each other almost every night and every weekend we'd make the trek to visit each other.  Things were going great for us until about half a year ago. He was offered a 4 month internship at a well known company in another country. We told ourselves that we were going to be fine and that we'd continue to Skype with each other and in order to have something to look forward to, we planned a trip to Europe for when he got back. By the last month of his internship we'd grown really distant and stopped talking to one another, however I kept my spirits up by looking for our trip to Europe. A few days before our trip he tells me that he and another girl had started having feelings for one another and that they both goth really drunk and ended up kissing. I was devastated when I heard this news, I asked him if he wanted to breakup and he said no. He said that he was really sorry and that he didn't mean for it to happen. Since he seemed to have been genuinely sorry and because he was drunk I forgave him. Afterwards we spent the next two weeks in Europe and it was like nothing had changed. We were in love again and all was good in the world. A week after we returned from our vacation and the day before my birthday he tells me that we should break up. He tells me that since his internship he wants to experience more things in the world. Heartbroken I let him go because I didn't want to be the reason why he missed out on his youth. We kept in touch for awhile, talking about random things but not in the way that we used to. We also talked about trying to start up our relationship again in a year or two when we were both ready and settled.  A few days ago he tells me that the week that we returned from Europe he had gone to watch a movie at a girl's house, this being the very same girl he kissed while on his internship. One thing led to another and they ended up kissing again. This time I was furious. I yelled at him for almost an hour and a half while he just sat there quietly crying once in awhile saying how sorry he was. I have never hated someone so much in my life than I did at that moment, I wanted to hurt him as much as he hurt me. He said that he was still hopeful that we'd be able to start things up in a few years once he's matured more, but at the time I told him that I never wanted to speak with him again.  Now its been a week and the anger has subsided but not totally gone. We grew up together since we were children and he's made such an impact on my life and I really want to forgive him but every time I try I remember his betrayal which once again flares up my anger. I miss him so much, but I don't know if I should forgive him or even how to do so in the first place."

I've done a PM internship at a smaller consumer facing product and LOVE it, but have some concerns about what the work may entail for a Cloud PM. I am very interested in it and would love any and all opinions from current employees both at MSFT and out. I am essentially boiling it down to this offer in Seattle with a great brand name against a smaller name in Austin TX. I feel like I could have more impact at the smaller company with more responsibilities, but the future of the company is in question and I'm not sold on their vision for their own future.
What is the culture like in MSFT Cloud? Will this help a future in product work if I want to get back into the consumer tech space?"
3salai,2,2015-11-10,[Advice] Thinking about taking a semester off,TDKshorty,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3salai/advice_thinking_about_taking_a_semester_off/,"I'm currently one semester away from getting my bachelors degree- technically, I'm 3 hours away from my Major and 9 hours away from my minor.  

Even though I'm so close to graduating, I'm really considering taking next semester off and just working full-time.  

I feel like I really need a break- right now I'm going to school full-time, working full-time (essentially, between a part-time job and a paid internship), in a band, in a relationship and I go to the gym consistently.  

It may or may not sound like a lot, but I'm going to music school which requires me to practice my instrument, but the majority of my classes right now aren't completely music related- it's all of my Gen Eds that I need for my major, like philosophy and humanities classes- so it's taking time away from practicing, so I feel like I'm not really getting anywhere.  

And then I have my band, which is the ultimate goal, for me- to have a band, write, record, tour, etc... and I'm working really hard on that, so that's pretty good, but it can be stressful at times.  

Going to the gym is big for me, I go about 6-7 hours a week, which adds up, and it requires just as much energy- not to mention the time spent grocery shopping and prepping meals to fuel my body pre and post-workout. And I'm not complaining, but I'm just trying to state the obvious- I don't want it to sound like I'm making excuses, but this is a real summary of how I'm spending my time.  

And my girlfriend and I live together, but we don't see each other that much, as she works basically 9-5 and a few days out of the week I leave for the gym at 8:00, to go to class at 10, to do my internship from 11-5 and then I have rehearsal from 6-8, so that's basically a 12 hour day three times a week, and other days aren't too different, so our relationship is suffering.  


All of that being said, I'm burned out. I'm not doing too hot this semester. I have a few D's and an F and the worst part is that I'm really half-assing everything. I'm not doing the best job possible to practice my instrument or study for class or learn the material and it's finally showing. It really sucks when I'm doing something and my heart's not in it, you know. It's starting to affect my gym habits, my eating habits, and I've fallen into lethargy and procrastination- all around I'm just not doing anything 100% and so my whole life is suffering from it.  

I don't *really* want to be in school-I value knowledge and learning, but I never intended to get a degree; I moved to where I live now to go to music school to meet other musicians and be apart of something, and that never really happened until now, so I've spent the last 3.5 years- in which I've earned over 120 credit hours, btw- trying really hard to pursue my dreams and feeling really defeated when I felt like I was doing the right thing, but what I wanted wasn't happening, and I was just pursuing something I didn't really want, my degree, which was ""happening"".  

So I just feel like I've been half-assing everything for a long time, and it's finally taking a toll, but I want to be energized about school and work and life.  

I think if I were to take next semester off and just focus on being a better musician and developing better habits so that next fall I can be a better student, my life would be better.  

Does anyone have any advice?  

**TL;DR** I'm one semester away from graduating, but I'm super burned out and I feel like if I should take a semester off to rejuvenate and develop better habits and routines. Any advice?

3sb783,0,2015-11-10,Google just gave me the best and worst interview within 15 mins of each other,idamo7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3sb783/google_just_gave_me_the_best_and_worst_interview/,"So recently, I did the Google internship interview (typically 2 back to back 45 mins interviews). The first one was probably the best technical interview I've had in my life! For some reason, I was really confident, I was able to think through problems quickly and pull out nice code within a short period of time. After about 30 mins out of the 45 mins, my interviewer said he was surprised I was able to answer so quickly and he liked the way I solved it because he ""had never thought about it that way"". Basically we spent the rest of the time chatting and joking around (for example, he made a joke about buying mini sodas from Minnesota when he visited the weekend before etc.) and I genuinely had a great time.
23 minutes later, I got a call from the next interviewer (he called ~7 late) and didn't really sound interested from the beginning. This guy went straight into blabbering about the something he wanted me to implement, but then he kept placing emphasis on how I can do it in whatever way I wanted to (therefore I was in charge of the coming up with the design and implementation). There was a huge communication gap and I could tell English wasn't his first language, since he wasn't able to fully describe what he wanted. Instead, whenever I asked for clarification, he'll respond with ""It's up to you"". I then went ahead to do it the way I could, but at random times he'll stop me and say ""No, don't do it like that"" and when I ask ""how do you want me to do it, then?"" he'll simply respond ""it's up to you"". If you're reading this, you probably understand my problem. He is telling me that he doesn't like what I'm doing, but not telling me what he doesn't like. Best believe I wasn't able to finish the interview, and immediately it was 11:45am he simply said ""time's up"" and dropped the phone, MIDWAY THROUGH ME EXPLAINING MY REASONING. I felt that was rather rude and literally sat there with my mouth open, gaping at the screen for about 5 mins straight. 
I know that at the end of the day, regardless of how good the first interview was, I am not going to be selected because of how poorly the second one went. I am just curious though, has this kind of thing ever happened to anyone? My friends told me to not take it personal and maybe he was stressed, or maybe he was just too hungry to be bothered/had other plans(the interview was right before lunch time). 

What do I really make of this? How do I prevent things like this from happening in the future? Thanks!"

The police are on their way as I type this, so I must hurry before they take it as evidence.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


""My psychiatrist suggested I write my thoughts down in a journal, pretty stereotypical. At first I thought it was pointless but, why not, got jack shit else to do. 

Anyways, I’m with her now. We just had a nice conversation. She always loved to listen to me.  I told her, just like always, “I love you honey!” But she didn’t respond of course. She never responds anymore. Not since…what, one year, 3 months, and 2 weeks ago? Something like that, I’ve lost track. 


But that’s irrelevant. I know she loves me too. She doesn’t even have to speak, it’s been unspoken for years. I remember that look she always gave me, that look that screamed you are the love of my life. That still holds fast. I mean, her accident didn’t take her hearing after all. It just took her away from me. Ripped her out of my life quick, like a Band-Aid, but this pain didn’t only last a second. It’s constantly on my mind. I remember what she told me on our wedding night, when we were laying out rules for ill fates, should they fall upon us. We were about halfway through a bottle of Jack Daniels…


Damn I could go for shot right now. I’ve been bone-dry since that night.


Sometimes I still hear the car tires screeching, jolting me back to reality just as I am about to fall asleep and escape the pain I face everyday, ripping me from my safe-haven deep in my mind. Forcing me to face the suffering.
 
I…um.
 

Yes, we were quite lit, but she suddenly looked me dead in the eye. She told me, she said,
 “If I’m ever in a helpless state, like a vegetable, a coma or something. I want you to pull the plug. I never want to be helpless.” 


It’s a wonder I even remember that night honestly. She was so drunk though, there’s no way she meant that. There’s no way.
 

All the doctors said there was no hope, but fuck them. There’s always hope. I can’t wait until she wakes up and leaves that wretched world she’s trapped in. 
I swear she mumbled something the other night, it sounded like my name! I’ve always been by her side, always had faith. This hospital however, they're all hopeless bastards. Damn them to hell. They try to keep us apart. They go so far as to lock her in this cold basement where everything is chrome and has sharp corners. Sharp like the broken glass that night, sharp like the doctor’s words,
 “I’m sorry. There’s nothing we can do”. 
I had to take keys off of a nurse to get down here where they keep her. Of course the nurse didn’t willingly give them, I really do hope she’s ok. 
The sight of her blood reminded me of that night, it made me sick to my stomach. 
Really they’ll all see. I’ll just stay down here with her, the love of my life, my world. I hope I don’t get sick though. The other people down here…they’re all dead. This can’t be sanitary. These doctors are all imbecilic I tell you. 
Oh! I hear her talking again! She’s saying my name! I hear it, I really do! I must go and be with her. I must be with her. I must be with her. I must be wi""


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


And the note stops there. We still haven't found the nurse he mentioned.

I hear many terrifying things on this subreddit, but I would like to remind everyone that our own minds can be the scariest of all. Please be safe everyone, be smart. We are a fragile being.

* Risky Common App/UC Prompt 2 essay about being the captain of a semi-pro CS:GO team (see [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3c7c6l/how_are_esports_viewed_in_an_application/). Should I include this as an EC?)

* Solid UC Prompt 1 essay about coming from an ever-changing world and hence not having plans for the future and just being adaptable

* Feel confident in my supplements, especially the ""Why NYU/Columbia"" and Harvard's topic of your choice

**Rec Letters:**

Obviously I haven't actually seen them so I'm just going off of my feeling and what my counselor has told me:

* Supposedly amazing rec letter from CompSci teacher

* Meh letter from Physics teacher (counselor had an e-mail from him open and it didn't look too promising)

* Probably solid letters from Economics teacher as well as prior head of secondary education (my school is K-12) (haven't gotten any of these yet)

* Counselor report should turn out really well

**Schools:**

* Columbia/Harvard

* UC Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD

* Northwestern

* NYU CAS (demonstrated interest by visiting)

* Boston University

One final question - there's numerous people from my high school applying to the same colleges, and while they have better GPAs (4.0s mostly), I have the better standardized test scores and demographics going for me. I'd rate our ECs about equal, maybe mine slightly worse. How does that affect my chances? I guess my question is: **Do colleges mind accepting numerous kids from the same school?**

Thanks and good luck to all of you!"

A little background, I am about to graduate in December in Computer Information Systems. I have applied for couple jobs in IT and had success in getting interviews. 

The first company that I interviewed for had landed me a full-time position. They had given me a salary of 62,000 but I had told them that I need sometime in deciding because I have a couple other interviews and was not ready. The director had said that is fine but I need to make a decision by this Friday. Now this company is semi-large, roughly 400 employees. They are looking to expand and I see potential growth. 

The second company that I was interviewed for is a really well known company, Kaiser Permanente. They are looking to hire for a internship position. The position is paid w/ benefits and will last  from three months to one year depending on how I do. I feel that choosing this company will open many doors in the industry or other positions within the organization. 

The dilemma is that Kaiser will notify me if I am accepted in two weeks while the other company is waiting for my response in the coming days. I do not even know if I will be accepted and also that it's a internship position which is not secure. The only positive is that it may open many more opportunities and that it will shape me more so than the first company. 

So my question is, what should I do? Accept the first job? or try and go for a bigger company?

P.S. I have two other interviews this week so I have other opportunities but these first two companies are my top pick. "

So far, I love the course. The lectures are great, the module pages are very well organized, and JSFiddle is an awesome front end learning tool. I am really excited to dive into the back end this week. 

The tooling is also very cutting edge. I've talked to some of my fellow interns who are taking a similar course at a local university and they are still learning PHP on the backend, using antiquated HTML and JavaScript practices, and have nothing but complaints. 

Conversely, we are deploying node.js applications to an amazon EC2 instance on the backend, using git for version control, and using modern javascript, CSS3 and HTML5 in the front end. These are all very marketable and practical skills. I am very happy that this course is forcing me to learn them. 

All in all, IMO they did a great job with course. It's a pleasant and intuitive learning experience. I'm not sure if others feel the same, but I really feel like I'm getting my money's worth here."

Hi all, 

I just graduated this past year with a BSc in Psychology (minor in Biology). Although I'm aware this isn't the conventional background, I came to love working with data and really became interested in pursuing data science as I progressed through my degree.

I was very fortunate to get lots of research experience with several different neuroscience and cognitive psychology labs (including completing a data-intensive thesis). I also have programming/scientific computing experience from coursework and research positions, namely working with MATLAB and R. As well, I did really well in all of my statistics courses, and even took two graduate-level seminars (in computational neuroscience and structural equation modelling/PCA). 

I spent this past summer expanding my skillset by getting more familiar with machine learning, SQL, as well as learning Python (which I love; it is now my go-to 90% of the time). I *love* learning this stuff and I'm driven to continue learning and expanding my knowledge/skillset while working. Simply put, if I don't know something, I learn it. 

But, **I'm really struggling to get my foot in the door**. I'm in a major Canadian city where data science isn't really recognized; all the jobs are 'data analyst', BI or database-type positions. Indeed, it seems that an analyst is synonymous with RDBMS + CS degree: all the jobs I can find require CS or related degrees and want people with generally a minimum 5+ years of experience. I've only had one job interview, and they told me they wanted a developer instead. I'm doing my best to network (meetups, coffee, etc) but that hasn't produced any leads either.

I'm starting to look elsewhere, but given that I'm just starting out, it's hard to apply to jobs in other cities where I don't have any connections. As well, a lot of these positions are high-level and prefer individuals with masters or PhDs. All I'm interested in, really, is some sort of entry-level or internship where I can start out and learn to do what it takes. I'm confident I can do a good job, I'm just looking for the opportunity.

Does anyone have any advice, ideas, or connections? Thanks and apologies for the rant!

* **Coursework**: I have taken 7 IB classes and one AP. This senior year I am taking another 7 IB classes along with one more AP. For my IB senior year, I am taking 4 HL classes (which is quite difficult, and the HL classes are IB English, 20th Century Topics, Physics and Math), and I self-study for IB Math HL, since I am the only student that takes the course.
* **Awards**: Academic achievement and special recognition in multiple classes, Conference Champions for Soccer

**Schools**:

I have already applied at these schools: 

* Duke (ED) -- Reach
* UNC  (EA) -- Match(-ish?)
* NC State  -- Safety(-ish?)

Reaches that I will be applying to:

* UC Berkeley
* Stanford
* Colombia
* Yale

**Concerns:**

Of course, my ACT seems really poor for Duke, and I am just really worried about it. I believe my extracurriculars are good, and, although it may not be as amazing as almost any other poster at this sub, I am still quite proud of my achievements. I do not personally know anyone else that does sports, clubs/service, and have two jobs while maintaining their academics at the same level as I do. So, I would assume this may be a positive for me in the admission process. Or, maybe I am just delusional. 

Anyways, if they, the admissions officers, are truly holistic, how strong would my essay and recs have to be in order to cover over the poor ACT? Does it have to be extremely strong? I believe they are strong, but I cannot assume the office would have the share the same opinions as me. 

Alright, I will quit my rambling, if you read through all the way here, thank you. "

I just feel like I don't know everything I will need to know in order to be a great member of the work force. 

I've read up on /r/homelabs, but I'm just not comfortable with setting something like that up still living at home with my parents.

I'm working an IT internship at the moment in the department of a fairly large company imaging/configuring computers/servers and shipping them out to offices being integrated to the company. Most of the time I do work unrelated to Net Admin (such as moving computers, unboxing computers to be imaged, and shipping/organizing stuff) , but sometimes I'll do prep work that can be done before they get the order for the machines. 

I really just feel like everyone around me knows so much more than me, or are just better at faking it. 

As far as I know the Net Admin program at my community college does a great job of preparing students, the majority of graduates in the area are often offered jobs and don't have too much trouble moving up the ladder. Though one of my main teachers who designed the course does say that he doesn't feel a 2 year program is enough to give hugely detailed knowledge but he attempts to instill us with the basics fairly well.

Sorry if I rambled there, I am mainly wondering if hands on experience will fill the gaps in my knowledge and help me to retain it better, or if I should know all this stuff by now?"

Its your friendly admissions student worker here with a word of advice for applicants. 

Congratulations to those of you who have acceptances on hand or will soon! You are approaching the time to make a choice. In your selection process, here are substantive things to consider that will contribute to your long term success in college.

1. Its all about the money. If you are debt averse (as you should be with rising interest rates and the lack of jobs for college grads), this is a big deal. If your dream school does not come with a dream scholarship, you may want to think twice. But the first thing you should do is see what else they have to offer. The letter or e-mail may have further details about additional offers. You may have to contact financial aid directly to ask what more is available for you. On another tangent, if you are someone who has not netted many offers, don't feel inclined to take the first full ride that comes your way if you're not genuinely interested. Not having debt is great, but not having fun is gloomy. There is a balance, work to find it.

2. Location, location, location. There are many layers to this issue. The first is general geographic location. If you know you get homesick or there is some reason you must stay close to hometown or family, its probably not a good idea to move across the country. Even if you're comfortable with the idea, work with your family to foresee the costs of travel and ensure you can afford it. If there is an emergency, can you get home or are you stuck? If stuck, are you okay with that? Beyond travel concerns, some people have temperature preferences. If you're from a colder area, can you handle going to school in the desert? Some people really can't, so think about it. On the micro-level, the location of the college itself is important. If you are accustomed to a large city, going to a small rural campus may or may not be the best fit. Same goes vice versa for suburbanites trying to fit into the city. Your comfort with distance, noise, crowds, crime, etc all fit into this decision. 

3. Size matters. It does, really. Colleges are all over the spectrum when it comes to size and experience, but some generalizations can be made here. BigStateU is typically an impersonal place, lecture halls hold hundreds of students, you may need a shuttle to get from one class to the next, and your professors will probably never know your name. Their sports, student services, and such are ""on fleek"" though. Clearly with the number of graduates from such schools every year, many people are okay with this. Doesn't mean you are one of them. Next to that is MediumStateU or AveragePrivateSchool, you stand a good chance of having decent class sizes here, campus is walkable, but not too personable. May or may not have sports and activities, etc that most incoming freshman look for. Works for some students, doesn't work for others. Lastly, there is SmallSchool which could be public or private. It has high school sized classrooms, you take classes with the same professor more than once, everyone knows everyone kind of thing. They probably have a great community but not a vast network of activities or services. If those things are a bigger priority for you, think hard before making a choice. 

4. Student services (sorry didn't have a witty title for this one). You can easily measure how ""good"" a college is by what kind of services they offer the student. I don't mean how big the stadium is, I mean the core academic and career factors. You need a tutoring lab, well-staffed library, career services (place where they write your resume and recommend places to apply), professors who are active in their fields, student jobs, and much more. If your prospective school has at least a few of these, they are focused on making sure students success during and after college. I got my first internship through a professor's recommendation. My first job...on campus. My first legit peer reviewed essay, at the tutoring lab. These factors are what ensure you'll make it the next 2-4 years. 

Naturally, I'm being very general to try and provide applicable info to as many as possible. If there is anything I missed, please comment below. If you have questions/comments, I welcome those as well!  "

3sdv4o,3,2015-11-11,Advice on Plans to get in Trading,Throwaway7282917,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3sdv4o/advice_on_plans_to_get_in_trading/,"Hello r/financialcareers

I wanted to outline my plan with respect to my ideal career path and get some opinions on it. Any Londoners would be perfect as I'm aiming for London. 

A bit about myself: 
- I'm a recent graduate 
- I got a first in a banking and finance degree
- It wasn't from a top tier university though 
- I'm 23
- My A level grades are ACC with a c in one AS (non quant topics)
- Have internship experience in trade finance and FX trading
- I had several extra circulars in uni such as being course rep, forming a trading-investing society 
- Some of those were entrepreneurial with my university's business school and one of the firms I did my summer with
- Currently I have a temp role with Lloyds Banking Group 
- It is a target driven role, but not a front office role 

I really want to end up in a front office role (ideally in a bank) in London, ideally in trading.

Now I am aware of what I have going against me: my A levels (quite a lot of roles ask for UCAS points or grades) and my university not being a target (a lot of roles want a top tier university).

I'll still do all I can to attend networking events while carrying out the plan. 

So I had the following plan and back up plan to try my luck. 

Plan
- While working do a new set of A levels (math, further math and computing) aiming for A*-A range.
- try to apply for various target unis for a masters programme 
- The ""story"" for the new set of A levels will be that I regretted not doing math before undergraduate finance and that I didn't want to repeat it for post grad finance; for computing I was thinking of using a story linking to how the industry is becoming automated 
- From there try again with grad schemes
- Make use of networking too 

But with work and doing the A levels via distance learning I think for good grades I'd take about 2-3 years (if I do them asap or sign up next year). That would make me 25-26... So 26-27 by the time I finish the masters. 
What I'm worried about is my then age working against me when trying for the roles I want to go into. 

Back up plan if I can't get a masters offer in a target:
- Was thinking of doing one of the accounting exams (I was told they could help)
- And/or doing the target MSc part time. 

That still puts me around the 26-27 range I'm worried may hinder me.

The much longer term like 3-5 years after I was considering an MBA in the event I wanted to change industry or another area of finance/banking... But considering the age I'd be at that point (around 30s) I'm unsure if even that is feasible. 

Any advice on if my plan is sound; if not what should change and why?
Also am I overthinking the significance of the age factor? "

Once we were reading something off his screen and he had trouble seeing the words. He told me that he’s dyslexic and that he stopped treatment after school.

Facilities intern here.

We're expanding our paint line, so our steam usage is going to increase. My boss tasked me with finding out how much of an increase in natural gas usage we'd experience if we need to add an additional 5000 lb/hr of steam.

Our four boilers are identical models and rated at about 85% efficient. They have a combined max output of 8280 lb/hr of steam. I tracked the feedwater gallon meter, but I don't have any means of tracking blowdown. So I really just found how much our gas increases if our water increases.

Is there a rough estimate percentage I can go off of to give me how much steam is produced out of feedwater? So far I found that if our feedwater usage increases by 5000 lb/hr of water, our gas will increase by 8.25 MBtu/hr. I'm assuming that this number might be way off if only a certain percentage of that feedwater is actually being converted into steam.

Thanks!

Is there any prep work that I can do before hand that would be especially useful?  Any general advice?  Right now I'm just reviewing Java, web stack details, and AWS services.  I'm also setting up various environments at home to get familiar with unix tools again (worked with Windows environments)

Is it a good idea to be asking my boss for prep work before I start?  Also, is it weird to be emailing my HR contact frequently?  I've already sent a few emails and don't want to be annoying, but I'm not sure how long is acceptable to wait for things like background check and relocation contact.

When I graduate from my university, I will receive a B.S. in IT with a specialty in Networking and Cybersecurity.  I've been searching for an internship for the last 3 semesters now and haven't even received an email response saying I didn't get the position.  Is it usually this difficult to get an internship position in the IT field?  I feel as if I'm doing something wrong that is preventing me from getting my foot in the door.  I only have 32 credits remaining (6 of which has to be an internship for 200 hours that I would ideally like to complete during the summer) before I complete my course work next December.  I feel that I am running out of time and that I'm going to finish my course work with little to no actual real world experience.  

Does anyone have any advice for a student who just wants to be given an opportunity to learn and gain real world experience that I can put on a resume?"

They assured me that I wouldn't have to worry about that much as they weren't really looking for someone with that background.

Well, today they immediately threw me into a half-finished Wordpress/PHP project with no documentation or way to communicate with other team members via slack (the CEO claims that she is totally swamped and will contact me later today). They also gave me 5 hours to work though a large task list and provide notes to present to the client later this evening. 

Needless to say, I am completely lost. I've managed to navigate through a few of the tasks but I'm really struggling. Is it normal for your first day of an internship to go this way?

I accepted this last week, but I just heard back from another company today with an offer as well. 

The company I accepted at is across the country, has a lower wage, and the relocation stipend will not be enough to cover my summer housing. Additionally, while it is a big city, it is not a downtown area where I can manage without a vehicle, so I would be relying on others for rides the entire summer. The new offer is only a couple hours from where a currently live, and downtown in a major city where I do not need a vehicle for transportation. They offer a much higher hourly wage and the relocation stipend will go a lot further as I will not have to fly down there. 

With all of this is mind, I believe the second offer is better for me and my future career. It is more in line with what I want to do professionally, and while the other offer is good, I wouldn’t have accepted it if I thought I still had a chance at receiving another offer. This will be my internship before my senior year and I want to live in an area where I would be comfortable if I am offered a full time job. I know it is morally and ethically wrong to go back on my original offer, but it is less harmful to the company since it is so early on in the recruiting process still? I guess I know I could be put on a black list and it could possibly hurt my reputation, but I’m not really comfortable going across the country when there is a better opportunity near home.

So what I have in my mind are:

1. If I accept this offer, it means I won't be available any other part-time jobs. Well maybe on Sat and Sun.

2. It's a startup company. If this was a big tech firm, I would gladly accept the offer.

3. They probably have more engineering related assignments for me.

3. It's NYC. People would go above and beyond for a chance of employment. Hmm. Though, I don't know if it's true."

I'm currently in the market for a new laptop. I don't own a desktop so this will be my primary machine. My current laptop crapped out on me (Macbook Pro 2009), and I figured this is a good time to upgrade. 

I recently picked up programming a few months back and started an internship in September. Programming, Netflix, and Reddit, is pretty much all I'll be doing with this laptop. In terms of programming, it will probably be a while before I do anything super intense. 

I have no doubt I could probably find something in the $300-$500 range to suit my needs, but since I spend a lot of time on my laptop, I'd like to treat myself to something within my budget that will hopefully last me for at least the next two years. 

I am highly considering [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015PYYDMQ?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) laptop. I'm no gamer nor super tech savy, but from a lot of the reviews I've read, it seems like the price is justified whether you're a gamer or not. 

I'm a little unsure if I should just hold off until Black Friday/Cyber Monday to see if any good deals pop up. 

Any suggestions would be highly appreciated! 

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: $500 - $800

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): This will be my primary machine. I'll probably be using Eclipse and MS Visual Studio in the near future.

* Screen size preference: less than 17""

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): no preference

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): The only game I play is chess. I may think about downloading Diablo 2. 

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): 

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): Mostly stationary. I like to spend time in coffee shops, but that's about it. 

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): no preference 

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): no preference

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: balanced (although weight is the least concerning)

* Build quality -vs- Low price: balanced

**List any critical features:**

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): A nice screen to watch Netflix and YouTube videos would be nice, but wouldn't be a deal breaker. "

*I'm not familiar with US education system and I don't have the knowledge one can accumulate by just hearing things from environment. So I rely on mainly Internet and a few of my professors/acquaintances to plan my next +5 years, which is why I really appreciate your help*


I'm currently finishing last year of my BSCS and applying to MSCS programs in US. My purpose for MS is that it tremendously helps me to move to US and work as software engineer. Starting a job right after MSCS is crucial for me due to visa things, which brings me to my next point.

When you are not a great student, optimizing school reputation and job opportunities of the area and the cost is a hard task.

For example, let's assess [SJSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_State_University). It costs $70,000 (all cost for 2 years). It doesn't have any ranking [here](http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings).

I was stupid, unhealthy, aimless and didn't care about my grades until last semester. I think universities in range 0-50 will reject me directly due to my poor background listed below. 

My cons: 2.9ish GPA (If I get all As this term, then it will be 3.0), no research experience, bad transcipt, not impressive recommendation letters.

Maybe pros: Built a tiny software company while studying, worked there as developer for 3 years. Got full scholarship from university by ranking high in national exams. Two short internships.

My questions:

1. What are some schools that accept bad students like me but have some good reputation (for job opportunities)? (based on your hearings or experience)

2. How can I answer the first question myself? I'm going over Linkedin to check where alumni work, quora and this sub. But there are hundreads of programs and dozens of states which I'm not familiar with. So it seems pointless to go through all those data. Because I end up being more confused :( 

3. Supposedly, SJSU has good for job opportunities and can accept someone like me, but it is very pricey. Do you know any similar schools in cheaper areas?

Good afternoon,
I am 3 semesters away from completing my bachelors degree at the University of Maryland (College Park).  The school hasn't made getting to this point easy, going far enough to kick me out of majoring in CS my Freshman year (went out too much -&gt; poor grades...freshman mistakes).  After being told that it was impossible for me to get back into CS I switched to a Communication major and focused on getting CS jobs and work experience.

And what an experience it was.  I've been programming since Middle School where I started making simple HTML websites and Flash games, and through some luck and perseverance I was able to get an internship.  This internship was everything I could have asked for and more, I was doing what I loved in a great work environment.  I stayed there for 2 years, building a portfolio/resume, and then sent those out to other internship opportunities in the area.  I got a second internship (where I spent last Summer) and enjoyed it just as much as my first.  Both companies have expressed interest with hiring me Full Time once I graduate.

When I was working this Summer my coworkers were shocked when I told them I was a Comm major, a few thought it was even a joke.  I feel as if I am wasting my time getting this diploma if the people in my industry think it is a joke.  This semester I got hit with a depression due to finding zero joy in any of my classes, and it's made me seriously reconsider staying at the University.  While I have great friends, roommates, and enjoy being here socially, academically I am miserable.

I've been looking into those 8-12 week intensive bootcamps, and have been considering doing one of those to help build career connections.  Would that *on top of* my work experience be better than a Comm degree in the eyes of employers?

tl;dr: Comm major.  Been a programmer all my life.  Have fleshed out portfolio/resume with 3+ years of internships.  Is it worth it to graduate?  Should I ditch the Comm degree and get into the workforce?  Maybe attend a bootcamp in my area?"

NASA does offer full time positions if I preform efficiently during my time as an intern. and offers  tuition compensation towards my MBA. 

I got word back from Wells Fargo today and got offered the position, I find out Monday if I get the position at JPL, and I get word back tomorrow for the position at UBS.

Which one would look better on my resume in terms of future jobs prospects?"

3sl344,14,2015-11-12,It's time for me to negotiate my position at my internship,SirDucky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3sl344/its_time_for_me_to_negotiate_my_position_at_my/,"Hi Everyone.  There's some context involved, so this became a bit of an essay.  Sorry.   So I'm finishing my masters in CS and over the summer I took an internship with a local startup simply because I liked the project.  My core competencies are all based around machine learning, big data, and data science stuff.  This was definitely a calculated move since these skills are in demand, but I also just genuinely love statistics and machine learning problems.  I got my undergrad in Math so it's a good fit for me.

This startup hired me as an intern to work on some ML problems they had, and didn't pay me much.  It's two smart guys with a good idea and enough know-how to get relationships and drive sales.  After working with them for 8 months, I thoroughly believe in their product, and I think we're going to get a good chunk of an emerging market.  When I first started with them I knew the company was fragile,  so I just told them to pay me minimum wage and didn't worry about it.  I get a stipend from my university and this was one of the rare opportunities to work on ML problems locally.  Plus, it seemed like a good opportunity so I just went for it.

I love the work.  The problems are challenging, the boss is a great guy, and the team is a really good fit.  I'm glad to say that I've been able to drastically improve the development speed of the product, and sort of established myself as the guy who can wear all the hats and get shit done without worrying too much about his job description.  My being there to push the technical side of things means that my boss can worry about it less and drive the business side, so he's been making deals and driving sales so that he can hire me when I graduate in December.  It's a pretty good situation.  We're having a conversation this weekend where we're basically going to negotiate my position and compensation for 2016.

So here's the dilemma: I have no idea about how to value myself and what to ask for in this sort of negotiation.  In previous jobs, I've always undervalued myself when it comes to salary negotiation.  My best bet is that if I said ""screw it"" and went to work for a more stable company locally (this is a smaller city), I could land a starting salary of about $90-100k doing more general SWE kind of work.  I have no idea what sort of benefits that would include, or if there would be stock options.  I don't know the ""baseline"" for a fairly competent entry-level data scientist/wearer of hats.  Plus I'm their first employee.  On the other hand, I don't think my boss can afford that kind of salary yet, so he'll probably have to compensate with increased equity.  How do I value that though?  How much is enough?  What are realistic expectations, vs unrealistic ones?  Ideally, if I'm going to be undercompensated, I want to have a plan on how I expect that risk to pay off in the next 5 to 10 years.

Another wrench in the works is that there's the possibility of a big sale going through.  It would be the windfall we need, and provide a lot of startup capital for them.  Recently my boss asked me ""what pricetag would you put on not finishing your degree?  How much would I have to give you to drop everything and come work for me?""  So on top of everything else, I have to figure out what that price would look like, in a position where I take an even bigger risk on the company and  have a lot of leverage over them.

All this stuff is feeling really above my head.  I have no idea how to swing this kind of deal.  If anyone has personal advice or recommended reading, I would be heavily in your debt.

**TL;DR: Intern transitioning to first employee at a startup that heavily relies on him.  How do I navigate negotiating my position?**"

Junior year is when CS students scramble to land themselves an internship for the coming summer and I can't decide whether I should be scrambling. 

I have a university IT job where I have been supplied a relatively large amount of programming experience. This experience includes the creation of a WMI-based process monitoring program that will soon run on ~300 machines to help my bosses decide whether to keep software licenses, and the creation of a rather large web interface which allows us lab operators to edit LDAP and Active Directory entries all in one place. 

If I stay here I will have job security for the rest of college along with plenty more programming opportunities. I can't decide if the value of an internship outweighs this. Is a software engineering internship valuable enough for my future that I should leave this job and find something else when spring rolls around?"

So I was recently extended an offer to join Deloitte as a Solutions Developer intern. This is going to be my last internship and will most likely shape my decision for which company I start my career at, so I am just looking for any advice that I can get on being a programmer at Deloitte.

I'm going to be flying out to Microsoft soon for a final interview, and have an interview with Amazon, and I know working for those two companies would be pretty different than working at Deloitte, but of course I'd want to work for a company where I would gain the most and have actual abilities to move within the company.

From visiting Deloitte, it seems like mostly everyone is happy to work there and for being such a ""corporate"" company they have a pretty decent work environment. One interesting thing is that if you don't have a project to work on you'll still get paid, but you need to make sure you're constantly learning and improving your skills to be able to find more work, which could actually be a pretty positive thing for my career path.

Again, I'm unsure of what to do and any advice would help me a lot and be much appreciated!"

Do any of you know anything about the pros and cons of internships in the USA vs Germany or maybe if it would help me stand out on a resume?

I want to be as prepared as possible going in for the onsite because this really is my dream internship, and I don't want to screw it up. 

All I really have done up to this point outside of my classes (which doesn't yet include an algorithms class) is a couple problems from CTCI, maybe 15 easy Leetcode problems, and I skimmed through interview questions on Glassdoor. Ideally I'd love to be able to read through an algo text and do every problem in CTCI, but that just isn't realistic with the time I have left, especially with 3 exams and 3 20+ hour projects to do between now and then. 

What would be the most important things to practice if I can commit maybe 2 or 3 hours a day until the interview? I know I should practice whiteboard coding, and I think I should definitely learn about dynamic programming problems, but beyond that I don't know what would be the best use of my time. I'm super nervous about this and would really appreciate any advice.

Also on a slight side note, how many people who do onsites at top companies generally get offers? On Glassdoor I saw very few reports from people who failed their onsite, but that could definitely just be a response bias. "

In my opinion, Java takes a long road to learn. You have to know a bunch of frameworks JSP/JSF, EJB/Spring....and the new ones has no idea what it is.

Is NodeJS a good language to learn? How to get a job if you have no experiences at all?

3so4zn,22,2015-11-13,My life is ridiculous,MauPow,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/3so4zn/my_life_is_ridiculous/,"I feel like I'm a ship adrift on the ocean with no compass. I'm 27, have a BA in Journalism that I haven't put to any use whatsoever. I graduated at 24 and up and left the country to move to Spain to teach English, as I didn't study abroad and had always wanted to live abroad. I got homesick after two years and at 25, I thought I should try and focus on a career. I moved back to the states and in with my parents, picked up an internship at a magazine in town and started volunteering with the hope to get a position at the local public radio/tv station. After 6 months, those had gone nowhere and I picked up a shitty delivery job to try and get out of my parents place and start a life of my own. 

Depression hit me hard and after 1.5 years, I was still living at home, just driving around all day and coming home to smoke and play video games. No forward movement, no relationships, no enjoyment in my life. I needed to change something.

So I sold all my shit and moved back to Spain to be with my old friends. That's where I am now, and I don't know if it was really the best decision, but it was better than driving into oncoming traffic. I've realized that all my friends here haven't done anything with themselves either while I've been gone, and perhaps aren't the best company to keep if I'm really trying to reinvent myself, which was the original intent behind coming back.


I've got work as a freelance English teacher which barely supports me but it is ok. I would like some advice on what I should do next in life. I really like the city I'm living in, but I have this nagging thought in my head that it isn't really where I should stay, unless I can figure out some more professional job to do here and stop fucking around with English teaching. I really need to make more money so I can branch out in my interests, dress better, etc etc. 

I'm not completely against going back to the USA, but I don't know what I would do there. I feel like I have more unique skills here in Europe as a native English speaker with an EU passport, whereas in the states I'm just some other shmuck with a BA and no experience. I feel stupid and useless every day because I feel like I lucked out completely in the game of life and I've totally squandered every advantage I've ever been given (white, male, tall, from western nation, not unattractive, intelligent, socially decent) but nothing ever happens for me, and I'm never able to make anything good happen. Everything is mediocre.



For some reason, I have this feeling that I need to start completely fresh somewhere that no one knows me and just reinvent myself, but I'm too afraid that I would fall back into old patterns of sloth and malaise after a month or two and then be truly fucked. I don't know why I feel embarrassed about trying to improve myself. 

I've thought about moving to Germany and doing another degree in a more employable/higher paid field, as they have programs for foreigners there and I believe they do classes in English (though I do speak some German). I've also thought about fucking off to Asia or somewhere else and teaching more English, which I don't totally hate doing, it's just not the best career path.

Going to stop the wall-'o-text now, feel free to ask me further questions. Thanks"

3soezt,30,2015-11-13,"Need an internship to earn my Master's Degree, but lack many of the traits employers are looking for. How screwed am I?",Pictocheat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3soezt/need_an_internship_to_earn_my_masters_degree_but/,"I'm a 23-year-old male who is currently in a graduate program for applied mathematics.  Instead of a term paper, the program requires that you complete an internship in order to graduate.  After this semester, I will have completed all the classes and earned all the credits I need to graduate *except* for the internship.  The thing is, I still need to get one, but I don't think any company would give me a position for the following reasons:

- I like Math; it's my favorite school subject.  However, it isn't something I like *so* much that I care to do it in my free time.  I'm also not entirely sure what I want to do with it; I basically chose applied mathematics as a major because I generally like solving math problems.  I believe companies expect you to know which direction you'd like to take your skills in when applying for internships/jobs, but I honestly wouldn't know if I liked doing work at a specific company until I've actually worked there.  If you're wondering why I'm not looking for a position regarding something I'm more passionate about (in my case, video games), I feel it would ruin them as a hobby for me and I don't really have any other hobbies.

- I don't care which company I work for.  This follows from the previous point: since I don't have much of a preference for what type of mathematics work I do, I also don't have much of a preference for where I do it.  I also don't care whether the company is a ""leader in ________"" because practically every company I apply to claims they're a leader in something and it's like, what are the criteria for being a leading company, even, and how lenient are these criteria?  I see/hear that employers want you to be highly interested in their company (""Why do you want to work for us?"") but the only thing I do care about is that they're not involved in some sort of illegal scandal (which I probably wouldn't know about anyways going in).

- I'm not ""enthusiastic and highly-motivated""; I just want a job.  At this point, I don't care if the internship doesn't ultimately lead into a full-time position, or even whether it's a paid internship.  All I care about is that I'm able to complete my internship requirement in order to graduate.  I see a master's degree more as a means to an end, rather than an opportunity to learn.  For instance, my online project management class has weekly quizzes with multiple choice questions taken directly from the PMP Certification Exam.  I could spend hours watching lecture videos and reading the assigned articles, but the answers are on cram.com, so I use those instead (I still read the explanation given for each answer on my quiz, though.)  As for what my goals are after graduating, I just want to become independent so I can move out of my parents' house.  I don't have any personal projects I want to complete or special activities I want to do during my lifetime (I have my reasons: mainly anxiety issues, but I can elaborate further if you wish). 

- I don't have any relative experience.  The internship is where I'm supposed to be getting this experience, but apparently you need to have something going in.  And like I said above, math isn't something I care to do in my free time, so I haven't done any miscellaneous research projects or the like.  Some companies also prefer that you've completed a certain exam, but what are the chances that doing so actually helps you get a position?  If another applicant has passed the exam *and* has outside experience, they would still have a better chance than me of being hired.  And why should I waste my time studying for an exam when the job I ultimately end up getting may not have anything to do with that particular topic?  (I also have reasons for why I would consider this a ""waste of time"", which I'll delve into in a reply if you want.)

The thing I *can* do is work with groups.  I'm more of an introvert by nature and won't really talk just to be social, but I have no problem talking to people when I need to.  One of my professors also claims she has work I can do on campus that could count toward the internship requirement, but it's the same work I was offered over the summer that wasn't well-organized or handled professionally, so I'm not getting my hopes up.  I've also had two interviews before, but never made it past that stage (I'm not exactly sure why, but most likely because I didn't have experience.  And obviously I left out the more damning parts of this post).  Finally, the professors in the Mathematics department running the program said that if we got a job instead of an internship, it could still count toward graduation.  I assume a job would be more difficult to get into than an internship, so I haven't really looked for actual job positions.

Given all of this information, exactly how screwed am I, and what could I do to improve my chances of being hired?

**EDIT (11/14/15): Thank you, everyone, for all the replies!  You gave me the motivation to start being more proactive about applying to internships.  I've already applied to six positions today so far (five of them were from M&amp;T Bank and didn't require much time/input since my information from previous submissions was already saved, but still...).  I'm just waiting to hear back from a couple of my professors (who I am using as references) to update their contact information before I apply to other positions (otherwise I'd have to go into each submitted application individually and edit in the new information).

3sohmq,121,2015-11-13,TIFU by super-plugging a toilet in the factory restroom,mullyguns,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3sohmq/tifu_by_superplugging_a_toilet_in_the_factory/,"Disclaimer: This happened two days ago.

So it had been a long hard day at my job, with work piling over into the afternoon, and I was exhausted. Luckily though, the workload began to taper off soon after lunch. With the absence of my boss for the day due to a doctor’s appointment, the usual mentality of always looking busy was also absent. I assumed my usual “boss isn’t here” routine; grab a cup of break-room coffee, browse Reddit, and try not to fall asleep at my desk.

Now the thing about the coffee from the break-room is that it is shitty. And I mean that in the most literal sense of the word; you might as well be drinking laxatives. So within about ten minutes, I’m awkwardly shuffling/waddling to the factory bathroom while barely clenching hard enough to keep the Hershey squirts at bay. 

Before I continue, I want to address something: Why did I decide to use the dirty-ass non-automatic toilet-having factory bathroom that’s also 20 miles from my desk when there is a clean office bathroom just a few steps away? 

The answer: Taylor (the hot intern). Taylor decided to work late, which happens occasionally, and unfortunately her cubicle is in close enough proximity to the men’s office bathroom that she might sense something if I were to release the torrent of shit fermenting in my asshole in that toilet. Obviously not an option. So, at these times I choose to make the long trek and defile the factory restroom instead of risk the unspeakable.

I also want to quickly recount an event that happened about a week prior to this story:  There was another instance where I desperately needed to shit, and the office bathroom was off limits for the aforementioned reason. However, to my dismay  every single stall was taken in the factory restroom, save for my favorite stall (the one with funny, anti-management and union-fueled graffiti as well as apple pie scented Febreeze), which was also horrendously plugged up. I was desperate at this point; I would have pooped my pants if I had to run all the way back to the office. So I apologized to the bathroom gods and violently barraged the already destroyed toilet with even more shit, clogging it further.  I had to stand up a bit when I wiped to avoid getting shit on my hand from the mountain in the toilet.  Somehow I knew that this dirty and dishonorable act would come back to haunt me.

Now, back to the present day: Finally, I reach my destination. I burst through the bathroom door and instinctively head towards my favorite stall, but the door is sporting an “out of order” sign. ""Damn, I must have fucked it up real good."" I thought. Fine, I’ll take the stall right next to it. No problem, or so I assumed.

So I drop trou and unleash hell into that poor toilet. Once the storm is over, I pull out my phone and start checking various social media. I’m trying to burn as much time as possible so I can go home, after all. Now, this is where things take a huge turn for the worse.

As I’m viewing Snapchat stories, I hear the worst sound that a man can possibly hear while he’s sitting on the throne: the voice of a woman right outside my stall. “FUCKSHIT am I in the wrong bathroom?!” I wonder as my asshole puckers with fear. No, I shrug off the idea as I come to the realization that there isn’t even a women’s bathroom in the shop. This still doesn’t explain why there is a woman in the men’s bathroom though. When she speaks again though, I recognize her voice; it’s the female maintenance lady, and she’s speaking to another maintenance guy who also came in with her. Okay, this makes sense. They are probably just here to fix the broken toilet. No big deal. The lady will smell my ass but never know that it was me. I go back to social media and try to relax while they start working on the toilet. However, the worst was yet to come for me.

It’s been a few minutes, and I start to think about getting ready to get back to work. I’ve been in there for like a solid twenty minutes already anyway, and I don’t want anyone to get skeptical. This is where all hell breaks loose. As I reach for the toilet paper, the female maintenance lady happily exclaims “All Fixed! I’m going to flush it just to make sure.” So she does, and the toilet fucking explodes.

Now, I want you to throw away everything you thought you knew about the explosive potential of toilets, because I’m about to change your whole perspective on that. This toilet made such a loud bang, that my ears were literally ringing for a few minutes afterwards. The Febreeze that I presume was on top of the back of the toilet flies into the air, leaves a dent on the ceiling, and comes down and hits me on the head. The porcelain top of the toilet smashes on the ground. The wall of the stall next to me bulges slightly as it is barraged by a sea of toilet water being forcibly expelled from the bowels of the broken plumbing. The poor maintenance lady, she must have gotten a face full of it, and she went down hard. 

Obviously, I go into panic mode. The wall mostly protected me from the initial blast, but there is still a waterfall cascading over the edge of the bowl in the adjacent stall, and it’s quickly filling up this corner of the bathroom. I start unraveling TP like my life depended on it, as I still have a shitty asshole. I hear the maintenance lady cry out in disgust and shock as she gets up and runs from the bathroom. The other maintenance guy retreats as well. I am now alone in this catastrophe. Soon I am forced to hold my feet up and brace them against the stall door in front of me due to the rising water level, all while furiously wiping my ass. But alas, it was the dreaded shit of one thousand wipes, and things were starting to look dire. I gag as an old shitty wad of toilet paper floats under my legs. I need to get out of here.

So, with an almost clean asshole, I pull up my pants as best I can without putting my feet in the shit creek flowing beneath me, and I manage to stand on the toilet. I unlock the door and with a bound I am free; unscathed save for one damp boot and pant leg. I hurriedly make my way back into the office, barely containing my revulsion and incredulity at what has just happened. I finish wiping my asshole (no skid marks in the boxers so we good) and go home early.


**TL;DR I decide to use the factory bathroom at work rather than the office restroom. I severely plug one of the toilets, and it later has its revenge.**

I have no resume because I've never had a job before.

My hopes in getting my A+ was to get some kind of entry level help desk job to have something to put on my resume and then go from there. 

Well its not working. 
Any help desk job I look for says I need 1-2 years of help desk experience. 
I tried to look for internships and I only found one which is across town. I applied for it and Im waiting to hear back but I was hoping to find something better than having to take a 90 minute bus ride across town to get to work. 

I tried looking for active directory jobs too and those need 1-2 years of experience also. 

Even if I had the experience though, there was still hardly any jobs at all. I used 4 different job search websites to look up IT jobs and the only thing that came up was software engineering and systems administration. I thought IT was a growing market. 

How do I get experience in help desk if all of the help desk jobs require 1-2 years of experience in help desk? "

So flash forward to now, and Epic actually did reach out to me via a recruiter. It definitely hasn't been a year since I was last in talks with Epic, but I've got a phone call set up with an engineer anyways.

If anybody else has been in this scenario, or works at Epic, do you know if, because there has been such little time between my last attempt and this one, they have a ""candidate profile"" of some sorts on me, and if so, would I need to take the test again?

There's more, but you get the idea.

I don't want to quit, but I just don't really care about being here aside from saying in the future, ""hey I worked for _____"" . I mean I find the entire thing neat, but aside from that it's incredibly underwhelming.  I'm not sure if coding just isn't my thing anymore or if office buildings have lost its appeal.

Part 2.4:
https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3r9ozb/i_was_a_paleontology_student_in_the_desert_since/

Alright, I've had a lot of PM's about the Desert Rats, and now that work and school have calmed down, here's an update on them.

Do I know what they are?  NO!

I have my ideas and speculations.

Do I know what they are not?  Probably *shrug*

I have seen footprints, both in the desert and in some of the towns.  They normally don't come into areas where there is a lot of light, so you hear them, and smell them, more than see them. At first I thought it was the Paleontologists and Archaeologists making things up to scare the students and volunteers.  But, yeah, impulsive 18 year olds will go do things, like say try to find a big natural gas deposit on their own, in the wilderness with no buddy system to help them if something goes wrong.  While I've never actually seen one in detail, I HAVE seen them scuttling about.  Every time it's been a case of the things trying to get away from where I was when they realized they might be seen.

So what are they not?

They're not The Rake (from what I can tell), they're also not Wendigos (at least not from what I've read them described).

My first encounter with them was on a late summer dig (which I wrote about in part 1).  I encountered them one other time, directly.  I was out surveying for mineral deposits, trying to get rich quick on geology (and got claim jumped, but that was another story), and hadn't brought anyone with me.  I'd been out a full day, and was feeling pretty good, since I had a weeks' worth of rations with me, and plenty of water and hiking gear.  I bed down for the night after a roaming around good sized area unsuccessfully and set up camp for the night.  I let my fire die (BIIIIIIIG Mistake!) and climbed into my 2 man tent to get some sleep.  It was a new moon evening and cloudy so the night was like someone had painted pitch on a plastic dome over me, and I couldn't see very far at all.  After I had been down I heard something sniffing around, but it didn't sound too big so I brushed it off as maybe a stray sheep (prairie maggot) and started letting myself fall asleep. What I heard was a kind of deformed chittering.  It wasn't in the animal call range either, it sounded like a highly malformed human voice.  After a few moments I heard more of them and whatever they were, they crept into my camp.  In a rush they shook the tent so hard that I thought the poles were going to break, but they held, and I heard this kind of mumbled half-language all night long.  The best way to describe it is to hear someone with a severe hearing disability speak, combined with random teeth clicking noise, and gorilla-like grunting/huffing.

The smell pushed itself into the tent too, and I wound up throwing it away since it wouldn't wash out.  It was like rotted carrion mixed with soured goat's milk and coal slurry.  The voices ranged from very deep to high pitched, like a soprano singer and back.  I hadn't brought a gun with me (HUGE MISTAKE in the desert) so I tried to stay totally silent and wait it out. They shook the tent twice more in the night, and at one point I heard what sounded like fingers fumbling around the door of the tent.  Fortunately they never found the zipper!

About an hour before the dawn twilight the creatures started chattering and a fight broke out, then they ran away.  Flat feet slapping on stones as they went. When I left the tent there was nothing but these weird footprints that looked like bare human feet with claw or talon like marks above the toes.

Of course, me not being able to leave well enough alone, I had already been sniffing around, but now I started to try to really dig for details. One of the students that was there with me claimed to have shot one with a .22, but it didn't kill it.  It ran off leaving a patch of blackish blood on the ground.

Another one of the students lived in a town that was just outside of the town where the college was, and was nestled in a slot canyon.  She claimed to see them regularly, at least weekly, when the nights were really dark.  You'd flip the back porch light, and there'd always be one or two poking around in the back yard. While I visited her house once or twice, I was never there at night, so I didn't get an opportunity to try it, myself.

Most of the town was terrified of them, and if you asked about the Desert Rats, they'd just stop talking, abruptly and walk away from you. Some of the Museum staff would talk about their experiences more, though.  One of the administrators told me once about seeing one through a door.  She had a red, adjustable LED light on her back porch (which she assured me with strenuous emphasis on this point that it was for ""Scientific Purposes,"" and not for, ""The kind of thing most of you interns go for,"").  She heard a loud tapping noise on her back porch windows so she went down to take a look.  She could see a dark silhouette outside the door tapping and pushing on the windows and door.  So she turned on the red light on its' lowest setting and turned it up slowly so she could try to see what was going on.

""It looked kind of like a person, but it had a muzzle, more like a bear and not as much like a dog.  Its' skin was very thin, and I could see veins bulging in it, even in the low light.  The back of its' head was bulbous, the way a chimpanzee's head flattens at the crown and then arches back.""

She couldn't tell what color its' eyes were, or its' skin due to the dim red light.

""It was trying to get in the of the house,"" She shuttered a little, ""It was big too.  At least as tall as my husband if it had stood up fully and squared its' shoulders.  It was hunched, it probably could run on all fours easier that on two feet.  After a minute another one showed up, and this one was bigger.  It only had stubs for lips so its' teeth were mostly bare.  This one's face was more human.  It didn't have a muzzle.  Their fingers were very long and ended in talon like claws.""

""When I turned the light up too high they freaked out!  I've never seen animals move that fast!  And screams!"" *shudder* ""Like 11 year old boys, and goats, being tortured.""

She had reinforced the windows to her house with half inch thick iron bar cages after that.

When I had expressed my frustration with trying to get information about the Desert Rats to one of my friends who was a history major, he just laughed and asked, ""Why do you think all of the dorms around campus have reinforced doors that automatically close just before sundown, and lock? Why do you think this little school has more street lamps than BYU?""

He pointed me in the direction of some research, but it was all very sketchy, no actual details. However, there did seem to be a beginning to the observations of them. It was just after one of the largest coal explosions in the area.  One of the bigger newspapers in nearby area published a story about, ""Hulking night stalkers,"" (of course that particular newspaper was tragically lost in a records fire from the publisher's offices.) So all I got were off/hand descriptions of the article. The more I dug the less I found though.  It looked like there were a lot of local legends about a lot of things that the counties in the region had actively suppressed.

One night, shortly before I gave up, one of the students offered to show me something about the Desert rats.  She took me up to her room on the top floor of one of the dorms, and just after midnight she opened up her window blinds slowly.

""Watch the street corner where the light's blown out."" She whispered to me darkly.  She the took a bright white bed sheet and threw it up in the air so it spread out and reflected some of the outside light for a second, then yanked the sheet back down to the floor.

I saw at least four hunched shadows scramble from different sides of the street to the other.

""Only on the darkest nights,"" She said holding my eye contact.  ""You shouldn't go back to your building tonight...""

The reprieve was snow.  Yes the desert does get snow.  It's incredibly cold, doesn't stick very well and usually turns into ice on any surface it's near to within a few minutes.  Whenever it was snow the sighting would die down, for weeks at a time.  Winter was the main safe time.  But there was still the occasional sighting, so no guarantees of any kind of safety.

So what are these things?

No one really knows.

There are a lot of stories about boom town millionaires making a ton of money off small claims that dried up in a year or less, buying exotic pets like chimpanzees, or gorillas, then going broke, and just leaving the animals in the wild to fend for themselves, in an environment where there is often coal and uranium in semi-toxic levels in the streams and rivers. The oldest stories and what few hints I could find in newspapers showed that the local people started reporting seeing similar things after one of the first major coal mining disasters in the area.  Could be a small cut off communities’ water supply got polluted and irradiated from the mines.

A Navajo friend of mine told me his community thought they were some kind ancient people who’d become decrepit and corrupted by some of the fouler areas out there.

They could also be a unique species to the region.

Some of the spiritual thought the Desert Rats were literal Ghouls.  Flesh eating undead, maybe tragically killed outdoorsmen and miners. 

I've kept in touch with a lot of the friends I made while I was at that school, they all know I love strange/macabre things, and will report back to me with stories that they gather.  They also put me in touch with people, or tell me where to look things up.

Similar things have been spotted, over the years, further and further away from the San Raphael Swell area.  I've heard of strange sightings resembling the Desert Rats from as far west as Black Rock Desert in Nevada to as far south as Flagstaff Arizona, and north to Dugway Utah. It is clear to me though, that as the winter temperatures rise, and the droughts get worse, these things are migrating.I’ve also heard that in the areas where I first heard of them, they’re not being seen alone in the towns anymore, but in small packs.  

They’re getting bolder.

Edit: formatting

The desert was a dangerous place to start with, let alone with things like that crawling around now.  There is no way in hell I’d be caught alone in the desert now.  I wouldn’t even go in a group of two or three anymore.

When I was younger I would also do funny voices, and mess with truckers over a CB radio, and some prank calls with voices. When I was branching out in acting career, I went to the Teen Titans audition, and as fate would have. I became Beast boy. Then everything moved from there, just how life works sometimes.

Also learning embodying the heritage of the accent, really understanding the culture. Like for instance my Australian accent is much stronger because I've been there, my English accent slips more into Australian because of this.
 |Anything that exercises your voice will ultimately help with your singing. Work those vocal chords, but don't strain them. Learn exercises for your vocal chords, it will do wonders.

Now I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, but I'm starting to realize that I'm behind by a year or so. Most of the students in my intro to Computer Science are freshmen, giving them an entire year more to learn what I have only three for. I have the advantage of having more electives completed than they do, but most of the advanced CS classes are locked behind prerequisites for classes I'm taking this and next semester. Where they would normally be completing their core CS courses in the fall of their sophomore year, I'll be doing so in my junior year - before I can go onto the more advanced courses. 

Maybe I'm just overreacting, but I'm freaking out because I need to start looking for an internship in the fall of my junior year - if not sooner. Most of the places I've looked at require their interns to have a semester or more remaining, so I can't do it in the fall of my senior year or anything. 

So I want to commit to learning things, and learning them in a much shorter time. Can you guys/gals give me any advice on what I can do to prepare in a significantly shorter period of time?"

Basically, I'm stuck, I don't know where to go with programming.

It's not a case or having no time or motivation, I have lots of that. It's just more a case of not knowing what to do next.

I started programming around 4 years ago, this was using Visual Basic in my computing class. Then me and my friends moved to C# in our spare time as we thought this was a much better language for what we wanted to do.

Then I started an internship, this was making a game in JavaScript, so I learned the basics of that, and then learned Phaser.

But every time I get comfortable with the syntax, I learn the basics, but have no idea what to do with my knowledge.

Should I try working on different projects? Or should I try learning the language even further? Or both? Or a different language?

I've worked with one truly talented game designer and the other studios i have been at have essentially had makeshift designs, design by committee,  maybe game design interns and I feel like the games without a dedicated designer suffered from the lack of a focus on that roll. 

So i was curious if anyone had an idea of why i have come across so many roles essentially asking for a cross-discipline role like this? I chalked it up as maybe a way to cut costs and just put two positions worth of work on one person or possibly lesser experienced studios not understanding the full projects needs and requirements of a developer role however the last position i saw that asked for a this was at a pretty big company.

Anyway any thughts?"

Environmental Engineering alumnus, 2.85 GPA.  
Changed careers to software, love it.  
Want to go to graduate school.  
Taking CS50x and lower division Java 2 in spring. Joining a programming club at a community college.  
Want to do a PhD and would like advice on preparation to get schools to look beyond my GPA.  
Full time employed as a developer for mobile applications.  
Yes I get that I can just stay in my career, but I don't want to get a PhD for the money. I want to get the PhD for me and my own intuition into the topics of machine learning, predictive modeling and big data analysis.  
**Full read**  
I really really really want to go to graduate school for CS. I feel like I wasted my entire undergraduate on a degree that doesn't offer me the mental stimulation or satisfaction that CS does.  
I build things every day that people use and I can see the results of my hard work every day.  
I solve problems and I think better as a result of it.  
I have a deeper appreciation for logical deduction and computer applications.  
I wish I studied this in undergraduate but instead I chose Environmental Engineering because I cared about water treatment and alternative energy.  
Unfortunately, working as a mechanical engineer more or less turned me off from the field and what's worse: when I studied it, I intended on my BS being my terminal degree so I didn't get research experience, recommendation letters or good grades.  
Having said that, I want to go deeper down the rabbit hole and I want to pursue a PhD. We only live once and I would like to become formally educated in the field I am now working in but it's going to take time.  
The first step is clearly GRE but I would like some other preparation as well. I realize with a low GPA, I need to pad my application with some good highlights. I'm full time employed as a software developer and I will be with this company for a while. I think as long as I stay with my company long enough to help them out a lot, I will earn a recommendation from my employer. I also plan on telling them I'm applying as early as I know it's sure (If I get two or more recommendation letters and a decent GRE score, I'm going to tell them).  
I'm taking CS50x (one of the compelling reasons behind me wanting to pursue a PhD, I feel like my mind is blown with what I'm learning, first time in years since Calculus and Physics my freshmen year that I feel invigorated by what I'm learning). In Spring semester I'm taking a lower division Java II course at a community college and the professor wants me to participate in her programming club. She said her recommendation letter probably wouldn't help me as much as PhD but if I perform well she can try to connect me to some professors at a nearby university.  
What I would like to do:  
Prepare myself for academic computation. I'm considering Python and C.  
Get research experience with a professor, maybe try to get unpaid internships with professors and offer to build them an application or website as part of my work for them.  
Try to make myself look like I'm better than my GPA. Is this possible after graduating? I feel like I won't do enough to increase my overall GPA (I sit at about a 2.85 all considered but that's with over 215 units, my physics, chemistry and calculus grades are pretty high though, above a 3.0, it's mostly the specialized engineering courses that got me) but I'm wondering if a solid 4.0 in computer science courses after graduating will make me stand out.  
Any advice guys?  
Main things I'm looking for:  
Advice on getting a professor to accept me unpaid so I can get research experience.  
Advice on padding my GPA without an official post-bac program.  
Advice on gaining more academic related CS knowledge that's important for entry into a program."

I graduated in environmental engineering this past may and have been working for a large consulting firm since. For various reasons I've been seriously looking for a way to transition into a software/computer science. If you wan't an in-depth explanation of my history you can look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3pav9u/unsatisfied_with_my_career_path_need_help/). I've been contemplating a career change for a while now and have decided on a CS job and am ready to put my all into getting on the right path for me. 

The shortlist of my current skills/academics are: 

GPA: 2.99 (Major GPA around a 3.3-3.5).
Four internships during school (Each can provide me with excellent recommendations).
Current job as an engineer at a large consulting firm.
Rudimentary experience in programming. Self teaching Python for the past few months.
Technologically proficient. Strong in general IT/troubleshooting/hardware. Linux user since early high school, comfortable with the command line.


The best option in my mind right now is to pursue a MS in computer science. Since I have an engineering degree I wouldn't need a huge amount of prerequisites to make up. A masters would also look as an advancement to my education rather than going back for a second bachelors. My largest concern is that I fear my low GPA effectively bars me from any decent graduate CS program and that trying to get into one would be a waste of time. I was a weak student in my early college years but I've become an excellent student in my last years due by getting disciplined and hardworking. I received a 4.0 my last Spring semester and a 3.7 for my Fall. I believe I can do well on my GRE's as well. I requested a meeting with the graduate director of the program I'm looking at (my alma mater) to discuss this further. My other concern is that I'm not sure a masters in CS would give me enough practical/foundation knowledge to become a competitive software engineer. 

The next option would be to pursue a second bachelors. A second bachelors is definitely more credit intensive but as an engineer I've taken a lot of the annoying prereqs ( Calc 1-4, Physics 1-3, Chem, etc). I'd have to mainly focus on core CS courses and electives that would satisfy my major requirements. My main hangups with a second bachelors are the cost and the perception from future employers. I also feel like I'd be able to integrate my undergrad degree better in a masters program. Many topics in computational biology/environmental science/hydrodynamics are masters level classes. 

My final option would be to self teach and then try my hardest to get into a job. Many posters on this sub indicate that it is possible, but I'm not sure how well I can effectively teach myself. Seeing as my job is very long hours and very draining, I've already begun to have issues sticking with my current self teaching. This would obviously be the cheapest option but I feel would lead to lower paying/quality jobs that would be available to me with a degree. 

As far as what kind of career I want, I believe my knowledge in life and environmental sciences can allow me a lot of interesting opportunities in scientific programming. Beyond that I'd be willing to take a wide variety of jobs that can lead to advancement to better positions. Does anyone have any advice on finding a tech job with my current skillset? 

I apologize for the long post but I wanted to be as thorough as possible. If anyone has advice, experiences or even encouragement that would be great. Considering all these options has really weighed heavily on me for the past few months so having the opportunity to write this out to find a way forward has been helpful in itself. "

I have struggled with social anxiety since I was young, and was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 18. I entered university with the intent of studying pharmacy. However, I got a job teaching swimming lessons part time. I loved teaching. The joy of seeing someone understand and succeed was exciting and something I wanted to pursue as a career. So, I entered the college of Education. My marks were great and I was engaged. I had student teaching with a lot of guidance, and the most that I taught was one class a day. It was great, and I had lots of compliments on my lessons and teaching style. The next year was internship, and it started well. My placement was in an EAL class, and I got on well with my cooperating teacher. The stress and constant work at home got to me though. I was depressed and attempted suicide. I withdrew formally from my internship in order to finish my coursework the next semester, and after that to resume my internship. The coursework was great. But the second attempt at the internship was much worse. I couldn't manage my classroom and had trouble adequately planning. Like the first attempt, I took another overdose and withdrew. I am stable now, and want to go back to school, as all I require to get an Education degree is the internship. They will not allow me to do the internship in any way other than full time days, 5 days a week. I'm starting to think that teaching isn't for me. My anxiety is worse. I have 8 years to go back to my program, but I'm considering returning to school to pursue Pharmacy.

I've passed an interview last Friday at a somewhat big software firm and got selected for the technical test (final step before getting the internship). I have no idea what the test is, except it's 2.5 hours of coding and 0.5 hours of being challenged on your code by a software engineer. Also, they said that in the last 50 or so person they interviewed, only 2 succeed the technical test. So I guess it's gonna be somehow very hard.

When they asked me  in what language I would prefer to do the test I said I could do it in Java or PHP since it's what I've used the most at school. They were very not sure about PHP and said that nobody ever passed the test using PHP and that I should use Java. I jokingly said that things like interacting with the file system would be easier in Java indeed and they laugh and said they couldn't tell me more about the test.

I'm studying my data structures, designs patterns, etc. since the interview Friday in preparation for the test that is Tuesday.

I have a college degree, but not in CS. I was working in an unrelated profession previously.

Every interview I go on, every time I think I'm doing well, I get rejected because I haven't worked in an actual IT shop before. I literally had someone say to me once that I had all the things they needed for the job, but because I didn't have at least one year of experience working in an IT shop I wouldn't even be considered.

So... What can I do about this? I can do the job, I just need to get the job. So how can I get experience in a shop, even if its working for free?

I've been looking at apprenticeships and internships. All the internships im seeing want current CS students (im not one) and there aren't any apprenticeship programs in my area ( I'm in NJ).

What are my options? My github portfolio hasn't been doing it for me, I seem to need this actual shop experience."

3syiwa,1,2015-11-15,Deciding between two offers,jobthrowthrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3syiwa/deciding_between_two_offers/,"Hi, so I'm currently a senior(majored in Computer Science) who is deciding between two different offers and I was wondering if I can get some advice or insight from people who have been working for a while. The salary for both is pretty similar so that is not the big issue. My end goal is to become a software engineer or developer(not sure if there is really a difference between the two).

First Offer: Ford

This offer would put me into their IT FCG program where I would work through in three years three rotations through different departments of IT and then I have a choice at the end to roll off into whichever department I would like to work in. Obviously, I would be able to gain experience in all different parts of IT(application dev, operations, emerging, etc.). From what I've been told Ford has a better ability to move around within the company. Also, from what I've seen from the offer, their benefits would be better. In addition, it would be near where I went to college so I would be able to still hang out with my friends from college and be comfortable since I'll know more people(not sure how big of a positive this is though). 

However, my main issue with the offer is I would like to eventually work somewhere as a software engineer and I feel like the rotational program may not offer be the ability to grow as one right out of college. I've interned there before and my supervisor told me that outside of the Application Development department, any software work is essentially like the ""Wild West"" and that is what I experienced at my internship where I wasn't really given much feedback or guidance on the code I wrote and I'm not sure if I would become a better programmer through this program. Also, there is not a 100% guarantee I would even be write code in other IT departments as it is dependent on what jobs are available. 

Second offer: Lockheed Martin

This offer is to be Software Engineer Asc. at a location in Colorado. Obviously, I would be working as a software engineer helping write software for whatever assignments they would be contracted to do. The thing that appeals to me about this offer is the opportunity to actually take part in a software development process at a company. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that if my end goal is to try to be a software engineer, either at Lockheed or some other company, I think this experience would be more helpful. Also, I wouldn't mind living elsewhere after graduation and Colorado is a beautiful place.

I'm currently leaning toward Lockheed, but I still have some doubts. I've read that a lot of the systems and languages used at defense contractors may be old which might not help me later. To be fair, I have been told I would be working mostly in C++ or Java at my position. Another thing I'm a little concerned about is a security clearance. No drugs or arrests(1 ticket) and an American citizen, but my whole entire extended family lives in China which might hurt me. I don't want to decline other offers or interview requests and then find out I don't even have a job because of a denied security clearance.

Any advice would be great. Also, if anyone has worked for either company wants to provide more info that would also be great."
3sykl8,0,2015-11-15,Have been working for almost a year at big 4 company. Am one of senior most developers on team. Should I be leaving for lack of a mentor figure?,Manwith2plans,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3sykl8/have_been_working_for_almost_a_year_at_big_4/,"When I accepted this job post internship, there was a brilliant, experienced developer on the team who I felt I was learning a lot from. He retired. Two other more senior developers left. I stayed knowing that I would be able to grow by filling the vacuum. 

I have delivered valuable results since then and my manager and team value me. Still, I feel like I've mastered these systems and like the pace has slowed down a little too much. With this, and the lack of a mentor figure, I have been contemplating jumping ship. Either to another team in the company or another company. 

If I stay, I will probably be promoted rapidly enough, but I don't know how much I will learn. I have startup ambitions and want the experience necessary to be successful on my own in the next few years.

Redditors: what's your advice?"
3syoty,1,2015-11-15,Accept internship before job or go right into job?,CS_job_question,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3syoty/accept_internship_before_job_or_go_right_into_job/,"So I was offered both a full time job starting in the summer as a firmware engineer, and also was given an offer for a web dev internship for the next four months. I don't have any prior web developer experience and think it'd be a great way to expand my skillset, and potentially give myself the ability to work in the field in the future.

I'm wondering if the full time company will take offense at me trying to work an internship before then (might they rescind my offer?), or if I should say screw the internship and ask to start earlier at the full time position"
3syr2l,3,2015-11-15,"Arrogance and ego of the rising CS student ""rockstar"" - How does this transfer to prestigious companies?",csthrowaway12304,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3syr2l/arrogance_and_ego_of_the_rising_cs_student/,"I'm 29 with a background in a different field of engineering. I find CS very interesting so I decided to make a career change and go back to school for CS at a large state school in the midwest. So far I'm doing well by the standards of this subreddit I guess (projects/internships/GPA/interviews/gold star stickers/etc). Honestly I'm just happy to be able to devote a full time effort to learning something new!

I was originally excited to get involved in CS related extracurricular organizations, this is something I missed out on my first time around at school. I knew there must be people in these groups who landed internships and job offers from the ""good companies"", so I thought it would be a good experience to ask questions and get some valuable tips on how to get the most out of school. Because of course, just like everyone else it seems, I want to work at the ""cool companies"" too! Right? And above all else, it's always good to make new friends and meet new people.


My experience so far has been unexpected, though. So many of these guys with internships and offers from these Big4 companies have such huge egos/arrogant attitudes. People I see and work with all the time grumble or look the other way when you say ""hi"" to them in the hall, only are interested when they're talking about themselves, etc. I consider myself a sociable guy and I've never had trouble making friends in the past, both in school and at work. It's not the minority that are like this, either. The majority I've come across in the past 1.5 years since I went back to school are very unfriendly, arrogant, and egotistical. I understand being young and having a bit of an ego, especially when you're doing so well! But why be unfriendly?

Now for the serious question. These types of people, at least where I go to school, are the ones that are moving on to work at companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. I know a lot of the people in our CS department, and I honestly don't know any (except for 1 person) upcoming grad that's moving on to work at one of these Big4 companies that's a friendly, genuine, semi-humble person. 

So this has me thinking, what does this say about the a chunk of the people who work at these companies (the younger employees)? I know I can't generalize such large organizations with such a small sample set, but is this the average type of younger person working at one of these Big4 companies? If so, are those the kind of people I really want to be surrounding myself with 40-50 hours per week?

For those of you who do work at these companies, am I off base in coming to this conclusion? Just curious to hear other people's opinion on this, especially those out of school working at these prestigious companies. At the very least this whole experience has taught me to value the genuine, friendly people you come across even more.

I used to major in business before I transferred in to my current university so I took most of the intro classes in my Sophomore year. Now I feel a little behind and don't feel too confident if someone where to ask me to code something off the bat. I also plan to look for an internship soon and I don't feel like I would be able to answer everything correctly.

What do you, the community, suggest I and other people like me do right now to learn as much as possible for our Computer Science career. What books do you suggest I read now to start getting a better grasp at programming. I already have the c programming language by K&amp;R which I still need to read. Any other recommendations. Recommendations of what books I should read in order would be great. Maybe some awesome websites.

Also, what would you guys recommend me to do to start getting more experience in the field. I heard about contributing to some open source projects but I don't know where to begin on that. Is their some sort of guide to guide me through that? Sorry if this was not the right place to ask this sort of question, just wanted to start doing something to get on track with my career. Just a quick note, I want to get into the web development industry. So any advice on that would be great.

Some more information about me is that I have written in C, C++, Python but I don't remember that much and Java recently. I feel like if someone where to give me task at writing something, I think I would feel somewhat confident but I would have some trouble."

I am a guy, she's a girl, both of us 30 years old and single at the moment. She's always been very straightforward, extrovert, likes to party (not too hard) and she's a Catholic. I can't say we're the exact opposite, but we're definitely different, I am the typical super nerd that enjoys Star Wars, LOTR, I spend my free time reading classical novels or watching Dr. Who, and I'm an evangelical Christian, not the crazy type though. We've been friends since college, we're both engineers. For a long time we were just very good friends, then two years ago she helped me get an internship at a company she was already working, I was very thankful, eventually I was offered a position and I've been here two years now.

She's an awesome woman, I met her at one of our chemistry labs, I was barely able to talk to her, because I was too shy, but she immediately took me into her group, back then I was really overweight. Over the years I have known a few of her relationships, and I didn't even paid attention, she's always said that I'm the cutest thing, first I didn't mind, now it hurts me. Somehow we have become best friends now, I have become her go to guy (I have a few other female friends that talk to me when they need some advice, not that I'm smart or anything, probably is because I'm really quiet sometimes and they know I won't share their secrets).

Well, when I started working here she was in a relationship with a coworker, it ended up bad, I was always there for her, because I really care for her, at first not in a romantic way, but I'm afraid it has become that, and I hate it, because I don't think she'll ever see it that way. She will probably never know a series of sacrifices that I've done to make her happy, she's still very nice and attentive to me, even flirty sometimes, she hugs me whenever she can (because long ago I told her I am not really comfortable with human contact, but I don't mind about her anymore), a few people has asked her if we are dating in front of me (people here knows I'm an introvert) and sometimes she jockingly says yes, and she's the first woman that practically forced me to dance with her at a company party, the first time I ever danced.

I wish I could tell you that I'm gonna make up my mind and tell her straight what she means to me, but I have grown to love her, and I'm almost paralyzed by the fear of losing her as a friend, at different occasions she's stated that she wouldn't date friends so she wouldn't lose the friendship, and that's pretty much what I have to say right now.

**TL; DR: I have fallen in love with my best friend, but she doesn't want a relationship with a close friend and I'm to afraid to reveal my feelings to her because I don't wanna lose her**"

I am ultimately interested in pursuing a career that will hopefully culminate in a position in information security (provided I don't change my mind for some reason as I learn more in the field).

My question is this: Barring a paid internship in my area (CT), I have zero interest or opportunity to work an internship. I also will likely not have the time to work on any side projects between now and my graduation. Is this actually problematic or will it not likely prevent me from entering the field at graduation?

Additional Info: I received an email inviting me to complete the assessment for a full time position after applying for (and being rejected from) an internship in June. I attempted to take the assessment, but their system said my credentials were invalid. I emailed them over 10 times over the course of the summer, but never received any response. A little over a week ago, I received an email saying that I hadn't completed the assessment (which is true), and that if I wanted to take the assessment, I should respond and they would renew my credentials. I responded telling them that I would love to take the assessment, as well as my previous attempts to get in contact with them. Their response was essentially ""You can take the test now"".
Is it possible that my previous inability to take the test is what caused this? Should I just suck it up and re-apply in 6 months?"

This question is more geared towards next year when I (theoretically) have more skills. I'm just wondering at what point are companies willing to take me in for an internship? Specifically, what set of classes are usually required for a CS internship. My college offers all the usual courses like Discrete Math, Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, OOP, etc. I should be able to take most if not all of these by next year.

Or am I good for an internship by this summer or next fall. I'll be able to take Discrete and some course called Advanced Programming (with even more C++, some Java). In the summer, I'm looking to take Data Structures.

And how do I apply for internships? Do I just try to apply to as many companies as possible? How do you guys do it?"
3t5kkj,11,2015-11-17,Am I hirable yet?,BlueQTips,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3t5kkj/am_i_hirable_yet/,"  I'm about to start applying to jobs in my city and there are so many things I'm nervous about. I live in Windsor, Ontario which isn't exactly known for it's tech and there's this one position I've been eyeing for months now as a front-end developer. 

  I work at this said company in the sales department and want to switch, though I fear the rejection from HR because I graduated with a degree in Biology, not Computer Science. On top of that, I don't have any internships or work experience under my belt. Except for one project I completed in high school, everything I learned and created was since June 11th 2015. I don't even know if I should mention this because I feel it would be used against me for having a lack of experience, though I look at the sites they make and I'm fairly confident in my ability to replicate them. 

  I really want this particular position because this is one of the biggest tech companies in this city, and the only one I've seen that works with Python/Django. All of the others seem to want PHP/Laravel, wordpress, or asp.net. 

Every week that passes by I feel like the job is going to disappear. I checked their site again this weekend and saw that the other tech job I was interested in was just taken off (software developer). I've delayed my job applications for a couple months now due to lack of projects, but I feel I may have delayed too far and need to act now. 


I'd really appreciate some advice, reviews, or even just different perspectives on my portfolio and what I should look out for/improve/do.

I'm a 23 year old guy from Belgium that basicly won't have anything to do starting from half January and I would like to get out. Preferably to one of the big cities in Asia.  

Some background info:  
- I have a bachelor degree in applied computer science (major: programming).  
- I'm doing an exchange now and when I come back at the end of December I will have finished the biggest part of a master of business administration (not MBA, just a normal master with the same name). The only thing left to do is write my master thesis, which I can only start working on in September 2016 and which I'm hoping to finish by January 2017 (so I can graduate then).  

Apart from a summer job and an internship (both as Java programmer) I have no experience (but I don't really wanna work as a programmer anymore). I also have no money left so I can't do an unpaid internship or some volunteering thing. So I think my options are: Finding a real job, or a paid internship. But what would be the best way to handle this so I can find something within 2 months? Is it even possible? I don't have to be back by September, I think I could just write my master thesis from abroad.  "

I applied the first day it came out and haven't heard anything. I'm looking for a CS internship directed towards people with less experience (in the Boston area), because this year I'm switching from engineering to CS as a sophomore. This puts me in an awkward position, because I don't yet have the experience for difficult coding interviews, although I will have a good amount of experience by the time summer hits. Anyone else not hear back from Google? Any recommendations on similar internship opportunities? Thanks!"
3t6fdx,1291,2015-11-17,I was A Field Photographer for National Geographic,_theundergroundman,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3t6fdx/i_was_a_field_photographer_for_national_geographic/,"For the sake of anonymity I’m not going to divulge too much into my personal life. Suffice it to say that worked at National Geographic for the past 12 years as a Field Photographer. It has been one of the best experiences of my young life; traveling around the world and taking photos of things that are rarely seen by other people. I’ve shot on all 7 continents, in 164 different countries, and in some of the most dangerous conditions imaginable. In September, I decided to take a little sabbatical while expecting my first child with my wife, Ava. During my time home, I was clued into this subreddit by a friend and shown the post about the Search and Rescue officer. His stories are absolutely haunting, and have inspired me to talk about some of the things I’ve seen. 

Anchorage:

I was offered the position, almost immediately after college. After a summer of getting trained and doing mindless intern tasks in Washington DC and Chicago, they awarded me with my first rookie expedition. Whether it was a blessing or a curse, I was being sent out to the wilds of Alaska to take pictures and track migrations of Arctic Foxes along the coastline. After an upbringing in the cold New England hills, I wasn’t that intimidated by the prospect of the Alaskan winter, and was genuinely thrilled to be traveling into the depths of the arctic expanse. I wished that I was following something a little more interesting than white foxes in white snow banks, but I couldn’t complain; especially because I was getting the opportunity to work underneath a seasoned veteran AND with another rookie. That rookie was the curly haired, bookish, silently smiling Ava that I almost instantly became infatuated with. 
	
We flew into Anchorage on a blustery November morning and were helicoptered from there into the wilderness. We were given the highest-grade weather-protected materials and began to set up our campsite in a valley on the side of a steep rock face. The wind whipped around the mountain, but never cut into the inlet where our tents and fire had been set up. The team leader, worked tirelessly, ordering the two of us around to perform different tasks. By the time the sun was beginning to set, the site was set, a huge pile of firewood had been collected from the pine grove across the valley, and dinner was roasting over the fire. 
	
As we ate, he described the shots that we needed to collect and went over some of the rules with us. At first, they were simple about No Trace Camping, but then they began to switch. “Make sure that the fire is out when we go to sleep. We don’t want anyone to know that we are out here.” There was darkness now tinged in his voice and his eyes glistened angrily in the firelight. “Also, if you hear screaming never try to go and investigate. I’ve been in these woods plenty of times before. Things happen here; they try to lure you out. Don’t play their games.” I flicked my eyes over at Ava across the fire, which nervously combed her curls out of her eyes and fixed her glasses. A nervous frown hung on her face, showing apparent confusion and immediate apprehension. “Lastly, don’t open your tents in the darkness. No matter what sounds are coming from outside; No matter what sounds...” And with that, he strode up from the campfire, tossed the bones of his meal far away into the night, and retired to his tent.

Ava and I made awkward conversation for a little while after, mostly covering very vague and superficial categories. Where we grew up, what our families were like, what our interests were, how we got into photography. After an hour of good conversation, we decided to turn in for the night. I kicked snow into the fire and made sure none of the embers remained. Then I zipped myself into my tent and snuggled down into my sleeping bag. Outside the wind howled by and the light oscillated with the movement of the clouds over the moon. 

As soon as my eyes closed, the screaming started. At first it was faint, but it was so profound I couldn’t help but bolt upright. I sat there in the darkness for a long moment, waiting for another scream, all the while trying to rationalize what I had just heard. Some animals mating calls sound like screams, but none that I knew of out here. And none of them even began to come close to being that human. The air had hushed and a silence clung to the outside of the tent. The clouds passed from over the moon and the canvas was illuminated in odd blue light. Through the thick canvas of the tent, the moon looked like one giant distorted eye without a retina. 

Slowly I leaned back down and synched the sleeping bag tighter against my body. As soon as my head hit the inflatable pillow and my eyes closed, another scream echoed out of the forest. This time it was much louder, closer, and longer. Bellowed at the top of its lungs, it echoed around the tent, and felt like it was coming from somewhere in the campsite. I whipped the sleeping bag off of my body and sat in the cold darkness, fingers braced against the zipper, remembering the warning that we were given. When it stopped, I continued to hold tight to the zipper, pushing it down to the floor of the tent. After 15 minutes of silence, I let go and slithered back to into bed.

As I lay my head back down, I couldn’t help but worry that Ava had been attacked. With directions that clear and unhelpful, she could have been ripped to shreds by wolves outside, and I never would have known. Her body could be nothing more than bloody meat, choked down by a hungry pack in the moonlight. The campsite could be covered in her gristle, staining the fresh snow and sides of the tents. Her hair would be ripped out of her head and lay strewn about with bits of the padding from her winter jacket. I wanted to throw up, imagining the sweet girl I had sat across the fire from being dismantled by a furtive pack. 
	
I tried not to. But I couldn’t help it. I thought about everything else, but still she clung somewhere in the edges of my mind. The moon glided across the time as I stared up at it. My eyes began to feel very heavy with time and slowly closed. I fell asleep for only a few seconds before the scream echoed louder than ever before. It sounded like a woman was being murdered right above me. My eyes furiously opened and in the darkness, there was nothing.

I stared around the tent angrily, looking for any kind of discrepancy that made sense. Then I began to hear this odd soft whooshing sound. It began behind me and moved to the left side. I turned on my flashlight and followed the sound. And I could see it: a handprint pushing in against the canvas. The fingers scratched playfully against the cloth, pushing deep into it at certain points, and then simply dragging the nails against the side. 

I yelled at it to go away, and leave me alone. But got nothing in response. I yelled that I had a gun, which was only kind of true, and promised to shoot at it. I was a little something of a hot head in that very stressful moment. Then a voice came through the silence. It was Ava’s. 

“Adam, help me…” It was only louder than a whisper, sliding through the canvas, like her face was just pressed on the far side. She sounded pained, or drugged; oddly calm in the moment.  Without thinking my mind went into third gear and I grabbed the flare gun we had been equipped with, slid on shoes, and unzipped the flap. The cold air lashed at my face, as I help the gun in the air, pointing it in front of me as I had watched cops do in movies. I slid around the tent; stealthily taking soft steps in the fresh snow. There were no footprints, but all along the sides were these large pads, which looked a little bit too big for a wolf. All around the tent, circling, over and over again. And they were nowhere else. 

There was a line of them that started along the cliff face, circled around several times, and another line that lead on into the woods. Purely working with angry adrenaline, I began to follow the footprints into the blackness. After twenty yards of walking down the hill and into the pines, I stopped and turned back to the silhouettes of the campsite on the hill. 

“Ava,” I yelled into the blackness, and waited for her response. From the pines, her voice bled out, whispering for me to help her again. I began to move faster, using my flashlight to keep me on the trail of pad prints. At some point along the trail I realized that I had no idea what I was going to do when I found her. I was following the prints of some giant dog to Ava. But what was going to happen then. Was I going to shoot it with a flare and run away with her? A dark voice in my head reassured me that that was totally improbable. 

I followed the pads into the center of a clearing, where all of a sudden they just stopped. Almost directly in the center, there was suddenly nothing. Fresh snow in all directions. No tree to climb up into. No space for it to jump away into the underbrush. Nothing. Just like it turned to smoke and dissipated. I stared into the prints for a long time, questions continuing to evolve in my head. “Ava!” I yelled into the darkness finally, letting go of all of my energy. 

There was nothing; only the silence of the woods, and the creaking of the pines above me. I turned around and began to walk back, wondering what the fuck could have happened to her. Gruesome fantasies played out in my head, but there wasn’t enough evidence to fully entertain them. It couldn’t have stopped there; there had to be more. I stopped in the center of the trail, and shined my light down at the prints, wondering if I should go back and look again. And that’s when I saw a flashlight cutting through the trees back at me. “Adam is that you?”

Ava’s voice drifted through the trees sounding much more definitive than before. “Yeah. What the fuck are you doing out here?” I asked her incredulously.

“I’m looking for you. What the fuck were you thinking leaving the campsite?”

“What was I doing? I was looking for you.” A long confused look manifested on her face as she put her hands on her hips. If the scenario were less serious, I would have found the sassiness quite attractive. Still I had to defend my side of the story from her blatant disbelief. “You were whispering that you needed help. I was following these footprints. But they just stop up there. And I thought you were dead.”

A hard look came across her face in the light of my beam, and her eyes narrowed behind her glasses. “The footprints just stopped…” Her voice had gone as chilly as the air. “These wolf prints?” She questioned, flicking her beam towards the ground, and then back up at my face. 

I nodded silently, and she quickly grabbed my arm and raced us back to the tent. I asked her what it was, and she only said one word silently under her breath, as we ran back. “Keelut.” I was too freaked out to ask her about it. But I was thankful when she forced me to sleep in the same tent as her. As I moved my sleeping bag over, she stood over the empty campfire pit, staring into the sky, where the northern lights burned relentlessly. As soon as she zipped the flap, and we were both safely and comfortably inside, the first howl of the trip echoed out of the woods. And I would swear on my life that at the end, it began to laugh, in a dark, twisted, throaty chuckle.

I'm a student studying Computer Science, and my boss recently had a pretty serious heart attack and will be out for a long time. He hasn't been able to speak much so he hasn't been able to convey to us his passwords or what needs to be known for our place of work to continue; I work as an IT intern at a company that uses my school's network.

His computer boots Scientific Linux, and it would be really helpful to be able to access his files. I am a serious child when it comes to security and breaking into things (aka I have little to no experience) but I booted the computer into Ubuntu from a flash drive and was able to -sort- of look around, but his root folder seemed to still be inaccessible and I am honestly not even sure if I was snooping around the right places.

I know this is probably a very stupid question, and I probably seem very uninformed, but that's exactly it; I don't know much about this subject and my work is dependent on me to find a way to get access to his files so we can understand where he was in terms of a lot of projects he was working on. He keeps to himself until he is done with something, and he is halfway through documentation on half the things he is doing but it is all local on his computer and we honestly are stuck like fish out of water right now.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, even if it's just pointing me somewhere else.

Light googling tells me that rent is high there.

Doesn't sound so good. However, I am international student and I switched to CS very very late. I'm only taking Data Structures right now, and have only a bit of web design  experience which I got interning in my own country. I get the feeling that I might not be able to get interviews from good companies(little to no experience), and if I do get them, I might not be able to pass all rounds (I'm not bad at tech interview questions, just haven't covered a lot of the topics). 

I have a feeling that this might be the only offer I might get. 

Should I ask for a 4 week extension and say yes if I don't get anything by that time? Should I keep interviewing even after that? And say no in February or something if i get a better offer? (I honestly feel as though ANY other software engineering internship would be better in terms of location, pay, work, experience)

The goal is to get good enough for big firms next year. What should I do in this case?"

So, I've been attempting to get my degree for quite a while.  I started at community college, switched to a 4-year, dropped out, moved across the country, attended community college again, switched to a 4-year university, and now I'm limited with my remaining federal financial aid.

I have a few years of software development work experience under my belt from the time that I was not attending school, but decided to switch to computer engineering from my previously decided major, computer science.  I have low paying job prospects lined up writing software, but job prospects nonetheless.

I technically have senior status with the number of credits I've completed, but major-wise, I'm really a sophomore/junior hybrid.  I'm not incredibly confident in my knowledge and ability, however.  In order to continue receiving financial aid, I had to petition the school and agree upon a course plan for my remaining two years.  I'm in my first of the last two years right now.

*That said*, I really want to find an internship.  To do this, though, I would have to not take classes in the summer, which is part of my agreement.  It would essentially put me back another year.

Would it be better for me to just finish, get my degree, and then look for some entry level position?  Could I possibly find an engineering internship while I'm not in school?  I understand that isn't typical.  

I suppose a possible option would be to finish, get my degree, find a job, *any job*, and just keep attending classes part-time while paying cash for tuition, applying to internships and other jobs that way.  I'm not sure how kosher that is, though."

MIS is a blend of computer science and business admin. I changed my major half way through my collegiate career so I haven't had a whole lot of time for an internship trying to catch up. Another contributor to that is that I had a bad semester my freshman year which honestly discouraged me from applying for an internship. Since then I've gone 3 semesters with 4.0s and brought my overall GPA to a 3.3 with one more semester to go before I graduate. I've made A's in almost every class related to my new major (MIS). How do I leverage this in an interview and how will employers respond? Not only do I have limited work experience in my field (I worked IT Helpdesk for a year) but my transcript is basically periods of really good performance after a period of really bad performance. I've been told that my major is in really high demand and that there are more jobs than there are people to fill them but our most valuable skill (Oracle/database development) is taught once a week in a night class our senior year and I'm not that great with it. It feels very similar to Accounting which I what I left for MIS. Where do I begin my job search? I'm willing to travel anywhere in the world as I have grown up in 5 different countries and I speak some conversational Japanese. I currently work as a student business consultant for local businesses in the region for the business school of my university on hourly pay but that will end once I graduate.

3t8c66,2,2015-11-17,Just out of Highschool with a decent amount of college credits. Advisors have not helped much so I really need some help.,Mrka12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3t8c66/just_out_of_highschool_with_a_decent_amount_of/,"  Hey guys. I've had some anxiety recently because I realized how many choices I have to make and that I actually have to learn now, not just get decent grades. I would really like some advice. I'm going to provide background, but if you just wanna look at my questions they will be at the bottom.

    I graduated highschool this last june. Last 2 years of highschool were spent full time in a community college. I had to take a bunch of shit highschool classes so I didn't get enough credits to transfer. Like any idiot highschooler I barely tried. Ended up with a 3.5. I know it's not good enough, but in recent classes that i actually tried like calc 2 i got a 3.7 and calc 3 I have a good chance for a 4.0. So far in the cs classes I took I got 4.0s. Attempting to transfer to UW bothell. A little easier than their main campus. Still not good enough right now. People have told me i need a 3.8. I would like to note my grades are low simply because I didn't try. Sounds like an excuse but I believe I could have easily gotten a much higher grade in every class I took.

   I have a number of problems. First of all I have literally no idea what I want to do. I don't know what specific job I want. I don't know how to program. All  I have taken is intro to cs, c++ 1 and am finishing java 1. I don't know if i want to program. From what i've seen it was pretty fun. I like trying to get code to work. Problem is I learn nothing in class. 90% of c++1 and java 1 was doing projects using code we did in class or ones i found online. Tests are jokes. I feel like I can program well enough by using things like the internet or my book, but off the top of my head I really don't know much. I think my grasp of logic is pretty good.

   I know I've only done intro classes so I shouldn't know much, but every time I read this sub i see people talking about how they were programming as a kid or they have been on github doing open source stuff their entire life. I just enjoy computers and was always good at math compared to everyone else so I chose programming. 

   So I guess these are my actual questions. Can I still be a successful programer without having done it all my life? 

   People keep telling me to do github/open source, but how am I supposed to participate if I can't really program? Also, where would I even start? Is there a place I can look for projects to contribute too?

  I heard interviews for internships are similar to job interviews but just easier. When do you guys think i should start applying, considering my minimal programming knowledge?

  Should I spend time outside of class learning java, using online tutorials? If so, which do you recommend?

  What are things I could participate in outside of class they could make me look better to a university?

This is my first post! :) So here is the back story. I am an intern for a company. I get school credit for this job, as well (yay!). Over the summer, I did a really good job (said my boss) and my evaluation went well. They were really nice and extended my internship until the end of this year (I am thinking around December 11th is my last day). They gave me a project for this semester, as well. For this project, the project manager left the company. I went to another manager and asked who would take over the project so that I could report to him/her. I told her it was okay if she couldn't get back to my as soon as possible with the answer because I had so much work (in school and individual work at my job) that I wasn't in any rush at all. This was at the beginning (August). She said she would let me know, but never did. I should have reached out to her and other managers, but I never did because my school load got extremely tough and my internship got neglected a bit (my company allows us to work remotely). I didn't neglect my work completely, but I slowed down quite a bit. Some work still got done, just not all. My school sent an evaluation to my managers and I have a meeting tomorrow to discuss my evaluation. I don't know how to explain myself and my actions (in a nice corporate manner) and I want to tell them that I'm sorry for not reaching out... Anybody have any tips on how to deal with this in the corporate world? Is there a certain way to say things or certain things to say so that I don't get straight 0's on my evaluation? Sorry if this post is extremely confusing... Any help would be amazing!"

However, how simple can a project be to still add value to the resume?  I don't want to rush anything too complex and look silly if they ask to see it and the code's sloppy.  Neither would I want to explain the project in an uninformed, naive manner.

A class project I've been working on is a SQL project that requires us to have drawn an E/R diagram and implement the SQL statements necessary to create it.  Also, we execute basic select queries on it and we'll be accessing the database to perform transactions on it with Java.  Would something like that be worthwhile on a resume, or is that trivial?  

Whatever I list, I want to emphasize Java and/or SQL, as Java is the main language I've learned in CS and I enjoy using SQL.  And it might go without saying that I'm targeting jobs that want Java knowledge along with relational database knowledge."

Im currently in my first year community college doing freelance computer aid and working an IT internship. Ideally, I'd like to work in InfoSec

* Cal State Dominguez offers much cheaper tuition and much more relevant course work. 

* Additionally, getting in is easier and would take much less time. No calculus or physics needed.

On the other hand, people say UCLA and UC Berkley are more prestigious and give you better connections, however.

* Their coursework is almost entire focused on programming and the tuition is way higher. 

*  The prerequisite classes I would need to take to transfer in would keep me at community college for at least another year. A shit ton of calculus and physics.

Does it really matter where I graduate and what major? 

The wiki author states:

  &gt; Best option is a Computer Science degree IMO. This is mostly because its what HR and hiring managers are asking for. Keep in mind, this does not mean you have to be a programmer. The Comp Sci curriculum teaches you a strong foundation of how computers work.

Do you agree with the above?

If I went to Dominguez, I'd still learn Java and C++ but learn a helluva lot more IT sec coursework at a cheaper price."

I just don't feel happy anymore, but I don't feel sad either - I just don't really feel much of anything.  There are distractions, but those only last for an hour, maybe two - when I drink they last longer, and I end up forgetting for up to a day, but then it just comes back.  Sometimes, I'll just look at porn all day, and that at least keeps my mind away.  I'm a PhD student, and I'm failing my classes.  I don't really have any friends - I had friends, back at home, but here, I only have acquaintances.  In fact, I felt like I'd found a group of people that I actually enjoy being with - that was a year ago, and I had about 8 months to spend with them.  Then it was gone, and now I'm here, in a cold, dark city, surrounded by ""friends"" that I'm not very fond of, and I feel that they're not that fond of me.  I always told myself that I'd work hard and happiness would come later - now I'm at the university of my dreams, as a PhD student, and I'm realizing that I might not be smart enough or strong enough to do this.  Sure, if I fail out this semester, then I'll be able to find a job afterwards, but what then?  I had a year of work experience before this, and every single day was the loneliest, most depressing experience of my life.  I had no friends, nothing to look forward to - the only thing I actually looked forward to was the end of the internship, but there's no end like that when you start your career.  I always think about it, and I always come to the conclusion that I should just end it instead of living in my deathbed for the next 50-60 years.  Because that's what it felt like, and these thoughts scare me a lot - I daydreamed today about what the least painful way to die would be, what I would write in a note, if I would write a note, how could I do it without anyone knowing for the longest time, or maybe there is some way that I can do it without hurting my family.
Is there some secret to life that I've been unaware of my whole life?  Am I missing some integral part of the human experience that would make me whole?  I'm not asking for people to talk me out of anything - at this point, it's just a hypothetical that's been developing very very slowly.  I hope you don't think that I'm doing this out of some need for attention from strangers - I honestly just want help.  These thoughts scare me, and my growing yearning for nothingness scares me."

So I have roughly another year left. I have no professional experience in the field nor do I have any prior internships. 

1. What internships can I apply for? I can't apply for some like Microsoft Explore because I'm not a sophomore/freshman. 

2. When asked my education level (specifically in google), do I put down bachelor's or master's?

3. Should I wait until January to start applying or should I do it ASAP? (Holiday season)

5. Can somebody provide an example of (redacted) resume/cover letter that received an interview/offer?

Until about a month ago I hated programming. I only wanted to be on the hardware side of things. Now after getting a lot of hours of goods choosing practice under my belt I want to become a developer. I understand what I'm doing now compared to previously when professors just gave the class code that we had to alter before turning it in. 

The problem is though that I have an awful GPA. My circumstances are a little odd but the jist is I got really sick one of my first semesters which takes my 3.2 down to a 0.73. I was advised to not withdraw. Bad then I also was a music major so I didn't really care about anything but my music so never took classes seriously. Really just screwing myself over. As a result of me getting sick I physically couldn't play my instrument anymore. This lead me to change to IST. 

At this point I got the GPA back up to 2.0. Since going through the IST program I now have a overall GPA of 2.49 and a major GPA of 2.75. I've applied to a lot if internships bit have either been rejected or no answer whatsoever. It's making me nervous about what it's going to be after I graduate.

I started out as a hardware tech intern for about 6 months then my manager hired me full time as a support desk level 1 tech. Though not a traditional role I did a lot of AD/Network administration and worked closely with our server teams, application teams, and our networking team as well as the regular old break/fix answer calls helpdesk stuff. So I have a pretty decent handle on a wide range of things at a young age.. Things went south at this job when my coworker left and I got forced into having a 2nd shift I didn't want but I only had about a year full time experience at this point so I was doing what was necessary to get more working experience so that when I either left or asked for a promotion I could have the equivalent of a college degree. I stuck it out for another 2 years (so 3.5 years total at this company between intern and full-time.) I got increasingly frustrated and basically asked for my shift back because I was told it was only gonna be ""a couple months"" and it seemed permanent at this point. Me and my manager had a bit of a falling out because he kept trying to use the excuse that he ""needed to see more out of me"" - meanwhile I'm doing work for him that would typically get paid much much higher, top performer on my team consistently, and my coworkers knew I was getting the shit end of it. so I found another job at a different place and got a nice 35%-ish raise from what I was previously making, this place has great benefits and my coworkers are awesome.. however 6 months later after starting here and I'm just getting no where, there isn't enough to do because they have the IT department so fractured into little teams that only handle 1 thing each and don't give access to other teams. So I'm getting extremely bored and I think I'm actually getting worse as an IT professional because I'm not handling the same volume as I was, I don't have the higher level projects anymore and I'm not allowed to do anything with AD, Servers, Networking.. etc all the stuff I used to love doing. The one thing thats keeping me here is they have fantastic benefits and I can attend a very very good college for basically pennies of what these actual courses cost. 

I never went to college so I would definitely love to be able to take some classes/ get a degree to put on my resume but my two issues are...

* I don't want to keep having days where I can spend hours on reddit at work and still be told I'm doing a great job
* I have no idea what classes I want to take to get into other areas of IT.. I was very interested in Networking &amp; server work but I feel like too much about servers is going to get automated so I don't want to bank on that.. I'm also interested in programing/app dev/software dev.. but I know if I stay at this current job I'm not gonna be able to touch any of those things unless I move teams which will be a pain in the ass because I'll have basically one thing to do all day in another team

should I stick it out and take classes or should I find another job? I know I can probably make more elsewhere but other jobs don't have the same benefits I have at my current employer.. So I'm not really sure. Its driving me nuts wasting a lot of my time just sitting in a chair browsing reddit, I want to get back to doing work that matters and keeps me interested in IT 

Any advice is greatly appreciated as to leaving/staying or suggestions of different areas of IT to explore to maximize my potential and earnings.. "

2. Does the difference matter with degrees in Software Engineering or Computer Science?
3. How do I go about proving my knowledge in certain programming languages?

I'm sure I know it well enough to list it on my resume. How well should I know a language like C++ I can expect to be able to answer interview questions that test not just algorithmic abilities but test my knowledge of that particular language (at the level of an intern)?

So far the stuff I've done in C++ havn't involved much of the stuff I learned in my object-oriented programming class; stuff like polymorphism, operator overloading, templates, etc. My projects aren't big enough to require that kind of stuff but I could review them easily.

Is it just a coincidence that I don't know what a guard object is or does it mean that there are huge gaps in my knowledge of C++ even for a potential intern."

I currently work full-time as a Customer Service Rep with a Software Company making 35k. I recently decided to go back to school to finally complete my degree in Computer Science. However, since I can't attend school in person due to work, I have to go to school online, specifically Dakota State University.

My main question is should I shoot for getting an internship somewhere out west during the summer and potentially quit my job? My main concerns with staying at my current company is that they use .NET and Delphi to develop their products and I really, really do not want to work with those the rest of my life like I'm scared of being shoe-horned into that role if I actually start working with those languages and frameworks.

I'm leaning heavily towards mobile development as I have done Android Development in the past and I love it. I haven't necessarily dove in iOS development yet though. 

I've always wanted to head to the Bay Area (or similiar area) and work for a company out there. That's what I aspire to. However, that is basically across the country for me. So, my thinking is that I score an internship somewhere out there  and that way I can start to gain experience which will hopefully be in my preferred area of development. I would actually love to work for a start-up.

The one issue with quiting my job is money during the winter/spring. But if I save up enough and pay off enough of my debt, I might be able to go back to school in person. (Only 22 years old, just credit card debt and a car). 

I dunno, am I just being stupid for thinking about quiting a fairly stable job for a few months of work experience?
Anyways I apologize for the long ramble and hope someone can help me out. 
Thanks!

I've been fortunate enough to receive two job offers for full-time starting early next year since I'm graduating in a month. One is at a big 4 company and the other is at another tech giant (not listed as the big 4 usually but it is a massive tech corporation..)

The big 4 role will have me doing team selection after I accept the offer, so I won't necessarily know what I will be working on which is a risk. The other offer will have me doing low level C development at the OS level working on a distributed file system.

I'm not terribly interested in C development, especially at the OS level, but I've heard that it can be very beneficial for one's career coming out of college.

Another point to consider is that the salary for the tech giant offer is much higher than the big 4 company's offer (before negotiations). I basically got the entry level salary that they give all college hires, especially those who work in the Bay area, but I would be working in a satellite office in a very cheap location (just a little above national average in terms of cost of living).

I'm really unsure of which one to choose at this point. One offers a lot more financially, although I haven't really negotiated with the big 4 company yet to see if they could match it or come closer to it, but even matching it would be less considering the cost of living difference between a large metropolitan city and a city with under 100,000 people. However, another downside to the tech giant offer is that it doesn't have very many college hires or just young people in general, which is something I disliked about my previous internship this past summer.

Salaries by the way are between 90k-100k (starts with A) for the big 4 company and 105-115k for the tech giant (starts with O).

* They will not pay for me to fly out there so I would have to use my own money to get there.

* It's contract to hire for 6 months. They would pay me $20/hr then bumped up to 45k - 50k annually after the contract which sounds really low even for a junior dev position

* I would have to move to an area with almost no family and actually be making less money because of rent/food/etc since I live rent free here.

Working?,mribdude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3tdt99/how_to_deal_with_a_coworker_that_never_stops/,"So this is one of those weird ones and I really dont know how to approach it from an upper management perspective. I'm a relatively new dev, graduated last year with internships every summer and now two years working full time as a software engineer. Started at my current place in August and my coworker started a few weeks after me. He's a code boot camp graduate that found programming in his late 20s. He's a studious guy to an insane degree (reads an entire textbook on some language in a week). 

So now to the problem, he's kind of a hokey guy as well. He literally never sleeps and he works on stuff all day like 15-20 hours. Normally it's whatever, it's his time it's what he wants to do. But lately it's been pushing pressure onto me because he and I are the only two devs on our team (don't get me started about two junior devs being the sole individuals on a team). Whereas I seem more focused on actually delivering a tangible working project, he seems more apt to live in a theoreticall design experiment. Because he never stops working he'll take his two weeks worth of stories and finish them off in 3 days. Then he goes off and starts designing stuff for our future projects down the road. Now he's bringing shit up in meetings and making it sound like I'm not pulling my weight because I'm not reviewing the 30 iterations of a database schema that he's decided to take down from a fairly well done rdbms design and turn it into a one table schema with 5 recursive joins to get a basic task done, that we agreed not to do but he did it anyways and he's done all of this in a week. 

He's sending me hip chat messages at 2:30 am with new schemas, holding meetings with senior devs and executives with models that I fundamentally disagree with and not telling me, and is telling execs that we can't move faster because I'm not approving his stuff. I'm dedicated to the cause I put in 9-10 hour days and do extra work when needed, but I'm simply not being paid enough nor would I be willing to work his schedule. How do I bring this up to a manager when my lead is basically, ""you've got to tell him to stop working so much because it makes me look like a jackass and I'm not willing to toss my entire life and work his schedule?""

Am I off here and just not seeing it, or is this just kind of obnoxious?"

I received my BA in mathematics in 2012 and took a year off. I went back to pursue a MS in computer science in 2014 from a CSU. I just started taking graduate level (200+) courses. So I have roughly another year left. I have no professional experience in the field nor do I have any prior internships. 

1. What internships can I apply for? I can't apply for some like Microsoft Explore because I'm not a sophomore/freshman. 

2. When asked my education level (specifically in google), do I put down bachelor's or master's?

3. Should I wait until January to start applying or should I do it ASAP? (Holiday season)

5. Can somebody provide an example of (redacted) resume/cover letter that received an interview/offer?

Best,

Ed."

I want to keep my anonymity, so what do you guys rank in terms of culture, engineering prestige, ability to learn, and overall package? If that deadline was hard, what would your decision be for each company (as in, say Amazon gave that hard deadline. What would you do? Or Microsoft, HubSpot, or Epic)?

Here is the information I know about each company for internships:

Microsoft:
~$6800/month 
-Free cafeteria
-Ability to work on some cool projects like VR and health
-Relocation + Housing in Redmond, WA

Amazon:
~$6000/month
-Free coffee
-Free housing + relocation in Seattle
-Rigorous code reviews to really improve in software development

HubSpot:
~$5600/month
-Free coffee, candy, snacks
-Ability to work in a fast-paced environment
-Very focused on front-end
-No housing/relocation, based in Boston

Epic:
~$5000/month
-Free housing + relocation to Wisconsin
-Healthcare software where you are given an individual project (usually) to work on
-Fast paced environment

Finally, would it be worth declining that offer to pursue interviews with the other 3 companies? How would taking an internship at one of these companies line me up for a full time job?"
3teilt,1,2015-11-19,Should I include this on my resume?,_Prolific,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3teilt/should_i_include_this_on_my_resume/,"I've been a long time lurker but decided to get some feedback on this. I'm a junior in university (Computer Science &amp; Business double major) currently applying for software engineering internships for summer 2016.

I got into programming in high school and like many others I started doing game development to get my feet in the door. I was a big RuneScape fan at the time and eventually found my way into the RuneScape private server community. At first I started developing a RSPS with a few friends to learn about the RuneScape protocol, but after a few months I decided to launch my own server to the public (Jan. 2012); needless to say it became relatively successful (75k+ registered users, 5M+ pageviews, ranked top 10) and to this day I am still running it with a team of ~10 others (developers and community managers). I would be lying if I said I haven't made any money from this project, it has helped me pay for most of my living expenses throughout college. 

It has been an extremely valuable experience in my mind, as I have learned everything from website/game server development to database administration, security, hosting, marketing/advertising, financing/budgeting, general business operations, team management, and most of all I know the RuneScape protocol from top to bottom (wrote RS framework from scratch, ~105k LOC including game content). I have spent thousands upon thousands of hours developing and growing the project/community, but recently I have branched off and I am trying to become more serious about university and my future. I have several other projects (both academic and personal) that I maintain alongside this, but this is without a doubt the largest and most successful one. 


Now let's get to the point. In my mind this is very similar to something like a Minecraft private server, however RSPS carry more legal issues, and Jagex Game Studios has been known to shut down RSPS that become too popular or that rake in substantial amounts of money. On top of this, even though myself and several other developers have written the server source code from scratch, we are still making use of an older RuneScape game client that has been significantly reverse engineered (thus breaking several of Jagex's terms and conditions, copyright infringement). 


My question to you is, do you think it would be wise for me to include this on my resume (in either projects or work experiences)? Or do you think it should be left out due to its 'gray area' of legality (and if so, are there any ways I can still show my experience that I gained through it (perhaps through another project, or offline version)). 

Any feedback or tips are greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

I have a higher cert (2 year) in software dev but am also about 2 years out of the market. I currently work in retail. 

Backstory: Went to college. High grades year one, medical issue cropped up year two. Failed year 2 due to a lot of medical absences. Repeated and scraped a pass. Failed year 3 for the same reason + situational depression. 

Moved closer to only consultant in the country that deals with my issue. Took first job I could find. Sorted medical side of things over 2 years. Stable now, no more absences expected. Looking to get back into IT now that I don't need to focus on the medical side as much any more. Also looking to move back to less expensive area near the college and repeat year 3 if possible, which requires internship for 3 months.

So. I've identified where I want to work. I have 9 months before the course restarts and about 15 months before internship is  required to start.

I want to begin putting together a relevant portfolio of work and go back over course content, with an aim towards approaching the company within 3 months.

I'm not going to claim that right now I have any relevant skills. I'm rusty in every area. That will change. 

What I would like is for anyone with relevant experience in web hosting / sys admin to help me build a checklist of marketable skills to focus on over the next 3 months, and any ideas for projects that would get me the job in your eyes.

Rusty skills: 

- Programming in Java, C, C++, SQL, JavaScript.

- Servers: Windows and Linux basic command line.

Hardware: Can build / repair computers quite handily. Only listed as rusty because my own rarely need work and the market near me for repair work is overly saturated right now. 

Customer Service: 2 years experience in a busy retail position Customer facing role at the service desk. Deal with returns / complaints and other issues on a daily basis while organising floor operations.

Going on shift now, so I won't be able to answer anything here for a few hours.

Thanks for the help in advance!"

After college I did a few jobs in QA testing just before the recession happened and during the recession I managed to get a few temp jobs in the same field, but in between I spend long periods being out of work.


For a time I returned to college to do a minor certification in web development and learned the basics to creating personal websites and made my own for demo purposes.


In Spring 2012 I managed to get a content management job for a small startup. The pay wasn't great but I was grateful to have the job.


After a while I figured the job wasn't going anywhere, but I was afraid to leave as the unemployment in my country was really high. 


So I decided to study the Cisco CCNA (R&amp;S) while I was still working and passed both exams this year.


I tried to apply for networking and IT helpdesk support roles. The agents said that even though I had good qualifications, the clients would likely choose people with more experience.


So I applied to volunteer for free at different places and managed to get a part-time job at an English language school.


I generally just help out with classroom desktops, installing and reinstalling software and helping with networking problems that might happen.


Initially I was going to do this up until Christmas (started in September), then in the new year I'd apply for another volunteer position elsewhere to add more variety. 


This morning my supervisor at the school told me that in the new year he's going to start on a large PHP project and will need more people on the job. He recommended that I could join as one of the beginners and gain experience in programming and in the long run I could make good money in later job.



I said that I would think about it. 


I always put off my programming. I found it hard to get my head around when I was in college. I also found that on some jobs you try to learn one language (like python or java) and then another language becomes more popular for another job.



So I figured that I'd like to focus more on the infrastructure aspect of I.T over programming. I was also studying a few security certs like security+ and would later do the CCNA security.



The programming intern may be good experience, but I feel like I might be giving up on the IT helpdesk aspect.



Any advice or suggestions?"

I graduated and found my first full time software engineering job. That being said, I'm not doing so well. Before joining this company, I had two internships, and I did pretty well. I implemented a lot of new and important features and was well liked. 

In this new position, I've mostly been fixing bugs. There's been a few bugs I've been able to fix, however, there's been consecutive bugs that I've been stuck on for more than a week. The senior dev, who I'm working under, is getting increasingly angry. But I'm not getting increasingly better.

The software I'm working on is quite old (more than 10 years) and large. I can't seem to wrap my head around it. I'm not used to how a lot of the way the program is coded. The way the projects I worked on in my internships were structured are not how this program is structured at all. Also, I didn't fix bugs a lot in my internships so I don't have that skill.

I don't really like going to the senior dev for questions because I feel like she is little help. I ask how one part of the program works and her response is, ""well what do you think"", then I have to keep prying until I get an answer. I see that she wants me to think about the problem, but overall it just discourages me to go ask for help. Also, a lot of times when I ask a question, I'm directed to ""go look at the log"", which I feel a lot of times, is like looking for a needle in the haystack.

There are other devs that are some times helpful. But no one completely understands the project. A lot of times I'm working on something they are not familiar with and they can't help me at all. And weirdly enough, the senior dev has recently told me NOT to ask the other devs questions. Instead I am to ask the senior dev questions almost entirely through email. There's also no documentation or comments to be heard of for the project.

**tldr: I am a new grad working on a huge legacy project and sucking at fixing bugs. Both because I'm not good at fixing bugs, and because there's no documentation or comments. Also working with a senior dev who is very hard to work with/approach.**


How do I improve? The senior dev is getting increasingly tired with me. I'm trying my best, but I just can't wrap my head around this code. I've read a little of ""working effectively with legacy code"", but it seems like its suggestions are to find some who knows about the project. In my case, no one really knows every thing about the project."
3tfjk1,25,2015-11-19,Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering not getting me any jobs. (Explanation inside.),DuckHuntHotDog,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3tfjk1/masters_degree_in_electrical_engineering_not/,"I've been dumped off in the unemployment fun-zone recently and have been searching for jobs for the past 2 months with no success and just a lot of automated 'sorry but you didn't make the short-list' letters in my inbox.

I think the long and short of my problem is this:
I have had experience and classes in a variety of fields including digital circuit design, RF circuit design, CAD simulations, computational electrodynamics, digital signal processing, digital image processing, laser physics, antenna design, C, C#, C++, Matlab microwave circuit design and even quantum electrodynamics. So basically it boils down to the fact that I spread myself too thin throughout my college career. I'm a jack-of-all trades and master of none and no one wants to hire someone who isn't prepared to handle specialized work.

I don't have extensive years of experience in any of this. It's pathetic, but I only have a mediocre thesis, some mandatory lab experience, and a short internship to my name.

So for the first month, I applied to hundreds and hundreds of industry jobs. That has worked out about as well as playing the slot machines since there are a lot of people with the same degree I have and better-equipped to handle the job.

So having actually completed a research thesis in Electrical Engineering to achieve my Master's Degree, I have recently been trying for academic jobs again believing that the academic side left me too unskilled and inexperienced on the hands-on side of things for industry jobs. But that having some degree of experience for the academic side would give me better chances.

I am actually managing to get interviews for the academic positions, but even then I hit a roadblock when they ask me about practical lab experience because I honestly have none and it probably doesn't help that my current situation has caused my confidence to plummet so my presentation skills are now garbage.

I'm not blaming anyone but myself for this obviously. I didn't listen to or pay attention enough to the need for specialization and just did whatever looked cool to me at the time.

I had a really bad case of subject ADD. I didn't know what I wanted to do, I still don't know what I want to do. Frankly, I don't care about what I want anymore, I just want to be able to fund my expensive hobby of paying my debt from school and my livelihood.

My situation is so pathetic, I can't even get a stupid internship with my Master's Degree. A damn internship. Who the hell can't get an internship? Me, apparently.

What do I even do at this point? Should I keep trying for PhD positions at all? Should I keep trying for industry positions? Should I just start flipping burgers?"

I wanna thank you all over here - this has been a tremendous resource for my career.

I am a sophomore in a top school (not US, but most companies recognize it as very good). I interviewed with Google recently and successfully passed the technical interviews. Thanks to y'all here - couldn't have done it without you :)

I am in host matching phase, and from what I understand (the opinions on this are very extreme), there is a good chance I may not get the internship. But I really want one. I don't want to completely waste my whole summer.

I applied to Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Quora, Intel. Only Google and Quora got back to me. Quora rejected me. (BTW has anybody else applied for an internship at MS or FB? Have you got any email about it?)

So I really want to apply to other companies to have backups. Of course, the companies that I could possibly intern at must be a fit for my experience:

- Languages
 * C, C++ (with over 20-30 thousand lines of code - I'm fairly good at competitive programming)
 * Python (about 2-3k lines of code)
 * PHP (about 3k lines of code), and MySQL
 * Javascript (about 1,000 lines of code), Node.js, MongoDB

(I know LOC is not a proper estimate, but it gives a fair relative estimate of my abilities.)

- I would really prefer the internship to be in the US.

Basically, I'm good at backend stuff that involves algorithms, data structures. I suck at graphics, testing, and front end.

I'll be happy to give any more relevant profile information that will portray me clearer.

Thanks guys, I searched a lot for possible companies, but couldn't find any. Thanks again :) :)"

I don't even look at companies like Google/Amazon because I've read so much about their grueling interviews and I know I can't compete with the straight A geniuses from MIT or the likes.

And then there's me.

Whereas the first story follows more of a cryptid storyline, this one stands more in the realm of urban legends. I consider this to be one of the most unsettling moments in my history. Not scary, just plain fucked up. It’s something that still sits in the back of mind. And I hope it sits in yours too. Enjoy. 
First story: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3t6fdx/i_was_a_field_photographer_for_national_geographic/

Two years later, I had touched all the corners of the states, bathed in the oceans, and was frothing for new territory to cover. Following an extremely arduous trip along the Yucatan Peninsula taking pictures of the migrating Monarch Butterflies for a documentary on North America, I had bigger and better dreams. Aside from one possible interaction with a Skinwalker in the desert, nothing truly bizarre had happened to me since the meeting with the Keelut in the Arctic. 

Ava hadn’t been assigned on any missions with me in a long time. She had also picked up some idiotic boyfriend she had met while taking pictures of New England foliage. It was sickening, but I tried to think about other things. I missed having her around, even if all she wanted to do was scold me for being too headstrong or beg us to stray away from danger. We made a good team. Unfortunately, no one else thought so.

Besides, after two years, we had enough experience to be in charge of our own investigations. We had a brief encounter in Chicago once, where we both happened to be getting our new assignments at the same time. She breathlessly exclaimed that she was being sent to the Amazon to take pictures of the rare Orinoco dolphins. If you don’t know why she was ridiculously excited, it was because these are those super special dolphins that are actually pink. Lastly, she was excited because Mark got named to her team. 

I smiled happily for her and excused myself to go find out where I was going. Dreams began to run wild in my head as I imagined all the spectacular places they could send me. And then all of the terrible places they could send me. I might have just quit if they gave her that, and made me go back to Kentucky. Thankfully, as I walked into the room, that wasn’t what was by name.

“Miedzyrzecz Bat Sanctuary”. I said the words breathlessly, more confused than anything else. I honestly wasn’t happy or sad, angry or disappointed. I was simply and solely impartial. As I loaded onto the plane and stepped out into the airport in Warsaw, my excitement had finally hit me. 

And this is where I’ll be completely honest with you all. This story has absolutely nothing to do with the caves filled with bat eyes, staring down from the darkness. This story takes place when all of that is said and done, the photos have been taken, and I return back to Warsaw. I had one final day in the city, before I was scheduled to fly back to America. And in that tiny little bit of time, things got real interesting.

At this time, Poland had just been accepted into the European Union and was in the early stages of becoming a bustling new superpower. Construction was happening all around me, as I walked through the city streets. The other members of the team I was working with took me out for a tour of the city, and then we went to a soccer game at the 10th Anniversary stadium. The sky glistened with stars throughout the whole game, and afterwards we went out for drinks. After a few drinks downed, we all parted ways, and they called a cab for me. As I waited outside for my cab to arrive, I began to get fixated on this black car that had parked on one of the side streets.

Now, it was almost three in the morning, and this was one of the only cars out. The others were all yellow taxicabs, but this fancy looking sedan was jet black. Also, it looked like it was straight out of the past, as if it had driven off the pages of a textbook or from a 1950’s era billboard. In the semi-darkness of the night, I couldn’t make out anyone inside, and in the oddest way, I got the feeling that no one had driven it. I stood there, outside this bar, and waited to see if anyone would come out. But no one did. 

Being bored, drunk, and overly curious, I decided that I was going to walk over, like I was just in the neighborhood, and check it out. As I approached, I saw that in the darkness, the car was full. In the drivers seat was a man dressed from head to toe in all black. A black trench coat snugged up to his neck, and his face was covered with a black baseball cap and a pair of dark sunglasses. This again, was curious, considering that it was nearing three in the morning. The passenger seat sat bare, and the most bizarre of all, was the back seat, which was occupied by three nuns. 

As I passed by slowly, the driver’s side window rolled down and smoke began to pour out of the car. In the smoky haze, the man stuck his head out, tipping two fingers along the top of his cap. His glasses gleamed in the streetlight and I felt transfixed by his stare. In a gravely, dark voice he smoothly asked “Would you happen to know the time?” 

I was caught off guard at first. Not because he had asked a question, but rather because it was in English. Everyone else so far had talked to me in Polish than began to try other languages while I stared at them in disbelief. After a few seconds of wrapping my head around it, I checked the time on my phone and told him. He nodded, smiled a toothy grin, and rolled his window back up. Never bothered to thank me. 

From there, the car, started up again, and took off, leaving me in a cloud of exhaust smoke. Through the dense fog, I could see the headlights of my cab pull up, and I jogged over to meet up with it. As I approached the window, I could see the young drivers face contorted into a shocked countenance. His skin was pale white and his eye’s large in his head. As I reached for the back door, he hissed, “Volga, Volga, no. No. No. No.” He kept repeating this until I closed the door and he sped off. 

I sat dumbfounded on the curb and called for another cab. While I waited my mind raced and I tried to figure out what had just happened. When the next cab pulled up, I happily got in, and had a conversation with the driver in very broken English. At the end, I told him that the previous driver had freaked out when he saw me and started repeating the word “Volga.” As I paid the man, he silently, put his hands over his heart and looked into the stars. Then he made the sign of the holy cross in the air and said, “Son, I bless you. For you have witnessed he who wears all black and live to tell the tale. His curse breathes your air now.” 

The next morning, on the way to the airport, I rode in the same cab as Sasha, who was one of my interns. I told her about the crazy night that I had and she began to flip through her phone absentmindedly. Or so I thought. Finally, her face went pale and she feverishly began to scroll down this page. 

“The Black Volga is a luxury car reportedly driven by the Devil himself. All throughout the 50’s and 60’s it drove through the streets of Eastern Europe picking children off the street and using them as unwilling blood donors and sacrifices for the rich and famous that had leukemia. This practice has since gone out of fashion, but it is widely believed in urban legend, that the Devil was the main driver. He would appear late at night, dressed in all black, and ask someone what the time was. If they answered, they had been considered to give their soul to take. Considering any kind of wording, this person would therefore be marked for death.”

She looked up, and frowned towards me. “So, there you go.” 

We decided together to stay another day in the city after that. Something lingered in the back of my head as I sat at the airport that made me feel uneasy about the whole situation. Sasha agreed to stay with me when she finally saw how freaked out I was. And it was a good thing too.

That plane went down. Said it got struck by lightning in the air. Only one guy survived. They claimed he had gone mad. I did research years later and found him. He told me from the confines of his room at the mental hospital that he saw a man dressed in all black standing on the wing of the plane. He said they locked eyes, and he asked the man for the time. He was too scared to do anything. He blacked out. And when he came back to consciousness, he was in a hospital bed. 

So, I don’t know what to think. I guess I cheated death. But maybe its all just a crazy coincidence. There’s really nothing to say either way. Sasha thinks it was divine intervention; God shining through and saving us from going down. She said it was the cab driver’s prayer. But I still think I’m marked. And one day, the man in all black will come back. And I’ll ask him for the time.

I have also applied for the University of Houston for their Chemical Engineer program and still waiting for their decision. I'm just wondering that if I got accepted to UH, should I choose Chemical Engineering at UH or Computer Engineering at TAMU? I personally think that TAMU has more reputation among the US, which I think will be really helpful with internships and connections. My goal after college is having a good and stable job in the Houston area, so I think going to UH shouldn't be a bad decision either and also, the chemical engineering program at UH is actually a pretty good program. I research a little bit and see that computer filed is growing rapidly while chemical engineering is growing a little bit slower these years. Any suggestions and recommendations are all greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Yesterday, I received an offer for a Co-op from January to June for a Fortune 500 company. It includes $18/hour and free housing.

I also received a lucrative offer for a summer internship for another great company and I accepted that as soon as possible.

The question is, should I take the Co-op and work 9 months straight including the internship, or reject the offer and just do the internship? I also have to make this decision by this Friday, which gives me little time to think about it.

Pros: Great work Experience, $$$, networking

Cons: Working 9 months straight, relationships put on hold, have to miss 2 quarters of classes, no relevant class credit

I am asking as many people as possible... my parents said to take it, my friends said not to... any advice?"

I'm going through a discrete math course right now, and I guess it's nice to know even though it won't help me too much in regards to programming.

My question is, when's a good time to start applying for internships? I know internships are about learning, but surely there has to be some sort of expectation. While on the topic of resumes, I'm a college student with a few irrelevant part-time jobs under my belt. Should I just focus on my education now and the skills I've (somewhat) developed, or should I include everything? It's not going to be a lengthy resume, which worries me."

Are they worth it?,DamnDishwasher,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3thwtg/unpaid_experiences_are_they_worth_it/,"I know /r/cscareerquestions strongly recommends against unpaid internships, and I entirely agree, but I have a sort of unique situation, and I am unsure if it should be treated in the same way as a traditional unpaid internship.

My situation is this: I am a sophomore computer science major studying at a community college. A small local software development company has recently reached out to the programming club I participate in, and offered some of the members an unpaid ""mentorship."" 

I thought this was an interesting opportunity, so I scheduled a meeting and explored further. The mentorship would essentially consist of this company providing an environment for students to come work on personal projects and have professional developers
available to assist and guide the students with their work (think: incubator). I would retain all rights and ownership of my work, though it would be listed under the company's banner as something built at their facility.

So, my question is, should I go for it, and is an experience like this at all useful on an application? I would be participating for the next 3 months (a time where other internships are not available, and I have no school), using the time mostly to work on some volunteer programming that I have been doing, as well as my personal website. It seems like, at the very least, this experience would be useful on summer internship applications, and provide an atmosphere where I am forced to be productive. 

Any thoughts or advice will be extremely appreciated!"

My peers are scary with their portfolios. A project here, an internship there, a PATENT as well. It seems that some of these guys were mentored in programming as soon as they came out of the womb.

I started focusing heavily on programming way later - senior year of high school.

I'm learning to program now in my spare time, but I've come across a dilemma: 

I want my programming skills to be top notch. I feel a need to make my code elegant, my UI well-designed, and so on and so forth. I've done extensive reading on what makes a ""good programmer,"" and everyone says that good quality code is what is wanted.

So, in response, I tend to learn a little more slowly, making sure that my fundamental understanding of a language and its uses is very, very rock solid. And I also make sure that my programs are extremely legible.

I want to be a good programmer who make good code. Not one who adds heaps of dog shit to the dump of unreadable and thus un-maintainable programs.

The problem is, I don't have that much on my resume.

I see my friends with crazy ass amounts of applications and the like on their portfolios, and I'm scared that I don't have enough. I look through their programs though, and they're poorly written, hard to follow, and have little to no documentation.

But I've also heard that you should just ""ship, ship, ship, ship, ship, all that matters is shipping."" And I feel that my college's CS program, as well as employers everywhere will only like me if I have a lot on my resume.

What do I do?

3ti2pi,1,2015-11-19,"Writing a thesis at a major company, company supervisor gave me a topic that has already been researched. According to academic and university rules, this renders the thesis topic dead. What should I do???",czechchequechecker,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ti2pi/writing_a_thesis_at_a_major_company_company/,"Dear /r/Advice,

I'm in the last semester of my business bachelor studies, and thus I am now doing my thesis at a major company where I have done my internship before.

Our thesis has to be done at a company, and the topic for the thesis must originate from a problem that the company has.

Before I started, I had to wait for a month because of the recent major issues that the company had. Anyway, Then it took another 2 weeks because my supervisor still didn't have time due to the crisis. No problem so far, but I had to ask my university for an extention, given the circumstances, they allowed the extension.

A few weeks into my research, I discovered that all the research I was intented to do according to my supervisor, has been already done by the department of my former colleague during my internship. Another problem is, that the thesis relies mainly on internal data, and this data happens to be of the kind which cannot leave the company premises. My university usually has a clause for confidentiality, but the company policy has determined that not even a clause can permit me to access and write the data.

In short, my supervisor gave me a thesis topic which has already been researched and finished. He also has contact with the department that has already done this research, thus he should have known this! Even if the research hasn't been done, I wouldn't be allowed whatsoever to use the data, let alone write it down and show it to my university supervisors. 

I am basically without a topic, and I need to find a new one. I still have to talk to my supervisor who gave me this topic and determine what steps should be taken next. 

Also, I get housing from the department, and if I would terminate the thesis/internship, they would terminate my housing, and I would have to move back home which is 700 miles away! I intend to stay at this company, however would prefer to go to another department.

I blame my supervisor for not informing me that the topic I got has already been researched. I cannot continue, as it is against the rules of my university and academics to basically copy or ""rewrite"" of what already has been done. The topic is dead, and I won't risk anything.

-How do I talk about this with my supervisor?

-How can I keep my housing? Blame him and ask for extended housing until I find an new topic within the company?

-How do I deal with my school? They already gave me an extension and it might be too late to start with a new topic. They would shift me to January, and I already shifted from September to November when it comes to the Thesis Start.

-How do I explain this to other parties (potential future new supervisor at another department). Should I be honest of what caused my former thesis topic to fail, or should I cover it up?

-Should I inform HR? Should I inform the head of the department? Should I keep quiet?

-Should I even ask for a damage compensation, since I basically wasted 2 months in this department? I got housing and 2 dollars per houd, but I will graduate 2 months later, at best, and I already have to take a loan to cover all of my expenses here anyway.

-Lawyer?

TL;DR: Writing my thesis at a major company. Company supervisor gave me a topic. 2 months in, I find out that everything that I should research for my thesis topic has already been researched. Company Supervisor should have known, since he is weekly in touch with the department that informed me about this. Academic and university rules state, that I cannot research anything that already has been researched. If I still would continue, there is a high risk of failure and in the worst yet possible case, that my thesis will be considered a fraud, which would ban me out of the bachelor studies. I have to find a new topic, and I have to talk with my supervisor about it. I need to keep my housing until I find a new topic, somehow.

Excuse me for the chaotic story, but I'm still a mental mess. I'm still shocked, and I don't know what to do really."

My grades have a strong upward trend, along with my difficulty of coursework and commitment to extra curriculars. I had very strong college essays and letters of recommendation from the Dean of Yale and two other teachers who taught my advanced classes. The teachers witnessed my academic and personal growth throughout the year, so I am hoping that their letters are as strong as they hinted them to be. I have had a lot of exposure to the medical field and have a strong drive to help my community and give more than I take. My passion for medicine has been influenced by various personal challenges and hardships that I elaborate on in my essays, as well as a plethora of wonderful career experiences. I do hope to eventually go to medical school but I am keeping an open mind and want to explore my options once I get to university.

Please let me know if I formatted this incorrectly or if this should be posted somewhere else.

2. Don't listen to the people that tell you to take risks - risks can destroy your life. Why through away a safe source of good income?

I'm sure there's a happy moderate place in the middle but I'm interested in what you think about it. Industry veterans are appreciated on their take on this as well.

Don't rush into grad school either.,CityLiver12345,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3tjuj3/a_recommendation_to_college_grads_who_hope_to_be/,"I'm living in New York and graduated seven years ago, so my experiences are very different...plus, I'm sorry if these are obvious, recommendations. 

Anyway: 

1) treat college as a job recruiting ground--every department connection (do you have an adjunt that might have a sweet internship/volunteering recommendation)?, every friend in your major. It really is who you can turn to down the line and say, I need a job.

2) The horrible thing is literally every entry level job these days seems to expect college students to learn all the skills one might need for a mid level job. 

There are some common things--stuff you'll learn writing for your papers, but....know more than that. If you can learn Quickbooks (big plus in entry level office jobs in any major company) for basic accounting, do it. If you can learn Adobe Creative Suite for a school paper, do it. If you can write for ANYONE, in any recreational respect--group blog, online school newspaper, personal tumblr of reviews, TED Talks--do so. 

I am applying for receptionist jobs now but the major employers hiring want creative types with experience. 

Go on Craigslist and really take a look at the internships and the software asked for the skills....now.

3) Don't put off going to your career services office.

I'm very lucky, that's one thing my school got right. 

It takes four years to build up basic computer skills, poise to get through an interview, write a good resume tailored to a specific job, get used to the grind of writing cover letters, and develop transferable skills that will get you in the day to data entry/analysis, event planning, coordinating with clients...all of which can be tailored across different fields into jobs to keep a roof over your head. 

I wish someone had taken me by the hand and warned me a decade ago,  but I was forced into graduate school for a field I had zero interest in that was highly specialized and horrifically underpaid. 

I would not go to grad school unless you MUST--I'm sure those of you in the medical or engineering fields have to. It's a huge waste of money and physical energy. Be very careful about the program you choose and their requirements to graduate (the fieldwork, the reviews of professors, the number of credits assigned to ""x"" number of work). I've seen it all. Try to get as high a gpa as you can now based on the same criteria and if you can't get into a graduate school with good accrediation and a strong career placement for you field...RUN. Really, just fucking run in the other direction. Look into another route. Get your GPA up some other way. 

See college as the first step feeding up the ladder into employment. 

The sad thing is it's wonderful and you're learning how to write and think as a community but employers give fuckall about giving you that experience in the future until you can demonstrate basic, technical use to them, generating content (again--even for a basic receptionists or data entry job for an industry that specifies they only need a receptionist, but interviewed as if they would only hire someone with 5 years experience performing the same content creation tasks they did) or demonstrating office experience. 


You need to have all these skills for jobs that  might pay $13/hour.

Get it now, even if it's unfair you should be obligated to treat this time as job training time too.

P.S. You can totally count on campus jobs or that 3 month internship/stint. "

So little backstory. I'm a 18 y/o student(male) who does a internship at a IT company I just started a week ago what makes this even worse. Today when we had our regular lunch together everyone was asked a question about a certain occurrence. The question was : What if a girl punches you or hits you in your face? I understood the question as what if a girl hits you sometimes in the face what will you do back? Well of course I thought like if I get randomly punched or hit in my face I'm gonna hit her back. What I meant was like keep her under control by either holding her back or holding her tight so she couldn't hit me anymore and calm her down. Now they think I'm the douche bag of the company which will harm females and hit them. 

TL;DR: Answered a question not in a good way now I'm a girl puncher and the biggest douchebag."

Little bit of a background, I was an intern at a company for about a year, and we handled small businesses that were too small for their own IT department. So this includes remoting into people's PC to fix issues and stuff like that.

On to the main story,
So we just upgraded our biggest client to new computers, new servers, new everything actually and the CEO requested that we would disable the games that come with Windows 7, and that users couldnt install any software.
So we did no one could play games or install software if they weren't allowed through the filter that was the CEO.

CEO calls a week after installation of the new hardware;
&gt; Me: Good afternoon speaking with Mooiweer16, how can I help you?

&gt; CEO: Hello I have a problem with my PC would you be able to remote in.

&gt; Me: Sure, give me your ID and Password of teamviewer please. *remote into his pc*

&gt; CEO: Ye could you please look at this: he had a notepad open that said ""Could you please install solitaire""

&gt; Me: Euhm, sir you asked us to disable that.

&gt; CEO: *Starts writing in the notepad* I know but i'm done with my work and want to relax for a bit.

&gt; Me: Sir why aren't you talking?

&gt; CEO: *Starts typing* I'm in a room with 3 other people, if they know i asked this of you they would think i was a hypocrite.

&gt; Me: Okay sir I will enable it again if you could do me a favor.

&gt; CEO: *Starts typing* What kind of favor?

&gt; Me: Well my internship is almost ending and summer vacation is just around the corner so I would like to have a part-time job in the vacation.

&gt; CEO: *Starts typing* Done, come to my office next time you do your maintenance here.

And that's how i got my summer job, and had a good laugh with my co-workers. 

CEO was actually a pretty cool guy.


TL:DR: CEO doesn't want anyone playing games, asks me to enable it for him, got a summer job."

Company is very large and although isn’t big 4 level it’s still considered one of the high tiered companies. The offer I got is around 70k, much less than I expected. Classmate of mine got an offer with this company in different department last year for 78k, lower GPA, and didn’t even have an internship with the company. I also have 3.85 GPA from top 30 school.
Salaries for this position on glass door LOW end of the range is 77k. My manager really likes me and mentioned that when considering salary he would take into account fact that I was part of their team for nearly a year already.


So far I was only contacted by HR for this offer, manager is on leave for some time but he said I could contact him about questions. Should I email him and ask for more because I was honestly expecting about 10k more.

 
This job is in a location that I don’t really like so I’m not happy about the amount at all. I’m about half a year from graduating no other offers.

 
What the best course of action to approach this?

 
I’m honestly considering not taking this if the salary is this low because I would much rather earn 60k in a location I am from than 70k here. "

But I'm incredibly frustrated after getting the ""thanks but no thanks"" email today from one of the bigger SV tech companies after my initial interview for an internship with them.

I honestly don't understand the interview process, though. I'm smart, and I'm capable, and I am good at problem solving given that I have all the typical resources I would normally have at my fingertips. All my CS class grades have been A's and B's, and I have a pretty good grasp of the languages I've studied. For the interview, I studied and practiced for weeks, and then I finally had my first technical interview on Wednesday. The guy barely introduced himself, gave me an intentionally vague question (which is typical, from what I've read/been told), and then hardly spoke a word as I tried to figure out a solution to it. 

So how does this tell anyone what kind of a worker or a developer I am? I panicked in the moment and as soon as I hung up the phone, I knew I should've used recursion to reduce the problem until a workable answer was there. (I also could've brute-forced the solution, but I assumed that wouldn't be the answer they were looking for.) In the end, all the interview did was frustrate me. And isn't it incredibly subjective to allow one random engineer on the team to evaluate someone in under an hour? 

I'm not switching paths or careers. I'm determined to make it as a developer. But goddammit, this interview process seems ridiculous. "
3tn76c,60,2015-11-20,Callie,eimedallas,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tn76c/callie/,"I’ve never been the best dad. Even now, after ten years of practice, I’ve never quite got into the swing of things. It’s not that my wife’s children are hard to get along with or that they misbehave. It’s just me. 

In some ways, I suppose this all started with my internship for Mike Peters, a professional man with a thirst for the outdoors. Usually, I was tasked with small jobs such as making tea or running errands, things any nineteen-year-old guy could be trusted with. But one day, Mike had an idea – he was going to venture out onto one of the recently charted islands just off the coast of our town to record notes on wildlife and film a little, and of course he wanted me and the rest of the crew to back him. Well, I sure as hell wasn’t reluctant. Anything to get away from the robotic responsibilities I had to deal with on a daily basis. 

Honestly, I don’t want to spend time describing the voyage and the island itself, because they were both what you would have expected – motion sickness on an overcrowded boat and a lot of trees. And I mean a lot of trees. So much so that when I finally wandered away from the daily rituals of staring at bugs and plants, I got lost straight away. And that’s how I found Callie. 

Tiny, curled up under a tree with a gun by her head and one shoe missing. At first, I thought she was dead, or that I was simply imagining her. I took a few hesitant steps towards her and that’s when she was awake. I can still remember her eyes – large and gold, staring up at me under thick lashes. She seemed confused, her head tilted to one side a little, and I kneeled down beside her as to show that I came in peace. 

For an hour we stayed in silence, then for another we talked. I had to tell her that my name was Glenn before she told me that hers was Callie, that I was nineteen before she declared very proudly that she was six, that I came from off the island before she told me she had no idea where she was from. I wasn’t sure what to make of that. But I couldn’t leave her there, so I held out my hand and we found our way back to camp together. 

When I look back, it’s clear that I entered the island an immature kid and left as a parent. After a series of doctor’s visits, check-ins with the police and ‘found child’ posters, Callie came to live with me in my tiny apartment; because that’s the only place she would go. No doubt, I was terrified, but I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride. When it became clear that no explanation to who she was or where she came from would come, I enrolled her in school, and I got a real job. 

We had a rocky start because neither of us knew what we were doing. I couldn’t braid hair or cook proper meals, and I was late to pick her up everyday. But we got there. Eventually, I sent her on her way with her wispy hair in two perfect plaits, learned the basics, was there at the school gates when she ran out and – most importantly – was granted the honourable title of ‘dad’. Things seemed to be perfect. 

Then the first letter arrived. Scrunched up, brown paper with only one sentence scrawled across it: She doesn’t belong to you. 

Obviously, I thought it was somebody playing a strange prank and crumpled it up, throwing it into the trash immediately. The only thing I was concerned about was how freaked out Callie would have been if she had read it. I thought it was the last of it.

But another came the next day. And the next. One after the other, all with that dumb ass writing scrawled across them. When it was hard to ignore, I contacted the police, but without any signature or address, or even CCTV footage that showed the assailant posting things through my letter box, there wasn’t much they could do. They advised me to ignore it. And I tried. God, I tried. But then the accusations turned to threats. Whoever it was warned me that they knew where we were, that they would come for her. I didn’t think twice – I collected Callie from school straight away and we left town to my sister’s house. I remember the fear in my daughter’s eyes as I feebly tried to explain that there was a leakage in our home, so we couldn’t go back for a while. I knew she didn’t believe me. 

Once again, the police offered no help. They said I was probably overreacting, that a neighbour was playing a trick on me, but I couldn’t see it that way. I gathered up all the money I had left, quit my job and moved far, far away from our old town. I even tried to ask Callie if she could remember anyone being with her before I found her, but she couldn’t. We were puzzled, but once we had left town the notes stopped as quickly as they had started. We could once again live in peace. 

Until one misty Tuesday. I can remember everything about that day, because it was the day Callie had art and she was practicing her drawing on the steamed-up windows of the bus. Because it was the day that the boss brought in lunch for everyone because it was the end of the year. Because that was the day that I, so immersed in myself, didn’t notice who dropped a crumpled up note onto my desk. A note that said: I’m coming for her. 

I’ve never run so fast in my whole life, but even so, by the time I reached Callie’s school there was an overcrowded mass of parents. I searched for her yellow raincoat in the crowd, waiting for her to show. But she didn’t exit the school. The teachers didn’t know where she was. The parents didn’t know where she was. Her friends didn’t know. 

I didn’t know what to do first, so I multi-tasked, yelling for her in the surrounding area while yelling at the police between breaths. A full investigation was opened and the note was taken from me as evidence, but no good came of it. I couldn’t find my child and neither could they. When I say I did everything I could, I mean it, but it just wasn’t enough. It’s never enough. 

She’s still missing. She’d be sixteen now. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t miss her, that I don’t wonder what the hell happened. My wife has been good to me – she coaxed me out of my unbearable sadness just enough to feel again. I try my hardest to care for her kids, but yesterday, something happened. 

I woke up from an hour long nap on the sofa to something being forced through the letterbox. Barely able to walk, I slumped off into the hall and saw what I had always dreaded – a note. A note that read, ‘I’m coming for her.’

Without a second thought, I raced upstairs into my step-daughters room and straight to her crib where I had set her down to sleep. And she was gone. I freaked out, my heart pounding so fast that I nearly fainted. Slowly, I slid down the wall, and waited for the subtle ‘clang’ of my wife’s car door as she returned home, but it never came. She hasn’t returned home, her two sons have not returned home, and her daughter has gone. 

I’m sitting in the station writing this down. My hands are shaking and my breathing is irregular, and I’m just about losing it because the more I think, the more I remember my wife – how she knew exactly where I lived when we first met, how she could guess my name, how she had lost her oldest daughter in unthinkable circumstances but never showed sadness. 

How her eyes were gold, always staring at me under thick lashes.

I graduated from a UC in 2013 with a degree in Computer Science. My first three months out of that degree were spent job searching, with almost no luck until a company reached out to me. I had only done two technical interviews with companies prior to the one that hired me. Started at ~$70k for a engineering job in the Bay Area (which was fine because I was living at home with parents anyway). At that job I learned a lot about developing in Javascript, working with a team, and working with teams between disciplines. In terms of theory, I learned very little as a lot of my theoretical knowledge came from my university experience. What I did gain was knowledge and experience in how the development cycle worked, and how to contribute to a team.

For the first year and a half, everything seemed fine. I was ramping up slowly and becoming more comfortable with being an individual contributor to the company. A few months ago I was put on a PIP for a number of reasons, including code quality (accidentally breaking builds) and getting distracted (by things like Reddit, ironically) at work. I spent the entirety of my PIP working towards improving on these things. In the end, my manager had said I improved but thought it would be better to let me go from the company. Foolishly, I thought I could overcome the PIP and didn't look for jobs in the meantime. In hindsight, not knowing I could resign before getting let go is knowledge I would bring with me to future jobs and knowledge I fully regret not indulging for this situation.

Now I feel stuck, not knowing where to go from here. I've interviewed with a few companies with varying degrees of success (in person interviews, multiple rounds of interviews, no offers yet). It's only been a couple months but I feel my hope deflating. I'm not sure how to balance using my time applying for jobs while learning new skills I could bring to another job in the future. I know I definitely want to stay in the CS field for my next job. I have lied about the reason I was let go from my company a couple times, which I have since learned is a big no-no. When companies ask me why I was let go, I try to now be as transparent as possible. The more time that passes, the further I feel my opportunities slipping. 

So, /r/cscareerquestions, am I screwed? What can I do to assure companies that I am better than the reasons I was let go from my first and only job? Is it bad to start applying for internships at companies despite having professional experience? I honestly don't know where to go from here."

It's one of the nine specialized high schools in nyc and its harder than other high schools so my GPA is lower, sadly, but my school said that the high school profile that they send to colleges will make colleges understand that this is a very competitive school and the lower GPA would be more understandable.

Alternative school is where they put all the kids that have behavior issues. I'm in alternative school, because I was sleeping in class, and not getting along with people.

Alt school is a repository for all the kids that the normal school system has given up on. Also everybody I go to class with lives at the school, because it doubles as a jail/juvenile detention center.

Anyways. I've been going there for a year or so, and I'm so goddamned done with this shit.

I got moved to a new classroom 2 weeks ago cause I got into a fight with another student, and now I'm in a room with the dudes that actually live there. Anyways theres 2 teachers in the new room, and I only know 1 of them. 1 of them is my old teacher, and 1 of them is an intern. 

The intern is borderline mental. 27 year old fratboy dumbass who will fuck with you all day long, and when you get mad he goes ""WOE BRO IM JUST MESSIN WITH YA CALM DOWN!"". The other day I was sitting down doing my work, and Captain fedora walks up, and says ""Hey Arv...Do you know what the capital of thailand is?"" I said ""Nah man I dont"" He yells ""BANGCOCK!"", and then punches me in the balls as hard as he possibly could.

He does shit like this to everybody in the classroom, and most of the people in there just let it go, but every once in a while somebody gets pissed off at him. Today I was talking to my buddy outside while everybody else was playing basketball, and I swear a lot when I talk. Just in normal conversation, and not even on purpose its just how I talk. I'm talking to my buddy, and the intern tells me to stop cussing. I say alright, but a few minutes later I said fuck by accident, and he got up, got a football, and threw it at me as hard as he could. He picked up the football, sat across from me, and said everytime I cussed he was going to throw the damn ball at me. 

Like I said. I don't cuss on purpose it's just how I talk, so I ended up slipping up a few more times, and he threw the ball at me a few more times trying to hit me in the dick, or head with it. On the way back to the classroom he asked me if I just said ""fuck"" to my friend in line. I said I did, and he walks over to me, and punches me in the fuckin balls as hard as he can. I kind of laugh it off with my friend, but this guy is seriously getting on my nerves at this point.


We get back into the classroom, and I sit down, and he tells the other teacher I was cussing. I told her he was punching me, and shit, but of course he was ""just playing"". He looked at me, and denied hitting me in the first place, and I just looked at him, and said ""Are you for fuckin real man?"". He says ""I thought you learnt your lesson about cussin"" I say ""Apparently I fuckin didn't, because I still am"" He starts gettin mad, and yelling at me saying he will ""knock the shit out of me again"" if I don't shut up. I ended up just walking out of the room, and sitting in the hall til my ride got there. 

I know this is long as fuck, and probably missing a few pieces, so lets just recap.

TL:DR 27 Year old teacher aid threatens/punches/fucks with me (15yo guy), because I was cussing in class, and he regularly fucks with people in the classroom. Gets away with it, because he's ""just playing"" even though I made it pretty obvious I wasn't in the mood to deal with his shit. What are my legal options?

Edit: Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention all the shady/bizzare shit that goes down at this school besides the intern/manbaby.

1. They have put people in solitary confinement (Safespace) for weeks at a time before.

2. A friend of mine was sentenced to 6 months of jail there for TRUANCY!

3. The school has conducted random drug tests before. No warrant no probable cause no nothing, and if you refuse to take the drug test then it counts as a fail. Bye bye 4th/5th amendment rights.


4. Because the school is also a jail I'm in a room with guys who have commited real crimes, so between the violent criminals, and the intern I am always an inch within danger.

5. Cells in the jailhouse are the size of a broom closet. Theres a bunk bed, a dresser, a toilet, and thats it. Also theres plenty of petty offenders being forced into conditions like this, because something sketchy as hell is going on here. I mean they have a guy living there now for the next 6 months, for truancy...

Is this shit legal? What do I do?"

For Apple, I would be working on almost kernel level stuff. It's the kind of thing that is very low level and could potentially be in kernel (not user) space. It seems kinda scary lol.

What would you guys do as a jack of all trades master-of-none coder? What are the pros and cons of each. In your opinion what should I go with? What would be the best professionally vs socially vs ...?

I was offered an internship at JPMorgan for the position of Tech Analyst Intern, however the title is throwing me off a little bit. I wanted more of a software engineery type internship, but the title for the internship suggests otherwise. 

However, the then other curveball is that the description for the internship from my school's career services site (where I applied for the on campus interview) suggests that it could potentially be a full on software developer position that I would want.

Here is what the description for the job says:

And to cap it all off, you’ll be invited to attend senior speaker series and a whole host of other exclusive events to meet colleagues and senior leaders to develop your professional network. You’ll also have the chance to join us full-time after successful completion of the summer internship and upon graduation.
In Software Development, you will have the ability to work across the complete life cycle from analysis to development, testing and implementation. You’ll gain an understanding of business challenges and needs across the firm, learn to develop smart and secure technology solutions, and innovate to create best-in-class user experiences, processes, products and applications.
In Infrastructure Engineering, you will participate in the development of high-performance infrastructure service offerings to help build and manage some of the firm’s largest and most complex business initiatives. You will engage in the design and development of innovative computer, storage, and networking solutions on platforms such as those used for trading or credit card processing with unparalleled scale and complexity.

3tp2yv,2,2015-11-21,"Applying for CS and HCI masters programs, and need some reassurance or guidance!",gradschoolhopefully,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3tp2yv/applying_for_cs_and_hci_masters_programs_and_need/,"So, a little backstory on me as an applicant. I currently attend a pretty good public university (best in the state and considered one of the ""public ivies"" by some), where I'm in my senior year. My major is Economics and I'm picking up a minor in Computer Science. My overall GPA is just above 3.9. I am also 17 (I did a ton of dual enrollment and graduated early). This summer, I had an internship with a large (top 10) U.S. bank as a Data Analyst, where I did database and data work, so that helps a bit. But I lack research experience or more generally any experience in the fields I am looking to apply for: besides the computer science minor, the only important experience I can point to is FIRST robotics, which I did in high school. I have taken the GRE and gotten 95th, 98th, and 98th percentiles in verbal, quantitative, and writing, respectively.  

As the title suggests, I'm interested in computer science and human-computer interaction masters programs, and have a list of about 10 programs total to apply to (I've already applied to one, actually). They are at Ivy League or Ivy League tier schools, so I'm assuming they are highly competitive. I know my strengths: my GRE scores and GPA are excellent, and I have good recommendations (one from my manager at the bank internship). But I also know that my resume may lack the intense focus on computer science or HCI that these programs value. My question is whether the aforementioned strengths, in combination with the fact that I am 17, outweigh the weak background. If anyone has come from a similar situation, or just knows how programs such as these evaluate applicants, I would be very grateful to hear your thoughts.

Thanks very much!"
3tp9xi,4,2015-11-21,Adding assoc. deg. + certs vs. just certs.,spartan24-7,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3tp9xi/adding_assoc_deg_certs_vs_just_certs/,"So a little background: Graduated with my B.S in Criminal Justice (focus on intel analysis and Poli. Sci.) and thought I would much rather enjoy the physical side of things vs. IT. I've always had a strong background in computer/IT since I was a kid and decided to just keep it a hobby. Realized after two years on the physical side that I find the IT side of security much more interesting (and progressive).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dilemma: Should I just pursue the normal certs (A+, Net+, etc.) and go from there or get an assoc. degree from my local CC that also preps you for the following: Sec+, Linux+, CCNA Sec., CEH, ICND1/CCENT and MTA (according to the course catalog). 

&amp;nbsp;

In my mind it seems logical to takes the classes and get the certs as I then have some formal education to fall back on in my resume. Taking these classes would also allow me to join an relevant academic groups or take part in any internships while helping me network. NOTE: Due to my B.S., I would only have to take the 30 credits that are IT related and no general coursework. 

&amp;nbsp;
On the flip-side, I could just study for these certs and don't know how adding an associates degree would look to a potential employer when I already have a B.S.

&amp;nbsp;

Potential career path: Start in Help Desk/entry level IT and then proceed to a jr. network position. From there go into security.

3tpcnv,1,2015-11-21,"So I got my first internship, thanks guys. Here's what I have learned",ambid17,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3tpcnv/so_i_got_my_first_internship_thanks_guys_heres/,"Just landed my new software development internship! I wanted to thank you all for helping me prepare with the thousands of random questions with high quality responses. 

In my time of learning computer science, I have come to learn quite a few things about studying for interviews and getting a job.

95% of the reason I got the job is because of my personality. It is a smaller business that lacks a real IT community but has a few very intelligent professionals that run everything. The first job they gave me is to build a dashboard for a database for a nearby university, all on my own. For a job like this what the company needed was the following:
-someone with integrity(the can count on you to do what they need in all situations)
-someone resourceful (I have not a clue how to build this database dashboard but I love that I get to learn something new)
-driven to complete tasks individually (the company is quite small and doesn't have the time to show me every step of the way so I will have to teach myself how to do it, which is one of the best traits to have when looking for employment)
-can deal with both business and technical side of things (they need someone to communicate with the university in nontechnical terms but still understand the software that needs to be created so that way we can get a build design going)

Overall, I have come to realize that many of the things necessary to be hired have nothing to do with computer science, because anybody can learn it. How you keep up with the new knowledge and tackle things you don't currently know how to do is what really sets you apart from others. On top of the way you present yourself and communicate with others. For example I had the interviewer laughing the whole time. 

Also, if you don't have any real world experience, how is a company supposed to judge if you can work as a team or make a large project? They can't. Thus, you need some way to show them you are even employable. Find a project. Build something you think is cool and explain it to the interviewer like you actually care about your projects and show how much effort and time and work you have put in.

Any other questions? I'm thinking about making a website with everything necessary for knocking that interview out of the park"
3tpptf,2,2015-11-21,Keep getting low balled,Fnasty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3tpptf/keep_getting_low_balled/,"So I graduate this December from an engineering school with a good reputation in the Midwest. I studied computer engineering, have an excellent GPA, and 3 internships related to software engineering. 

I have largely been interviewing for positions involving web application development. Some have been agencies while others are product companies. I have a significant amount of experience in web dev, with 2 of my 3 internships being in this field. I also have some personal projects involving frontend and backend dev. So my point is, I feel that I'm a good candidate for these positions. 

Nonetheless, I have had great interview experiences multiple timed now, I get the offer, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed by the salary. For example, one offer was 50k for a job in Boston, and that was bumped up from their initial offer of 45k. Cost of living in Boston is insanely high, so I declined. Right now I am interviewing for a job in Chicago, and they asked me my salary requirement. I said 60k, which is honestly on the low end of my requirement. They asked if that was negotiable, so they obviously want to pay me less. 

My career services office says that average starting salaries for CS and CpE majors is about 67k (remember, Midwest school). I can't help but feel like these companies are trying to take advantage of me."

Basically, I'm stuck in community college and it's been this way for a while. This is my 3rd year in and I was JUST rejected from a CSU that takes in students with a 2.0 GPA. (I have a 1.9).

This means that I'll be stuck in community college until Spring 2017, which is a LONG ass time. I don't even know what courses to take anymore over here. Next semester I'll be taking Calculus 3, Physics 2, and whatever other class is acceptable. My college doesn't offer any upper division CS Courses and I've completed everything transferrable CS class over here.

I know I screwed up bad because I couldn't get myself to study for these classes. The only subject I committed to is CS. I was just diagnosed with ADD last month and I'm working on treating my procrastination habits with and without the medication, so I'm confident I'll be successful in the following semesters.

What should I be doing now? I hate to think I'm just stuck and unemployed for over a year when my friends are already getting their internships. "

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tgizk/i_was_a_field_photographer_for_national/ 

Now before I start, I want to clear up a few things. There’s been some conversation about the whole skin walker thing, and I didn’t feel like there was enough credibility in my own head to mention it as a story. Its just one of those things where I think I want to believe it was that, but really know deep down that it isn’t. Also, I mentioned this in the comments before; I want to do my best to tell this story chronologically. Ava is very flattered that most of you want to hear about her, but we’ll get there in time. Before we talk about how I ended up working with Ava again, we have to talk about the reason they almost suspended me. 

After the whole almost dying in a plane crash thing, Sasha asked if she could continue to work under me. Without hesitation I said yes. While Sasha was still fresh out of college and one of the worst interns, she had a brilliant head on her shoulders, quick wit, good research skills, and knew her way around the internet like no one else I had ever met. Also, it might have helped that she was unreasonably attractive and nonchalantly flaunted her flawless body. It was difficult to think about Ava and Mark when Sasha’s smoky eyes and cute smile glinted in your direction. 

In the fall of 2009, we were tasked with going to Hong Kong on the lookout for Ferret Badgers. Supposedly they had meandered into the city and were getting into trouble; eating trash, attacking animals, etc. They were oddly cute and Sasha kept talking about how she wanted to try to pet one. I told her it would be more likely to rip her hand off, but she waved it off. Spoiler: throughout the whole trip we only found one, and the pictures of it were less than extraordinary, but it got the job done. And we found it by complete accident, while eating lunch outside of a restaurant; it meandered up to us and began begging for Sasha’s food. She fed it, while I took the shots. 

After getting the shots, we retired back to our hotel room, where we did the common thing. This included me watching TV in another language and trying to decipher what I could, while she sat in her chair by the window and played with her phone. She never said whom she was talking to, but I never really cared. This time she put it down for a while and began to look over this tiny book she had gotten from a street vendor. Animatedly, she shot up, hopped onto the bed besides me and pushed the book into my face. 

“Look at this fucking place.” The picture showed this old ornate house that looked like it was rapidly falling into disrepair. Anyone could have taken a two second glance at the picture and assumed this place was disgustingly haunted. “It’s right around the corner from here. Nam Koo Terrace. Supposedly, it’s ridiculously haunted. Originally used as a bordello for soldiers during WWII, the spirits of all the destitute and desperate women that died in that house still haunt it. Come on, a house haunted by the ghosts of a whole bunch of prostitutes; tell me you don’t want to see that.”

I gave her a quick chuckle and a long look. She rolled her eyes and took her computer out of her backpack. She lay back down beside me, letting her long brown hair flow out of her bun, cascading around fragile shoulders. Her hazel eyes changed color as I watched her type furiously into the search bar, from a deep brown to an evergreen. A little frown hung cutely to the corners of her mouth, playfully insinuating that she was still angered. 

Before she had started telling me about the groupings of people who had lost their minds inside, the bodies of homeless men they found dismantled, the cult they found eating the bones of refugee children, I had already decided I’d go with her. As a hopeless romantic, stuck in winds blowing somewhere else, I needed something to get my mind moving. And, as sure as I was that it wasn’t with Sasha; she was fun, and that was something that I desperately needed.

She beamed and began talking animatedly when I agreed. It was annoying. But it was cute. “We’ll go once it gets dark, that way we have the best chance of seeing anything. Or hearing anything, whatever. Something awesome will happen. I just know it.” For the remained of the afternoon, we bought flashlights, got dinner, and continued to do research on the place. Then at a little after nine, we slunk out of the hotel, walked a few blocks down, and stopped in the center of the sidewalk, marveling at the towering house that sat before us.

Without hesitating, Sasha hopped up the steps and pushed the gate open. It only budged a little with chain wrapped around it, but both of us could sneak through the section where the old brass bars had been bent. The yard was a disheveled mess of old broken glass and children’s toys being strewn around the cracked flagstone walkway and hidden throughout the knee high grass. Sasha bounced ahead of me, inspecting creepy objects with extreme interest, taking photographs of what she found interesting. 

When we got to the door, we found it slightly open, and the jamb broken, so it couldn’t be fully closed. Sasha looked back at me as we crossed the threshold and turned on our flashlights. Her look was a little bit of fear, mixed with a lot of excitement, and a dash of something darker and more powerful. 

Inside the place was absolutely destroyed. Pieces of furniture rotted in the rooms that they had once happily occupied. Bugs and other sorts of creepy-crawlies scuttled around the floors in attempts to evade our flashlight beams. The sought refuge in the skeletons of old bookshelves or underneath rugs that looked suspiciously like dead animals. The walls were canvases for disturbing graffiti. Chinese symbols lingered against images of monsters ripping apart bones and skin, eating flesh and drinking blood of innocent people caught in their path. The only bit of English was inscribed at the top of the large spiral staircase, next to the image of a girl whose face had been completely blacked out with what looked like soot. It read: “The eyes of God hide in the walls with hands like the Devil.” 

Sasha insisted that I took a picture of her in front of it, claiming it was make the best Facebook photo. As I pressed down the button, and heard the shutter click, I felt a powerful cold wash over me. Looking down at my arms, they were covered in goose bumps underneath my shirt. Even Sasha looked like she felt it. She stared down the hallway in front of her, narrowing her eyes as she peered into the darkness. I wondered if it was all goose bumps underneath her gray sweater. 

“Come with me,” she said quietly as she began to walk down the hallway. This time it wasn’t with the same purpose as before. Her steps were slower, quieter, less defined against the creaking of the house. She turned with every little noise as the world settled around her presence. I could see my breath when I reached the top of the staircase, and stood mystified by it. I continued to stare in the vapor I was making until I saw her flashlight beam dip around the far corner and raced to catch up with her. 

Around the corner, she stood in front of a large black door that reeked of kerosene. On the door itself was an image of a stick figure girl drawn in chalk. She had long hair that covered her eyes and was picking petals of a flower she held in her right hand. For how sparse and simplistic it was, it was oddly transfixing and beautiful. After staring entranced at it for several minutes Sasha turned over to me, “Adam, we have to go inside. I can feel something in there. Right on the other side of the door.” I was hesitant, but she seemed so calm and put together, I couldn’t stop myself. I nodded. She turned the handle. I pushed the door open. 

The room was completely black, from head to toe, as it had all been burned. Rotten and splintered wood clung blankly to the sides of the wall. The only other things in the room besides the burned walls and floor was a rusted metal bedframe that had been fused and contorted by the heat, and the top half of the charred remains of an old teddy bear. In this odd trance-like state Sasha moved forward and picked it up off the ground. She clutched it in her hands and brought it against her heart. As it pushed its way in between her breasts, her eyes rolled back, her knees went weak, and she collapsed onto the floor. Her mouth began to froth as I furiously dialed for the help. 

Hours later, they let her go from the hospital. They claimed that she had just fainted, but there was more than that. I could have sworn that for a second, she levitated. Maybe only an inch of the ground, but her skinny frame was definitely not attached to the ground. Also, she refused to let go of the bear. It took the two EMT’s and me to pry it out of her fingers, and when it was released, her eyes found home, the frothing stopped, and she began to stir.

We both cried in the ambulance. Both because we were scared. The police wanted to throw us in jail for trespassing in that building, but after seeing what we were going through, decided not to go through with it. They took one look at the makeup streaming down from Sasha’s fierce turned sad eyes and didn’t bother making her life any worse. I was really thankful for that. But, still they took our camera. Claimed it was evidence in a case they had against us. So, we lost the photos of the Ferret Badgers; the whole reason we had come. It didn’t matter in the scheme of things. 

While I waited for her, I called back to the states and explained the situation to my boss. I wanted to be honest with them. I took the blame for everything. Leading us into the house, using their company property for personal reasons, getting it confiscated when the police came. He remained fairly silent on the other end of the phone, only asking how Sasha was. He seemed relieved that she had only fainted and come back to quickly. Simply he told me he was “disappointed by my recklessness, foolishness, and apparent disrespect for the company, and that we would have a longer discussion when I returned.” Lastly, he thanked me for being upfront with him and taking the fall for the whole party, in a knowing voice that told me he knew I was covering up for her. 

When she got out, we held hands in the cab back. She leaned over after a while and put her head on my shoulder. I asked her nothing, but waited to see if she would say anything. She said very little, and kept her head there the whole time. When we got back to the hotel, it was nearing 4 in the morning. We took the elevator upstairs, obviously looking quite the sight to the late-night manager who stared blankly at us, and skulked back into our room. Without saying anything, she undressed, slid underneath the covers of my bed, and waited for me to get in. As I slid in beside her, she grabbed my arm, and wrapped it around her. I kissed her cheek softly and apologized. Not for anything in particular, but rather just for everything. She smiled a little, and cried softly.

I never heard what happened to her. I don’t even know if she does. Secretly, I hope she just blacked out and that sent shockwaves throughout her. I really want to believe that, but I doubt its true. 

I also wish that this touching scene was how this story ended. 

But hours later, in the darkness, I woke up to the dark room. Held somehow in sleep paralysis, I could see and hear everything, but no part of my body could move. I heard the door click open and the thud of footsteps coming into the room. Then I saw her, a little girl with long dark hair, walking in and standing at the end of the bed. As she combed the hair out of her eyes, I could see her face was heavily scarred and burned. Embers sat deep in the scars on her face, and still burned bright orange. She moved her way around the side of the bed, and I could feel the temperature in the room beginning to heat up. Silently, she slid up next to Sasha, and put a scaly, burned finger against her face, meticulously combing a strand of the brown hair. Then her soulless black eyes found mine, and I was transfixed. In this deep throaty voice, that had no place coming out of a little girl’s body, she hissed “I don’t go in your room; you shouldn’t go in mine.” "

I worked on a variety of different projects and ran on three platforms to their completion. I thought Reddit would be a good data trail to leave behind, so please ask me anything of interest regarding my time in ASUCD and how ASUCD or UC Davis could improve. Thank you!

My platforms were:

Financial Aid Peer Advising: Worked on proposal and drummed up support through Financial Aid Office to implement peer advising and support student needs in financial literacy. Funding was successfully secured and hirings for peer advising are underway this year.

Greek Life-ASUCD Pantry Partnership: Coordinated and scheduled intergreek food drive during Greek Week, which secured 500 cans on first iteration. Planning on scheduling another for this year focusing on the Pantry Scholarship.

Campus Testing Center: Served as undergraduate representative on the project committee for the campus testing center, which previously was stalled for years; we successfully steered the committee this year into implementing its first iteration in Haring Hall, complete with signage through Undergraduate Education. 

Some of my projects(this list is not exhaustive):

*Coordinating Yolo County Office of Health and Human Services staff to lead mental health first aid trainings through Student Health and Counseling Services. Currently, CAPS is searching for trainers that can lead the campus curriculum for students(traditionally, NAMI-Yolo does it for the UC Davis chapter on a quarterly basis) 

*Currently working on securing the clinician that works with the Davis Police Department to also work at UC Davis Police Department as well to increase the response rate of the crisis hotline.

*Hired the new Students Disability Center Director as sole undergraduate representative, as well as the new set of CAPS counselors currently.

*Submitted proposal to the Academic Senate to amend divisional regulation on course outline to include wellness resources on all course syllabi.

*Sourced textbook reserve in Aggie Reuse Store to divert unsold course materials from UC Davis bookstore to an ASUCD service that can resell at a more affordable rate. 

*Conducted lighting survey to replace deficient lighting on campus in areas such as theater building, Memorial Union, and Hoagland Hall.

*Conducted road survey to retrofit unsafe pavement in Silo Union region, particularly near Bainer Hall. 

*Secured testing materials back into residence hall area convenience stores. 

*Co-facilitated workshop and training of CashCourse software with Financial Aid Office to academic advising community to provide tools for financial literacy and personal finance that academic advising can use.

*Submitted briefs and provided consultation to tech team working on myUCDavis and Schedule Builder to improve functionality, with new tools ranging from automatic notifications on myUCDavis that can be used for pass times, calendar view and print capability on Schedule Builder, and the Contact an Expert section. Looking to survey Oasis before graduating.

*Started first on-campus designated nap site in the Student Recruitment and Retention Center, now with six additional bean bags.

*Created advisory committee to the University Library under ASUCD to advise and counsel the library staff on the use of the libraries and guide their year-long space planning process. 

*Organized and facilitated meet and greet event between ASUCD, Davis and Yolo County officials, which was the first in a supposedly long time.

*Started and secured support for campus-wide project implementing cameras at bike parking lots to stave off bike theft.

*Secured 1,200 cans for ASUCD Pantry by coordinating internal food drive between Intercollegiate Athletics teams.

*Exploring opportunity with Computer Lab management to implement printing at 24-Hour Reading Room or other 24-hour spaces on campus.

*Started a partnership with the Arboretum's Edible Gardens program which will be piloted in winter to donate produce cultivated through the edible landscaping internship to source in the ASUCD Pantry two days a week, expanding the days of available produce throughout the week from 2 days to 4 days.

3treiq,16,2015-11-21,NEED ADVICE: Was a valet working for a valet company. The Department of Labor and Training is investigating my company for compensation fraud. Is there anything I should be worried about?,throwaway98234723409,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3treiq/need_advice_was_a_valet_working_for_a_valet/,"Sorry for the long post. I created a throwaway for this to protect my identity.

So here is what's going on: I am a 22 year old college student finishing up my last year of college in the state of Rhode Island, USA. I have been working a valet job for a valet company in RI over the past year or so. When I first started the job, my bosses told me that I would be signed as an Independent Contractor and (if I remember correctly) was told to sign a form claiming the Independent Contractor employment status. I didn’t think anything of it and took the job as an Independent Contractor. Fast forward to the present, I recently just quit the job earlier this month because I’m starting an internship soon, and also because I want to start focusing on pursuing jobs related to my career field and start building up my experience. I had no issues the entire time I worked for the company. I completed the shifts they scheduled for me each week, I submitted the car count forms after each shift, made some money, and that was it. This is where my problems begin. Earlier this week I received a phone call from the Federal Department of Labor asking all sorts of questions about my company. They told me that they were investigating the company because they suspected that they were not properly paying their employees. The guy mentioned that because we were signed as Independent Contractors, that somehow my bosses were able to get around paying us wages properly and that the company probably owed me money. He told me that realistically I was not a true Independent Contractor because my bosses plan out my schedule and decide what I get paid for each shift.  I didn’t say much nor did I provide any personal information during the call because I was not sure if this was some sort of elaborate scam to steal money from me. The thing was, the caller knew everything about me. He knew my full name, my home address, when I worked for the company, where I worked, etc. Now this made me question the authenticity of the caller because he knew so much about me. I asked for his name, who he worked for, his phone number, and all that stuff so that I could keep his information for records sake, and he did provide me the information without hesitation. He then asked me if I would be interested in participating in the investigation by providing detailed information on how employees were being paid. He said my participation in helping them was optional but also said that if I did participate and the investigation was successful in uncovering fraud, that I could possibly get reimbursed money from my bosses that they believed was owed me. Like I mentioned before, I did not share any information and chose not to participate in the investigation. The caller told me he would send me something in the mail containing a questionnaire and some more details about the investigation, as well as his business card, and said if for some reason I decided to participate, that I should fill it out and send it back to him. 

Now let me freshen you up on just how employees were being paid so you can help me out a little better. The caller explained that we were not being paid correctly. Well pay varied depending on the location you worked. At some locations, you were guaranteed an hourly wage, let’s say $10/hour for the sake of the example. Throughout the shift you receive tips from your customers. At the end of the night you would pool all the tips together and count it up. Now if the tips you earned did not exceed the guaranteed $10/hour times the hours you worked that night, then the company owed you money and would send you a check in the mail. If you did make more money than the guaranteed 10/hour times the hours you worked, then the company didn’t owe you anything and you wouldn’t get a check at the end of the week for that shift. Basically what happen was if I was guaranteed 10/hr and worked 6 hours that would mean I was guaranteed to make $60 that night. If I only made $50 in tips, my company would have to pay me the extra $10. If I made $70, then I just made myself an extra $10 and my company didn’t have to pay me anything since I made more than the guaranteed.  Another way we would get paid - and this was the way I would mostly get paid during my time as an employee for them – was a guaranteed hourly wage plus tips (let’s use $10 as an example again). Simply put, if I worked 6 hours and was given a $10/hr wage, I would be given $60 in the form of a check while also keeping all the tips I made during my shift. There are other ways employees were paid but I am just too lazy to get into trying to explain how the pay system worked when you start factoring more than one valet working a single shift. All you need to know was that at the end of the day, I didn’t put any money aside for taxes, it was really all under the table pretty much. The reason why I didn’t pay taxes was because our bosses told us that if we weren’t making more than $10,000 annually, then we wouldn’t need to file income taxes come the April deadline. Being the college student that I am, I have only been able to work 2 days a week all year long, putting me far below the $10,000 mark. I didn’t do anything in regard to taxes last year because my bosses said I was all set and wouldn’t have to worry about it. It never crossed my mind to ever worry about not paying my fair share in taxes to Uncle Sam, I trusted my bosses. I mean they were running a pretty successful and reputable valet business, they had to of known how all this works, right? Well let’s move on.

So going back to the phone call, I spoke to my parents afterwards about this and my dad, being the incredibly paranoid person that he is, told me that this may be a way for the government to come after me for not paying my fare share in taxes. He said that they are probably trying to go after my company because they are screwing over their employees by using shady business practices, but he thinks that they might go after me as well. He did out some quick math and said that I might have to pay a large amount of money if they come after me. If that’s the case, I can’t afford to pay back the money I might owe to them! As you can imagine, I am pretty worried about this. I am just a young, poor college student trying to get through school who figured valeting would be a great way to make a little extra cash on the side. Why should I have been worried? I had friends who were working valet jobs as well and none of them had issues?

But anyways…

Yesterday I received a letter from the Department of Labor and Training, Division of Workers’ Compensation Fraud &amp; Compliance Unit saying that I “…submitted a Notice of Designation as Independent Contractor (DWC  11-IC) to the Department of Labor and Training. This letter establishes that you filed the DWC 11-IC and is your official receipt confirming the Department has accepted the form.” The letter goes on to say that unless I submit a Notice of Withdrawal of Designation as an Independent Contractor with the Workers’ Compensation Division, that the filing would remain effective.  My boss advised all employees not to do anything regarding this letter and to contact them if we had any questions. Apparently I was not the only one to receive this letter.

So now for my questions: Should I be worried about anything? Am I going to be targeted by the government because I haven’t been paying taxes? Do you think that the company is screwing over its employees? Should I submit that Notice of Withdrawal of Designation? 

My dad thinks that I am screwed.  I’m worried and have no idea what to do about this. Please help."
3trfet,5,2015-11-21,"Decision between two opportunities, confused which is best for me",bzthrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3trfet/decision_between_two_opportunities_confused_which/,"I had two final interviews this week and have received offers from both. One is a developer internship a small startup (10-20 people), the other is at a 50-200 people consulting firm partnered with a large software platform as a fulltime systems analyst/software dev. A little background on me: I graduated last year with a comp sci degree and have basically no experience or large projects I've worked on. However I got really good at something and set myself up decently well financially while in school and this looks good to employers. Anyways now I'm ready to finally start my career, but I'm very confused on how is best to do so.

This first offer at the startup, I'd mostly work with javascript and be a fullstack developer within a year, starting as a QA for a month or two and advancing as quickly as my learning allows. The offer is about 40k with pay increases throughout the year. Looks like a fun place and they are on the verge of expansion. I'd learn a lot and be able to work autonomously for the most part. I really have no idea where I'd want to go after that, and to be honest I am not thrilled in specializing in web technologies, though I figure its something I gotta learn regardless if this is going to be my career. 

The second place looks much better for my career and after a training period I'd work with one of their clients on a team as a systems analyst. It pays 60-70k with benefits etc and I'd have exposure to a really wide range of technologies along with the entire business side of things. Its definitely a less coding focused job though and they want a 1.5-2 year commitment, emphasizing its a fast track to career development. Fwiw I found their interview process rather brief and not thorough at all. They emphasized the possibility of long hours and I will probably have a long commute. The clients are mostly big banks and such.

While I really want to start my career off right, I also don't want to be miserable doing so. I've been used to alot of freedom and just the idea of working 9-5 is a bit daunting. My quality of life won't change depending on my salary right now. Really confused as to what the best direction to head in now is. I could always take option c and take neither, I've only been searching a few months now and could take the time to work on some coding projects til something else comes along as I don't need to get a job asap. However my resume gap is growing so I can't wait indefinitely. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"

     python runmyproject

    python manage.py runserver

Any Advice would be appreciated,fishpen0,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/3ts56g/jumping_back_into_the_interview_circuit_after/,"I am thinking of doing some interviews just to get an eye on what is out there and maybe shift towards a less stressful position or somewhere with different tech than what I have been working with.  I never really formally interviewed out of college, since I was recruited by the company that I interned for so I started with my internship resume and tried polishing that.

For the internship position, I tried to capture exact projects. For my full time position, I have had a hard time capturing that since 90% of my work is whatever random stuff pops up in the day to day with the product teams or team based project work. 

I also left out a job I did for a year in the middle of my primary role, since it was a top tier product support role and I would rather die than ever do that kind of work again.  Is it awkward leaving that gap in the dates?  Should I just change it to show I was in that position the whole time?

In terms of skills I am also weary of listing my full sysadmin background because stray interview questions about the intricacies of AD or DNS would probably kill me and I am afraid to use the word ""rusty"" or something like that.  The jobs themselves include which skills I used, so word scrapers should still find AD, but skimming the page would show I haven't done anything significant with it in 2-3 years.

I have two offers I am considering, and wondering how much the ""prestige"" of working for a fairly well-known San Francisco start up would help versus a start up from my local area.

The San Fran offer is for a mature ""start-up"" that has been around for a bit. I really enjoyed the interview process, and while I am not much of a city person, I liked everyone I worked with and the company as a whole. They have a product with a great mission, the potential teams I could work with are interesting and I was thinking it would be a great experience.

The second offer is for another mature startup near my university. They are a little smaller than the SF start up (glass door puts them in the 501 - 1000 employee range while the SF co is at 1001 - 5000) and also have a great product with a great purpose. Everyone I have spoken to about the company speaks very highly of it, and they have the highest Glassdoor ratings that I have come across. With this one, I would be working as an Software Engineer in Test, but the potential teams I could be working with also seem pretty interesting.

I feel the both offers are compelling. In another context, the SF one would be the immediate answer. However, for personal reasons, staying put where I am for the summer is also a very compelling option. I wanted to ask this subreddit if working in San Francisco/Silicon Valley as an intern going to open a lot of doors? Is it worth sacrificing some other things to have that on my resume?"

3tw2dt,2,2015-11-22,2 months into a restaurant job and I'm starting to hate it. Are these legit complaints or am I just entitled?,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3tw2dt/2_months_into_a_restaurant_job_and_im_starting_to/,"I started working at a restaurant 2 months ago as a host and thought it was great. Not as good as my IT internship I had over the summer but better than both retail jobs I have had. However i'm starting to hate it, even more than the retail jobs, and wanted to list out a pro and con list and get some feedback on if these are legit complaints and what I should do. 

Let's start with the cons:

**Management decisions** this is my biggest complaint. When I worked at the office as an intern, literally the lowest level of staff, my boss made it clear on day one, and multiple days after that, saying ""please if you feel anything we do can be done differently speak up we want to hear your ideas"" even people in HR and finance cared what I had to say. Management here is completely closed off from what we have to say. The other night for instance my manager told me and the other host to do something and it wasn't working at all (it had to do with our wait list) and I explained to her why it wasn't working and offered my opinion. She basically told me ""yea well this is the way we are doing it bye"" and it resulted in a lot of angry customers. This is just one of many examples. 

**Complainers** I have never met so many people that complain so much. What is it with servers? Its like a constant flow of complaints ""I want a cigarette, when will I be cut, why did I get cut so early, why do I have 4 tables instead of 5, why do I have so many tables,"" it just doesn't stop. It's like no one is happy, ever. 

**Customers** speaking of unhappy holy crap like 4/5 people that come in have a problem or are rude. I say ""how are you"" and they just say ""yea give me a booth"" or I take them to a table and they just walk past me and sit wherever they want. Then they have a problem with the food and yell at me about it what am I supposed to do?

**Customer is always right** I know the customer is always right except even at my past two retail jobs we never followed that 100%. For instance last night I had someone come in while we were on an hour wait saying they put their name in 20 minutes ago. I never saw this person nor was their name on my list (people come in and lie that they were already on the list to jump ahead it happens a lot) so I told them you can put it in now but you aren't in here. Then they got mad and left and my other host got mad at me and said I was supposed to seat them anyway. What the hell is the point of even having a list then. Why would I allow them to cut the 20 other people in line? 

**Hours/time off** I don't do a whole lot outside school and work so I don't request many days off however if I ever have to do something on the weekend say a sporting tournament I can't because thats when we have two hosts on all day and there is only two of us. It's not a big deal now but I feel like my social life is going to take a hit with that one in the future if I can never request any weekend off. 

There are some pros:

**Pay** my pay is pretty good at $10 an hour which is a big step up from my other jobs and helps me pay my bills. I work spotty hours from 18-20 a week because they cut me at different times but its better than 90% of the other min wage jobs

**Hours** they are pretty flexible with hours and I'm not working too much. They also gave me a specific day of the week off every week because of a sport I play which is nice I suppose, though if the other host couldn't work that night that would have never happened. 

**People** the managers and some staff themselves are pretty good people I like most of them and have made some friends. I think its working with them I'm not crazy about. 

Idk part of me feels these are legit concerns but part of me feels like I'm just being entitled. I feel like I got spoiled with the internship; nice office, great motivated people (it was a marketing company), great managers, etc. I don't really want to leave but i feel like this is getting too taxing for what its worth. Also I don't think I will ever find another job that will work around my hours and pay that well. 

So I guess what are your thoughts? Anything I can do to help any of my cons? "

I recently graduated from a [coding bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) doing mostly Ruby on Rails and basic algorithm stuffs.  Since then I have been working as an intern for my friend's dad's cybersecurity company dong low-level system stuff in C.  Before that I took some CS/Math classes at a local community college and worked as an Intern for my friend's dad doing simple things like writing code comments.

Now I am looking for my first entry level job as a software developer and I was hoping to get some perspective on an important decision I must make.

I am confident I can get a job as a web developer at least somewhere in the next couple of months.  I have been searching for a while and I have several prospects I am interviewing with and I believe at least one of them will turn into an offer.  However my friend's dad has offered me a full time position working at his company.

The two paths are drastically different.  On one hand I would be learning kernel development with my friend's dad and brother in a very casual very small-business environment and on the other hand I would be a junior developer or apprentice at some sort of web consultancy shop probably either in Ruby or JavaScript.

Now I feel either route would probably be valid career-wise but I think they lead to two very different paths and I just don't have the perspective to make an informed decision.  On the one hand working for a web consultancy sounds more exciting because I'd be moving to the city (I'm a couple hours away in the suburbs) and working with more variety of people in a new situation and probably making more money (all relatively superficial things that still matter), on the other hand kernel development sounds kind of badass and mysterious and I'm skeptical that anyone else would give me (little experience no degree) an opportunity like that.  Also in that vein I wonder if I take the job with my friend's dad if I will be essentially stuck there since perhaps even after I get experience it would still be really difficult to get hired as a kernel developer without a degree and also I might not even learn well considering the gaps in my knowledge (gaps that I don't even know how to estimate the size of because I don't know what I don't know).

Any thoughts? Sorry for the wall of text."

3tyxgs,1,2015-11-23,College dropout who majored in CS. What can I realistically expect?,tubularjohnny,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3tyxgs/college_dropout_who_majored_in_cs_what_can_i/,"**Backstory**

I was a CS major in college before I dropped out a couple of years ago. Up until that point I was a really good student--4.0 GPA, scholarship to college (though it was a mediocre CS program, I initially was planning on majoring in something else and switched to CS later on), came in with lots of AP credit, high SAT score and strong high school transcript, etc.. Someone very close to me was killed and it took a major toll on me. I sunk into a depression, and started failing classes in my last two semesters because I stopped going. When I dropped out, my GPA was around ~3.2, though my CS major GPA was a bit higher if I remember correctly (~3.65).

**Experience**

1) I worked as a software engineer for four months at a startup about a year ago, but it was terribly run. After three months on the job they claimed I wasn't doing a good enough job to have earned my pay (literally never mentioned anything about my performance before then...), and I had to threaten legal action to actually get my paycheck. So it was basically a three month, terrible internship. 

2) I started a startup with a friend, and we developed the webapp ourselves. We got decent traction but eventually ran out of money, so we shut down after six months or so. In a way, it was sort of like an internship as well, though a very stressful one that destroyed what little savings I had. 

3) I did a little freelance work here and there, but nothing major. 

**Other factors**

This has little to do with coding, but in the years out of college I crowdfunded ~10k to write a book, which was very well received and is currently being considered for several awards. I can't imagine this would hold a ton of weight, but being able to pull that off might count for something?

**Goals**

Of course, I'd love to work at (or even intern) at a Big Four company, or one of similar caliber (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Uber, Stripe, Kickstarter etc.), but I have no idea how to get my foot in the door. I'd love to be able to work in NYC, the Bay Area, Boston, or maybe a place like Denver. 

But considering I'm broke and unemployed, I know that beggars can't be choosers. So a decent paying job that allows me to afford a place of my own would be a solid start. 

**Plan**

I want to begin interviewing in late spring/early summer. My biggest weaknesses are: 

1) I missed the upper level CS classes due to dropping out, mainly the ones that cover data structures and algorithms

2) I don't have a particularly strong portfolio--I'll be open sourcing the startup code, but other than that I don't have much. 

I've created a pretty thorough study plan to address both of those issues, which I'll be working on through for the next several months along with interview prep via Project Euler/TopCoder/LeetCoder/Cracking the Coding Interview book, etc. 


**Question**

I'm smart and I'm definitely willing to put in the work--what are realistic expectations in a job search? Will I have an opportunity to get one of the high paying software engineering jobs? What's the best path to get from where I am to where I want to be? Any other advice?"
3tz5du,21,2015-11-23,Over 6 months have passed since college graduation and I still haven't managed to land a job. Hitting new lows each day and starting to lose hope. Would love some advice.,must_be_the_mangoes,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/3tz5du/over_6_months_have_passed_since_college/,"Hi,

I graduated in May from a top liberal arts school with a BSBA in management. I did really well academically and ended with a 3.78 GPA, magna cum laude honors, top 10% of my class, admittance into a business honors society, etc... Professionally, I completed a pretty exclusive marketing internship with a Big Four firm and started/led two student companies while in college. I let loose pretty hard senior year and waited until graduation to start the job search, confident that I could easily land something in the summer. 


Boy, was I wrong. 


I have applied to well over 100 listings since graduation and have had 4 phone interviews and 4 physical interviews, which all went well but not well enough apparently. I'm beyond broke, at an all-time low in confidence, miserable, lonely and starting to lose hope at a rapid rate. With all my past success, I just can't comprehend why seemingly all my classmates have secured jobs already while I have been constantly passed over. 


I'm looking to go into marketing, PR or communications... ideally in the music industry. I am only looking at careers in NYC. At first and at heart, I was very disinterested in large, corporate settings, favoring small, intimate startup type companies with strong and vibrant cultures. As desperation has started creeping in, I have lowered my standards significantly and have been applying to these larger firms.  I currently do not reside in NYC but am looking to move down in the coming months. I try my best to not disclose my personal address to employer, as they probably prefer local residents. On all applications, I maintain that I can start work immediately which is the truth. I'm ready to move down in an instant, especially with an actual income secured. 



I've had a few professional recruiters and counslers help me with my resume, so it is in pretty decent shape. I'm a fairly sociable person and do well in interviews although the lack of confidence is really starting to bite me in the ass. I'm a white male, so not the most desirable candidate as companies are striving to reach their diversity quotas by the end of the fiscal year. Most applications I've submitted have been found through LinkedIn or Indeed although I have applied to a few through my school's alumni network. 



Here are some questions I have:

* Am I being too picky?

* Am I being too vague about the marketing/PR/communications field? To be honest, I still have no fucking idea what I want to do. 

* Do employers not give a shit about academic performance because I thought that was one of my selling points? How do I leverage my smarts without coming off as arrogant?

* How do I currently network with companies in NYC while living a distance away?

* Should I consider finding a headhunter?

* Is one internship not enough these days? 

* How do I break through the clutter of online applications? I feel like I am having a difficult time getting someone to physically look at my application, despite contacting talent acquisition departments.

* How do I differentiate and make a ""brand"" for myself?

* What else should I do to boost my appeal? Professional certifications? Learn code? Learn more languages?

* Does someone sharing my name engage in Nazi-themed child pornography because that seems like one of the few logical explanations as to why I am having such abysmal results...



Sorry to be a downer but I'd really love to hear any advice and thoughts you could give me. Cheers.

I assume this implies a choice between Windows or Mac. I am very experienced in Windows and have 0 Mac experience, however:

Pros

1. This might be a good opportunity to learn OS X

2. I feel that a lot of developers use Macs and find them very good for software development

3. I know Unix stuff and like it a lot

Cons

1. I don't want my inexperience to hinder me in ramping up in the internship (I have never used a Mac)

2. I might be more productive overall with Windows due to the internship being only 12 weeks

I won't be doing iOS development - hopefully something more like data/web dev/back end stuff. I know there's no clear answer of Windows vs Mac, but what do you all think?"

Base salary is good, perks are good, they let me work from home 100% and set my own hours, I get my choice of projects and even some leadership responsibility right out of school, etc..

3u09us,4,2015-11-23,I'm scared I won't be able to emotionally stand a full work week,LittleUpset,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3u09us/im_scared_i_wont_be_able_to_emotionally_stand_a/,"First off, yes--I'm exactly as lazy and entitled as it sounds from the title. Millions of people have it so amazingly worse than I do, but at the end of the day, I'm about to graduate college and I'm afraid I won't be able to make it out there.

I've had plenty of jobs (half-dozen shit ones since I was a teenager as well as some freelance contract work and an internship), but I've never had to work hard. I'm finishing up at a good school with a degree in Computer Science that I've earned through a slow grade decline (I now only work 2-4 hours a day before I return to sitting around watching netflix and playing video games), and I have a great career opportunity through friendship/networking + a great resume that will likely get me ~$60k/yr the day I'm handed a diploma this spring.

**Cue intense guilt at the amazing hand I've been dealt**

I hate doing work of any kind. I've hated every job I've had, regardless of what it entailed. For instance, my current internship should be great--I only work ten hours a week with a boss and group of coworkers who are nothing but nice, supportive, and laid-back. I receive many compliments about the quality and efficiency with which I do my work, and I've never been so much as talked to in a negative manner while I'm there.

But those ten hours are the worst of my week and I loathe them wholeheartedly. I can't stand sitting there. I can't stand punching shit into spreadsheets the same way I can't stand taking a customer's order. Even if I spend my whole shift on reddit, I just can't take doing it at work instead of at home. I worked independently leading a personal project (with *absolute* creative control) backed by a publisher and a team of professionals, and I could barely scrape 15 hours a week out of myself when I was supposed to be working full-time.

I just can't convince myself to want to work. Nothing pays off--nothing I have ever completed felt worth the mountain of bullshit I had to wade through to get there. I've been on the frontpage of this site over a dozen times with creative shit I made, and I stopped doing any of it because *I couldn't give a flying fuck* when it means I have to spend time working on shit.

I've seen a therapist, picked up hobbies to try to find something I'm ""passionate"" about, but I've found nothing that feels worth it. I've tried writing, music, art, programming, carving, home projects, making new friends, trying new jobs... it just never matters. I don't want to spend the effort it takes to have them, because that effort *ALWAYS* sucks more than what I get in return. The list of cons always outweighs the pros.

Coming off of half-assing my entire life (to appreciable success, thus far), I don't know how to fix that for a job where I have to be physically present for 8 hours a day; and, more importantly, how to *want* to fix it for that job. I don't have expensive things I want, nor do I want to travel or meet people--the only thing any job buys me that I'm happy to have is food, water, internet, non-homelessness, and my wonderful girlfriend not leaving me for being a piece of shit.

It's been months and months now, and I'm nearly at the end of my rope. Does anyone have anything that might help?

PS ""thinking positively"" is the first suggestion everyone has tried with me, but unfortunately I've had very little success trying to trick my brain into liking things I don't.

EDIT: I've also already seen a therapist. I had to stop during the summer due to insurance stuff with school, and I haven't restarted it for this semester because (cue the part where I'm an idiot young person who thinks they know everything) I wasn't hearing anything I hadn't heard and attempted already."

I've heard that there is a decent chance of having physics questions come up in technical interviews, and was hoping that some people who know better can indicate how critical these classes are. Anyways, any feedback is helpful, especially from those people that have graduated and gotten jobs, or those in school who have gone through internship interviewing processes.

I definitely could have some more personal projects.

I also have experience with stuff like Rails, NLTK, NumPy/SciPy, and I'm comfortable with Python/Java/C/Ruby. All of this is listed on my resume.

I don't feel as if I'm particularly underqualified (at least on paper, which is the context in which they're examining me as an applicant, right?), but basically everybody I know has at least gotten an interview, while I haven't heard anything. I've gone to every career fair, applied online, the works, but for some reason I just haven't heard back from anyone. Could there be something significant I'm missing? I've been applying roughly between August until now, but haven't heard back... Thanks a lot for your time guys, I really appreciate it!

""Mr. Haustam, we've been receiving reports of extreme gang activity recently. Should we take precautions?""

""No. Let those vermin squirm. They'll stay within their confinement. They already think they own the city and we both know that isn't true,"" he replied shaking his head.

""But sir, it's never been this violent. Some of our politicians are saying if they're not dealt with they can eventually become ungovernable.""

""Let them talk. We don't operate in the slums. Now leave.""

""Yes si-""

""I said leave!”

The intern turned away hurriedly to walk out of the office.

“Actually, Bert, turn around and come back here.""

The intern, being hesitant, turned back around, and with his head down, walked back over to Mr. Haustam’s desk, keeping his distance.

“Bert, you’ve been with us for a while, correct?”

“Yes sir,” he said tentatively.

“And do you always dress like that?”

“Only on special days, sir. Today is my fiancee’s birthday and we have plans for when you let me leave.”

“Ok. So you thought it would be a good idea to try and outdo me. In my office, my building, my city. Please, correct me if I’m wrong. Also, please, take a seat, I insist.”

The intern cautiously sat in a chair positioned slightly off center of the desk.

“You do know I’m in charge here? Right?” He poured two small drinks and gestured one towards Bert.

“Yes sir.”

“So why are you trying to make me look bad? Please, drink.”

The intern did as he was told, “That wasn’t my intention sir, I was excited 
and thought too far ahead, I promise it will not happen again.”

“No, it won’t. You are dismissed.”

Bert apologized and thanked Mr. Haustam and got up to leave. He reached over and pressed the comms button on his desk.

It beeped once, “Yes, Colo?”

“Hello Trin, my precious paramour.” Colo said it with a face of annoyance. 

He pretended to love her. Even though she believed it, because he was very convincing, he couldn’t care less about her. “Will you please send Bert our notice of Administrative Separation, please. Also send an Apology of Death notice and a life insurance brochure to his Fiancee.”

“Will do, love.”

Colo turned off the comms, took the two glasses to his washroom, and poured his drink out.

----------------
Matte woke and the haze in his eyes faded. They were being dragged downhill. He could hear running water and the noise of a crowd in the distance. They entered a square shaped culvert, cement walls surrounding his peripherals, and the light started to fade. He felt an ache on his head and tried to rub it but couldn’t. Matte and Bozo were tied back to back with their feet and hands bonded together being dragged by their wrists.The men dragging them started to talk.

""So what do you think the boss is gonna do with em?""

""Whatever it is, they'll get dealt with.""

The men dragged them up a small metal stair set. Hitting every edge on the way up and tugged them across the metal grate floor onto sludge traced concrete.

""Set them down and untie them,"" a voice called.

They dropped the rope and both prisoners smacked their head. Bozo woke up instantly when his head hit.

""Whoah, hey! Who the hell do you guys think you a-""

""QUIET!"" the voice carried.

Matte looked around and saw they were in a large dark dome with a green haze that lit the interior and all around was the whole army of the WOEs. 

The most Matte had ever seen altogether in one place. 

The sound echoed. Matte looked up to see who said it. A man sitting on a big concrete chair up a small set of steps with Bliss on her knees at the bottom, battered and bloody. Matte started breathing heavy. Their feet got cut loose and they stood up. They then cut the hands free and Matte felt his wrists from the rope burn.

The man on the throne looked completely different than the gang that he lead. Clean, dapper, confident, but not arrogant. It made Matte wonder where this man came from. The King got up and started walking down. 

""Bozo? Is that you?""

""Heh. The one and only! Say, when did you get that high chair? Is that where you get spoon fed?""

""Hahaha! I forgot how funny you were. I've been wondering where my favorite buddy has gone ever since he killed my brother. Now we can celebrate this wonderful reunion!""

King walked up to him and stared into his eyes. They stayed there a little while and King moved back and hit him in his face. The crowd cheered. 

Bozo fell down and he hit him again and the crowd cheered once more. 

King took out his gun and shot Bozo in the leg. Matte charged but King already had a gun pointing upward at his jaw. The noise died down and in the background was the sound of running water.

""You must be the one whose been killing my family.” He looked him up and down and said with raised eyebrows, “Welcome to the Underground.""

Jester jumped up and down making a show and pointing, ""That's him daddy! That's the man who-""

""Shutup and stay out of this! You're only living because I let you,"" his ferocious voice rang.

He turned back to Matte and continued to speak, ""Two of my soldiers. My friends. My loyal servants. My children.""

He turned to face the gang.

""It seems like we're in the midst of some serious murderers here!""

There were grunts of agreement from all over. He turned back around at Matte.

""Do you know why they call us WOEs? It's because we are the most powerful gang here in this concrete jungle. When you meet us, that is the last emotion you feel before you die. We control what comes in, and out, of the city. We own Superbia, and its people! We. Own. Everything.""

The whole room erupted and he stood there looking at Matte waiting for the noise to die down, ""What's your name, anyways?""

Matte growled through his teeth, “Death.” He stared him down just like King had done with Bozo, and Matte saw the intentions in his eyes. King stepped even closer and spoke into Matte’s ear very softly.

""I actually hate it here.... I can't stand this place, these people. They are all driven by instinct and it makes me sick. I can tell, just by looking at you, you have purpose and this might be my break. But let’s hope I’m not wrong. Only one of us is going to live in this next ten minutes.""

He slowly backpedaled, pulling the gun away, and kept eye contact, each step provoking Matte. He took the holster from his waist and threw it, and the gun, to the ground, both tumbling and skipping to the bottom stair that lead up to his throne. King unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his imposing build. He had an intimidating demeanor. His fighting stance gave off an aura of experience, the same kind of experience you’d expect from a seasoned veteran who was loading his ammo before a battle. Matte got defensive. The thirst for blood was already overwhelming him.

They slowly circled around, getting a feel for one another. King threw some feigns, testing his opponent. Then Matte went in throwing the first punch but King ducked and spun behind him. Matte quickly turned and bent his knee to check the shot. 

That wasn’t going to work twice. 

He then connected with an elbow to the chin and they started boxing. King jumped back and Matte pushed forward with an uppercut that grazed the chin and followed with a hook to the body. 

King recoiled, feeling the pain in his side, then went back at him dodging the lefts and rights Matte was throwing at him. He put a straight into Matte’s throat and hooked him in his ear and returned an uppercut and twisted to launch a kick. Matte caught it and landed a punch putting King in a daze. Matte spear tackled him and started to pummel. King swayed left and right dodging his hits and Matte’s knuckles knocked the hard concrete. 
King caught Matte’s arm and wrapped his legs around it and his head, pulling on Matte’s arm and creating a vice around his airway. 

Matte started to lose vision. 

He snarled trying to suck in breath and barely got his feet underneath him. Matte used his strength to lift king above his head and King released and slid to Matte’s back putting him in another chokehold. He barely even got a gulp of air. He did a backwards body slam and King let out a yell and let go, a trickle of blood coming from the back of his head. 

Matte stood over him and stomped on his chest, crushing his collarbone and cracking a rib. King let out a bloodcurdling scream. Matte bent down and 
grabbed King by the hair and started dragging him to the stairs.

""Daddy! Daddy no!""

King scrambled for the gun. He thought that he was ready to die, to be rid of this life. To finally get the only release that he could get from all of these savages. He thought about his hard-knock life. I never wanted to be born anyway. I never asked for any of this. I never wanted to live, but never had the balls to end my life either. 

But then he met her. Elizabeth. Her sweet smelling hair and infectious smile. They were inseparable and adored each other. They were also both like minded, hating everyone and their lives. Of course they had their little problems, but she bore his child anyway, secretly not wanting any. 

‘I thought it would make me happy,’ she cried to him. ‘I thought our son would give me a reason to live and for us to go on.’

She couldn’t handle it and disappeared. King thought that maybe she killed herself, but in the back of his mind knew that probably wasn’t it. She just wanted to be by herself. 

He raised his son, that’s what men do, but resented him for living. A spitting image and a constant reminder of Elizabeth. So he turned all of his sadness into rage. 

In the middle of the night he walked into the slums and executed the head of the WOEs in his sleep. He got rid of the body and sat on the throne until morning. And very oddly, no one asked any questions about it. King acted like he belonged, like he’d been there the whole entire time. Then slowly, but surely, he snuffed out all of the rival gangs and renamed his own. 

He wanted power. 

Even when he had it all, it still wasn’t enough. So then it was time to grow before he could overthrow the city. He recruited day and night and eventually owned his own city. Only operated underground. His whole life it seemed like, he was always grinding. 

King grabbed ahold of the weapon but Matte was quick to take his hand and smash it on the ground, making the gun discharge. He dropped it after the second time. Matte regripped King’s head and started to drive it repeatedly into the corner of the steps. Once. Twice. Again. Four times.

""NOOO!""

Matte heard rapid clumsy footsteps behind him and jutted his arm out and seized a throat. King's head in one hand and his child's neck in the other. 

He started to squeeze and Jester struggled in Matte’s grip.

""Stop!""

His breathing became regular again and the blackness lifted from his eyes. 

Matte turned to Bliss. She was staring at him, terrified. He let go of both men and went to her. Jester dropped to the floor gasping and bleeding from his abdomen. She winced as he got closer. Matte got on one knee and they met eyes.

“Bliss,” he said shaking his head. “I would never hurt you.”

“That’s what you say. All I’ve ever seen you do is kill.”

He went behind her and undid the bonds. He helped her up, though her moves were still cautionary towards him. They both went to Bozo and helped him up. Jester was caterwauling at the reality of his dead father.

Matte walked up the stairs and stood at the throne. All the people were looking at him, their former leader, and at each other. He stayed there straight faced and called out to them at large.

“If anyone objects now, step forward and we can settle it.”

A man pushed and shoved to the front of the crowd and Matte stared him down. 

He took a knee. 

Then, one by one, just like a wave, they all took a knee.

So kind of got two questions here:

1. Should those graduating from grad school, after entering straight out of undergrad, expect to get positions other than entry level? (they have had internships and co-ops)

2. If they do only get entry level positions, should they be expecting/be able to negotiate higher pay for these entry level jobs? Versus someone with similar experiences (internships, etc) with a BS?

3. Would you say those answers strictly apply to CS related fields only? Or something similar in varying industries?"
3u10qc,20,2015-11-23,"Really starting to question if it's ADHD, depression, or just me",KamikazeRusher,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3u10qc/really_starting_to_question_if_its_adhd/,"I studied for a calculus test today. I went over the essentials of sequences, series (geometric, telescopic, alternating, Maclaurin, Taylor, power, etc.), did review questions, the works. I walked in to take the test thinking about finishing with my head high, only to trudge out like a beaten dog. My mind blanked out as soon as I sat down. I feel like I bombed it while everyone else probably did well.

I'm starting to question if I have ADHD or if it's just due to emotional disorders. I've got depression, anxiety, and some bipolar (type II) tendencies on top of ADHD. Which reminds me, I have to set up another appointment to get screened because my first screening two years ago ""showed strong attributes of ADHD but emotional issues are also present."" So according to the Accessibility Center I don't have ADHD, however my first doctor said I had it after balancing out emotional problems with meds. I've still got issues though (I'm on my third type of antidepressant, Wellbutrin, because Sertraline and Trazadone had a stronger negative impact that still lingers) but I'm a lot better than before. Still...

I continue to live in the land of mediocrity, stuck in a valley where anything I do to get out of it continues to push me back down. I've studied and studied to get where I'm at but I'm still blanking out at tests – though I do fine with class quizzes. I'm wanting to do well and get out with a degree so I can move on but I just can't seem to get anywhere. Don't get me wrong, I'm not failing *all* my classes, but the essential ones (such as Calculus) are what's holding me back. Every damn time I get put into that testing center it's like I was writing notes in my mind on a beach, but the moment I turned away a gentle breeze went through and erased all traces of my hard work.

It's just frustrating, ya know? No matter what I do I keep getting kicked in the teeth and end up asking myself, ""is it really me, or is it *me*?"" Perhaps I don't have what it takes to finish with a CS degree, or maybe it's just the classes. (What the *hell* kind of 400-level Computer Security class has lecture slides where 3/4 of the material is straight-copied off of Wikipedia?) Maybe I'm in the wrong field or should just drop out and go with networking certifications.

Many of you know what I'm talking about. You've been there, some have succeeded, others are in the same boat, but many of you *know* what's up. I'm questioning myself every so often because of mixed opinions and medicine(s) that don't help. My parents, who never oversaw me studying, don't believe it's ADHD. My dad, the retired Marine, thinks it's a lack of discipline – yet I still do my laces left-over-right as he taught me and do my work first before playing. My mom (who I inherited chronic depression from) thinks I'm looking too hard. But one has never had emotional problems while the other only had one. They never watched me as I studied throughout school, a comment that the person performing my screening wasn't too happy about. I've always had issues with focus, motivation, and procrastination. It's never been because I was lazy – when I come home for the holidays I'm outside six hours of the day chopping wood for the winter, cleaning out the garage and animal/garage/storage ""shop"" (two-story garage with animal pens, lofts for storage, tool space). Adderall has certainly helped me bring focus to my work and boost my productivity. But is it because I have ADHD, or is it just a lack of dopamine from depression/bipolar disorder?

I'm ranting everywhere about everything. I'm sorry. Last week was rough and from here on out, like with every end of the semester, it's all uphill until the last final exam. You guys know what it's like. At least I get to work tomorrow; I love my job. I have a Philosophy exam to finish studying for and I should continue my work on my Networking Programming project. Just one more day. I can get up early tomorrow and study hard before taking the exam.

Maybe I should look at being hired on as a 3/4-time employee and part-time student. I love my job and it would help slowing school down a bit, but if I can pass everything I'll be done in a year and a half. That and I need to get a least one internship in. Graduating with a CS degree isn't enough on it's own, after all!

Thanks guys. Your conversations, quips, study advice, and stories about success have really helped. If anything I'm spending my time better doing things that get me through classes with good grades (and comprehension) for most assignments because of what you guys post on here regularly. ADHD or no, this is certainly a subreddit of great advice for getting through rough times and college. Keep it up, ya hear? I can still past my classes if I can do well on my finals. I'm not out of the game yet!"

Now, I expect to be in this role for 1-3 years more to pay my dues and get experience in IT generally. And I am not bad at it. I get the customer support part of it. I can fake smiles, laughter, playful banter, relaxing affirmations, patience, being friendly, social, and understanding all day. 

But, I hate it. I can bare doing that kind of stuff for maybe 2-4 hours a day, but not all day. I am not an outgoing guy that enjoys being social and meeting lots of new people all the time. I don't thrive off of people, I thrive off of locking myself into a problem by myself until I can find the solution, then consulting with a team of other people for the next move, then rinse and repeat. I love when I have an hour or two where I can just rest my face instead of having to put on the phony smile and actually get some real work done in peace.

I want to start getting a plan for my next move to be very much the opposite direction of my current work environment, where instead of constantly running around and engaging with users, I am in a cubicle or server room talking to almost none of them. 

Now, I know I could try and make a dramatic career change into software or web development, and that would solve my problem, but I feel like that will be a big leap and starting from scratch again, since it has little to do with IT. I also am not sure I can compete with the quality of programmers who are younger and much better than me at this point.

Right now I kind of know a little bit of everything, but not much of one thing. I know networking basics, some programming in C/Bash/Python, html/javascript and design, some SQL, linux and mac administration... and would be happy in either of those directions honestly. I just don't know which way to focus (or another way?).

So my question is, if I want to eventually be away from end-users (and not trading them too much for internal interaction), but be in a position that builds off of the experience that one gains from working desktop experience (or where that experience is considered worth something), what would you recommend I do? I realize that there will always be some social interaction component to IT, and I get that, but I can't imagine doing this same kind of thing in 10 years, faking smiles while another user yells at me for something I have no control over 5-10 times an hour, every hour. I can handle it, but my goal is to get beyond it."

-------------------------

We use the following technologies:

• Linux. Linux. And more Linux.

• Cisco Nexus Switching: data centre scale deployments.

• Network protocols: OSPF, BGP, TCP/IP, Diffserv, Ethernet, IPSec.

• Petabyte storage systems. Highly available with disaster recovery.

• Python. It glues our infrastructure together.

• XML/XSLT/JSON. We manage our inventory and firewalls using these data formats.

• Software builds. We maintain a number of optimised scientific computing libraries.

• HPC. We run a powerful compute cluster with high performance network interconnects.

--------------------------

My question is how can I prove myself to this company when I have little knowledge on many of the areas listed above? Are there any projects I could undertake that would prove/improve many of the skills in the list above such as building my own mock system infrastructure (how would I do this)?"

I'm needing to see whether it is more economical to use our current crappy steam powered condensate return pump as opposed to replacing it with an electrical pump.

Unfortunately, my knowledge of AC power is very limited and Google wasn't much help.

**Why are there two values for current?** I found a calculator online, but it needed a power factor. **How could I find power factor?**

**Could you also explain this step-by-step so I can learn how to find this in the future?** I work under a Facilities engineer, so it's about 70% Mechanical and 30% Electrical in discipline, and calculating average AC power consumption comes up quite often.

Long story short, I had a few years of college where I dealt with some serious depression and anxiety issues. First couple of years GPA was OK (like a 3.2-3.3) and then tanked after I stopped going to class, taking tests, everything really, and almost got kicked out of college. GPA dropped to a 1.9 at one point but I'm on the up and up now, getting help for some issues, got back into the engineering program I dropped out of, and hoping to finish in the next 2 years.

Problem is right now my GPA is around a 2.8. I'm happy about the progress I've made from an abysmal 1.9 but I realize this still isn't a great GPA and I'm worried about it affecting my ability to get internships and a good job when I graduate. I've taken so many credits on my transcript at this point that making any drastic changes to the GPA is difficult. At best I might get up to a 3.0-3.2.

Anyone else have experience with this? (With the low GPA, not necessarily the depression and anxiety) Is it still possible for me to get internships while in school? And in turn a decent job when I graduate? Any input is appreciated, thanks."

* I have a Github account, but I still am not quite sure what to do with it.  I feel like I'm only just now getting to the point that I could create anything worthwhile (just finished up a class on Data Structures).

* What useful skills should I work on between classes in order to stand out?  I've started working on learning SQL after my exposure to it at the previous internship, but for some of these things I feel like getting a job in it is honestly the best way to gain experience/practice."

I'm 17 years old. My birthday's in July next year. I'm French and I'll be living off on my own then. 

For my entire life I've been living in Malaysia and India. Therefore I don't know much about the French culture or European traditions. (I haven't been in France a lot). Also I've finished high school six months ago, and since then I have been interning in a webdesiging company for two months, then worked for a language center in the next four months. 

(I've thought myself HTML and CSS - Webdesigning languages) and I suppose we could call it a skill, adding it is something I like
(I also love writing and reading / I teach French on Saturdays.)
(During my first internship, I've been living on my own - However the bills weren't paid by me)
(I do not know how to drive, and I am planning on seriously learning it soon)

However I ignore on precisely what to research for my future, what to plan.

I probably will be heading to Paris since:
1) Big cities generally offer a lot of jobs
2) It was more of my parents choice then mine. 
3) I'm sort of cool with it, but I'm trying to keep an open-minded mind?
4) I don't think I'l be heading off to college, because I could be working and gaining experience instead but then again (Staying open-minded) - and I really don't know too much about college, since most of my acquaintances haven't finished school or has already finished but are searching for jobs.
5) Costs of living?
6) Arrondisements to live in?
7) Entry level jobs I could obtain the instant I reach there?
8) Rights when I'll be 18
9 and 10) How will the ""Carte vitale"" work? along with accomodation and la ""securite sociale""


I apologize for all of this, but I've spent my day-off trying to get into researching yet I'm just wandering without aim. So I thought I could seek help.

Background for those who missed my first one: I'm working as an intern for $LocalAdministration. Lots of people there are afraid of computers, and one can not say about many of the public employees that they are hard-working people without lying, but yet they want everything to go smoothly, they probably want their Facebook to load faster than their work.

---

This didn't happen to me but to the other intern. I was probably replacing some VGA cable or ugrading Java or something of the sort at that moment.

We got a ticket about a printer not working. It was not very descriptive, so my companion went there to find out what was happening. Conversation was like this:

&gt;**$NotKoTL**: Hi, $User? I'm $NotKoTL from the IT department. I've come to find out what the problem with your printer is.

&gt;**$User**: Ah, I've had that problem before, I think I know the solution: It needs **more proxy**.

Restarting the spooler service gave the user all the proxy he needed."

I'm a sophomore undergrad Chem E student who's really keen on getting an internship for the summer of 2016.

I have a 3.94/4.00 GPA as well as some research experience, but I only go to a state school rather than some big-name engineering school, so I don't know how that affects my chances.

Over winter break, I was thinking about taking a lot of time (I've been insanely busy recently with finals week approaching) to send as many applications as I can. But I'm curious if winter break is a poor time to be searching for summer positions? I know many companies have already made their decisions for summer hires. Is there any advantage in following up on the places where I've already applied instead? Or maybe some combination of both of those? Any advice would be extremely appreciated!"

3u8wz2,41,2015-11-25,"Something in Dearfield, Colorado",PiercedRose,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3u8wz2/something_in_dearfield_colorado/,"I shouldn't have let my curiosity get the better of me, but as a college student studying history, I just couldn't pass up a trip to the abandoned town once I had heard of it. It was just a few miles down the road, forgotten amidst the slayings of time, and I reprimanded myself for not having investigated its promise before. Hell, I had not even known it had existed before I met Lily.

Lily was a history major as well, and we met at an internship at our local museum. She was a perky girl with midnight skin, and she bounced about her day with an air of enthusiasm only those still pure at heart seem to have. All right, she was gorgeous, but I put that fact in the back of my mind for the sake of the internship.
It was when we were working on a new exhibit about ghost towns that Lily brought up Dearfield. Or, rather, she held the answer to my rather rambunctious question.

""Dearfield? What's that?"" I asked, flipping through photographs of weather-worn buildings and houses taken over by the jaws of nature.

""Ooooh, you've never heard of it?"" Lily leaned in closer, smiling. ""My grandfather was from Dearfield.""

""No shit?""

""I wouldn't lie to you. A businessman from Boulder settled it around 1910. Oliver Jackson I believe was his name. He dreamed of a colony for African Americans right outside of town here in Greeley. Not many people lived there, but the land was very dear to them, hence the name.""

""What happened?""

""What do you think, history nerd? The Great Depression hit and the town went bankrupt. The settlers left to find better opportunities, especially when Jackson died at the end of World War Two.""

I stared at the pictures, mesmerized by the decay. ""And this is right outside of Greeley?""

""Yup.""

""How come I've never heard of it before?"" That question was forefront on my mind. I felt idiotic, narrow-minded, buried under a rock.

""Not many people have. You blink and you miss it."" Lily held her eyes shut for a few seconds before opening them, black orbs of opportunity. ""But I suppose it was just forgotten about, and there's not much you can do to reclaim memories that don't exist.""

""But you said your grandfather was from Dearfield?""

Lily smiled. ""That's right. He was born there, but his parents moved pretty quickly. He said something about the place just not being good to a child during the Depression.""

""How come you've never mentioned it before?""

""Why should I have? My grandpa never really brought it up, and I never really pried.""

I caressed the pictures with my index finger gently. The material felt cool against my skin. ""I would love to talk to him about it. We could totally turn it into a historical landmark or something.""
""There is already one in place; I think they built it in 2010. And I wish you could talk to my grandpa, but he's dead now.""

I glanced up at Lily, genuine sorrow coursing through my body. ""I'm sorry.""

""We weren't close. But if you want to know more about it, you can still go visit it. It's not even a twenty minute drive from here.""

The disappointment quickly vanished. I smiled. ""I know what I'm doing Saturday, then. Care to give me directions?""

Lily wrote down some tentative tips on how to get to Dearfield, and she gave them to me with a strange expression on her face.

""What is it?""

She pursed her lips slightly and furrowed her brow. ""It's just . . .  my grandpa never had any good things to say about the place. And I'd have to agree with him. I've only been there once, and I wasn't too impressed.""

I raised an eye at her. We lived in cow-town Greeley, a city which literally stank like shit. Any place other than that was interesting and grand. ""Thanks for the warning, Lily, but I can brace myself for disappointment. I'm a history major, for fuck's sake.""

That made her laugh. ""All right. Just don't say I didn't tell you so.""

I was true to my word. That Saturday, I packed a camera, a few water bottles, and snacks as I made my way to Dearfield. Excitement coursed like electricity through my body, and I drove having to keep slowing my car down when I chanced a glance at the speedometer. I passed the Swift plant, lamenting briefly for the fallen souls, and then I immediately craved a hamburger. I stopped in Eaton to grab a Big Mac.

Belly full, I drove further into nowhere. I spotted a few neat birds which broke up the monotony of the dying grasslands, but I was no ornithologist. I was a historian, and one who almost missed the abandoned building on his right at that.

""Blink and you miss it,"" Lily had said, and she had been right. I had to make a dangerous u-turn before pulling up to the first building, exhilaration like cancer in my veins when I spotted its dilapidated structure and more behind. The air was brisk as I walked up to the first building, footsteps crunching in the decaying nature, backpack swung like a rifle on my back. The sign on the structure still read, ""Dearfield Lunch Room. Short Orders and Quick Lunches."" I snapped a picture and peered inside at the remains of what was probably once a popular eatery. I could almost smell the grease, but that might've just been my leftover McDonalds. I snapped a few more pictures and moved on.

I came across the remnants of the lodge, and the decrepit ruins of a small school house. In the former rested skeleton bed frames rusted red, and in the latter I caught images of termite-infested desks and chairs, and even an old chalkboard that portrayed a child's drawing of a cow. The few houses in between the landmarks had been torn down by the elements and devoured by insects. In the dying light of the day, I was able to encapsulate the already dead town. I even came upon a marker, like a tombstone, that had been placed there to commemorate the dreams that had vanished there.

""Dearfield, Colorado. Colorado entrepreneur and messenger for three governors, Mr. O.T. (Oliver Toussaint) Jackson filed a desert claim to create the African-American agricultural colony of Dearfield in May 1910. Dr. Joseph H.P. Westbrook M.D. of Denver proclaimed at an organizational meeting in 1909 that the fields 'will be very dear to us,' thus giving the community its name. The first settlers moved here in 1911, and by 1920 Dearfield had more than  200 residents, two churches, a school and a restaurant and plans to build a canning factory and college by the time residents and agricultural experts seriously noticed the diminishing rainfall. Eastern Weld County was part of the Dust Bowl and Dearfield never recovered. In 1946, Dearfield had a population of one. Today, Dearfield remains a symbol of Western pride and empowerment for many African Americans.""

The monument had been put there in 2010, and already it was starting to weather like the town it stood for. I wondered at what it might have been like to have had to survive during such a period of drought, depression, and oppression. I thought I could hear the swing music pouring out of the lounge. I thought I could see children stampeding through the grasslands in search of water. I thought I could smell the farmlands on the air. And, in fact, I perhaps was catching the aroma of the beef processing plant just a few miles away. I was used to the smell, but it was a little overbearing on the heavy winds, so I gagged a bit and drew my hoodie up over my nose.

Imagining the past, my eyes strayed over to one of the lifeless churches. Was that the bell chime I heard on the rancid wind? I strayed over to its doors, and I was immediately berated by the scent of spoiled meat. Doubling over, I attempted to catch my breath only to have it stolen by the smell again. Never before had the odor of cows been so strong, not even as I passed the factory. I wondered if it had been near a farmstead, but there were no signs of agriculture near the church. Drawing my hoodie closer to my mouth and nose, I pushed past the crumbling doors into the church.

Inside, I immediately just found rows of pews and a statue of a dying Jesus. Whatever paintings had adorned the wall had been washed off by time. Bibles littered the isles. And there was that odor, much more pungent now. The church smelled like hell, and I had to pull my hoodie down to empty my stomach upon the floors of the once holy site.

That's when things went downhill.

That's when I discovered what had really driven the people out of Dearfield.

Huddled on the ground, the sound of something wet sloshing towards me made me grab my stomach in a fetal position. My camera and bag were discarded right next to me like the town. Tipping my head slightly, I threw up again when I saw what was coming for me.

It was large, perhaps about six foot, and the smell that permeated off of it caused an intense wave of nausea to hit me. It was humanoid in form, and I suspected it might have been in reality, but a cow skin hung over it and covered its face like a mask. I knew the pelt was genuine. It radiated the smell of rotting meat, and it even had a green tinge to it. The buzzing of insects caused a pounding sensation in my stomach, and I curled up in a ball on the ground, willing, wishing the creature came no closer.

Of course it did. I was prey, it the butcher.

I drew out a knife from a fold in its skin, and it hovered over me, a vengeful god. It snorted like a cow would, but how its motives were so different! With an expert hand, it grasped my arm and began to saw.

I screamed in terror through the burbling of vomit. Blood pooled on the floor next to me, showering my entire body in crimson. I felt it slice through my flesh as easily as unzipping a coat, and the methodical nature of the cutting made the pain terribly predictable.

It was when it hit bone, resulting in a strange sort of *clanking* sound, that the blackness swallowed me.




I woke up with a fragile head and a searing arm. I glanced over to my arm and realized it had been sawed clean through; blood was crusted all over me like some horrible crayon drawing. I noted my body still huddled in a fetal position, only this time metal bars surrounded me, crushing my limbs inward as I was unable to move. I turned my head slightly (that was the only thing I could do) and surveyed my surroundings.

I was in a dimly lit room with dappled red floors and walls. The metallic stench of blood and the foul odor of rotting meat filled the small room. Cages lined the walls, and a table stood in the  middle holding knives and the body parts of humans. I choked out a sob which reverberated loudly through the room.

""Hello?""

I turned me head to the other side and the figure of an emaciated girl swam into my vision. She could not have been older than sixteen, and her clothes hung loosely on her ragged frame. I noticed immediately that she was missing both of her arms and that the foul smell centered largely around her. Her wounds oozed color into the effluvia of human excrement. She stared at me with wide, blue eyes. She repeated her greeting, and I whispered a reply back.

""Hey,"" was all I was able to get out.

""What's your name?"" Her voice sounded harsh as though it were grating on sand paper, and she leaned up against the confines of her cage to get just an inch closer to me.

""Jayce,"" I replied. I found myself wriggling closer to her as well.

""I'm Hannah."" As though that pile of decaying flesh could have an identity! But she launched into what was obviously bothering her right away. ""These cages are old, so usually it cuts off both arms so we can't escape. But you still have one.""

It took me a moment to process her frankness. In the meantime, she apologized for being so blunt.

""Sorry, Jayce. It's just . . . I've been here for a while now. I don't really know how long, but I've seen it kill three other people. I'm . . . I'm next, I think. Do you think you can try the bars? Do you think you can try to get out of there before it comes back?""

Again, the questions barraged my aching mind, but I shifted a bit so I could get a better look at Hannah. She looked downright miserable; her face was covered with grime, and underneath it I could see the blossoming rouge of a fever. Her hair, an indiscernible color, appeared to have been chopped off at an odd angle. But her blue eyes still shone at me with hope, and so I moved my good arm until it was able to grasp at the bars of my cage. This made Hannah smile; she had a rather pretty one despite her pitiful appearance.

I don't know how long I tried at the cage. There were no windows in the room to mark the time, so it may have been hours, or perhaps even days. Hannah watched me the whole time, huddled with her knees to her chest in what looked like a rather uncomfortable position, and she pitched in a few comments here and there.

""Try that bar, the one right there. Yeah, that one.""

""Maybe tug at it a bit harder?""

""I think the lock's right by you now; try it.""

When she mentioned the lock, I felt it slip into my sweating hand. I yanked it with as much force as I could muster, but it only groaned slightly against the pressure. However, Hannah seemed excited by this.

""I think it's giving! Try harder!""

As I gritted my teeth and gripped it tighter, pulling at it over and over again, I heard footsteps from outside a wooden door that led into the room. My heart plummeted. Hannah's smile faded.

The creature entered the room. Its smell filled the room completely, and I hurled on myself as the nausea came back. The human with the cow skin passed my cage and stood in front of Hannah's, fiddling with the lock to her cage.

""No no no no,"" Hannah chanted. Her pleas grew in fervor when the creature got her lock off, and she began to thrash as it hoisted her up with one cruelly strong arm. I tried at my own lock with a greater intensity. I don't know what I would have done to save Hannah had I got the lock off in time, but maybe I would not have had to see the creature pin her down to the table and rhythmically chop off her body parts in harmony to her screams. Only after her tortured yells had died did my lock finally give.

I quietly pushed myself out of the creaking cage, and when the creature noticed me, it stepped away from Hannah's body and made towards me like a raging bull. I awkwardly found my footing and made for the door. I think I was shrieking as it grunted behind me. I think I may have been crying. Either way, I booked it, threw open the door even against the protesting pain of my absent arm, and made my way up a flight of rickety stairs. When I found myself back in the church after undoing a hatch in the ceiling, I ran past the decaying Jesus and ancient pews and found myself back in Dearfield.

The brisk air cut daggers into my wound, but I still sprinted towards the entrance where my car was still parked. I did not look behind me. I did not have to. I could still smell it coming after me.

I fumbled with the keys to my car (I had left them in the passenger's seat), and before long, I was off, just catching a glimpse of the dust and soulless black eyes of my tormentor.

I went immediately to the hospital after having to stop to throw up when I passed the Swift factory. They questioned me over and over again as to the cause of my injuries, but I just said there was something in Dearfield. I believe the police went to investigate, but when they came over to my apartment, they reported that they found nothing. I cannot say that I wasn't surprised.

Years later, I had worked with Lily to preserve Dearfield and had succeeded in getting the local authorities to put up ""no trespassing"" signs and barbed wire around the town. She didn't quite understand what had happened to me, and I never completely told her the whole story, not even when we got married.

My life is fairly normal now, and I teach history at the local university. But I still refuse to step foot in that dreaded Dearfield again. I even have an aversion to meat now.

But to anyone driving through Colorado, I just beg that you do not stop at that abandoned inn. If your car breaks down, just run. And, above all, do not go into that church.

After all, there is something in Dearfield, Colorado.

3uaajt,3,2015-11-25,Why are seasonal (year-round) internships somewhat less common in the US?,1stletmetakeaslefie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uaajt/why_are_seasonal_yearround_internships_somewhat/,"I'm sure that many US companies have internships year-round. That's not my point.

I got to school in Canada, and the vast majority of companies with Canadian engineering offices will offer internships throughout the year, either coinciding with semester start dates or with flexible start/end dates (e.g. Beginning of February to the end of May). This is common among the top tech companies in my hometown, which include many large major startups as well as AMZN.

But when you look at the top American tech companies, whether they're larger blue chips like GOOG or FB, or FinTech companies like Jane Street or Square, or unicorns like Pinterest or Uber, the recruiting they do is overwhelmingly targeted towards internships that occur once a year, between May and August, aka summer internships. Having internships three times a year, with the exception of small/mid-sized local companies or startups, appears to be much rarer down south.

I've always wondered why that is."

(CA, United States)

Just a little back story: I've been working as an intern for the past three months, and the experience has been horrible. I was brought in (second year computer science student) to complete a monumental task that is way above my abilities. Along the way, I've had no mentor-ship, not guidance, and have not been provided any of the necessary tools to even start this project. The company demands 8-9 hour days, 5 days a week. When I signed on for this opportunity, I was told it would be part time, work around my school schedule, and that I would be assisting some of the engineers with this assignment. It ended up consisting of me being the organizer and owner of this assignment, something I soon learned that their team of 5 engineers failed at many times, yet here I was expected to do it in half the time the previous team attempted to do it in, and completely by myself.

It got to the point where the internship was calling for almost all of my time, and my grades were suffering. I approached the executive who hired me, and let him know that I needed to cut back my hours a bit (from 8-9 a day to about 4-5) so I could pass my classes. He gave me the ultimatum of staying with the same schedule or quitting, so I quit on the spot. I had an excel project I was working on for them (separate from my main ""impossible"" project) that has a bunch of custom macros and equations (on a company laptop). The project itself wasn't really of interest to anyone, it was more or less on the back burner. When I quit, he asked me to come in the next day to discuss things, and see if we could find a solution to me quitting. Our discussion ended up being about me coming in to the office to explain this excel sheet I created so they can use it in the future. This was literally the first time they ever showed interest in this project, so it was a little weird. I told him I would get back to him, but right now I'm keeping myself busy with trying to salvage my gpa. When he kept pushing me to make a commitment to come in on a specific date to go over the excel sheet, I flat out told him I can't commit to that right now, but I'd be more than happy to return the laptop as soon as possible. His response was ""you can't just quit and not give us anything."" 

My experiences here make it hard for me to want to help them out, when I was pretty much set up to fail from day one. I was considering spending some time explaining this document to them, but now I feel like it would be a waste of my time. My  question is, if I were to send back the laptop with all of the excel sheets deleted, could I get into legal trouble?"

Next semester I'll only be taking 9 hours so I'd like to get an internship.  Naturally it would make sense for my internship to at least be tangentially related to what my career would be in.  So I'd like to figure out what I want that to be first.  

* 1.  What jobs/languages have the best outlook going forward, money-wise?   
* 2.  What jobs/languages are most insulated from H1bs, cheap foreign labor, etc.?   
* 3.  What jobs/languages are most likely to still be around a long time from now?   
* 4.  Is is still worth it to learn to do COBOL or other mainframe work?  I took a COBOL class and I have a friend who works in COBOL and tells me that that language isn't going away anytime soon.   
* 5.  Any advice for getting internships if you are an online student?  One of my conundrums is that I live in Raleigh North Carolina, but my university is in South Dakota, so they are unlikely to be able to help me get an internship.       
* 6.  Any websites or resources to help find internships/careers?  A general nation-wide website is fine, or one for my specific area (Raleigh NC).

3ub92c,0,2015-11-26,Never compared myself to others until I got an offer at a prestigious tech firm. How to deal with being insecure about my career?,extremelymediocredev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ub92c/never_compared_myself_to_others_until_i_got_an/,"I've always thought of myself as mediocre at best - I go to a decent, but not great, school, my GPA is pretty bad, and I don't have any significant achievements, internships, or side projects. Throughout college, I figured that if I could graduate and get myself an average paying job in my hometown, I'd already be pretty happy, seeing as I don't think I'm even average. I'd see my peers getting jobs at Google or Facebook or what have you and think to myself ""Well, so and so is really smart and hard working, so it's no surprise that they managed to get a prestigious and high-paying job"". I'd never be jealous or even think that I could manage to get there one day; I would've been perfectly content to just grind away making CRUD apps for companies that don't care about tech. Heck, I thought so lowly of myself that I didn't really even bother applying for internships to these companies, thinking that there's no way I'd make it and that I'd just be wasting time.

Well, as luck would have it, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to have him refer me to the company he was working at (one of the big 4). I figured if I didn't need to ""waste"" time doing an application and just needed him to forward my resume, then why not? I expected it to get lost and that I'd just get rejected, or that I'd just flop out on a phone screen but, long story short, here I am with an offer from one of the big 4. It's been a few weeks since then, and I've since accepted the offer, but now I can't help but wonder if I could do even better.

I find it weird, because I never compared myself to others before. I'd just accept the fact that I was a below-average CS student with below-average job prospects and that my peers were just really smart, dedicated individuals; if someone got an average job and I got a below-average job, then that was because they're better than me and that I wouldn't be able to reach that level. However, now that I've gotten an offer at a big 4, I don't look at other people getting offers at seemingly more prestigious companies the same way anymore - I no longer think ""they're smarter/work harder than me"", but ""if I worked harder, that could've been me"". I look at the job offer I have, and the money I'll be making, and can't help but feel a tinge of jealousy when I see these better offers because I now feel that they're in my league rather than leaps and bounds above my capabilities.

There's obviously a cut-off point where you don't think ""that could be me"" (e.g. you'd never imagine yourself being a billionaire at the age of 23), but while going from starting at 50k/year at a mediocre company as an average developer to 6 figures at a big 4 seems like it would require you to be much smarter, once you've passed the gauntlet at Microsoft, you'd assume that you could also probably get into Amazon, Google, or Facebook, and it's not too far of a stretch to think that you could get into even more selective companies like Uber, Palantir, Twitter, etc.

Has anyone else felt a change in mindset after ""making it""? How do you deal with constantly comparing yourself to others?

**tl;dr** mediocre student that never compared myself to others, but got offer from one of the big 4 and now can't help but feel insecure and think that I could've done even better; how to cope?"

So to start it off, I live in a shitty area, Bronx NY. Jobs out here are abysmal and expect perfection at minimum wage. I tend to work only in the city, and been applying to entry level jobs even though my past recent work consist of manager of own department in a bigger pet store, regular sales employee in another store, and working as an intern help desk tech. Was laid off 4 months ago and ""living off unemployment"" using money I saved off work. I live alone in a place ""paid"" by parents. 

I really want to go back to school, but it seems impossible. School $ aid won't provide me with anything because I had to drop out. Unable to work so can't pay for my own tuition, even if I could best I can probably get now is 10 hourly, under 1.5k a month. I'd have to save up for that + books. Luckily I have a community college that's a 10 minute walk from home, but the issue still comes back to money. As far as getting a loan or something, been told that's not possible because I'm not employed.

I just really don't know how to fix this situation. I really want to study marine biology, but I'm more leaning towards IT due to it's demand in the city. Don't believe I have the willpower to study programming, but I maybe study for comptia certifications and try to get back into help desk or something.

Yes

Thanks a lot for reading this post. I have finally decided to build my first PC and I'd love to hear your opinions about a few issues I have found while searching for parts.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I have 2 objectives with this build:

1. I am finishing my internship in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Madrid, and I have been creating a few games to help patients with neurological deficits. Id like to know what specs would you recommend for unity developement (my current PC crashes when importing or compliling, my guess is the 4GB RAM with Vista crappy setup) and Unreal engine (24 GB of RAM recommended for the kite boy demo?). I am planning on creating simple games (brain training like, but with specific adaptations based on the patient deficits), but with enough time and those sweet free Infinity Blade Asset Packs I would love to create something bigger.

2. Playing games, Id love to play recent games and next years ones with comfy setteings (my current build is a Radeon Hd 3450, I am not picky at all, 1080p 30fps with no drops and medium quality is enough, I will end up just playing SpaceChem, Eve and Infinity Engine RPGs anyways).


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

My budget is around 600 euros

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I live in Spain

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**My current issues:**

**GPU:** 2GB AMD MSI R9 380             160Euro
or   4GB Sapphire R9 380  Nitro     200 Euro

Nvidia cards in that range are more expensive (20-40 euro), also 290 and 285x are hard to find at a good price.

**Are the 2 extra GB worth it? What would you pick?**

**MOBO and CPU**

I see people recommend a lot this combo, would you recommend it?

Intel Core i5-4460 3.2GHz Quad-Core Processor	
ASRock H97 Anniversary ATX LGA1150 Motherboard

I can only find the MOBO for at least double the newegg price, after choosing the CPU, what specs should I look for in the MOBO?

Logical increments recommends a i3 4160.... Would that be enough?


**The rest of the parts I am collecting are:**


**PSU:** Corsair CX600 V2 600W  60Euro

**RAM:** G.Skill Sniper DDR3 1866 8GB 2x4GB   35Euros

**SSD:** Crucial BX100 - Disco duro solido SSD de 250 GB  70Euro

I'm in a predicament and I need some advice because I'm running out of options. A few years I ruined my life by getting arrested. I was 17 (living in North Carolina), and I stole money because, well, I was an idiot. Looking back now I can only shake my head. The entire ordeal resulted in me paying back the money and getting about a year or probation. I ended up taking a plea and got a misdemeanor on my record. I started community college, and got a degree. Two years after my first incident I got in trouble again this time, I worked at a department store and overcharged him $15. I never touched that money, and it went to the store. Guess who found himself getting arrested again? Me. Over $15. The guy called the store and instead of them refunding the money (and me being allowed to pay it out of pocket myself) he pressed charges. I got another larceny charge and felt like a moron. I paid the restitution ($15) and the rest of the fees. No probation, no nothing, moved on with my life. Since then I've held about 6 other jobs, all specialized, never any issues. I'm 23 now, I'm about to finish my bachelors up, debating on whether to go to graduate school or not.

Except no company wants to do business with me because I'm a thief. In the past I've only been denied one job and an apartment lease because of my background. Out of the 6 employers that I have had since then, 4 never looked into my background and the other 2 kind of gave me the benefit of the doubt since I don't look, nor act like a terrible person.

Now that I can apply to big companies and look for a career, I also face the reality that the errors I've made, despite not being violent or involving drugs, have effectively ruined any chances I could have of living a normal life. So I feel like I'm handicapped, although It's not as serious, I feel like I've lost an arm. I can still live my life but it won't be like everyone else does.

I recently landed an internship doing my dream job, at an international multibillion dollar company. There's a possibility of it becoming a full time if they like me. The people who will oversee my internship are a contracting company who have never met me, or who I will have a chance to talk to. I just need to give them the authorization to look into my background so they can tell me that I can't work there. And quite frankly I don't know if I can handle that.

I don't know what to do. Whether to pursue the internship and hope for the best. Whether to decline it for some made-up reason. But that doesn't fix the rest of my life. Will I have to settle for mediocrity because I can't get a job at a big company? I know today everyone is thankful for what they have. Every other aspect of my life is great but my future is dim.

Will I learn about the use of these while earning my degree or is it something that I will learn through internships and jobs? Or is it just in me to learn how to use these things? The tools I am thinking about most is things like Git, or the more advanced features of Eclipse.

I'm not one of those who need everything to be on Ultra and was doing only a low pay internship, so i built it with these specs:

* Asus B85M-E/BR motherboard
* Intel I5-4460 3.20GHz
* Kingston Hyper 8GB (2x4) DDR3 1600Mhz RAM
* Corsair 600W CX600

So, with it i can play all the games i like, such as TES: Skyrim, GTA V and Civ V without much of a trouble, as well as using it to code and run local servers for development smoothly.

This week, my parents PC died, and they got a new one, since this one was at least 6 year old. Around 2010 they got a **Sapphire Radeon HD 4550** 512MB, which is there without use. Would it improve my experience to use it on my desktop, since it isn't integrated, or i would be better off with the processor one?

I looked all over google but couldn't find some comparative, and hardware isn't that much of my kind.

Thanks, people! :)"

3uguuw,4,2015-11-27,Entry level (truly) and changing careers. Can't find a temp agency to help me. Please read within,Applicant123,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/3uguuw/entry_level_truly_and_changing_careers_cant_find/,"I graduated 6 years ago and went straight into graduate school for early childhood education. It is not a career I want to pursue.

Unfortunately, despite an undergraduate degree with some exposure to finance courses and being computer literate, I have neither enough professional office experience (have worked part-time as an assistant, including a lot of work that could parlay into assistant work) and I feel I lack many of the computer skills asked for (Excel for finance/marketing jobs, Quickbooks, Adobe Suite). 

I have a not-terrible resume and I really would like some experience--even unpaid--but I've applied to Atrium, Gainor, Beacon Staffing Windsor, etc. in addition to every type of part-time, entry level marketing and sales, and entry level receptionist job (where the duties listed on phone calls, cleaning, scheduling meetings, etc.) 

I failed to intern in college and that's really hurting me; at this stage unfortunately I am too old and seemingly too unskilled to qualify for internships as well. 

I am not sure what to do. 

At this stage I feel like I'm at the same disadvantage as someone who only got a high school education; I need unpaid or paid work where I am allowed to learn (training on the job, based on intermediate computer literacy but less so in programs in the MS Office used most in offices--Excel, Quickbooks, Access)--or guidance into the volunteer position or the low level job position where that is allowed. 

Are there any temps that actually do that anymore? 

I'm continually told temp agencies can't find an opening for someone like me despite freelance experience that relates to a lot of the office jobs I'm applying for. 

eta: I specified this in a second comment, but make use of most of Microsoft Suite and continue to experiment with Excel, Access, Outlook, and so on. But each office use these for their own ends, and without the benefit of a classroom or an office exchanging data with it (like Microsoft Office for business functions...or an internship) it's difficult to learn with confidence. 

I can take continuing education classes and go to whatever computer workshops I have access to but I'm asking because three years ago, I get the impression these temp agencies might have been able to offer some guidance. Right now I'm cold calling for positions that indicate they'll train applicants, that say they're suited for recent college graduates, or that these are entry level, and unable to find anything. "

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3fcc7p/tifu_by_getting_a_job_in_a_field_i_have/

So it's been a few months, and I'm still getting PMs from the wonderful people that have been giving me advice for an update.

One disclaimer I didn't mention previously was that I used to be a surgical intern, finished my PGY-1, but I didn't rematch, so I was doing research (still am).  I recently applied for the match, so we'll see how things go.  That said...

Many of you were right.  The company is in absolute disarray.  I'm wearing multiple hats (SEO, UX, backend, database, etc) to the point where I am now a CTO (seriously).  

It was nice to have some additional income for something I can dictate what I do when I do it (research 9 - 5, and then do this at home), but the multiple hats I had to wear for the company was ridiculous.  During our first conf call, the CEO (he's more of a visionary than an actual doer) asked me if I can do this, that, and a multiple other things, some of which were possible, and some that weren't possible at all.  However, I was able to manage his expectations and get to work.

I changed the website completely from a geocities-like website to something more user friendly and clean/neat using various scripts from other websites.  I also integrated merchant processing to the back end...y'know, so we can make money.  Before this, we had paypal alone.

I had to outsource SEO a little bit, mainly because I had no clue how local SEOs worked, even with several days of me studying and researching it.  I'm not entirely sure even SEO ""experts"" truly know how it works, but it was a good investment because I was there to make sure I knew exactly how to do what and learn from the ""expert.""

I had to make up a database and learned some SQL along the way, because previous to this, the CEO was just using excel.

About a week into it all, I asked during a conf call with the CEO and the CFO, ""Hey, who's our marketing guy...?""  ...silence.  So then I started doing some market research, thanks to mturk that I used to use in college for some extra bucks here and there.  They were amazed that I could get a market response within a few hours.

Anyway.  There's a lot I'm skipping over.  Just the minutia of what I had to do to even get this thing up and running.  Overall, I learned quite a few things, and I really appreciate everyone for their input and advice and even offers to help out.  You guys are awesome.  Now we're somewhat on track to start making SOME money, as we weren't previously.

As for the future of the company, I'm not entirely sure we're going to get anywhere too far.  Maybe we can get to 300 - 500k a year, and make ourselves a chunk of change, but other than that, there's really no vision of taking it further.  The team (myself, CFO, and CEO) disagree on a lot of things as far as how we can get it to grow, and the CEO is very hesitant of spending even a few hundred dollars here and there for new tools/severs/computers.  

I'll be here until next summer, when I start my residency again, and then after that, we'll see how things go.

TL;DR - got hired as a UX programmer with absolutely NO knowledge of the field, learned a lot on the way, wore multiple hats, made some money."
3uhufd,4,2015-11-27,Anyone know how to unlock an encrypted pdf file?,anonymous_potato,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3uhufd/anyone_know_how_to_unlock_an_encrypted_pdf_file/,"So our company has contracts with clients and we had an employee who would scan the contracts into a pdf file and then encrypt them with a password.  That employee left in 2013, but she trained an intern who took over the scanning and encrypting.  That intern left in 2014.  I started working here in 2015 and today an employee is telling me that they're trying to look up a contract, but the password doesn't work.  Apparently, the employee who left in 2013 used a password that everyone knew.  For some reason, the intern used a different password that no one knows and they're asking me if I can ""hack"" into the files for them.

Anyway, the good news is that we have hard copies somewhere but I'm not looking forward to rescanning a year's worth of contracts.  We've emailed the intern, but considering that it's been over a year since they worked here, I'm not counting on them remembering the password they used if they even respond.  I'm gonna try to run a program to brute force the password over the weekend, but is there anything else I can do?  I hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving."

Right now, I'm considering a major in physics out of interest in the subject. However, I don't think a life of academia suites me well, so I expect I'll be going into software engineering (or perhaps quantitative finance) after graduation. I have many years of experience coding as a hobby, I'm taking core computer science classes at my school, and I have a software engineering internship at Google for next summer. I expect I'll have software engineering internships in the upcoming summers (and perhaps a quant internship, just to get a feel for that industry).

I've heard that non-CS majors can struggle to get software engineering jobs after graduation, and it's sometimes suggested to pursue a Masters in order to convince potential employers that I can in fact write code. Of course, obtaining a Masters requires a couple years I'd rather spend in industry, and also can cost quite a bit.

I know it's early to start worrying about this, but do you think it'll be worth pursuing a Masters in my case? Should I instead just double major/switch my undergrad major to CS? Or is it likely that I'll be fine with just physics degree, given that I'll have internship experience? Thanks in advance."

3ukd0a,1444,2015-11-28,No 'mam nobody here enjoys helping you with tech for free,H34DSH07,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3ukd0a/no_mam_nobody_here_enjoys_helping_you_with_tech/,"### A little background first:

I am a manager at a Security company, we basically install security cameras in households or small businesses and, if they so desire (and are willing to pay), keep a remote database of their video footage for them. All our software is home made and we need technicians to maintain the code, networks, hardware, etc.

Two months ago we hired an *$intern* at the company, he had a lot of trouble finding his way around the code and maintaining it so we tried him out in customer service instead. Thing is when you are in customer service you become, for a lack of a better term, the face of the company you work at (Other than your relatives, no one knows you work at *X company* if you do only background work).

### The first contact:

One day, *$intern* meets his *$uncle* on the phone while he was shopping for a security system. *$uncle* decides it would be a great idea to tell *$intern*'s *$aunt* about the fact that her nephew (*$intern*) is working at a ""Tech Support"" company (which we are not).

The next day, *$aunt* shows up at our front desk. Thing is, internship at the company isn't a small deal for us, since we're a small business, interns don't do exclusively a single job. We try to make them do a bit of everything until they find what they're good at and/or enjoy doing and take a full time job. *$intern* was mostly busy learning how to maintain the software at the time, he wasn't doing customer support all day.

A = *$aunt*

M = *$me*


&gt; A: Hi I'd like to see my nephew, I believe he can help me fix my tablet.

&gt; M: $intern is busy working, he's not doing customer service at the moment.

&gt; A: Well I'd like to see him anyways he's certainly not chained in the basement is he?

&gt; M: I'll go get your nephew, just for this time, but please be quick, he's very busy at the moment.

*$aunt* proceeds to explain the multiple problems she has with her tablet to *$intern* while I go back to work.

### Feed a man a fish ... :

*$aunt* came back 2 or 3 days later, but now for a computer problem. I have no idea why but because we ""were good with computers"", she thought she was entitled to free Tech support. Since her nephew wasn't there I think one of *$intern* decided to step in and help her out of misery. Big mistake. This reinforced her beliefs that we would always help her out, nephew or not. I wasn't too concerned at the time, I thought this was most likely be a one time thing. She comes, we help her, we never see her again. Except it wasn't the case, she came back maybe one or two weeks later with a problem with her printer if I recall correctly. Since it was around the last days of *$intern*'s internship (A bit redundant eh?) he decided to help her out one last time out of generosity. Honorable thing, but huge mistake here again. He plugs the printer, finds the issue in minutes, says goodbye and goes back to his job.

A few days time later, the internship ends and since *$intern* is still in Trade School, he's not going to be taking a full time job any time soon.

### Isn't it my personal tech support? :

A few weeks later, *$aunt* comes back for more Tech Support. While I try to politely decline, (since, you know, her nephew doesn't work here anymore), she asks to see *$GoodGuy*, the employee that helped her with her computer problems when *$intern* wasn't there. While I agree this might be my fault for agreeing to this (but believe me I didn't think this would become what it became), I tried to convince *$GoodGuy* that he shouldn't feed the troll and let her be, he insisted to help her.

I try not to worry too much and let it pass once again. 

*$aunt* comes back the next day to complain about *$GoodGuy*'s help:

A = *$aunt*

G = *$GoodGuy*

&gt; A: *$GoodGuy* helped me with my tablet yesterday, he didn't fix the problem, it's still happening, it wouldn't have happened if my nephew fixed it.

&gt; G: I'll try to find the issue and fix it, but I can't guarantee anything.

&gt; A: You see, this is the thing, you don't *want* to help me, you just want to get rid of me.

&gt; G: Not at all, I willingly left my break to come and help you.

&gt; A: No you did not, you left your boring-ass job that's what you did.

You could see *$GoodGuy* was really starting to get pissed, but didn't do anything, because you know, he's a *$GoodGuy*. After a few minutes, finds the issue, fixes it, gives back the tablet to *$aunt* and she goes away angrily.

Later that day *$aunt* comes back with her husband, *$uncle* (our *actual* customer):

A = *$aunt*

U = *$uncle*

M = *$me*


&gt; U: My wife told me you didn't treat her accordingly

&gt; M: Sir, have my most sincere apologies, but we can only supply Tech support for things related to our product, anything else isn't in our contract nor valuable of our time to deal with.

&gt; A: You see this is the problem right here, *$intern* actually enjoys his job enough to take the time and help me, while your employees, just do it to get rid of me.

&gt; M: That's exactly it ma'am, no one here enjoys helping someone they don't know and waste the company's time absolutely for free.

&gt; A: But my nephew enjoyed helping me, why isn't he here?

&gt; M: Your nephew doesn't work here anymore ma'am, he ..

&gt; A: WHY DID YOU FIRE HIM?!?

&gt; M: We did no..

&gt; A: WHY DID YOU FIRE MY NEPHEW?? HE IS A HARD WORKER, HE IS THE BEST IN THE DOMAIN AND HE IS WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING TO FIX MY PROBLEMS, WHICH YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT COMPETENT AT. YOU JUST FIRED WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN YOUR BEST EMPLOYEE.

&gt; U: *Following his wife's tantrum* IF YOU FIRE MY NEPHEW, YOU LOSE ME AS A CUSTOMER, NO NEPHEW, NO BUSINESS.

&gt; A: IF YOU DO NOT CALL HIM IMMEDIATELY TO HIRE HIM BACK, YOU'LL LOSE US AS CUSTOMERS.

&gt; M: ma'am this is not possible to hire him back..

&gt; U: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD, YOU JUST LOST SOME VERY LOYAL CUSTOMERS.

They both left and never came back. I never got the chance to explain why their nephew wasn't fired, but actually *hired*, since he signed a contract with us that we would grant him a job as soon as he finishes studying as long as he maintains a good average with his grades. Oh well, can't say I'm too sad about ""losing"" them both.

My GPA is far below 3.0. I don't have any huge projects, except one small game (although I have my senior project coming up).

I spent a summer studying CS abroad, but honestly didn't learn much about programming.

Last summer I landed my only internship, which can last until I graduate. Its a great position on a resume -- its with the city of LA... However, I'm not doing any programming at all. Its mostly IT work and easy website work in an outdated language. I really want to quit, and I might do so before next semester starts.

I've made it to the 2nd round of Amazon's test but failed miserably. Then I failed a Western Digital online coding test. My confidence is really shattered and I'm getting a harsh realization that I'll be ending up at a job I hate. My programming skills and algorithms/data structure knowledge is really unrefined right now, since its been a good a year or two since I learned them.

3ukx2p,11,2015-11-28,Need to talk to you guys. Feeling in over my head.,floundering_3rd_year,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3ukx2p/need_to_talk_to_you_guys_feeling_in_over_my_head/,"## Introduction

Long time reader, first time writer, etc etc. I know this will be an awful wall of text when I’m done. I don’t think I expect anyone to read it in its entirety. I just hope a person or two will read and maybe help me find some perspective. I’m starting to feel pretty desperate. Background since this is posted on a throwaway - I’m a 3rd year Ph.D. student in a relatively highly ranked biomedical engineering program. There’s enough identifiable information in here that someone could probably recognize me, but few enough people know all these details that I think I’m probably in the clear. If you recognize me please be cool and don't be all like ""hey $NAME, is that you?"".

## Work

I had a bad relationship with my lab from the start. Most (now all, actually) of the other students are international, which made making friends challenging. I wish I could blame this completely, but I’ve never been good at being social, and can’t really use this as an excuse. This is exacerbated by the absentee management style of my advisor. Check-ins are nominally twice a semester, but in reality average less than half of that. I have virtually no communication with, and have absolutely no relationship with, my advisor. This has left me feeling very directionless in my research. Again, I wish I could blame this completely, but the “self-guided” aspects of a Ph.D. program are not things that I am comfortable with, and I haven’t given it the effort I should.

After a productive first year, picking up other people’s projects and finishing them to get small publications, I hit a wall. That summer I had a really great internship experience at a local hospital system that changed the direction I wanted to take my research. Instead it just kind of, stalled. I just got the IRB protocol submitted for a small grant that I wrote in this area, so there’s some hope of finally moving forward with projects on this track. But it’s halfway into the third year and this feels awfully far behind. I could have submitted this four months ago but didn’t, I still don’t know why. There was no reason, it was two hours of work. I just didn’t.

In the meantime, I’m supposed to have been working on finishing up another project form a previous lab member. It’s a rejected manuscript that would have been marginally novel in 2009, and now seems almost unsalvageable. I say “supposed to have been working on” because I haven’t been, really. No one cares if I show up to work or not. With my personality and godawful work ethic, that means I often don’t. I arranged to “merge” this project with another floundering project in the lab, and that changed the timeline. But this really just covers up the fact that I haven’t accomplished anything. I hate myself for not going in more and doing more, but I don’t.

Now the semester is coming to an end and it feels like everything is coming to a head. That biannual status update meeting with my advisor is impending, who knows what I’ll be showing her. Maybe I can put together enough preliminary, first-blush progress to placate her. Even if I don’t it doesn’t matter, she’ll be mad for twenty minutes then out of the country again. Coursework piled up, I decided to knock out all my remaining classes this semester in case I tried to masters out at some point. Two big projects to do and both with group members not responding, that’s always good for some extra stress.

## Personal

This semester has been especially hard personally. I have been commuting from home. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer six months ago, and I moved home with the thought that I could help out. And I hope I have. But if I’m completely honest this isn’t the whole reason. The real reason is that my old lease ran out and I didn’t look for a new place to live. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Still don’t know what I’m going to do next. My mom’s surgery is this week so hopefully things will be easier and I can look at getting back on my feet soon, but again, this wasn’t what was stopping me in the first place. Another excuse that doesn’t hold up.

I have trouble getting to sleep, sleep longer into the day, and am less rested than I used to be. Lots of reasons. 20% working on stuff at the last minute, 40% work-related stress, 40% sitting in the dark paralyzed by non-specific existential terror, thinking about death and mortality and how much time I’m wasting. During that internship I mentioned and the year after, I had been on a diet to lose some weight (I’m a short, 3-4XL kind of guy). I made ~65 lbs of progress, but that’s slipped backwards by about 15 lbs. It’s hard for me to keep anything regular when I’m in school. At one point this semester I drove 45 minutes to school, sat in my car intermittently crying for half an hour, then drove 45 minutes home, ate a whole frozen pizza, and called it a day. I think there’s a term for this, haha.

I don’t know what I should do. At the beginning of this semester I spoke to the graduate coordinator / counselor type person in my department about the possibility of changing to masters track. I never followed up on that. A lot of reasons. Haven’t failed at much of anything yet, don’t want to start. Also, my family strongly opposed it. My dad regrets not getting his PhD, though it seems to have worked out fine for him (degree inflation is the truth though). I want to go into industry, I would never want to stay in academia. People get jobs in my field with an MS. Part of me wishes they would notice and make the decision for me. I don’t do any work. I am not making progress. I haven’t learned anything on the job in 12 months.

## Conclusion

I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what to think. So that brings me back to my title - have any of you found yourself feeling so far in over your head? How did you deal with it? Where are you now?

**tl;dr**: don’t feel bad for not reading, I know it was a lot. needed to talk to someone/something"
3ulifk,3,2015-11-28,What does your Github look like and what is your background?,lavabender,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ulifk/what_does_your_github_look_like_and_what_is_your/,"I'm a freshman in CS right now, and since I have very little working experience, will be relying somewhat heavily upon my sparse personal projects and out-of-class experience to try and get internships this summer. As such, my Github account (https://github.com/d-soni) is going to be pretty important (I'm assuming), so I was interested in seeing others' accounts. What do your Github accounts look like, what is your current background, and what would you expect in a Github (or generally, in terms of personal projects) for someone like me, looking for a first internship? Is there anything I can do to improve my chances or make my Github more appealing?

BTW, I'll be doing a nontrivial project (compared to my prior projects) over Winter break that should be a decent amount better than the prior ones, so expect perhaps 1-2 more legitimate web-app/data-science related things by the time I start applying."
3ulkc4,100,2015-11-28,More businesses resorting to illegal unpaid internships,Seawoof,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ulkc4/more_businesses_resorting_to_illegal_unpaid/,"So I realized recently that many unpaid internships are actually *illegal* thanks to /u/srd_kirill in his post: 
--------------------
https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/3uerwi/how_to_get_marketing_experience_before_you/
---------------------

He cites an article and states:

&gt;Unpaid Internship - these can give you college credit when you do them, but the reason a lot of companies do not take ""unpaid interns"" is because unpaid interns are not actually allowed to do any real work for the company which hires them. 
http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm

To be concise, these are the requirements for an unpaid internship to be legal...

**The following six criteria must be applied when making this determination:**
*1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;

2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;

3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;

4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and

6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.*


Many companies offering unpaid internships though don't seem to realize this. One in specific in my area (there is a plethora that offer unpaid, while practically none offer paid)

Here is an example of one listing for an unpaid internship: 

&gt; Responsibilities
• Creating varying pitches and unique approaches to connect with various types of outlets 
• Develop, manage, and execute PR strategies 
• Work with databases to compile media lists 
• Update press database and forge new relationships 
• Assist with event planning / execution


As we can *clearly* see here, this violates several rules of the DOL link mentioned above.  

1. ""The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;""

As we can clearly see here, the employer gains a lot here. They appear to be stating that they are *not* looking for someone to learn, they are looking for someone to do their work for them so they can gain. 

2. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;

They used assist on *one* of their responsibilities. However, the other ones seem to be completely independent, as if the intern will literally be doing things a regular employee will do, just without the pay. Furthermore, on their posting, they had this to say: 

&gt; Selected interns will be responsible for providing (company name redacted) with the needed in office hours based on their respective schools and departments requirements. (company name redacted) is committed to providing adequate and enriching **work** during the hours in which the student is interning.

See, here is the biggest incrimination on their part. They state that interns are RESPONSIBLE for providing the company with the required hours, and they even refer to it as providing the company with enriching WORK. Basically, they are giving you a job, you are acting as a full fledged employee, and you are furthermore expected to WORK. That being said, they have violated all three of these rules: 

- The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;
- The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;
- The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

It's immediately clear it's not for the benefit of the intern. It's for the benefit of the company. They want some free workers, and then they crack a devious smile and add in, ""but you'll also be getting 'valuable' experience ;)""


But lets see a second example with a different internship posting, shall we?


&gt; Responsibilities
- Assist in the creation of mock ups, e-mail campaigns, on line promotion, etc. 
- Assist in the distribution or delivery of marketing materials 
- Assist in finding new clientele 
- Assist with the preparation and delivery of Invoices 
- Enter contact information into contact management systems 
- Assist growing our social media accounts 
- Maintain tracking report of public relations activity 
- Write press releases and distribute to local and national media 
- Assist and make follow up calls to media representatives 
- Assist and make follow up calls to real estate agents &amp; builders 
- Brainstorm with design team 
- Assist with design blog and online boutique

In this posting, assist is heavily used. It makes it instantly seem like you will be learning and shadowing another employee, not outright replacing one slot for an employee that is available. Additionally, while unpaid, the posting does indicate as well:

&gt; In addition, we respect our interns and the work they produce for us, and will pay them with 3% commission. 

This is actually granting the intern with some bonus pay (despite the posting being called unpaid) for their efforts. This *actually* helps verify one of the rules listed above.

- The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

It is shedding a 3% commission. In my eyes, this impedes the operations, as they are losing some money in the process to teach an intern. 


These are simply things to be aware of, especially useful to those of you who are college students (like me) and almost get conned into doing a job for free. Although it is ruefully sad that there are those who wish to exploit college students that are horrifically in debt, or hemorrhaging their future earnings to get ahead in life, it does still happen. The bottom line: if they expect you to *work* and not get paid, and it **benefits them directly**, it is possibly illegal. If you have experienced this, you may be able to get those funds back by filing a lawsuit. There are firms that literally make a business out of doing this.  "

I'm really eager to get some real world experience either through an internship or entry level position. The problem is I live near a small town that has very few IT related jobs and even fewer programming jobs. To add to this, I currently can't move because my fiance is going to college here. I'm stuck for the next two years. 

I know there are remote software development jobs, but they seem to rarely want an entry level employee. Any suggestions on how I can get some real experience and start my career?"

So I'll be specific here.

Things that I sort of know:
-Beginner Python, C/C++, SQL, R, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-Testing concepts, OOP concepts, UML
-Data types and structures (Various ADTs including AVL trees, Hashing, Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithm)

Things that I don't know
-Compiler 
-Computer architecture
-OS concepts (deadlock, synchronisation)
-Concurrent and parallel programming
-Theories (DFAs, ...)

I don't really understand how a math major can be competitive in the job market since I am missing so many important concepts. On the other hand, most of the interview questions appear to be problem solving or data structure related.

I could look into data analyst positions, but stat majors seem to be better fit for them. I only took two intro courses and have no intention to take more.

I'm working on a personal project but it doesn't go deeper than using some design patterns. I'm mostly interested in ""Applied CS"" fields, such as bioinformatics or NLP, which also I suppose don't require much of CS knowledge other than algorithms. But they seem to be esoteric, not a handful of jobs out there for people with a bachelor's degree. I don't like games or systems.

It's extremely difficult to get an internship in Canada as a student not enrolled in a co-op programme. Companies usually require a student to be a co-op student so that they can get tax cuts or something. I've been explicitly told by recruiters and website postings.

So what should I do from now on to get a decent job? It would be nice to get a job as a DBA or QA (not THAT much coding involved but a lot of logic I guess) or data analyst. I'm thinking of writing actuarial exams or CFA or MBA ONCE I get a job (yeah, I'm not much of a social person) "

My plan has always been to become a college professor, and in order to properly do that I'll need my PhD. I thought I would have my exact field of interest pinned down by now, but I'm not feeling 100% sure about my decisions.

Since coming to my school on a full ride, I've actually under performed compared to many of my friends. GPA of 3.573, okay GRE scores. I've also had to bounce around between a few different research labs because after putting in a few months of work in with a professor, he moved to a school in another state. I had been hoping to get out a publication with them before I applied, but I had to start over with a new lab, and my work there isn't the type that will get published. 

With a fairly mediocre academic record and unsure dreams, I've had trouble finding the energy to really search for PhD programs. I have a few flagged, and my parents (who aren't wealthy by any stretch) have offered to pay for all of them. I'm not sure they fully realize how much they will cost.

I've looked into a few gap year programs, but I'm having trouble finding anything that lets me build upon any kind of skillset I have with only a one year (*maybe* two year) commitment, and that I would be reasonably competitive for. I applied for a lot of REUs and internships over the past three summers, but came up dry almost every time. The work that I did have last summer I only found through a friend, and I was essentially the only candidate they had. 

I would consider maybe just getting a job for a year or two, but the program at my school is fairly recent, and almost nobody in my major was able to get an internship in past years in the area. As such, the temporary employment thing seems like kind of a long shot, at least if I wanted to actually apply any of my four years of college.

Should I let my parents spend probably upwards of $700 on my applications for PhD programs on the hope I'll be more interested maybe after being accepted? Should I go all out on the gap year thing? Are there any particular programs or opportunities that people would recommend? Any resources to make looking into graduate schools easier?"
3uoj0f,3,2015-11-29,Need some advice for an aspiring programmer,ChOOsetheBLUEs,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3uoj0f/need_some_advice_for_an_aspiring_programmer/,"I've recently stumbled onto this subreddit and decided to tackle on a very old childhood dream of mine. Seeking out all sorts of advice, criticism, and personal experience.

**TL;DR: Going to possibly have 4-10 months of free time and have a few options, considering learning programming as one of the main options. Possibly want to develop a self-guided curriculum program to keep me on track. Researched about 10-12 hours on various sources but still am lost. Most have led me to start out with Python and build from there + codecademy.**

I hope this isn't too long but here's some info about me:

Ever since I got my first computer at the age of 9, I knew I wanted to pursue a career involving computers. I chose a high school that provided various computer-related courses, I took an intro to computer science(I think..?) and a robotics class. The robotics class I really enjoyed whereas the intro to comp sci class not so much probably due to how poorly my teacher taught the course. 

Around the end of high school I started to have doubts about my own abilities and various personal issues which resulted in a shift of interest. It also didn't help that my math marks were abysmal but by then I stopped worrying about my math mark seeing as I didn't plan on doing computer science in university. 

After my first year of university, I was beginning to think that I should've given computer science a second try. There were a lot of 'what-ifs' and by the end of my second year I finally cracked and took a few math courses so that I can meet the pre-requisites for my school's computer science program so that I can add it as a second major. In addition, I threw in a discrete mathematics class  since it was a pre-requisite course for first year comp-sci majors. Needless to say, I failed, really badly. Both my math courses and my discrete mathematics. After that, I told myself that math isn't probably for me and that I should finally kill this so-called dream of mine. Discrete mathematics was such a depressing course for me, I've never felt so clueless in my entire life until I took this course. Attending every lecture, seeing my professor after hours, doing additional learning online, practicing the questions, this course never clicked with me. I thought of this as a sign and merely brushed it off because I took these courses trying to form a plan B and because of that failure I went back to my original plan of finishing my 4 year degree.

I realize that having some sort of math skills is certainly helpful for programming as it does teach you how to comprehend/analyse things in a certain manner.

I'm currently in my final/second-last year of university and am ready to check my mind out. I'm also doing an internship which is not that bad at all but it isn't something I can say I'm overly excited about. I've just about had it with school as a whole. Maybe I'm getting burned out but my mind cannot handle anymore schooling at this moment, not for another 10 months.

I'm considering putting my degree on hold and make an attempt at self-teaching myself some new skills, one of which is programming.

Now, I haven't fully immersed myself into learning code just yet, just about 3 hours into the Python courses offered on codecademy and 10-12ish hours of researching around. Saw a few posts regarding programming bootcamps and I loved the idea of it though it really isn't something feasible for me to do.

I've considered developing a personal bootcamp-ish schedule for me to learn but I'm not entirely sure where to begin with this idea. Its still something I'm thinking about. I've checked out a few books from my local library, found various video tutorials, online sources+ebooks (I personally prefer physical books), and as well looked into some of the free online programming/computer-science courses offered from various schools. Looked at /r/dailyprogrammer for some practice exercises that I may be able to do along the way. I also looked into a few curriculum/syllabus of bootcamps to give me a better idea of how to plan out my learning. It's just a matter of consolidating everything I've found in an appropriate manner.

This is by no means set in stone. I ended up treating this as a vent/journal post but I really had to seek some sort of guidance for this because it has constantly been on my mind for the last three weeks and on a few occasions in the last 4-5 years. I've been stressing more than I really need to whenever I find the time to read up on this after my classes/internship. However, I wouldn't describe the stress as a bad thing in fact its more of a feel-good type of stress.

Thank you for reading this!"

3urm1a,1,2015-11-29,"Should i continue my paid ""internship"" or try to freelance",Subalee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3urm1a/should_i_continue_my_paid_internship_or_try_to/,"Hi,

In the summer I started working at a marketing/webdev agency (currently finishing my 7th month there)

I went there with some experience with HTML and CSS, some simple jquery and zero experience with responsive webdesign, I got assigned to learn bootstrap, anyway in the first week of being there i finished responsive landing page, with a slider (owl carousel), Looking back it's a trivial task but what i mean by this that i think i was fairly productive for the company given that at the time i was unpaid intern, which i was fine at the time as i went there to get experience and after finish this up, I felt motivated and looking forward to any new project. For some time there were no new projects and the few that came up usually went to senior fronted developer. So I was left with editing older websites (all of the websites are using Wordpress, which i had some experience with, but only as a user, It took me so long till i was able to find some of the codes, but overall it was a good experience and now I know  wordpress structure pretty well and can create my own theme as long as it doesn't have some heavy PHP custom feature :) Again this is nothing hard, but still it was progress for me.

After that there was a client who wanted an online store and our boss decided to go with wordpress + woocommerce + unnamed premium woocommerce theme. And this is where all the good time stopped, i was left with semi-working pagebuilder spending several hours how to make a section fullwidth etc. This was the first time that i considered quitting but I stayed, than there was some more maintenance for me and after that another site like this popped up, that's when i had enough and asked for salary.

As i don't know anyone in similar niche I had no idea how much should I ask, just for information: Senior has 5.5€/h i asked for 4.5€ (didn't know how much he had at the time and this price didn't seem that unreasonable at the time even though it's just html/css/js basics) I got 3€/h which was as low as i was willing to go as money still wasn't the primary reason I was there, atleast i was now getting paid for work that sucked and wasn't giving me anything in return.

As the time went me and the guy who is senior frontend started to have our differences, so currently i only speak to him if i absolutely have to, though we moved to bigger office so it's a little easier to breathe now.


**And now to the question itself**
I'm currently studying applied IT, want to get better at programming, though i already know i'm not gonna be programming prodigy, I would love to learn a bit from design, maybe breeze through khanacademy math course (in order to be able to create more elegant solutions in programming) and spend more time learning interesting stuff.

The agency gig, which isn't that good paying is taking a lot of my time, which resulted me in getting out of shape even more than i used to be, fights with gf became more regular, though it's also because i got some clients of my own (not that i was looking for them) that pay more than the agency gig, however I'm not getting that much experience, aside from softskills. At the moment the only reason I'm still at the agency is i want to put experience on my resume (7 months just doesn't seem that much, sometimes i learn something new, and some of the people are really great)

Should i stay there or not?

**Goal**: I want to get better as a developer, perhaps get some grasps on design and after i finish uni, the best case scenario is opening up my own shop, As i said i don't think i will ever shine as a developer, so i would probably transition to more of a managing position with a tech. background (unless i really up my game as a developer)

Just turned 21 this November.

**TL;DR** Should i continue working at agency, should i freelance, should i give most to the university and education? I want to open up my own shop (software/websites/marketing) after I'm done with uni (if everything goes as planned, that would be in 5 years).

Thanks for advice, sorry for the looooooong text.

anywho I graduated, worked at a small mobile games company for 6 months doing Unity/C#, and now I'm at a similar place but smaller (10-20 people) and I'm being paid very little, 30k, I started as an intern there and now I'm moreso a developer and have been there for 8 months, using Unity/C# as well, I don't think my boss wants to give me a raise.

Like I am doing cool game development type stuff and learning a ton but my commute is over an hour each way and I keep having people telling me ""oh oh, but the experience is worth it"", and some are like ""get the hell out of there"".

I guess my hesitation stems from the fact that I'm not 100% sure I want to continue with game dev, I really enjoy programming but I don't think doing it paired with game dev is a requirement for me. I mainly just want to continue doing C#.

I have a few professional game dev projects now, I should keep those on my resume or just build some more general so I don't get turned away from non gamedev jobs?

I feel as though I'm proficient with C#, are there any other specific things I should start learning to make myself more marketable?

I feel like getting a 2 year degree wasn't a mistake, i learned a fuck-ton, but I can also see where a 4year would've helped.

I've learned a decent amount of java in two quarters, the last thing being different data structures, stacks, queues, arraylists, sets/maps, and BST. 

The problem is that I'm going to transfer to another college next fall so I don't know if I'll have time for the internship.

3ut06w,6,2015-11-29,How do I deal with my adviser's shitty codes and other such rantings,ChaosCon,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3ut06w/how_do_i_deal_with_my_advisers_shitty_codes_and/,"Hey guys - 

I'm partly looking for advice, but mostly just some solidarity. Lately I've become extremely disheartened with one of my advisers. From my perspective, at least, it appears as though everything he does is for the advancement of his own career without any regard for his students. In no particular order

1. Code quality is *awful*. We're an algorithm development group (so we're not just writing one-off programs to process data), but the twenty-odd years of accumulated crufty code is *unintelligible* without a guide (my adviser). Things like meaningless variable names (`x = xx`), convoluted data structures in the name of ""speed"" with zero profiling data, comments that *lie*, etc. When I've pointed out how difficult this makes things (alongside other faculty!), I was told ""You should see $PRIOR_STUDENT's code! *His* is a mess!"" and ""The fact that you graduate from this lab will get you a job much more easily than focusing on good code.""

2. When I started my program, an opportunity for an internship made itself available at a national lab. This adviser told me ""No, you shouldn't do an internship, just focus on graduating."" I've come to realize I wasn't ready for an internship at that point in my program, but recently this adviser suggested I do an internship at a company where he has connections. When I voiced concerns about losing momentum on my project, instead of reassuring me about my skills and progress, he simply said I should ""talk"" to them anyway. I left with the distinct feeling that the internship was less about getting me experience and more about my adviser demonstrating to this company that he's still turning out quality students.

3. Lack of communication, particularly with me. I don't think I've ever received a reply to a question I've asked by email. Whenever anybody else in the lab has a bug in their code, this adviser asks for a copy and actively debugs it. When *I* have issues, I'm told to ""don't worry about the code, just read this paper - that's all you need to understand it."" Of course, theoretical and practical implementations are extremely different things.

4. General philosophical differences. We have...different thoughts about what makes my project interesting. He's all about the method (make it more efficient, make it *faster*!), and I find what comes out of the method more compelling. I'd like to investigate both to do some cool science, he trivializes my interests and suggests I focus on his instead.

There's a lot more nuance that's hard to convey in text and I can only give my (very, very subjective) perspective on things, but I'm starting to find these things progressively more frustrating. I'm incredibly fortunate to have another co-adviser I work much more closely with (and enjoy working with, to boot!) but going to him with these issues feels a little bit like pitting mom &amp; dad against each other. I'm kind of at a loss for what to do - direct confrontation seems too aggressive (""You have tenure but your method sucks!""), but he seems unwilling to accept anyone else's perspective. How do you guys deal with difficult advisers?"

However, I'm really stuck and I don't know how to proceed. I was wondering if you guys can help me, here's my problem.

I'm a comp sci sophomore at a great school. However, I still find it hard to find internship. One of the reasons I believe is that I don't have experience working in the field. There are my three options and I honestly don't know what path to take:

1) Accept Northrop offer, average pay for the summer, I don't even know what i'm working on and the recruiters have been very vague about it. I hope I might be working on something cool like embedded software dev or I might be stuck with some debugging job. Anyhow, I can still claim ""working for northrop grumman"" and have ""experience"" on my resume for next year.

2) Continue looking for CS internship, though I think it's a bit late. I can revamp my website and my resume. I know there are a few opportunities in Spring and I can take a shot at it, but it might be a start up that's pale in comparison with the name Northrop? I have an opportunity to work on something more?

3) Continue researching for school's robotics lab over the summer, working my ass off and hope to get results. But there's still the fact that I won't have any real work experience to put on my resume. Though, I might enjoy the materials a heap more.

All in all, I'm really stuck. I can just accept the offer and focus on school/research in the spring. I honestly don't know and I hope some of you guys can help me. Lastly, if I were to go with Northrop, and if you have worked at Northrop, what was your experience like? What did you learn? and would you do it again? Also, what are some projects that you guys work on? I know this is a lot but thank you again in advance.

To put things in perspective, I have a 3.9 GPA... and this is how I feel. Obviously, somethings not right here.

I ""know"" a few languages, but by ""know"" I mean just get the syntax, if even that. Basically when I come to this sub, the other CS ones, or even SO, I cant understand what anyone is talking about.

I don't have much else going for me, so is this a good idea? Or should I just wrap it up and get out? Also, are learning these things going to help me land a job?

3uuwum,2,2015-11-30,I'm 19 and feel like I'm wasting my time in college. Should I drop out?,TawClaw,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3uuwum/im_19_and_feel_like_im_wasting_my_time_in_college/,"Hi there guys! I'm currently 19 and finishing up my first semester as a freshman in college (3 weeks to go!). I'm studying math, physics, and computer science, but I'm really leaning towards computer science as a career.

To give you some backstory and idea about why I'm in college in the first place, I just legitimately wanted to go to class and learn things. But, despite being at a well-respected LAC, I feel like that's just no happening in an efficient or genuine way.

I've never cared about getting a degree, I just want to learn the things in the fields I'm interested in so that I can work in those fields. I didn't come to college ""because that's what you do"", because my family wanted me to, or because I knew it would get me a good job. I came to learn.

So far college has just felt like a continuation of high school (which felt like honestly the biggest waste of time in my life). All of the material I have learned in all four of my classes so far I could have learned in one month if you gave me the textbooks and said, ""go learn this and make a project using your new knowledge."" 

It's not that things are too hard for me, quite the opposite actually. When I look at what I'm doing here, sitting in my dorm room waiting to head off to my first class, I wonder what the hell I'm doing with my life at all. Am I really going to spend eight months out of the next three and a half years of my life doing this? I feel like I'm missing out on things I could be doing, an opportunity cost of life.

Ideally I would love to shadow or be an apprentice to an engineer in a company that works on exciting and challenging problems. There's no doubt that if I did that for four years I would learn a LOT more than I would here. But that doesn't really happen (other than summer internships).

So alternatively I have thought that I could just drop out, and start doing projects of my own while taking one or two courses at my local community college. I really learn best by doing, and especially in computer science / software engineering what matters most is your actual ability to make things that work, not your GPA or degree. I could be working on developing my own apps, helpful programs (I have a few ideas), or contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. If I spent all day doing that instead of sitting in school, I know I would learn at a faster rate, and  learn in a better way.

Do I sound crazy so far? I kind of feel bad that it feels like I'm wasting my time here at college, because I also feel as if I'm wasting my parents' money. They are paying my full tuition and living expenses, so if I did graduate I would have no student debt. I just feel like if I could get them to understand why I'm choosing this, they would also see that they could save like $25,000 in just one semester (private LAC tuition).

My dream is to work on startups as a technical co-founder or founder. And college doesn't seem to align with my career goals. 

**TL:DR** I want to work in CS as a software engineer most likely at startups, and feel like I'm wasting my time and not learning much in college. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to drop out and *learn by doing* on my own while taking 1 or 2 community college courses.

Does anybody have any thoughts at all about this? Thanks so much for reading this all, if you did. I just need some spitballing.

Work Details:

- ~20 hours a week at our office in Plano at the Shops at Legacy (more if your schedule allows, but that's what we're expecting). 
- Business hours (8am-6pm) M-F.  Sorry, nights and weekends don't work since you need to work with your mentor.

You'll be working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, Angular and/or knockout.  Not necessarily all at the same time, but we like people to grow into full stack developers.

Here's what we need from prospective interns:

- some sort of portfolio of work to prove you can do something.  School projects, github contributions/repos, stuff you've played with in your spare time, myspace pages when you were 12.  They all count.  We're not looking for seasoned developers, so don't be embarassed.  Cultural fit is much more important than your current skill level, but we need to know where you're at to assess your growth plan.
- you must be a US citizen or otherwise allowed to work in the US.  F1's etc, sorry but we can't work with you.

How can you apply?

- submit your resume/sample work to me by 12/6 at midnight.  My email is sgoodpasture@thirdcorner.com

We'll be conducting phone interviews this week and next and in person interviews next week.

3uvmzx,1,2015-11-30,Looking for a few highly regarded resources to help me prepare for my next interview.,unionmade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uvmzx/looking_for_a_few_highly_regarded_resources_to/,"I'm currently working as a SWE for a pretty major tech company on the west coast, it's not a big 4 but we're definitely influential in the tech world. I love my job, the work is challenging, the people are great, the pay could be better but it's more than enough.

Thing is, the job is on the west coast and I'd love to move back home to New York City, I know it may be difficult scheduling cross country interviews and trying to fly out for F2F meetings but I have time seeing as I'm not really in a rush to move.

I acquired this job as a post-grad intern, halfway through my internship I was offered a full time position, my intern interview was not very challenging to be honest, neither was my previous intern interview. I'd like to prepare myself to the best of my ability so that I don't blow my chances. I went to a no-name community college where our curriculum wasn't really the best so I'd like to really get in there with a high chance of succeeding. 

Anyway, I'm looking for types of ""resources"" to help me prepare for this, I assume outside of bullet #3 they would be books but I'm willing to work with any medium. The categories I'm looking for are as follows. 

1. Algorithms &amp; Data Structures

2. OOP and Good Software Design Principles

3. Coding Challenges
 * Something like Project Euler but more interview focused perhaps?

4. Modern Interview Prep Book
 * I've heard Cracking the Coding Interview touted everywhere but if anyone has other suggestions I'm all ears.

As previously mentioned I have a couple of hours per day for at least of couple of months to work on this, so if it's comprehensive I'd love to take a crack at it.

Thanks!"

3uw167,1,2015-11-30,New to programming and I have an interview.,Caitlinmitcheem,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uw167/new_to_programming_and_i_have_an_interview/,"Hi! I was hoping I could get some advice for my upcoming interview. You guys have been really helpful in the past.

So I'm a junior in college right now who just picked up programming this year and I have my first round of interviews for a technology analyst internship with Goldman Sachs' Salt Lake City Office later this week. Since I'm fairly new to programming, I've never interviewed for a position where I might be asked technical questions before so I'm terrified.
 
I already plan on reading through my old Java text book to prepare, but I was wondering if there's anything else I should do to prepare. Also if anyone has interviewed for Goldman Sachs before and has any advice on the whole process, that would be nice too.

Thanks so much!!

So I really need some advice on this. I am currently a junior, who goes to Berkeley, studying CS and fine art as a double major. I have a neighbor who works at Google, who really liked this compiler I made for my own programming language, a senior developer in one of their departments, who gave me referral for a software engineering internship next summer. So this morning, I got an email from a google recruiter, that was asking for my transcripts, despite me putting my Major GPA on my resume. 

My issue here is that, there are some questionable things on my transcript. My overall GPA is a 2.903, and my major GPA with art and  CS is a 3.12. However, when I began college, I was originally a molecular biology major, and didn't do well in those classes, many C's and low B grades. In addition, just after I switched over to CS and art, my father became terribly ill and passed away from a stroke, so I ended up failing my first CS class, but retook it and got an A-.

My question here is that, when sending the transcripts, should I offer an explanation of any circumstances about my questionable aspects of my transcripts? I am asking this because I fear seeing the transcripts without a reason behind them this early (I have had no interviews at all with Google) might screen me out, since the recruiter that emailed me didn't comment on my experience or side projects in my resume.

tl;dr: Got referral for google internship, got email asking for transcripts, not sure if to send explanation for transcript grades with email.

Any advice or tips?"

3ux4jc,10,2015-11-30,19 months post graduation. Still no job,sofloIT,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ux4jc/19_months_post_graduation_still_no_job/,"This post isn't intended to whine about how near impossible its been. I am more here looking for help from anyone in South FL. I would be happy to send my resume to anyone who might know someone looking for entry level IT Support.

I graduated from FIU with a B.S. in IT. I have experience with Unix/Linux(RHEL/CentOS), Cisco IOS/JunOS router config, Windows Server 2012, ADDS, MSSQL, Web Development(HTML/CSS/WordPress/Joomla), Software development(Java, C#, Python), Automation with PowerShell and an A+ certification. I have been working with computer hardware for over 10 years so it's become second nature to troubleshoot.

All of my experience is from school and self teaching. I did an unpaid internship with a startup for 4 months right after graduating, but everything I learned there I taught myself. A lot of people discredit my college degree but I have done much more difficult things in school than I will ever do in an entry level help desk position so I am pretty confident that I am more than capable. I have a friend from college who says it should be a crime I have still not found a job because I was the one piggybacking everyone in college. "
