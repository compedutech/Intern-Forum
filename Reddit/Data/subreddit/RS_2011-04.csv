The company wasn't very specific about what we should expect, except for a tour of the company and meeting with managers we've talked with over the phone.  Weird thing is, I never had a phone interview with them.  

I'm not sure how to dress, what to bring, or what to expect with this kind of thing.  Any advice for me?  This will be my 3rd chance for an internship this summer, and I'm hoping that the third time is a charm!

gh5ph,1,2011-04-02,Question about delta,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gh5ph/question_about_delta/,"I have an internship doing some programming and over heard my boss saying something about having to calculate a new delta. I don't really know what this means. We are using APIs to test some hardware functionality. I'm not going to be doing this but I would like to know what this means.

I don't know if this clear enough to get a detailed answer but any feedback would  be appreciated.

Edit:
Talked to my boss about it, delta was used as the change in time between when a signal was being sent and when a signal was being received. Although the calculation was different than just timeend - timestart. It didn't occur to me that delta could have been the change in time, i thought it would have been a more abstract item. I think im just overthinking things. Thanks for the help guys."
gierm,28,2011-04-04,I just need someone to listen to my story,glyoxial,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gierm/i_just_need_someone_to_listen_to_my_story/,"I don't even know if this is the right place to post this. I just need to get this out of my system. 

I dated this girl my last year in college for about 9 months. She was like the exact opposite of me - I was liberal, atheist, shy/antisocial; she was conservative, religious, in a sorority. Despite the differences, we were really happy together. Eventually with our graduations looming and mostly my stubbornness, we split up and I took it pretty hard. But I made a promise to myself to become a better person. I started working out, focusing on trying to improve my social/fashion skills, working on being more tolerant/openminded, etc. and to an extremely large extent, I feel I succeeded. One night, I was drunk and facebook messaged her kind of just saying hey and hoping that she was doing better. She ended up coming over and staying the night. Slowly we started talking again via text, pretty much every day. Her texts were always the highlight of my day. I'm working in KS as a chemist, and she's moved to Atlanta, GA for an internship. We start to talk about life goals and how we've changed, etc. and it slowly evolves into a 'hey, you know, we seemed to be much more in line with each other now, maybe there's a possibility this could work this time'. And the sentiment is mutual. I plan a trip to fly down and visit her this past weekend, with the intent of laying the formation for a slow, but potentially great recovery and loving relationship.

Friday night, I get in and we go out drinking. We're being really flirty and having a great time then she just disappears. So now I'm alone in a bar in a foreign land and super confused. After 45 minutes of looking for her, I find her in the backseat of her car with some random guy. She doesn't even know his name, and they're clothed, but I flip out. She says it's not what it looks like, etc etc. We go back to her place, have angry sex, and pass out. In the morning we talk about it; she says she was scared/nervous about me being there, and this is her way of pushing people away when they get close. She says she loves me and wants to be with me, but doesn't think she can offer me what I want/deserve from her. I play the role of the nice guy and say ""alright, well, let's do some sight seeing and rent a movie and take it easy tonight, my flight leaves in the morning."" She thinks that's a great idea and she gets in the shower. While she's showering, I'm laying there and I kind of freak out. I sit up, think to myself ""No, I'm sick of being a good guy and letting girls walk all over me"". So I start to pack my stuff up to head to the airport and leave early. She gets out and asks me what's wrong, and I respectfully let her have it. I tell her that what she did is not okay, and that I came down here with what I felt like was a mutual interest in pursuing a meaningful relationship only to have her pull some insane stunt that hurt me more than I can put into words. She cries and apologizes, and I give her every chance to stop me from leaving, but she doesn't. I walk to the door, without turning to look at her say ""I hope you get everything you want in life"" and walk out. After walking for 45 min trying to figure out where the hell I am to call a cab, I find a McDonalds and start looking up cab numbers on my phone. She calls me. She asks me to come back and talk to her and stay. I comply. We kind of lounge around at her apt for the rest of the day, rent a movie and snuggle and watch it, then go to bed (no sex). We wake up, she takes me to the airport and I leave. She texts me after I leave telling me that she loves me and she's sorry, she just doesn't think she can give me what I want right now, and that she wants to be with me and that she needs me to be a part of her life. I tell her that I wish I could understand that. I tell her that I need some time away from talking to her for a while to try and figure out what I need to do.

I don't know what to do. I feel like my entire motivation to keep waking up and going to work is gone now. I think there's a part of her that wants what I want - the ""well, I'm an adult now and I want to settle down and share my life with someone"" stage but I also think she isn't completely out of that ""I'm young and want to party and meet people and be crazy"" stage either. I don't want to let her go, but I don't want to wait around to be the consolation prize because I might be waiting for nothing. She has always had psychological issues, she's been suicidal/a self mutilator in the past, and I think she's dealing with some of that stuff right now, so I don't want to leave her to deal with that alone, but I can't let myself be dangled along. I guess I just don't know what to do and don't know how to keep on keeping on. I know this was long, but thanks for reading."
gi8gn,10,2011-04-04,IBM or NASA internship?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gi8gn/ibm_or_nasa_internship/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a tough situation and need help making a decision. I have the opportunity to choose between and internship at IBM and an internship at NASA this summer. I know I'm in an great situation and probably can't go wrong either way, but I would still like to make the best choice and not just wing it. I ultimately want to go to grad school for something in Computer Engineering or Computer Science, namely Robotics. The internship at IBM involves working with a database of microprocessor simulation results using SQL in IBM's Custom Microprocessor department, where they develop and test processors for major game consoles such as Xbox, PS3, and Wii. For NASA Ames Research Center, I would help analyze a database of power management data using MATLAB algorithms. The database information is coming from their Sustainability Base, a building developed by NASA that utilizes zero net energy, meaning it generates as much energy from renewable sources as it draws from he power grid:

http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/sustainability-base/index.html

I'd really love to hear from anyone that has worked at NASA ARC as an intern or IBM. It's a really tough choice for me because they both seem amazing and I'm glad to have a chance with either of them, let alone both of them at the same time. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks!

I'm in the process of trying to prepare for an technical internship interview in a few days. Most of what I know is self-taught, so Im unsure of how to prepare for it.

They ask for an understanding of Object-oriented development, and the software development process, and knowledge of Agile, Databases, and Silverlight. I've only touched on the first two topics slightly, so I was hoping to get some advice from Reddit on possible questions, or resources to study with.

Java is the language of choice, so I'll be trying some problems at codingbat for that~

gj6xg,2,2011-04-05,Building a Portfolio,Flamefury,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gj6xg/building_a_portfolio/,"I'm a university fledgling, in the middle of my second year. I'm not exactly intelligent, so university is a serious struggle and it's difficult to find time to build up a decent portfolio so I'll have something to present to employers when I'm out of there.

Also, the software engineering program I'm in forces us to find internships every once in a while and I'm starting to feel the heat of competition. Employers are going to give me a lot less leeway in terms of how lacking in knowledge I am as I progress through uni.

I want to be a game developer. Though, right now my internship has me managing some CRM apps, which I don't particularly mind either. 
Any developing's good, really, wouldn't mind freelancing and doing whatever oddball job I can find. Gaming's where I'd favour, but isn't really required.

Truth be told, I can honestly say my only real experience in programming languages is (sigh) Visual FoxPro because that's what I've been doing the last three months for my internship. I scraped basic SQL from a QA job I had before, but nothing too advanced. I'm attempting to manage a blog, but my HTML, CSS and PHP skills could use some work so I'm really just stealing off a default skin. University / high school led me through C, C++, Java and Scheme (hah), but for whatever reason, I don't feel like you can understand the ins and outs for each language by only doing incredibly tricky one-shot assignments as opposed to a program to be released for public use.

Enough backstory, into the actual questions.

1. What matters more, the number of projects or the size? In other words, would it be better to do a bunch of small little applications (like a bunch of mini-games) or chart out one big project (like a console-ish game)?

2. For those of you that schedule out your hobby projects, what do you do to help you stick to schedule? (University hogs so much time some days...)

3. Does it matter how many languages you know and what each project is based on? Or would I better my time using what I know instead of picking up new languages and their interesting IDEs?"

gitf9,98,2011-04-04,There's something in Hawaii.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gitf9/theres_something_in_hawaii/,"I know it's cheesy to say ""this story is 100% true"", but in this case it is. I'm a regular redditor and you can look at my comment history if you doubt me. 

Last year I did an internship in Hawaii in agroforestry. I lived on a farm on a lava flow on the Big Island; it was a small place, so it was only the farmer, his dog, and myself living there at the time. This part of Hawaii is mostly uninhabitable due to the lava rock, but the farmer had managed to keep a decent forest of fruit trees going with innovative techniques. He was a bit of a nut, living out there all alone, and was really big on sustainability. The place was powered by solar panels, which worked about 60% of the five months I spent there.

One night, I was walking from the main part of the farm back to my yurt, along the main path. It was a moonless night, and I didn't bother bringing my flashlight as I'm really not afraid of the dark. I was able to navigate by looking up to see the trees to either side of me obscure the stars in the sky. Also, the lighthouse to the south would flash a faint bit of light about every 15 seconds, and I could use it to reorient myself when if I got turned around. The total distance was no more than 1/2 a mile, and it usually took me about 15 minutes to walk.

Now, the place I was living has some history. [See here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapoho,_Hawai'i) The lava flow made a ring around a 10-acre patch of rainforest, which they called a ""kipuka"". The idea is that Pele, the goddess of fire, spared this patch of forest because it is spiritually sacred. I worked within the forest for several hours every day, and my yurt sat right on its perimeter.

After about 10 minutes, I reached the point where the little path to my place cut off from the main trail. To help me find the path in the dark, I had tied a piece of white cloth onto a tree branch (I had missed it way too many times) so I knew where to turn. The cloth barely registered in my vision on this night, but it was better than nothing.

The secondary path to my yurt was really narrow and overgrown, so I couldn't use the stars to navigate the rest of the way, but rather had to rely on memory and my outstretched arms as a last resort. It was kind of relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. I liked to pretend that I was an original Polynesian settler- before the introduction of electricity and flashlights.

I had just turned onto my path when I heard something crashing through the trees and brush, about 15 feet ahead and to the left. My first thought was pigs, which often came at night to tear up roots and plants, so I froze in place, listening. Before I knew what was happening, the thing came bolting down the path towards me at full speed. It was then I realized that whatever this thing was, it was clearly bipedal. I was paralyzed by fear and bewilderment, and it was still coming. To my amazement, it *sped up* as it passed by me, brushing my upper arm (I'm 6' 2""), and crashed back into the brush behind me and to the right. I was only able to make out a simple form, but it was definitely not any animal found in the entire islands of Hawaii.

As soon as it went crashing into the forest, my paralysis broke, and I broke into a full sprint back the entire 1/2 mile to the main farm. I started yelling the farmer's name, freaking out the dog, and he came running. (Nothing like this had ever happened before.) Between breaths, I told him what happened, and his eyes widened with every detail. Without saying a word, he fished out his .22, got the dog on the leash, and went searching for the intruder. I grabbed my flashlight and followed. The moment we reached the spot of the encounter, the dog flipped out, barking, and tore off into the forest in the same direction the thing went, following a scent trail. After a tense 20 minutes, she finally came back, no sign of anything.

We never figured out what it was. I used my flashlight every night after that."

Pleasure to meet you all and here we go. 

I've been out of college for about a year and a half and I'm having no luck with the real world. I have applied for many jobs but I haven't even been able to get an interview. 

The core of my issues revolve around my lack experience. I graduated with a good GPA and even completed my undergrad in 3.5 years. Unfortunately, I didn't plan too well for post college life.  
 I took up as a temporary job when I graduated, but  I've been there for so long that I'm now managing the place. While the pay is good enough to support me, the job ultimately drives me crazy. 

I've volunteered at a non-profit historical site to gain some relevant history focused professional experience. Yet, after 4 months at the internship, I realized that any future in this job would require grad school and the market for related jobs were slim to none. 

At this juncture, I tink I have to re-evaluate my career choices, yet I am lacking in experience or direction!

I've been considering teaching abroad just for a change of pace.

If there are any post grad history or liberal arts majors who have shared a smilar experience please tell me about it! I want to move my life forward and I need some sort of outlet!

Thank you Reddit

My boss really liked me and kept me on over this past school year (I graduate with a degree in Mech Eng in a few weeks). Over that time there was an employee, lets say Tom, who I got along with really well, and liked a a lot. But my boss was always on him about various job performance issues. Some might have been legit, but some seemed ticky tacky, and it almost seemed like my boss was trying to drive him out. Anyways, things finally came to a head, and Tom ended up leaving the company, and filing for unemployment. My boss apparently has decided to fight. This morning I was copied on an email from Tom saying ""You WILL be contacted by OSHA and DOL on claims against the company."" and ""I'm positive after talking with OSHA today about my claim that [Company] will be shut down and [Other company in the same building owned by the landlord] will also be effected.""  Tom had indicated he liked me, and wouldn't do anything to screw me over, but then he goes and does this. 
  
Now I know there were some things we do/did that aren't ""OSHA standards"" but then who does follow all of OSHA's rules. I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything that we've done that would warrant any more than a slap on the wrist, and certainly not ""shut down.""

gpjbu,1,2011-04-13,"Reddit, I hate my lucrative college major. Should I 
suck it up or change it?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gpjbu/reddit_i_hate_my_lucrative_college_major_should_i/,"All right, let me break things down.

Current situation: Junior computer science major at Rice, aiming for a BSCS. So far, I have no student debt thanks to living off campus and being a minority in an engineering field.

However, I'm pretty sure this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I got into it because I was good at writing nifty little Java  programs in high school, I was *excellent* at Calculus, and, of course, the technology industry is booming right now and my parents wanted me to get into something with earning potential. 

But the farther into the curriculum I go, the more I realize that I hate analyzing systems, especially the guts of things like logic circuits or large-scale applications. I can't get interested in the work, and more and more often the assignments are just confusing me. I've failed enough classes that I'd definitely need a fifth year just to satisfy my degree requirements, which would likely mean I'd get financial aid cut off. My GPA is sitting below 2.0, I've made no connections in the department (or to anyone on campus, for that matter), and because of this, I couldn't get an internship if I tried.

So my question, Reddit, is, I've already registered for my Fall semester of senior year, and instead of excitement, all I feel is dread. I don't know what field I'd like to get into yet, but I know it isn't this, and chances are, it won't make as much money as a programming job. I don't want to let down my parents, and I definitely don't want to force them to pay for two or three extra years at such an expensive place. Should I suck it up and slog through the rest of my CS degree, or should I take the hit and try to head in a different direction?

For the last 4 years, I've done IT contracting all over the place. Small clients. Small businesses. Individuals. The works. Basically, a HS/College kid who did a lot of backups, re-imaging, virus cleans, some Linux troubleshooting for advanced users, small business network setups, configs, etc. This experience has gotten me officially employed in the last 2 months.

I have an MCITP:EDST7, EDA7 and am working on my EA bit by bit. I have an Associates degree in Network Administration.

My current title is Desktop Support II, at a large medical center.

I'm curious, what is the best amount of solid job experience I should aim for before moving on to greater things? In my job, I've already assumed lead in a Windows 7 deployment as well as some server swaps, I'm doing basic network troubleshooting and am getting well rounded with our heterogeneous environment.

I'm just lost as to what my next step is. In my short time I've gone from Helpdesk I to Helpdesk II to Desktop Support II and I've gone through a raise each time. My prior experience also has internships at my college doing network support, deployment, etc. I feel like I'm ready for a Junior Admin role, but I'm lost as to how to go about it.

In the building I work, the elevator doors are reflective. A month or so ago I got on the elevator and there was a cute intern in the back. As the doors close, I see a reflection of her looking me up and down.

""It's easier to ask for my name"" I said before I could stop myself. She turns bright red and stares at the floor the rest of the elevator ride. ""Too bad"" I say as I get off at my stop.

A week or so later I see her across the hall and she doesn't break eye contact with me, even though she's engaged in a conversation right next to her. I casually walk over, hand her my business card, smile, and keep going.

At this point, I feel like a BOSS, but acknowledge that from her perspective I'm either A-) Suave, or B-) Creepy as fuck. 

I see elevator girl yesterday and she smiles, waves, and yells ""hi {Verbicide}"". This is not the conclusion of the story....I will nail that intern. But for now, I think I'm clear of the ""creepy"" side.

What's your story/resolution?"
gqrwx,0,2011-04-15,Question about background check,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gqrwx/question_about_background_check/,"So I graduated from college with a not-so-great GPA (2.85) last June. I found an internship that became a full-time job at a small software company, but they had to let me go a few months ago. 

While I was with them, I interviewed for another position. I didn't write down my GPA on the resume. The position didn't work out, but this company called me again for a new position, and after a few interviews offered me the job. 

I never mentioned and they never brought up my GPA, but the thing is I can't remember if they asked me about it in the first interview way back when. If they did, I might have lied about it (stupid, I know).

So the person that hired me asked me to call HR. I did and she said when the orientation was, asked me to bring proof of eligibility and told me to take a Tuberculosis test as soon as possible (this is at a hospital). I kind of asked ""is there anything else, like a background check or drug test"" and she said ""Nope""., but I'm still worried about it.

So the question is:

1) Would the HR tell me if there was a background check, especially if they told me all the other stuff?
2) If they do a background check, would they check GPA, and would this be shown to anyone if there is no inconsistency with my resume (since it doesn't have my GPA on it)

1. He told me he was in AISEC, and i said oh really I am too, he retorted in a happy sounding way ""thats why I have your CV!"" 2.He discussed a lot of specifics with me, 

2. the length i was available. I told him I was only good for 3 months which he responded with ""Ideally I would want YOU (he didnt say SOMEONE) for 5 or 6 months but I can settle with 3"" 

3. He told me I would be paid, but HR was going to tell me about that because it was ""confidential and he doesnt even know""

If you go to U of I, I know you don't need to be sold on the amenities of this building, because they are notoriously good. 

* You'll join the mile-high club on the [nineteenth floor](http://i.imgur.com/VFqYZ.jpg), with a southward-facing view of all Champaign-Urbana

* You'll be in the deluxe apartment, which was just renovated last summer. This means a new [flat-screen TV](http://i.imgur.com/AR7Ql.jpg) mounted on your wall, for your viewing pleasure

gtkt9,14,2011-04-19,Internship dilemma...,tranzue,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gtkt9/internship_dilemma/,"First time poster here.  

Anyway, I was hoping the more experienced could help out.  I recently got offered an internship at a pretty small company, about 35 employees.  I accepted when they called, as I need an internship this summer.  I was also offered to have a second interview with a place much bigger, with probably better pay.

Here is where the dilemma comes in at.  If I get offered the job with the bigger company, should I accept and just call the smaller company to tell them I can't do it?

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses, it seems that most people say keep the smaller one since I've accepted, and the rest saying take the bigger company.  My interview for the position at the bigger company is coming up, I will still go to it, as I feel like canceling the interview may burn a bridge in itself.  But, if they do offer me the internship, I believe I am going to just stick with the smaller company.

Again, thanks for all the replies! It is a tough situation, and I've seen more than one person be in the same exact position.

guuom,1,2011-04-20,"Dear Reddit, we need your wise advice about post-college job hunting:",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/guuom/dear_reddit_we_need_your_wise_advice_about/,"Here's the dilemma.

My boyfriend is 4 months out of Engineering School (graduated Dec. 2010 with his Masters). He has been job hunting since mid-August/September of last year and has landed a handful of interviews. His primary interest is in working with a major defense contractor or government contracted position. He has had a formal interview with one major defense company, which we initially assumed would land him a job and were very surprised when he was not selected. Also (this will be somewhat relevant for my later questions), he is around $7k in debt with school loans presently.

Here's a little of his background before I continue:

He went to a public state University (city university, technically) that used to be one of the more well recognized engineering schools in the country but now ranks significantly lower on the list. He majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering and has specific interest in RF work. He maintained a 3.3 GPA in Graduate School, worked as the project manager of his Capstone design project (which is planned for distribution and was a major project originally started at Vanderbilt). He worked at a city Internet and Cable provider as customer support and interning/shadowing under the Senior Engineer of the office for nearly two years during his college career. He has been a strong support for many peers and individuals at his school program, providing tutoring and mentoring. Many of the positions he has interviewed for have been what he was explicitly trained for and specifically concentrated in college for, however he has not been selected for any of these positions in spite several promising interviews. 

With all of this being said, I have a few questions and would appreciate feedback from the general community on this issue.

First of all, how important would you say that having an education at a recognized school is when trying to be placed with a top defense contractor or specialized government job like he is trying to do? If it is incredibly important, I would like to know what your opinion is on this idea. Many have suggested to him that he should return to complete another degree at a University that has a more recognized name for the sake of having it on his resume. The suggestions have been anywhere from him going and trying to finish another degree and reapplying, to trying to land an internship (which requires you be in school to achieve) while he is pursuing another degree, or to work part time at school and try to continue to apply for positions while doing so. Any suggestions or thoughts on this? I know he is explicitly expressed his concern about becoming more in debt, but I am beginning to wonder if he needs to take the gamble in order to make a more formidable impression on employers that he really wants to work for. My thought is too, that a lot of these employers will pay him to go to school, so if he could land a job while still attending part time, they could pay the remainder of his tuition possibly. I understand this is still a risk, which is why I would like opinions.

What do you think is a suitable alternative? Another thought many have suggested is to get a smaller, more available position and then apply to one of these bigger companies at a later time. The thing that he has expressed as a concern with this however is that he does not want to get caught in a situation where he is stuck in a certain field he did not want to get into, and then find he can't get a job where he really wants to have one later on.

It has been made perfectly clear to everyone who has expressed concern about this that he really wants to work for a bigger defense company as I mentioned above. We are really trying to figure out how to make this possible. It's quickly coming up on 6 months without any sort of luck and no college to fall back on, and I am starting to worry for him and his future. I want him to be happy and successful and I would love any advice you have on this.

Thanks in advance."
gus9b,2,2011-04-20,I want to start a project as a substitute for a summer internship (undergrad CS student),dr_kludge,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gus9b/i_want_to_start_a_project_as_a_substitute_for_a/,"I'm just wrapping up my first year as a community college CS student who will eventually transfer to a 4-year state university.  I've learned a lot!  I got a late start on school (I'm 22 now) and I had never written any code beyond TI-83 BASIC or HTML until about 10 months ago. 

At this moment I am comfortable starting projects in C, C++, C#, x86 assembly, arduino, and possibly objective-C.  I have not found an internship and due to summer school probably will not continue trying.  Instead I am thinking that I should come up with some sort of 3-month project which can fill the internship void in my resume and experience.  

The idea I came up with so far was to build a rudimentary game engine.  Something that could do sidescrolling platform type games, with some 2.5-D (parallax with background objects for example) elements.  I'd stick with image based sprites to keep most of the work code-related.  I feel like this would be enough work to take 3 months, would be advanced enough to look good later on, but isn't so far above my skill levels as to be unrealistic.  The end result would be both the engine, and a game that uses it. 

From both a programming perspective, and a future employer's perspective how does this all sound?  

I have an engineer friend who I discussed this with as well - he suggested coming up with a game for either iOS or android that utilizes openGL ES.  I'm not against this, but it seems more daunting to me than the idea outlined above.

I'm open to ideas about how to make my project idea better, or maybe a completely different kind of project.  Or maybe I've got this all wrong and should be doing something completely different?"
gunux,3,2011-04-20,"To People in Video Game Industry, what would you want to see as past experience on a new hire's resume?",zoofman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gunux/to_people_in_video_game_industry_what_would_you/,"Hello reddit, this is a bit tldr, I apologize.

I'm a Junior in Computer Science at a fairly high ranked university, and to be perfectly honest, I've had absolutely no luck finding an internship in my past three years here.  This semester alone I've had 10 interviews, and many of them came down to ""it's either you or this other guy, and he's already got a security clearance,"" or ""we want to hire you, but without the defense budget being passed we can't afford an intern.""  Needless to say, I'm kind of depressed - employers always stress that experience is HUGE for them, and I am probably gonna be, at this point, a guy who went through 4 years of Computer Science and never secured an internship.

Now, I do have a saving grace in that all my professors are in the field I'm interested in, Media Computation and HCI, and do multimillion dollar research in it.  I can do research with them instead this summer if an internship doesn't come through, but I'm worried how potential employers would see this on a resume, and if they'd consider me doing research in virtual reality with one of my professors being inferior to an internship.

This came back to another thing though - I really am interested in game development, and I know it's a field that it's difficult to get internships in because of the nature of their development cycle (they bring you in, teach you stuff for 3 months about the project, then you gotta go before you can do anything.)  This is also kind of reflected in that all the companies that come to our school are, for the most part, government contractors (outside of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and a few others).  

This led me to wonder then, what exactly do companies look for in fresh graduate computer scientists who want to be game developers?  Would they want me to have an actual internship with a company like Booze Allen or something, or prefer to see that I pursued research in something related to HCI?  On one hand, I would have actual professional experience, on the other my research had more applicable results than ""I made email services.""  I'm honestly at a loss as to who to ask about this, because the types of employers who come to our school are so focused on a particular type of software development.

I'd also like to add that by the time I'm applying for full time positions, I will have taken our senior level game design course and computer graphics course, just can't get access to them till senior year due to the complexity.

In the past 3 weeks I've run into 5 or 6 of them. Being a young man, they seem to gravitate towards me. I try to assume the best of people and when they say ""I need money for the bus"" they mean it. However, each time I see them abusing handouts and simply unethical in their persuasiveness and speech. 

On Monday I was walking to my car downtown and for two blocks a man was following me screaming after me. I got to my car, turned around and realized he was trying to get my attention, and told him I had no cash. He insisted he didn't want cash, but instead a dart pass. I said ""Ok, I can help with that"" spent 10 minutes walking with him to the dart station nearby. During this time I thought ""If I get stabbed walking with this man, or he is about to jump me, I will have been injured doing a noble and stupid thing""

We walk up to the dart box and he says ""I really need a month one"" - I look at the screen and it was I *think* $65. I'm a broke college student working an internship and barely making ends meet. I proceeded with just buying a day pass for him for $4 and tell him I only work 20 hours a week and depend on my parents for my survival. He proceeds with looking at the ticket and saying he needed a month one.

I spent a few minutes talking with him hearing about him, where he's from, etc, then say goodbye. He then asks if I could bring him money on Wednesday. I asked him if he's looked up homeless shelters, food kitchens, etc. You know - places that us Dallas citizens pay for and that churches and non-profits pay for. His response was that they taste gross. I tell him that he needs to go to them and they're healthier than any fast food he'll eat.


So, Reddit, please restore my faith in people down on their luck.

I understand making demos would help boost my chances, but I'm not sure if (in the real world) a good demo outweighs marks (or, at least, balances them out), which is why I've been a bit hesitant. Along with this, I've been reading that internships would also help me greatly, but I'm feeling that, with my marks being not that great, it's pointless because I wouldn't get hired. I understand once I get in there (internship or a full time position) I will work like crazy because it is what I want to do; but I'm just worried that come 1-2 years when I'm done, I won't get anywhere because of a few slip-ups during uni.

gw2sj,38,2011-04-23,The Little Girl,lunaris,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gw2sj/the_little_girl/,"One of my coworkers is full of supernatural stories and I thought I might share one that creeped me out. Let's call her Olivia.

Olivia was doing an internship one summer and living in an old apartment she had never been in before. The apartment was set up such that the living room was connected to the bedroom; while lying down in the bed, you could see into the doorway of the next room. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary, except for when Olivia would constantly and uncharacteristically wake up in the middle of the night. 

One night when she awoke, she could make out the shape of a little girl standing in the threshold between the living room and the bedroom. Olivia told herself over and over again that it was just her imagination. Her glasses weren't on. She had vacuumed earlier. Where had she left it? It was the vaccuum's shadow, not a little girl. It just looked like a humanoid shape. Right? She pulled the covers over her head and turned over so as to not face that direction any more.

Except that it kept happening. Olivia continued to wake up in the middle of the night for seemingly no reason to find little girl standing there, staring directly at her. When Olivia turned the light on, she disappeared. To avoid her, Olivia would go into the living room and watch television until she fell asleep. It was all she could do to keep from being terrified in her own home.

Over the summer, her cousins came to visit her in the apartment. There was a night when she had to be out of town, but the cousins stayed. As she expected, they took her bed. 

When she returned, one of the cousins took her aside. ""Olivia, I need to tell you something. When we were sleeping, I kept waking up. At one point, I could have sworn there was a little girl standing in the doorway."" Olivia was quite taken aback. She hadn't said anything about the little girl to her cousins so they wouldn't be frightened. ""Maybe it was the vaccuum cleaner.""

""We vaccuumed earlier in the day. I left it on the other side of the room. There's no way.""

To extrapolate further: Olivia also told me once she had finished the story that, when she first moved into the apartment, the owner mentioned that a little girl had died there years ago. Another tenant overheard and dismissed the notion immediately. Interesting stuff."

I've got a 3.6 GPA (3.8 major), have been involved in a research group related to my interests since sophomore year, have gotten 2 papers published (third author on one, and first author on another), and have held an internship with the DoD for the past 4 summers.  Also, I received a sort of undergraduate of the year award for my major.  However, this is all at a 50ish ranked state school.  

Finally, what can I do to maximize my chances of acceptance?  My contributions to open source projects have been fairly weak.  Should I attempt to contribute more in the weeks/months before I apply?

Thanks!"

I am a bit stuck, and dont know what to... Some good avice would be more than welcome. So I am really hoping that once again, you guys can deliver.

situation: i am(male) 25 in a couple of days. 
I've been a huge IT guy/nerd since i was twelve. Studied IT and got a bachelor. During my internship, they offered me the job of the previous it manager. Which i took. 

Its been a bit more than a year now, and... I am SO bored. The problem is, its a really good position (head of my departement, etc). THe company is groing (we opened a new sub company and may open a new one in a couple of months). Etc etc. The pay is good and blablabla

For most of my friends, its a dreamjob. And i agree with them. But when i say i am bored, i really mean I AM BORED. Its horible, every day i get up, and i am allready bored of the day thats about to come.

In the begining it was friging awsome, having to take care of a 50man network, the entire IT parc, some devloping projects, etc. But now its always the same... Its a routine...
Once i a while i get a real challenge, like bad computer crash, nasty virus etc... But thats like once every X months. Takes me a couple of hours max to fix, then i am bored again for the coming months.


I really dont know what to do. Should i leave this job? Should i leave IT? Should i stay and be bored for ever?


PS: for the haters, yes, i should stfu and be happy to have a job, etcc. but i am not the kind that settles just because ""it could be worse."" and YES, i am stil imature, thats why I am here.


tl;dr: i am really bored at my current pretty awsome job. what should i do?

gyn30,3,2011-04-27,Eurail Train Passes - Help!,b26354rdeckard,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/gyn30/eurail_train_passes_help/,"I'll be spending three months in Lüneburg for a summer internship at the University of Lüneburg and I have questions about the options for traveling by train.  

The problem is I'm really not sure how much I'll be traveling while I'm working. I'd like to visit a number of German cities (Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Frankfurt, Köln, maybe München...) as well as Amsterdam, all during the weekends/holidays.  

Should I expect to need the train any more than on these occasions? I really have no idea how often German students use the train - perhaps University of Lüneburg students go to Hamburg every week as it's only a half hour away. In this case I'd probably need an unlimited pass.  

I plan to do some additional traveling after I'm finished with my work assignment. Here is my plan as of now, assuming I don't need an unlimited pass:  
Eurail: Benelux-Germany, 10 days within 2 months ($409) --&gt; For first two months   
Eurail: Select Pass 5 Countries, 10 days within 2 months ($549) --&gt; For last month and change  
          Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France  

What do you think? Is this a good plan? or should I anticipate needing an unlimited pass? Perhaps I should consider a German Rail Pass (25 or 50?). Also, should I purchase my pass before I leave or once I arrive? (I'm not sure if interning at the University of Lüneburg could get me a better rate).  

Any general advice is also welcome or even anything about Lüneburg. Is ~$1300 roundtrip a decent price for a flight?"

So, my question is: how do I best represent myself in these settings? Mention that I'm a bit older and maybe more mature than the competition? Or does that sort of raise the question of why it took me so long to get my act together and get to school? Mention previous jobs? Or do people in technical fields look down on menial job/service industry stuff enough that it would harm my chances rather than help them?

Is there anything I should know about the process? Any protips from people who have done this before (or even people who hire for this sort of position)?

gy7j2,0,2011-04-26,I’m two years out of college and disillusionment is a brickload on my chest. How do I find a decent employer?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gy7j2/im_two_years_out_of_college_and_disillusionment/,"I get plenty of interviews and job offers, but every one so far has turned out to be malicious in one way or another. Please advise me.

My backstory: After getting a BA in English --I know, this is where I screwed up. Please spare the obvious-- from Wittenberg University in Ohio, I enrolled in a six-week master’s level program in publishing at the Denver Publishing Institute. After that, I moved to the DC area to live and work close to my sister, who just had a baby. Most of the work around here is through government contractors, and aside from the part-time jobs I took while I was getting on my feet, I’ve been both a proposal writer and a technical writer. I’m good too. I’ll limit my bragging to the fact that during my first six months as a proposal writer, one of my proposals won a 10 million dollar contract and created thirteen jobs.

The big lesson from my proposal writing job was to get a realistic picture of the company's expectations of hours and their feelings on work/life balance up front. In interviews, I ask about the average hours for similar positions and how the company manages comp time. I also try to talk to actual employees whenever possible. Any job that doesn't want you to wander around and talk to the employees after your interview does so for a reason; they don't want the employees scaring you off. And that SHOULD scare you off. The abridged story of that job should explain the justification for these things.

I worked in a back office as a proposal writer for a firm that focused mainly on defense contracts. I thought that I had bombed the interview because I brought in the wrong writing sample, but I got a job offer the next week. That’s when I should’ve known. I started out as an intern and for the most part was limited to forty hours a week. It was obvious the full-time writers stayed much later. The management explained this in the interview: ""There are times when we're busier than others, but there are lulls in between peaks."" I figured that when I started full-time, I'd be working a little later during busy seasons like when proposals peaked.  

A little later? Let’s pause on the hours for a second and consider that I had an hour and a half commute one way to this job.  After they brought me on full-time, I started working ten hour days nearly every day, every week. There was no fluctuation in workload like they'd said; we were busy all the time. I woke up at 5:30 for work and any time I managed to escape work before 5 PM seemed like a jinx that would bring on a night where I didn't leave until 10 or 11.

I tried to tell my bosses I was getting burned out.  I needed a better work/life balance, and they kept promising that they'd try to manage our workloads a little better. I noticed no difference. I was averaging at least fifty hours a week, leaving my house at 6:20 in the morning, every morning, and usually not getting back until 8 or 9 at night. I'd get home, shower, maybe eat, go to sleep, and get up to do the same thing. After a night where I didn't get out of the office until 11:30 and had to still be in by 7 the next day, I started to feel like I was going nuts.

The next week, one of my coworkers was sick. She took Monday off to recover and worked twelve hour days for the rest of the week so that she wouldn't have to use PTO for her sick day. Our boss had said that this was fine; HR had something else to say about it. Even after our boss approved it, they made her take the PTO for that day, disregarding the fact that she'd stayed even later than normal to make up for it. Our boss didn't stick up for her. I quit.

I had to leave that job before finding another because I would have never had time to look for one during my rigorous schedule, much less interview. I had only banked a month’s pay at that point, so I had to move quickly... but it was worth it.

My second foray into the crazy, dishonest world of government contract work was technical writing. The tl;dr on this one: After I scanned over all the documents and emails that I'd kept, trying to find that golden line that stated how long our training and temp status was supposed to be, I found nothing. They had fed us half-truths verbally in the interview and never put any of it in writing. That's the lesson from this job: Get everything that they promise in writing. If it's not in writing, you ain't gettin' it.

I was originally thrilled about this job because I was actually on contract, not in a back office, and was only allowed to work forty hours a week. It seemed like heaven. During the interview, they told me that I'd have to go through a one month training period and that I'd be on temporary status while training. This meant a low hourly rate and no benefits. So I thought, “One month? That's not bad.” When I got to the job site and spoke to the manager, I found out that the training period was actually three months. Ok, so I was less pleased about that, but I'd already accepted the job and figured three months wouldn't kill me. There were four other people hired for the same position, and we were all in the same boat. We’d all heard the same things during the interview process. We kept hearing about this big 90-day review, and connected it to the end of our three month training period. 90 days go by and we hear that a 90-day review is really only for full time employees and that ours would be an informal review to give us some feedback on our work. It was during these interviews that we learned that they had no intention of considering us for full-time positions until they knew if the contract was getting renewed in September. No health insurance. No bump in pay grade. That might change, but there’s no guarantee. They told us that thinking we’d get full time status after 90 days was a “misunderstanding,” but how do five people from five separate interviews all have the same “misunderstanding?”

I'm interviewing for new jobs because there's no way that I can keep putting off my student loans and living like a beggar until September for a job I don't even know I'll get. Last week, I had an interview that turned into a job offer. I had to decline because I noticed some huge red flags:

* They based their salary offer on what I told them I make at my current job, even though their job has a broader scope and more responsibilities.

* They mentioned in the offer letter, but not in the interview, that I’d need security clearance. When I attempted to renegotiate salary based on this, they refused.

* During the interview, they danced around all of my questions about average hours per week and comp time. The emails containing the offer letter and responses to my renegotiation requests were also sent way outside of normal business hours.

It's a shame because this place is a ten minute commute from my apartment, which would have been really nice. That perk, while huge, is negated if I have to work through dinner.

So where are all the good, decent companies that want to keep their employees happy? Are there companies who employ technical writers or proposal writers that don't suffer from high turnover rates? How do I find a company that won’t try to burn me out to make a buck? Thanks to my experience I know a little more about avoiding the bad companies, but I don't want to waste my time in interviews with them. I could sure use a little help and advice."

I have the stupidest problem ever when it comes to internships, two of the three companies I've interviewed with have decided not to offer me an internship, but have offered me full-time positions instead. Sadly, I'm still in university, and I'm not really willing to drop out and move to California permanently.

So about me: I'm a freshman studying CS at University of Washington. I've been writing code for about 8 years on my own, and I have a 4.0 in every programming class I've taken to date as a result. Last year (my senior year in High School) I interned at Microsoft Research, where I published two conference papers (I'm first author on both), and the year before I worked at a [startup near my house](http://www.atigeo.com).

I'm willing to relocate for an internship so long as either the pay is reasonable enough to cover the housing situation, or there's some stipend for that. (Most of the other places I've applied have been in the latter.) Or if this is in the Seattle area, even better :)

If you can do anything, let me know and I'll send over my resume. :D You can email me at tyler@menez.es if you'd prefer.

h0mtx,4,2011-04-29,So I found out my sister is a Cam Girl.  What would you do?,bigbrother26,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h0mtx/so_i_found_out_my_sister_is_a_cam_girl_what_would/,"I was working on my design final for school and my Adobe design premium suite trial expired. I couldnt simply uninstall and reinstall due to Adobes DRM so I asked my sister to loan me her Macbook Pro. I used it and got my project done. My sister (Annie) took the computer back. I asked for it again to remove some files I was needing and noticed that my sister just closed out her browser and didnt log out of her gmail.

You see me and my sister are college students. I work as a workstudy on campus making peanuts on the dollar but it does pay for gas and food so no complaints here. My sister informed me that she landed a job as a blogger and was doing fine with the money. I generally believed her due to her writing background in high school. I never investigated the issue. I would periodically run google searches of her name and never brought up anything.

That was until this past Sunday. I admit that I looked through her email. This was not a big problem for me due to one of other sisters (Linda) almost commiting suicide and if it was not for me and Annies investigation the situation would have not turned out well.

I started noticing that Annie was pulling in an amazing amount of money for simply blogging. She would brag about making $800.00 in two weeks and recently made close to $1500.00. This caused me to become even more suspicious about the whole thing. I found out through her emails that my sister is not a blogger. She is a Cam girl. She performs sexual acts on the screen and people pay her for it. From what I figured out she started off striping but has escalated to other acts.

As you can imagine a million different thoughts and emotions have been racing though me. As her big brother I do not approve of what she is doing. I dont know If I should tell my parents or talk to her on my own. I doubt that me talking to her will change her mind. If I tell my parents then that will ruin her relationship with them. She is quite emotional. If I do nothing and if she fully embraces the lifestyle and that leads to porn or other acts I dont know how I could deal with that.

Let me just get a few things straight. Im not jealous. In fact Im rather angry because my sister made up a huge lie a few months ago that she won an internship to Disney and had to go to Orlando for orientation. She an opportunity of a lifetime and threw it away, or it was a fraud and went for some meeting for the company she works for. My mother had loaned her money for the plane ticket. Also when I finally found out about who she works for I went into her chat room. It basically works like this. There is chat room and they all have access to the girls webcamera. Every one in the room can tip her and she can flash or do whatever she wants to get more tips from the chat room participants. I went into her room once I found her user name and she conducts her shows from my mothers house and will talk to and call my mother from her phone while on camera. I see that as very disrespectful. On top of that my mother gives me a hard time cause I cant bank money while my sister can.

I honestly dont know what to do. Im just asking for some advice and if there are any former cam girls offer your advice as well. I understand that its her life and she has the right to do whatever she wants with it. She is 19 years old. I just think that it will lead to a desructive lifestyle and future. She's already hinting that she is not going back to school next semester. We are not poor or have a hard life. She had a full grant to go to college and study anything she wanted. She was living on campus and was doing well her first semester. The thought of fame and fortune have clouded her thoughts. Just looking for your thoughts on the situation. Thanks. My apologies on any grammar or spelling errors"
h0lgr,1,2011-04-29,So I found out my sister is a Cam Girl.  What would you do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h0lgr/so_i_found_out_my_sister_is_a_cam_girl_what_would/,"I was working on my design final for school and my Adobe design premium suite trial expired.  I couldnt simply uninstall and reinstall due to Adobes DRM so I asked my sister to loan me her Macbook Pro.  I used it and got my project done.  My sister (Annie) took the computer back.  I asked for it again to remove some files I was needing and noticed that my sister just closed out her browser and didnt log out of her gmail.

You see me and my sister are college students.  I work as a workstudy on campus making peanuts on the dollar but it does pay for gas and food so no complaints here.  My sister informed me that she landed a job as a blogger and was doing fine with the money.  I generally believed her due to her writing background in high school.  I never investigated the issue.  I would periodically run google searches of her name and never brought up anything.  

That was until this past Sunday.  I admit that I looked through her email. This was not a big problem for me due to one of other sisters (Linda) almost commiting suicide and if it was not for me and Annies investigation the situation would have not turned out well.

I started noticing that Annie was pulling in an amazing amount of money for simply blogging.  She would brag about making $800.00 in two weeks and recently made close to $1500.00.  This caused me to become even more suspicious about the whole thing. I found out through her emails that my sister is not a blogger.  She is a Cam girl.  She performs sexual acts on the screen and people pay her for it.  From what I figured out she started off striping but has escalated to other acts.

As you can imagine a million different thoughts and emotions have been racing though me.  As her big brother I do not approve of what she is doing.  I dont know If I should tell my parents or talk to her on my own.  I doubt that me talking to her will change her mind. If I tell my parents then that will ruin her relationship with them.  She is quite emotional.  If I do nothing and if she fully embraces the lifestyle and that leads to porn or other acts I dont know how I could deal with that.

In fact Im rather angry because my sister made up a huge lie a few months ago that she won an internship to Disney and had to go to Orlando for orientation.

h0kwu,9,2011-04-29,Need advice for systems analysis and information security from experienced programmers please.,call_me_happy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/h0kwu/need_advice_for_systems_analysis_and_information/,"So I'm a student at a community college and haven't even gotten into classes for my major but I'd like to start learning now so I don't get in over my head.  I'd like to get a degree in Computer and Information Science and then continue with a Masters degree.  I hope to begin a career in information security whether it's corporate, government, or I've even seen internships available with the FBI, CIA, and NSA.  I have done some programming with C++ and Visual Basic back in high school but this was really simple stuff.  I need suggestions on any books, classes, and other websites that might help prepare me mentally for this field.  I also would GREATLY appreciate advice from any of you that have experience in systems analysis and information security.  I'm particularly interested in what programming languages I should begin familiarizing myself with and how they relate to the previously mentioned fields.  Thanks in advance to all replies.  I look forward to reading them all and hope to respond to all comments."
