I've applied to about 35 places now and due to outside circumstances I've realized that I want to prioritize NYC in terms of location. I have the opportunity to have a really great summer in NYC so I would choose a less prestigious or lower paying internship there, compared to one in the Bay Area. 

I don't know of a lot of companies strictly in NYC but here are a few I applied to: Visa, American Express, D.E. Shaw, Codeacademy, Bloomberg, Yodle, ZocDoc, MongoDB, Etsy, Fog Creek. **Are there any others I should consider? I would be ecstatic if I got one of those.

Also, say I get an internship at a place like Facebook or Dropbox, is there a chance I could take that internship at their NYC office as opposed to their normal Bay Area locations? Is that commonplace to ask for?

Thanks a lot!

- Expected career/salary/options trajectory
- How to use internship money (right now it just gets invested right back to mostly pay for half the year's tuition)
- Basics of investing
- How to evaluate and compare job offers (especially stock options… how do they differ at startups vs publicly traded companies?)
- Strategies for saving money on taxes
- Saving money for retirement (How? Where? When?)
- Paying off student loans (should I just pay it off early or is there a better use of signing bonuses?)
- Comparing costs of living and salaries in major tech areas (SF/Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, etc)
- Saving up for a house in the Bay Area vs other CS hubs
- probably a bunch of other things that I don't even know are important because I have no idea what I'm doing :-/

I'm not actually a student anymore, but I just graduated this May (bachelors) and figured that asking other students about internships would be the best idea.  If I should xpost to another sub, do you have any ideas?

I'm an electrical engineer, but I specialized in biomed.  I technically finished all my engineering courses in 2012, but spent another 2 years in school studying biochemistry and organic chemistry to supplement my degree (studied on my own time).  I've been working full time since the start of 2013 at a startup surgical device manufacturing company as their sole hardware engineer.  Unfortunately the company closed shop at the end of August of this year and I was laid off.

I've been applying for jobs ever since then and I've had no luck.  There are absolutely no jobs in the biomedical field here right now (unless you have a masters with 5 years work experience) and the junior electrical engineering jobs here generally require 3+ years of experience.  I've applied to everything anyway.  I've had a few interviews and while they've all gone quite well, I still haven't landed a gig yet.

Going into the new year, I decided that working as an unpaid intern would be better than sitting around doing nothing while applying for jobs, and it would give me the experience I sorely need.  However, I have no idea how to go about applying for internship positions.  None of the companies I have looked at have postings or information about internships.  I have also probably applied to all these companies for real jobs, but have not gotten a call back, or have been turned down after interviews.  Is it going to be weird if I just send them emails saying ""So yeah, you didn't give me a job, but I'm willing to work for free if you'll take me?""

TL;DR: Did well in school, got job, got laid off, can't find job, and quickly sinking into depression.  Is it weird to send internship request emails to companies that have turned down my resume/interviewed me already?"

There's definitely a ""head first"" mentality where I'm given a project to work on and I have no idea what's going on. 

- My first project: write a web application. I had no experience in javascript or anything past some very basic ""put the div on the page."" TBH, it's terrible, not remotely supportable, and very ""newbish.""

- Second project (I'm currently working on): fixing an undocumented python application that was ""writing in a rush."" It's buggy, doesn't work, and is the largest thing I've ever worked on. Again, I have no experience in python. I struggled for days learning how the program went together, and how python syntax works, nonetheless debugging the actual program.

I'm kicking a bunch of ass in school and am on top of my class, but ""real world job"" programming and ""school"" programming are very different. I had an internship before switching majors to CS, and my experience there was much different. I was very confident in what I was doing and was good at what I did. 

I don't want this to be my experience and life as a programmer. It's exhausting to go to work for 8 hours where I beat my head against the wall, constantly have no idea what I'm doing, and feel ""behind the curve"" no matter what my project is. 

Moreover, I feel very isolated. The office is always pin-drop quiet. Relationships are hard to form. I am one of three women in my entire building. From my experience in CS, I have to be very careful how I communicate with other men I work with in order to avoid ""issues,"" with them either getting too personal and creepy or sending the wrong message. My more introverted coworkers avoid me altogether (it's something that happens in school, it's almost like some guys are just scared of talking to girls, or they have misconceptions).

Is this everyone's experience, is it just me, or will it ""get better"" over time? 

Alternately, what can I do with my CS degree that's not software development, where I can be in a more social setting?"

I've been in college for 5 years pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science, and since my second semester, I've been plagued with problems that hindered my education: severe depression, lack of money, lack of family support, and eventually (because of all these things) lack of interest. Since last year, I've found ways to address or better my situation and I've comeback from many of these faults. I had stopped taking CS classes my sophomore year and I just started again this year.

My overall GPA is abysmal because of my problems (2.7), but my major GPA is much much higher. 

I've taken these classes:
CS1 - A (basic OOP)
CS2 - B (taken during a bad phase, data structures and more OOP)
CS3 - A (Currently taking, OOP and software design)
Systems Programming - A (Currently taking, MIPS Assembly, C, and architecture)
Discrete Math - B+
Graph Theory - B+

Next semester I am taking Systems Architecture and Analysis of Algorithms, and another class as well (possibly Game Programming). I've attended a few hackathons and have a few projects with web programming and will continue to work on some this winter break.

Next Summer, I am dying to get a good internship at a large company. I desperately want to intern at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tumblr, Spotify, Pandora, Bloomberg, etc. Literally anywhere where I can feel the difference made in my daily life because of their products. 

However, my resume clearly sucks. I know I need to know my algorithms and have a strong math background for every interview at each of these places (and I believe I do, despite my grades saying otherwise) but I don't feel I have the projects or the grades to get my first foot in the door. I am confident in my ability to succeed at any one of these places, if given the chance. 

Basically, how do I get an interview given my shitty grades and lack of projects? Do I really stand a chance?"

During my spare time I do try to learn more advanced C and C++ from what's taught in class but so far the only thing that I've made was a simple Asteroids clone using OpenGL. If there are any HR people out there, what kind of skills are you looking for and how intense does a CS portfolio need to be considered for a job. Specifically game development if possible. 

So main questions are:

   * How difficult is it to get an CS job without a CS degree/minor?
   * What level of skill is necessary to land a job? (Asteroids clone, custom game engine, 3D-platformer?)
   * Is it worth it to go to school again for 4 years to get a Bachelors since low GPA means no chance of Masters in CS?

I'm starting to doubt if CS was the right choice for me. I am now entertaining the thought of switching majors to something fun like a language, but I'm really turned off by how hard it would to get a job and not make a lot of money.

Edit: Thanks for your replies, everyone.

Has anyone been in this situation? What did you do? Help. "
2o1dxq,2,2014-12-02,"After years of struggling, I finally feel like I've lost (flunking out). I'm medicated, but recently the medicine is no longer enough. Not sure what to do.",helpadhdthrowaway,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2o1dxq/after_years_of_struggling_i_finally_feel_like_ive/,"   I know how walls of text are viewed around here, so I'm going to put the tl;dr up top, and will do my best to keep the main post relatively small.  If you don't read the main post I don't blame ya, it's way too long despite my best editing efforts.

**tl;dr: Have been diagnosed ADHD basically my entire life (medicated on and off).  Struggled all through college despite being back on medication for the last 3 years (Vyvanse 70mg).  Lost my scholarship junior year, but I couldn't tell my parents, so I just never told them and instead got a job to pay the tuition myself (scholarship covered all tuition before that).  Worked 32-40 hours a week, ended up having to take a 5th year, then a 6th.  Currently in my 6th year, 18 hours left to graduate (one more semester), but I'm going to flunk out this semester.  I've tried everything (including some stuff I'm not proud of), but in the end I just couldn't get it done.  I don't know what to do.**


   Anyway since the tl;dr hopefully provides a good summary, I'll just fill in the blanks a bit for the rest of you who like reading walls of text for whatever reason.  

Edit:  This post ended up being too long, and also pretty disjointed at least in my eyes, so I cut it all out.  All you really need to know is that school was not the only area of my life in which my ADHD issues persisted.  I've always struggled in other areas of my life for ADHD reasons, but it was always manageable.  However during this year my symptoms have progressively gotten worse and recently become unmanageable.  First it started with things I only semi-liked doing, like hobbies and work at my current internship (which I actually love and find very rewarding).  But now it's gotten to the point where I can't even maintain focus on things that I fully enjoy doing, like hanging out with friends or even playing fucking video games.

   The thing is I hate quitting/giving up, and while I of course feel like a lazy piece of shit every time I show up for a test having barely prepared or turn in a shoddy half-assed project, I still know that I can work hard.  I didn't want to fail out of college, I actually wanted the exact opposite, I so very desperately wanted the exact opposite.  I would work 40 hours a week, and still put in most of my remaining hours trying to get school work done.  I made up for it by not sleeping much, but that's pretty typical and shouldn't be surprising or unusual to anyone here.  A few times I tried going cold turkey on things that might take away from me finishing school (video games, netflix, even went weeks without really hanging out with friends), but that never helped, and at times made things worse.  Regardless I had overall decreased the time I spent on any ""extra-curriculars"".

   The worse part is I ended up doing shit I never thought in a million years I would do (cheat on exams, manipulating the good will of my professors, further manipulating my professors using my image as someone who is supposedly ""intelligent"", and of course I did my fair share of lying to get out of exams and assignments).  Sure I know plenty of people will go get a doctor's excuse, but I wasn't able to get a doctor's note most of the time.  It's different when you show up and just make something up, gambling that you know the professor would rather not fail someone who seems genuine.  I justified it because I thought since I still had to know all the material for the final, it wasn't a big deal.  But I still felt like a piece of shit for it.  I'd keep telling myself, ""just get past this next chunk of exams/assignments, and then you'll have time where you can get your shit together and sort all this ADD stuff out"".  But of course it never worked out like that.

   Now I find myself sitting here, having spent 6 years worth of time, pretty much all of my money, a good bit of effort and even a little of my own dignity, and yet I'm going to have nothing to show for it.  Obviously I'm being somewhat vague about some details for anonymity purposes, and honestly I could further embellish my story by including a few important events that occurred, but they are really just excuses anyway.  I didn't find the classes terribly difficult, I had tons of chances right up until the end, I had medication and ample time to get all of the work done, I just couldn't manage to do it.

and..... this post ended up being extremely long anyway, sorry.  To sum it all up, I guess the question is, what do you do when medicine is no longer enough?

P.S:  I had a psychiatrist recently (I've had many over the years), but for some a *reason* I can no longer see him, and am in the process of getting a new one, but at the moment I am seeing nobody.  In the mean time I've been getting my Vyvanse prescriptions from my general practitioner. "
2o1nzg,11,2014-12-02,After two months I landed my dream job - advice and thoughts,dragwillhurtspeed,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2o1nzg/after_two_months_i_landed_my_dream_job_advice_and/,"Hello,

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was ""his favorite book"".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few ""standard"" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them ""I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y &amp; Z.""

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that ""something would come through"" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.

2o2gk9,2,2014-12-02,Am I expecting too much from a return internship?,Spiah,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2o2gk9/am_i_expecting_too_much_from_a_return_internship/,"Long story short, I was an intern at a relatively small company last year &lt;300 people, and I absolutely loved my experience. At the end of it, I got great reviews and a resounding ""see you next year! great job!"" from many people I worked with, including my manager. My manager constantly said ""you're coming back next year, right??"" and at the end of the summer, I was told we could discuss return offers in December/January. I was really happy to not have to worry about an internship this summer. 


So, fast forward to now, and I've been exchanging some emails with my manager, talking about my experience, what they could do differently and so on. However, he said that they're looking to expand their internship program (I was the only engineering intern this last summer.) ""Great"", I thought, I'd love to work with more peers this next summer.


However, he then told me that with the expansion of the internship program they'd like to re-interview me formally and put me against all the other interns I just gave suggestions on how to recruit. I kind of feel like I'm cannibalizing my own chances at getting my internship back, and was really looking forward to just getting a return offer and not having to stress about applications and interviews again.


Was I expecting too much from this last internship? I'll definitely apply any interview because I loved the internship a lot, but I'm confused why I kept getting told ""see you next year!"" by the very people who are in charge of hiring me, and then get told I'll have to apply normally again, all while being asked by my recruiter how to attract more people to unknowingly compete against me."

I have my dads GI bill and a good amount in savings. I am signed up for 8 credits next semester and if I get good grades, I will be able to go full time. I am studying Political Science/Public Administration at community college, but will transfer to a bigger school (maybe ODU, Radford or VCU)

While I am excited, I do have concerns. 

1) By the time I graduate, I will be 28 (26 or 27 if I really work hard, but I dont want to overwhelm myself). I have minimal experience (others probably have more than I do, only been working for a couple of months, will have to quit when I start).

So my question is how should I go about getting experience in the industry as a freshman?


How difficult would it be for a Freshman to get an internship - do employers prefer CS students past their freshman year?

I am doing both his projects and mine and its stressing me out.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2o3o6q/intern_doesnt_know_jack_i_am_doing_both_his/,"Boss hired an intern who is currently a CIS major graduating in may. He told my boss he doesn't want to stay in this part of the state and when he graduates he intends to leave and get a job else where. He's even had interviews at other companies but my boss insist that ""we can get a lot of work out of him before he leaves"".

He started a few weeks ago, and right off the bat he was assigned a large web project that allows employees to request time off, view accrued time off, and managers to review and approve requests. Complete with emails, expiring security tokens and a secure API back end. The deadline for mine and his project is Jan 1 but I leave for vacation on DEC 22 for two weeks.

He doesn't know a single technology needed: javascript, angular, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Entity Framework. And his C# is almost non existent. So I have basically been sitting at his desk for half the day or more every other day and explaining the basics of all these technologies and walking him through building this project. Most of the time I'm telling him what to write and where to write it. When I start to give him a small task a couple hours later he barely has a few lines of code out. In the mean time I have a massive project on my own that easily consumes all of my time. I've been staying an hour or two later most days because of this. 

The time it would take before he's proficient enough to be let lose on the project and have tasks expected of him completed well enough that wouldn't require me to rewrite his code he will be gone. I'm not sure what I should do. I wish I could go back in time and have him do the whole project in MVC and just sit back and let him sink or swim. Especially since this makes me feel like my boss doesn't realize what an asset I am due to the speed and quality of the products I produce.

I was in this kids shoes not too long ago, the difference is I have a passion for this, and I spend time at home reading blogs and learning. The stress of doing two peoples work is giving me headaches at the end of the day."

Earlier this fall I applied to several companies and ended up accepting an offer that I'm extremely excited about, so that's great!

I do want to continue taking CS classes (I doubt I'll ever actually go through a book on AI or Machine Learning, so I'm taking them next quarter).  I still love doing programming class projects, but some classes end up being so theoretical (and some instructors so bad) that I have to force myself to do the work and feel like I end up learning almost nothing. I'd rather put more time into personal projects, student groups I'm in, learning new technologies, reading, blogging, etc, but that would likely bring a hit to the grades.

So, how much effort should I continue putting into classes I feel I get little out of? And how much does GPA really matter for someone in my position?  How long after my first job am I expected to *keep* my college GPA on my resume, anyway?  Would having a great project that I've put a lot of effort into be more valuable than a few tenths of a GPA point?  I don't know if I want to go to grad school for a masters, but if I do, it definitely won't be for several years and only if I felt I really needed it (I'm pretty tired of academia).

So the essential question is **does my GPA still matter? Or am I safe to sacrifice a few points for other projects/involvement? If I'm safe to let it fall, where should I be careful to keep it above?**

Any other advice is also appreciated!"

I've been going here for 5 years because I've done two CO-OPs which are extended internships.  Anyways there's a few things off about campus.  Every time we has a speaker at engineering seminar that was an alumni they would talk about getting wasted on hotdog day (our party weekend before finals), and they would also brick up the brick (a residence hall) and how haunted it was... 


For me I never really saw anything too crazy until sophomore year.  I had gone to bed after eating some frootloops, fuck I haven't eaten footloops since then because it was too fucking scary.  I lived in Norwood,  a dorm not known for supernatural phenomenon. 

I awoke to the voices of my brother and sister in my room, I was like wtf... they should probably be back home, 4 hours away.  They were at the end of my two beds pushed together, because my roommate went on co-op, but as I tried to comprehend what was going on their faces started to fade into a dark abyss and there bodies sucked into voids and replaced with skeleton/demon looking things like my step-dads grim reaper painting. I closed my eyes in fear and tried to open my eyes to see if i was dreaming, this usually works if I am having a nightmare but I could not open them, and I was frozen in fear.  

I panicked as I felt the things step on either side of my body,  starting from the foot of the bed, boom, my body would tilt towards each footstep as if these creatures were massive entities that were actually tangible.  They moved in a staggered yet uniform painfully slow pace.  Always my left side of my body then my right, as there masses imprinted my bed, my anxiety rose.  

Finally they had reached my shoulder area, with my eyes still closed they slowly caressed my hands with their cold, skeleton hands and then violently pinned them to my chest and held them there for what seemed like an eternity. Eventually I finally pried my eyes open, however, I was still frozen in fear with my arms crossed on my chest, exactly like an ancient mummy.  It took a good 20min for me to slowly gain control of my body, I had my I-home in view of my bed so I watched the clock every so often as I surveyed the room anxiously, hoping these entities would not return.  This whole time I felt like there was a massive weight on my entire body, it felt like I was going to be pressed though crevasse formed between the beds.  I called my mom and dad the second I was able to conjure enough energy and courage to want to move from my bed.  To this day I can not fall asleep on my back because if I do one of the entities comes back for another dreadful night. 

This opened a door into a world that seems to visit me from time to time, or something who likes to visit.  I have one more god awful one,  one that chilled me to the bone."

Solo entrepreneur experience, two short business internships, no work experience. English only, working on German as we speak. (Duolingo)

Never one to plan in advance, I decided to just head to Europe first and figure out the rest as I go. Hostels cost about as much as rent did back home anyways, of course the only limitation now is my tourist visa's 90 day clock.

The last few days have been filled with endless amounts of job applications to various companies in cities like Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Budapest, and Amsterdam. I'm ideally looking for work in any combination of engineering and business disciplines. The hope is that a company would be interested enough in having me work with them that they would assist me in the visa application process.

I started in Austria, but am finding that there are more jobs in Germany, especially in the engineering field. Their visa application process also seems to be more lenient than Austria, but that's just an opinion from my recent readings. The UK also appears to have lots of jobs, but I'd like to exhaust some other options firstly. I can use the 6 month UK tourist visa if I run out of time in the EU.

I also have a friend in Hungary who claims I can purchase a sort of work visa for a few hundred Euros that would allow me to work there, but I'm not sure there are enough attractive jobs over there.

Pretty messy, haphazard situation no? Any recommendations on what countries would be best to look into for a person in my situation? Thanks!"

**Brief background:**  
* Current Senior at a State University  
* Currently working at a competitive start-up as a SE intern (remotely) 6+ months  
* Graduating within 6 months   
&amp;nbsp;

So, recently I've been looking at more permanent positions for CompSci. I was fortunate to get a few interviews/email exchanges. A start-up I'm particularly interested in, wants me to start by January 2015. But that would force me to take a gap year, or find transferrable courses near San Jose.  
&amp;nbsp;

**FOR**  
I really want to take this offer since its in Silicon Valley. The job is for a Web Dev/Automation engineer role. And would be considered 'Full time'. The job would primarily deal with the environments of: Node.js, which by no means am I an expert in, and Python, which I do consider myself skilled in.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm partially for the job since I'm sick of attending a STATE university. I feel like my degree will be worthless when compared to a private degree/Ivy League. I live and work in Boston; but attend a Large State Uni. And if you know Boston, there are a bunch of high-browed Unis. I feel like a competitive employer will disregard my projects and achievements based off my STATE university degree. Honestly I'd prefer to just transfer into a top-tier CompSci program; but given that I'm a Senior I don't know if this is feasible or even advisable.  
&amp;nbsp;

**AGAINST**  
* I would have to take a gap-year from my State University. (which I barely care about).  
* I'm no expert in Node.js; but can certainly enhance the skill.  
* The start-up is four years old; doesn't have much press, social buzz, glassdoor is empty  
* Would need to quit my currently successful job.   
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Can someone provide advice to whether I should finish the degree or take the job; based on the details provided above?**  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
-
Would also be nice to provide insight on the whole STATE vs Prestigious degree argument. From my point of view a STATE degree will require you to jump through additional hurdles with increased projects. While with a Prestigious degree you will easily grab a job in which you are completely unqualified for. Given this, I don't necessarily see the benefit of graduating and being associated with a STATE degree every time I apply to a job.

I'm a computer science student in one of the top Universities in the World for CS, in my 3rd year now. This is the time of the year everyone applies for internships and jobs through my schools co-op program, and I think I'm not in a good position right now.

Even though I'm in my 3rd year, I feel like a freshman since I didn't really care about computer science and my degree the first two years, due a mix of a lot of reasons, some personal, and some because I had a lot of growing up to do. I didn't even consider my self a CS student till this year. Anyway, because of that I don't have any projects and technical experience outside school to talk about, and to make things worse, I've never even had a job in my life and my GPA isn't anything great.

What I want to ask is, what can I do now to make myself more attractive to employers? I'm ready to work and hard, and I'm committed to giving it my all and become a better programmer but I don't know what I should be focusing on and what projects I should start that I can put on my resume.

Also I tend to look down on myself, and underestimate my abilities so I have a hard time selling myself.

For at least a year Ive been at a lost of what I really want to do with my degree. I was always into computers and wanted to know how they work. I always thought I was into hardware but I guess Im not as into it as I thought I was. I know for a fact I do not want to do heavy EE stuff like designing analog circuits or something of that nature. Im so lost in my electronics course and I found my circuits course difficult while alot of my classmates found it easy. 

I thoroughly enjoyed taking an Intro to Programming in C course last yr and then a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in C course last semester even though I thought I wouldnt be a good programmer. I guess I never took the time until that class to learn how to program and for some reason I didnt mind too much putting long hours to get my code to run and debugging stuff and learning about linked lists and vectors and trees etc.

I struggled alot with my digital logic design course last year but this semester I am liking my Digital Systems Design course where I am doing HLSM and RTL stuff and mostly programming in VHDL to get my fpga to do stuff. I still find it difficult to think how a processor does but I do find it very interesting.

So I am leaning towards programming stuff but then isnt there a huge difference between low level and higher level programming? I enjoyed the Data Structures class the most so what types of software internships should I keep a look out for? I dont know what key words or phrases to use when searching.

I live in NYC and everytime I look at a software internship, they always put in some requirements for scripting or web based stuff and my only experience from programming is in C and a tiny bit of C++ and i started to learn python on my own but its definitely not at a level where I can be tested on using it. They seem to only want Computer Science guys and it makes me depressed and wonder if I shouldve switched to CS when I had the chance at the end of my junior year. Im not trying to switch now and take an additional yr to finish college. I dont know what to look for based on my interest with data structures.

But I also applied nationwide for companies that were more in tune with my skillset with low level programming interfacing with hardware and required digital logic knowledge. I believe programming to interface with the hardware is fascinating.

So I guess my dilemma is that I dont know what type of programming role I should go for and would like to know all the opportunities I should be looking into. I just know Id feel more comfortable programming now rather than dealing with alot of circuitry.

Tldr; I grew to like programming when I did it for the first time last year but not sure what type of programmer I want to be and would like to know whats out there."

I am 26. I have a Bachelor of Fine Art, a Masters in Arts Management and a Masters in Arts Curatorship from arguably the top university in Australia. I was also accepted to do my PhD in Information Studies at University College London, however I was unable to secure funding and deferred my place until next year. I have applied to do my PhD in Archaeology at a well respected university in Australia (as I don't see any prospects in securing funding for UCL despite my deferral) next year but I'm having serious doubts regarding my long term career and student debt. 

Despite my education and internships and contracted positions at museums, galleries, festivals, etc. I have been unable to get my foot in the door and secure a permanent position in the arts. For the last 18 months, I have been really exacerbating all resources at my disposal and applying for as many positions as possible but the fact is I got one job offer for minimum wage at $37k per year. I considered it but after it was made clear that the company had very little career progression or further opportunity, I chose not to take it. As a result, I am currently working for my mum's business in the financial industry and get paid double that annually.

I am now considering going back to uni and retraining in the law/commerce field. I have applied for several undergrad courses such as law/commerce, law/international relations and am considering applying for a master of laws due to my postgrad qualifications. I have a postgrad average of 85% average and solid undergrad marks. 

I have also really come to want to help people and change what I see in the arts as grossly unfair treatment. After studying arts law and a lot of arts curatorship issues I am really passionate about issues such as artists and intellectual property, the repatriation of stolen artefacts, copyright infringements, etc. 

My PhD research surrounds the preservation of prehistoric rock art using digital technology and is an extension of my Masters thesis. As such, I see it as a whole other kettle of fish in terms of subject matter, direction and outcome. I am also incredibly concerned about completing my PhD and then being unable to secure an academic career or an job outside of the field, considering my previous experience.

At the moment, I am having a full internal battle and have even resorted to a pro/con list but am feeling very apprehensive about my current career situation. I would really appreciate any wise words, brutal honesty or anecdotes from strangers on the internet. "

Everything at the same time.

I'm constantly getting behind on those deadlines and being asked why this or that takes so much time.
I get to work waiting for the day to end and praying that no costumer calls to complain about the service because if that happens, I'll take another half day hunting and solving the problem.

At the end of the day I'll go home thinking about all the stuff I'll have to do tomorrow and all the projects that are behind schedule. (Luckily I never built up the habbit of staying until later)

I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this bit I lied about my degree and got my job. 

I am very young (people graduating from my degree around 2-3 years older) and I recently began an internship in an advertising agency. I slaved away at this place, working 10 hour days, 3 days a week for 3 months for no pay while studying and working another two jobs to pay the rent. All my managers have commended me on my work ethic and the quality of my work and know I'm more than capable of handling this entry level position.

I offhandedly mentioned that this was my last semester and I had started looking for full time positions in the field. However, I'm still a year away from finishing. They offered me a full time position and I accepted. After reading through the contract, it obviously had a clause to address the fact that if I lied about information, I would be fired. Also, there was another clause that said I would have to provide documentation like bank statements from past employers and transcripts if requested.

I really do not want to sign a legally binding document when I know I have lied. But the directors have been so excited to announce that I'm ""becoming a part of the family"" and I don't know what I can say to get out of this. I've considered telling them that I thought I'd be finished but I just got my results and it turns out I failed a subject and if they were still willing to hire me, knowing this fact, then I'd be happy to do the subject online and still work for them full time.

I'm so desperate for this job. I'll finally be able to pay rent without sacrificing sleep and my friends but I really don't want to start a working relationship on the foundations of a lie. It will only lead to weaving more lies to cover my ass and it will blow up in my face. I don't know what to do. Please help?"

I have checked with financial aid and course advisor and they said if I want to pursue it I will be ok to come back the following fall and continue where I left off.

2o6i1d,1,2014-12-03,Trying to break my barriers in game programming.,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2o6i1d/trying_to_break_my_barriers_in_game_programming/,"**The first part is some of my background. Skip to the next bold'd section if you don't care.**

I started in Maxis' Klick 'n' Play when I was 13. I must of clocked a good 8k hours into the game/development suite by the time I was 17 and I started working in the IT field. I made some interesting games that my friends loved. 

My most popular was a game called ""Rome"" (big Times New Roman lettering on the opening screen) where I used hidden number fields that players could enter in values at the start of the match and soldiers and archers would appear and shoot or march on the battlefield and the values depicted their positioning and the quantity of each unit. After both players entered the values they pressed play and the battle took place and a victor declared. Years later Rome:Total War was released and I was shocked at the similarities of the little game I made. Rome:Total War is one of my most favorite games of all time and I'm not taking credit for any of it but I feel the idea I had at 14 at the time was strong for a fun game.

Years later and after many administration and DBA jobs... I am a strong SQL programmer who primarily works in scripting languages with some object orientated code. I have had some huge accomplishments at the jobs usually hired in as a DBA that within 6 months, I've outcoded the developers and been moved into a developer or dev-ops position. I'm usually a developers worst nightmare as I have had years of administration experience to know what is working code and what is GOOD code. I have implemented code reviews at my positions and that's when the developers pack up and leave. One of the first things I did at my current job was script out all the DTS and SSIS packages data flows and sql scripts and mapped out how every table and column in our 87 databases across 6 SQL servers moved data. I created a tool within 2 days to take all that data and made tables and columns searchable with data hierarchy. Within 6 months of my position I had a birds eye view of the company and was an invaluable resource and received at $12k raise for the work I had done.

At a year in the position I took over administration of a $2.2 million system which we were paying out the ass to support. Over a month I rewrote all the processes put in place by the third party that were faulty. Prior to the rewrite we could process 10k claims in 30 minutes which failed 3 out of 4 times forcing our data processing group to restart the process. By the end of the day we could usually get 20k claims to go out. There was no logging in the system. Claims would fail and show as sent. We had fallen behind in $80 million dollars during the prior use of the system. After my revamp of the system we were able to process up to 1 million claims in 10 minutes and within 2 months we caught back up. My system logged all claim errors and some interns created reports off those tables so we could analyze every claim error. Our Claims dept of 3 people grew to 12 (currently). We then had an issue of processing the responses of those claims which forced me to rewrite the entire process of gathering those responses and inserting them back into our systems.

I saved my company roughly 68 million dollars and just in time as our contract with the government is up in 2016 and we are now bidding on the next one. We were out of compliance for 2 years prior to me even walking in the door. I was being commended by the CFO and CEO and my company and they said ,""Wish we could of got you sooner."" to which I replied ,""I applied to work here in January of 2007, March of 2008, October of 2010 and on a sheer whim a recruiter cold called me in March of 2012.""

**I feel I have the skills to break my barriers.**

So generally my skills have been .Net, ASP.net, TSQL, Report Building, Data Warehouse modeling, B2B solutions (BizTalk), PhP, MySQL, Python, VBA, VBScript.

As you can see most of my experience is in scripting languages with the only exception being .Net which is OO lite.

Object orientated code doesn't scare me. I have a little bit of experience in Java. I have written a couple test apps to mix touch screen controls with a 3d rendered object using the android SDK and Ogre3d. Took me 3 days to get it to compile using two code sample sets that I was merging. It felt like an accomplishment but I didn't feel I really wanted to pursue it as I hate phone games and prefer PC/Console as my ultimate platform. Anytime I got a new phone I'd instantly wanted to see what the dev kit was like.

My biggest issue with game development in the past and present has been setting up the IDE with the appropriate libraries so I can start my project.

**My frustration peaked today** when I looking into the Xbox XNA development kit to find that despite the fact that Microsoft posts on their website that it's the current development kit, the internetz have stated that as of 1st QTR 2014 it is dead. There will be no future releases and I cannot seem to find anything on what the future platform will be.

**The project I was working on last week** as setting up visual studio with UDK 3 engine. I've watched about 47 hours of UDK tutorials and there was a point where I had said to myself ,""I find myself really struggling with the visual style of kismet. Maybe I'll use kismet for some elements but I'll try to use the C# language for more complex builder things"" as I'm looking to do some procedural rendering in my first project. Unfortunately, while trying to set up my IDE with the UDK engine using the nFringe VS templates I get a hard error stating the template is borked. The error is so vague and I haven't had the urge to debug it. Ultimately UDK is moving away from C++ and is moving to a more robust Kismet (sigh).

**What I was working with 2 months ago was NodeJs.** Node is soo cool in what it can do. Socket.IO is some pretty amazing stuff. I had an Ubuntu VM on my machine and I started setting up my IDE, my text editor, my repository and I start trying some sample code.

I can't get most of the required modules for the few sets of sample code installed due to the using the latest version of node. Ok! Time to get NPM (Node Package Manager). Great tool for easily managing which version of node I will be using as a run time!

My sample codes were pretty much using Module A, Module B and Module C. (usually express, socket.io and another I forget)

Module A works with node version 8.6 and it has a dependency of Module B which works with module 8.6 but the code sample is using a function deprecated in 8.6 and documentation on Module B says to use Module C to fulfill the same function deprecated in Module B. Module C wont install in 8.6 because it requires Module D but because Module D's installer is using a command deprecated in 8.1. 

NodeJs seems so awesome but it seems like a volatile mess.

**This is just what I've done recently. I cannot tell you the other 80+ attempts I have made at this in the past 14 years.**

I have only met 2 programmers stronger in knowledge about programming in person (internet I'm sure is filled with them) and I say that liberally as maybe I have met people but their first rule is ""don't talk about code club"". I feel confident I have the skills and the aptitude to break this barrier and find something that I can pour my creative mind into that will see to compilation.

**[TL][DR] Below**

**My question is to seasoned programmers in object orientated languages that have worked with external libraries (preferably 3d engines), how do you go about figuring out what collaborations of IDE's will make it to a successful compile? Any suggestions? Anything you currently have working?**

I'm not against using eclipse, I have in the past for my Android project but I really have never seen any 3d engines give much documentation with it."

Many people get interesting idea's and don't know the first thing about executing them. So we get on the internet and have to go through a slow learning process of figuring out web development, marketing, product management, validation, etc. Would it be easier to do all of this from inside a startup?

This was just a random thought but are their any programs that let you work with a early stage startup for a few weeks for maybe 20-30 hours a week to get some experience working with real startups? I see something like this having a few benefits.

1. You get access to built in mentors as the startup you'd be working with would most likely love to help you in any way they can.

2. You get to start building your entrepreneurial brand and networking as the internship like program would break you into the culture.

3. The third and most important thing I think would be learning the hardwork, time, and effort that goes into making a startup. You will get to see the founders working 80 hours for next to nothing (or nothing) and learn to respect the hustle.

I think this would be great for all the MC's, and finance/accounting guy's out there. People that want to do the career switch, but aren't quite ready to make the jump. Anyone know of any programs like this?

I think programs like the founders institute do something similar to this, but I feel it would be better to actually work with/intern for a startup. Your mentors are much more invested in you and you get a much more realistic view of startup life. "

They are using Java and that includes stuff like Maven, Git, continuous integration and all that cool jazz.

However I don't see myself working with Java in the future. I've grown more and more frustrated with the language (and it's popular frameworks) over the past few months and switched to C# as my language of choice. Maybe it's just the initial excitement, but I really enjoy working with C# and it's what I would like to do in the future. 

The internship will be for ~6 months, after which I should graduate University and I will be looking for a full time developer position. I want some experience I can put on my CV, since it's currently lacking in that area. As I mentioned above, I'm leaning towards C#. 

Should I look for something else where I would work with C#, or will employers appreciate more working at a big company but with different language and tools?"

The thing is, I'm not sure if I should cancel some of them given that 1) I have finals to study for, and 2) I'm not that excited about the company. 

The offer I got was for a very young startup (&lt; 1 year old) whose key attraction is its incredible growth rate and opportunity to implement and experiment (I'm on a small team). Does anyone have experience interning with this type of company? 

Also, does anyone have any experience with interning at the following companies? Or have advice for what I should do?

* dropbox (notoriously difficult, so might skip) 
* knewton (requires 6+ hours of coding)
* asana 
* reservoir labs (good for research experience but not much else?)"
2o74y7,1,2014-12-03,IT support being offered SEO position. Looking for feedback from outside perpsectives.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2o74y7/it_support_being_offered_seo_position_looking_for/,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but I got some more concrete news this morning and wanted to get some outside feedback on what I have been thinking about.

So I work as IT support for a company. We have a pretty big client that I won't name but we handle the media creation, website hosting and company tools creation for them. I am responsible for all the equipment in the office and for all software purchases among a multitude of other smaller responsibilities (if a chair needs to be put together then I am usually the one doing it). Everything goes through my boss but I have a fair amount of autonomy and he trusts my decisions when it comes to IT solutions.
Over the past few months I was asked to help do QA testing for our main site redesign about 2 months before launch and for 2 months after that. Many things have happened between that time and I have assumed quite a number of new responsibilities in that regard. I have also been doing SEO and Metrics analyzing for the developers and for the strategy team more recently. This work in particular has been ramping up in terms of time necessary to complete.

So in all, not only have I been doing IT, I have been doing QA for the site itself and for the tagging of the site for search rankings, traffic tracking, etc. Over the last couple weeks the head developer has been trying to get me to come to his team full time to do this work. At first they wanted to get me an intern but after launch I no longer needed it. Nothing was really for sure as ""the idea"" was being floated around between a few of my bosses.

Today he CIO came to me and asked me about what I think about the work I have been doing. I won't try to lay out everything that was said, but I basically told him that I have considered having to do this type of work full time (QA for the site) and that I wasn't sure if I could. It isn't something I am used to and it doesn't come naturally to me like IT work does. He went on to tell me that the QA position was not necessarily what they wanted me for. They need someone to supplement the current strategy lead so that all the duties required of them can be fulfilled.
What this would mean is that I would leave IT all together and move into a new position that would deal with SEO and metrics. I would still QA but it would be ancillary to the other two types of work. I honestly hadn't considered this and told him as much. He was very supportive of it though based on my impression. He said that ""they need someone who is not only technical but flexible enough to assume this position"" and that he thought because I have already been doing it that I should have the opportunity to take the position. This is as opposed to finding another employee to fill it.

That would mean that I would be replaced in IT and assume this new position full time. No dates were discussed specifically but this is something that is going to be decided on in the next couple of weeks. The CIO also said some things that I felt were really important. He said that because of our client's size we are able to do things that wouldn't normally be possible in smaller environments. I totally agree with this.
I see this as an opportunity that I shouldn't pass up but I told him that I needed to think about it before I could make a decision. I have a pretty good working relationship with my current boss (even though it has been rocky in the past) and IT has always been something that I am naturally good at. Before I came to this job I was a legal assistant and it was soul crushing. If I wasn't doing IT as work I would be doing it anyway for friends and family.

I have an interest in the work being offered to me; I just don't know if I should jump on it. I'm on this weird cusp of judgment and I guess I wanted to write it out and see what other people think. I am going to spend tonight and tomorrow talking with family/friends to see what they think as well.

Should I do it? What should I consider? What should I ask about? Is there something I could look at in terms of my history here or other circumstances and say ""definitely not!""? My head is swimming with possibilities and I'm trying to funnel them into something that I can articulate to the people that are going to decide on this.

Please ask anything you might need/want to know and I will try to respond as best I can."

I'm a 19 year old anxious freshman whose interested in computer science, although I have limited programming skills and experience asides from my intro to Computer Science class in python. I have a couple of questions for you guys and hopefully I can get your opinion on some of them.

* How can I survey different areas of computer science before I choose an area to examine deeply? All the areas of CS look cool-web design (back-end and front-end), AI, graphics etc.-but how can I scope them out and focus.
* Whilst looking at some websites who are hiring computer science interns, I've noticed that they are mainly interested in those with BS degrees whilst my degree is a BA degree. Is there a way to make up for the lack of fulfilling this requirement, or do I have to look elsewhere?
* I have also heard that employers like looking at some evidence for experience. So this question is pretty much 2 questions.How can I start working on open source projects? So far, if I go to Chromium and I choose python, all i see is WTF?!?!?!? Also, How can I build a good programming portfolio?
*I'm thinking of taking a major in economics because I can accommodate it in my schedule (although the shoehorning is hard) and I feel like the quantitative analysis required in economics will help out in CS.
* What other skills would be helpful in Computer science career?
* Any general tips.

2o7zt3,0,2014-12-03,I'm in a bit of a predicament with my internship,arbartz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2o7zt3/im_in_a_bit_of_a_predicament_with_my_internship/,"THERE IS A TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM

Okay, so here's a bit of background first.  I'm a sophomore electrical engineering student with a 2.7GPA who's had two internships so far.  

I had an internship at Company A in Madison, WI during the summer between highschool graduation and freshman year in college.  I really liked Company A and felt generally positive vibes towards me from everyone I worked with, but when I emailed them asking about interning again (for the summer between freshman and sophmore year) I was basically told that they were not awarded the grants they were counting on and they didn't have enough work planned to make it feasible to hire another intern.  He did say though to let him know when I'm thinking about next summer, which I am now...

Since I didn't get the Company A internship the second time around I went searching for other companies in the state, and ended up getting an internship at Company B in Manitowoc, WI.  I really enjoyed my time there and they offered to keep me in the system so I can come back during christmas break and next summer.  

Cool, but here's where the predicament comes in.  I went to my school's career fair and picked up a few interviews and job offers.  All of these offers were from companies that were close to the school, which meant I would have to be working during school.  I'm not too opposed to that, but I have an on campus job that is really convenient since I can study when I'm not busy.

I let Company B know that I had another offer I was considering and they gave me a generous counter offer.  So I took it and turned down the other companies.  Well, Company B came back after I accepted the offer and let me know that they are opening an R&amp;D facility in Chicago...  

I hate Chicago, I hate the fact that I can't live at home where it is essentially free, and I hate the fact that I will be forced to take public transportation. 

I set my foot down shortly after I started school at MSOE that I will NEVER work anywhere in a big city.  I know full well that limits my earning potential, but my life goals revolve around having lots of land, lots of guns, and lots of fast cars.  I can't have any of that living in the city.

So here I am, in one hand I have an offer that I hate, but is the best option financially and in the other hand I have an outside possibility of an internship at a company I loved, but didn't pay as well.

TL;DR:  The company I'm currently employed with gave me the shaft and wants me to move to Chicago for my internship and I turned down a few other job offers because my current company gave me a really good counter offer before they told me about moving to Chicago.

What do you guys think I should do?"

2o8op5,0,2014-12-04,MechE Switched to ECE,LogBaseE,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2o8op5/meche_switched_to_ece/,"Hi Everybody,
I just thought that I would share my experiences as an Engineer at Boston University so far. I feel it's been a pretty standard experience but It's always good to share. Mostly I'm writing about how I switched from MechE to ECE.

I'll start with what I was going into college till now (end of second year)

I've was always a good student, all my high school teachers thought I had potential. I got a 4.7/4.0 GPA because of AP Physics C Mech and E&amp;M, AP Chem, AP Calc AB &amp; BC, AP Econ Micro/Macro, AP Lit, AP Chinese etc. I wanted to go to MIT, but honestly I was never going to get in because I was to focused on studies and had no extracurriculars or projects. I also didn't really focus on College Apps because I was honestly always distracted by AP PhysC HW or AP Chem Lab. I did FRC in high school, so that pushed me towards MechE. Proudest achievement in High school got 200% on Calc BC mid term after extra credit and scaling. I got a medal or something. I think I traded it for an Arduino or something. Anyway, at the end of high school I was on my way to Boston University as a MechE with a good scholarship. I honestly felt that I didn't try very hard. But thinking back, I did spend most nights studying or watching Kahn Academy Videos.
In my freshman year due to all my AP credit, I was taking sophomore classes in MechE. I didn't feel that passionate about it so I lost interested. BU was honestly way less tough then my high school, so I had a lot of free time to focus on what I wanted to do. I took a python, C++, ECT, and DiffEQ class and I pretty much decided that MechE was super boring, so I quit that and decided to double major in ECE after I couldn't stay awake for 8am Thermo classes 3 days a week. I know they're similar.
Right now I'm loving ECE life. FETs are my favorite bounty hunters. I'm in love with software, algorithms, verilog, data structures, ECT, electronics, signals, etc. I'm loving what I do. Anyway thats where I am now. I had many difficulties that seemed like a big deal at the time, but they ended up not mattering in the long run. I think my cumulative GPA is like 3.4-3.8 now, I stopped caring about that after I spent a weekend in panic in my closet after I got a B- on a Statics Exam. 

Some of the difficulties I've had:
I have no sense of direction of what I want to do, but I'm loving ECE, and am looking forward to doing research and discovering myself.
I get super focused on studies and have a hard time making friends, or finding time to go to the gym, or looking for internships, or joining clubs, or playing video games.
My portfolio of projects is slim to non existent. I built a self parallel parking Arduino RC car that is like 90% done if I ever get around to debugging the code.
Don't have a girlfriend, don't think I'd be a very good boyfriend.
Official Caffeine addict.
Etc.

For All those struggling right now especially during finals season, Don't give up! It's all in your perspective! Be positive and go forth.
For High Schoolers thinking about majoring in Engineering: It's pure pain, but you learn to love it and can't dream about doing anything else.


Thanks For listening

Financial aid tells me if I'm finished with my degree they won't give me anymore financial aid. So I have one of two options:

1. Drop my current English class for bullshit reasons and pick up another English class for spring 

2. Add the UF honors course but have to take the seminar in spring and write the thesis in summer. 

To top it off, I still have to petition for my financial aid come December 28. I've hit the maximum amount of credit hours for aid, which is bullshit considering they're counting the 36 I picked up from high school. As someone who comes from a low income family, this sucks when I have to pay my first bills for January and the financial aid I'm used to receiving wont be available until weeks later.

But the dilemma I'm facing is whether or not I should do concurrent enrollment and also take CS61A during the spring as well. It would cost me a whopping $3,000 out of pocket just for these 4 units. It doesn't make sense for me to fully enroll next semester, since as an out-of-state student, it doesn't make sense to pay $17,000+ to take two CS pre-reqs along with classes I don't need to take, when I can just focus my time on these two pre-reqs for less than $3,500.

It's hard for me to decide whether or not it's worth paying this much for CS61A. If I DO take CS61A during the spring, I'll be able to finish CS61BL + Math 1B over the summer, and be prepared for fall-recruiting for summer internships (as a junior).

If I DON'T take CS61A next semester, then I feel like I'll be behind in a way since I'll be taking CS61A + Math 1B during the summer, and then taking CS61B during the fall when the vast bulk of internship recruiting occurs, and I'll be not prepared to recruit till the Spring since I won't be done with CS61B till then. I feel like recruiting in the spring will put me at a disadvantage for finding a good internship (but I might be wrong). HOWEVER, I'll save $3,000 bucks if I don't take CS61A in spring.

---
TL;DR: It all boils down to this: Taking CS61A during the spring will allow me to wrap up CS61BL by the summer before recruiting season, and will give me room to hopefully take an upper-div CS class during the spring of my Junior year, thus making me a stronger candidate for full-time recruiting. My concern is that is that worth $3,000 bucks though? Will I be just as fine wrapping up CS61B during Fall of my Junior year, and start recruiting during the spring? I just want to make the right choices to be the strongest candidate I can be for internships &amp; for full-time recruiting.

This is a long post, but I appreciate the time you took to read through all this.

2ob7m3,1,2014-12-04,"California, ""interned"" at a startup from January to September. I believe I was misclassified as 1099 during my time there. What should I do?",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ob7m3/california_interned_at_a_startup_from_january_to/,"I am a third year Computer Science student. This January 2014, when I was still a second year student, I had my first internship at a travel company startup who's job posting I found on my university's job posting site. The position was for Java Web Development. As a second year student at the time who was eager to get his first internship, I immediately jumped on this opportunity. As an 19 year old at the time, I had no knowledge of how taxes work (1099 vs W-2 employee classification, etc).

The company operated in a very shady manner:
-I interviewed and was brought on board in January. No formal offer letter, no signing anything, it was simply a verbal agreement that I would come in on certain hours to help out on projects.

-I was told from the beginning that I would be paid but every time I would ask about when I would be paid, they would avoid the topic. It wasn't until March when the company finally told me how much they would offer hourly ($12/hour) and they asked me to fill out standard employment forms (I believe I9 and one of the forms that start with a W). I was provided with a timesheet format which I would turn in every week. The timesheet required me to enter a description of the work I performed each day I worked. When I finally received my checks, I noticed no deductions were taken off for tax withholding and I mentioned it to the accountant and she mentioned the word ""contractor"". Not knowing anything about employee classification, I ignored this at the time. I have kept almost, if not all, of my check stubs.

-During the time I was working unpaid, I was learning the company's codebase, learning the technologies needed for the work I was doing, and doing oddjobs for my supervisor and other colleagues (parsing and scraping websites for data, following up on Amazon orders for the CEO, etc). I still have emails archived showing this work.

-I referred some of my friends to my boss and ended up getting two of my non-American friends to come on board. They are both not legally authorized to work in the US and for a period of about 3 months, they worked unpaid. When they finally got paid, they were set up with reloadable gift cards that would be filled monthly by the accountant. The accountant made it clear all the time that these gift cards were ""gifts"" every time they were mentioned to my friends. 


Although I have not yet confirmed, I am 100% sure this employer classified me as 1099 during my time there and when the time comes, I will get a 1099 mailed to me. 

After reading around, I found out that employers save money by classifying employees as 1099. I found out there's a form I can use to report classification and have the IRS deal with it. I am scared of any retaliation from the company by doing this but I truly believe I was misclassified as 1099 and I do not want to get f'd over with taxes.

I would like to do the following:
-not have to 1099 income tax on the roughly $6000 I made while working there
-report this business for the shady things it's done

tl;dr Previous employer misclassified me as 1099 while I interned there. What should I do?"

I feel like my grades won't cut it getting into grad school. I royally screwed myself over by taking a ridiculous amount of classes my freshman year, including a junior level proof based math class and modern physics. I actually did well for a non-physics major in the physics class (average was a C, I got a B both semesters). My cumulative GPA stands at 2.3 up from a 2.0 at my lowest before this semester grades get turned in. 


I just feel like an absolute failure. My grades have improved significantly, 3 As, 2 Bs and 1 C this semester, but that still won't cut it for grad school. Now that I am going to be taking mostly senior/grad level classes next semester, the prospects of getting straight As is really slim. Had I not been an idiot freshman year, I would have a decent GPA by now. 


Now that I am trying to find internships, my GPA is being a major turn off. I feel like my programming skills are diminished compared to my CS major peers, electronics skills can't compare to the EEs, grades are shit. 


I just posted this to mostly vent. All I can do from now is try my hardest and just try to raise my GPA within the 3 more semesters I have. "

Plus I'm frustrated that even if I get into prerequisite classes and get a good grade, I can still get denied to the major. I'm feeling desperate about this. I know there's math CS joint major, but I still prefer the regular CS major than it. Should I just give up on getting into CS and stick with math CS? I'm also worried that if I major in math CS, it'll be less competitive than those students in CS major in terms of getting internships and jobs. "

I've done a couple small programming and web projects in the past, but nothing major by any means.

I took a 4 month QA internship at a company, my boss seemed to like me, and I expressed in programming, as that's my interest.

Before my 4 months was even done, I got extended to 8 and moved straight to smaller tasks on the project, it seems like there it has escalated and the tasks I'm given are bigger and bigger.

I took another 4 month extension of the same job, and its coming to an end. I'm doing everything that a junior dev would do full time in the project.

They offered me a part time job while I'm going to school, and I took that too.

The thing is, I feel like a fake.

Before this, I've never touched a line of Javascript, and the whole project I'm doing is Javascript.

I didn't tell anyone I didn't know Javascript, and no one asked. I just learnt as I went.

I barely know any of the technical details of the language, terms, way things work, etc.

I just am really good at Googling, having an intuition, and knowing where to look to do something.

I'm just always scared I'm doing something wrong, inefficiently, not as clean as it could be, etc.

With my dozens of merges I'm always scared one day its gonna fall apart and it will come to light I have no idea what I'm doing or everything I did was half baked.

I'm I making things worse for myself by throwing myself into this as a regular employee? This project is vital to the company.

Should I become a Javascript expert? Is there anything I should make myself study my butt off about?"

I am a 20 year old high school grad, who recently dropped out of an Indian engineering college. I dropped out because the focus on rote-learning, and the outdated material made me feel like I was wasting my time there. 

I am interested in things like computers, social sciences, military and even being a sailor on some merchant ship. 

I am now very confused at what I want or what I can do. Need advice on the following things -

* What steps can I take to become an Android app developer? Any courses I can attend? Any where I can intern?
* What steps can I take to enter the maritime industry. Intend to work and learn my way up from a lowly deckhand. Any advice on how to find such jobs?
* If possible, I want to study outside India. Any way or place where I can join a good Uni and work part-time to pay my fees? Is it possible for an Indian to join a foreign Uni without bankrupting his family?
* I can not join the Indian military right now as I overshot their age requirements by 5 months(sob). Only way is by being a Uni grad and passing their exams. Not qualified for that too. 

Actually, I just want any opportunity to enter any industry so I can move out of my parents' basement and start my life. I am really scared that time is slipping out of my hands, that I may not be able to get into any career. 

I am really sorry if the post seems haphazard, I am in a very confused state of mind. Any advice will be so helpful to me right now.  "

As students, my co-founder and I have been working on a new mobile app, launching in two weeks in Spain. I am studying in one of the top 5 US schools and I am graduating in one week. After that, I am moving to my home city in Spain, where I will work full time on the startup. I am studying engineering, ranked #1 in my degree, and I have rejected some job offers with very high salaries as a 1st year. I have a passion for technology and entrepreneurship and I really couldn't be more excited about my startup.

I am responsible for all the technical, financial and logistic parts of the company. My co-founder (let's call her Maria), takes care of all the Legal, Marketing and Social Media, which are also very important given the nature of the project. For the last 6 months, I would say I have worked 1.5-2 times as much as Maria in # of hours. That said, she does an awesome job and I am really happy with her. The company was incorporated at 50-50% in September, verbally agreeing that we would rearrange the shares now in December (we are good friends, and I totally trust we will rearrange it). I have also taken care of the funding and we have 8 investors very interested. We are asking for €70k seed funding, which I am almost sure (given the conversations with the investors) that we will raise in the next month.

The problem is that she started her Masters in Law (in Spain) this September. She has been working on the project as a student (probably putting around 20 hours/week on the project), but now the Master requires her to intern in a company for a semester. She already has an offer where she would work from January to May 9am-7pm. After the internship, she will have to study one more semester, until November.

I am trying to convince Maria to drop out or at least postpone her masters, which I don't feel like she is going to do. I understand that if she decides not compromising her masters, I will have to find a substitute for her co-founder position. I have pretty crazy work habits (I average 2 allnighters/week working on my startup), but I know Maria doesn't. Working until 7pm, there is no way she will have the energy to work more than 2 hours a day on the startup.

Even if she dropped out of her masters, I believe I should have a majority. I have worked more, my responsibilities in the company are more important, and my cost opportunity is much bigger than hers. But, in case she DIDN'T drop out, up to what degree should this affect her share and position in the company? Isn't compromise the most important thing in such an early stage? Any recommendations to convince her?

I am due to pay that back starting in august 2015.

working (the off season right now) about once every week to once every two weeks making 225 s day. I also intern for free (to complete school and further my career 9-5, monday-friday)
on average thats 675-900 a month
quit my part time job so i can work on my career in spare time.
I live at home still.

jut purchased a $4,000 camera - I am in the film industry, i want to be a DOP. to be a DOP I need to make my own films/music videos/ect.. to have reels so i can get jobs. a lot of jobs I've been getting require me to have my own equipment. in my eyes this was a good long term investment (cheeper than renting equipment)

I also just got plane tickets to go to Europe. yes, this is not a good move for money but all my live I've just wanted to travel. Europe trip will run me $3,000 including plane tickets, hostels, and food.

I have a phone bill of $120 a month. which i am going to lower to $40-60


account including Europe fund - roughly 3,900
monthly bills/spending
$120 phone
$50 food (I realize this is low. I am frugal. I rarely eat out)
$100 alcohol (i like beer)
$30 smokes (trying to quit)
$200 miscellaneous (clothing, transportation($20), vet bills, ect...)
total monthly cost: $500
total monthly savings: $175-400
after Europe trip money: $900 left in account
(work will pick up in the summer (june when Im back from Europe till august.) I will be hopefully making around $1,300 a month which will bring my savings in the summer up to around 800 a month)
estimated savings by august 2015: 3,100-4,000

interest on student loan:3.5


I quit my shitty part time job and may look for another one once my internship is up. however i leave for the month of may for Europe so that may not go well with an employer.


How do i pay off my student loan so i can have minimal interest while still having fun (movies, galleries, drinks)?
do i pay a large sum at the beginning of what i save (3,000) to avoid racking up interest?

do i just pay it off gradually like everyone else?

2odnbs,632,2014-12-05,"I can't find the power button, just send a tech!",Abstruse,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2odnbs/i_cant_find_the_power_button_just_send_a_tech/,"I’m working as contract helpdesk and SPOC for a large financial firm. It’s 24/7 support but, because they’re a multinational company, there’s actual need for round-the-clock coverage since just as the Sydney and Hong Kong offices are wrapping up their days, the London, Paris, and Glasgow offices are opening. This particular story takes place on Labor Day which is a holiday in the United States but not other countries. Company policy stated that you couldn’t force an employee to work on a company holiday because most of the company’s other clients were US-based government, military, and corporate and typically closed on American holidays. Because only two of us were stupid enough to volunteer for double-time pay, we were down from five agents and a supervisor to just the two of us.

Issue #1: There’s a minor outage on some program that about half the company uses. The guy who maintains that server is stuck in traffic and no one else has access to restart the process.

Issue #2: There’s typically a spike in calls on Monday morning as everyone calls in the problems they had Friday but didn’t want to bother getting on with the helpdesk about right before the weekend.

Issue #3: Patches get pushed out on Saturdays, and the system they used had a tendency to crash about a quarter of the computers updated, so users are greeted Monday morning with a BSOD.

Issue #4: Every single employee of this company has a grandiose job title. The lowest level job title (aside from contractors and interns) was Vice President.

Note: Because we’re contractors, we use one ticket logging program. The onsite technicians (who are employees of the financial company) use a different ticket system. Our system integrates with theirs and tickets are automatically forwarded, but it can take a few minutes to update.

And this led to the perfect storm that got someone fired.

The call came in from Entitled Receptionist (henceforth abbreviated ERB…I’ll let you figure out where the extra letter comes from on your own).

&gt;Me: Thank you for calling AwesomeCorp Helpdesk, this is Abstruse. How can I help you?

&gt;ERB: I need you to send someone up right away!

&gt;Me: What seems to be the problem?

Time skip as I spend a full two minutes (with calls piling up in the queue) to get her to tell me that the computer has a blue screen.

&gt; Me: Oh, that’s a simple fix. You just—
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Send someone up right now!
&gt; 
&gt; Me: All you have to do is restart the computer and—
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Are you dense? Send someone up right now! I don’t have time for this! I’m the receptionist for Vice President Decentguy and every second my computer is down, this company is losing thousands of pounds!
&gt; 
&gt; Me: If it’s that important, we can get you fixed in under a minute. All you have to do is turn the computer off and back on again.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Ugh! Just send up a technician!
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Can you just try restarting it? There’s a power button on the front of the tower. If you hold it in for 10 seconds, the computer will turn off.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Ugh! Fine! &lt;8 seconds later&gt; I can’t find no button! Get someone—
&gt; 
&gt; Me: There’s two buttons on the front of your computer, one big one and one small one with a half-circle on it glowing green. Hold in the green one.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Ugh! &lt;seven seconds later&gt; Now the screen’s off you idiot! Get someone up here to fix it now!
&gt; 
&gt; Me: That’s what’s supposed to happen. Just push that button again and you’ll be all set.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: I can’t find any power button!
&gt; 
&gt; Me: It’s…it’s the button you just pushed. Ten seconds ago.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: There’s no button on the front! Just send someone up now!

At this point, I’ve been on the call for 10 minutes and there’s now a dozen calls in the queue. My co-worker has taken three calls in the time I’ve dealt with this one. While ERB is exaggerating, there are people who work for the company who, if they’re cut off from their computers or phones, they *can* lose the company thousands of pounds a minute. So I decide screw it.

&gt; Me: I’m forwarding this ticket to the onsite IT. Someone will be with you as soon as they’re available to turn your computer back on.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Finally! If you knew how to do your jobs, then—
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I am also making a note on the ticket that you refused to complete troubleshooting and demanded a service call.
&gt; 
&gt; ERB: Whatever. Just get them down here now!

So ERB is off my phone finally. I take another two calls, reset an AD password (which takes me exactly 90 seconds including verifying the customer logs in successfully, I’ve timed myself) and explain to someone that they’d have to submit a formal request to increase their mailbox size through their supervisor (and no, I can’t make an exception just this one time). So I take the next call in queue.

&gt;ERB: I’ve been waiting for fifteen minutes! Where’s that tech?!

&gt;Me: It’s been four minutes. The ticket has been filed and the technician will be with you soon.

&gt;ERB: Ugh! Hurry up! This company is losing money every minute!

So she hangs up. I take another call, another blue screen. This person actually knows how to find a button they pressed ten seconds previously, and it goes smoothly. The call takes longer to log than it does to walk them through it and I’m finishing up when my co-worker turns to me.

&gt;Other Overworked Tech: Hey, did you talk to ERB?

&gt;Me: What?

&gt;OOT: She’s calling about the status of a ticket and I’m not seeing it in the system.

&gt;Me: I sent it like eight minutes ago. Refresh HEAT.

&gt;OOT: There it is. Wait, are you $&amp;#%ing kidding me?

&gt;Me: No, that’s the ticket.

&gt;OOT: Jeeze…

So he tells ERB that the technician is on the way and will contact her soon, as well as telling her that she doesn’t need to check on the status again unless it’s been more than twenty minutes. However, three minutes later.

&gt;Me: Thank you for calling—

&gt;ERB: *It’s been half a bloody hour where is my technician!?!*

&gt;Me: No ma’am, it’s been exactly thirteen minutes. I’m looking at your ticket right now and—

&gt;ERB: You liar! Do you understand how much money you’ve lost this company you idiot?! Get me a technician to fix the problem you caused right now!

&gt;Me: The ticket is in the system and—

&gt;ERB: I don’t care about any &amp;@#$ing ticket you @#$%! Get me my technician now!

&gt;Me: This is your only warning to cease using abusive language or I will end this call and it will—

&gt;ERB: That’s just @&amp;#^$ now get me my technician! &lt;hangs up&gt;

She proceeded to call in two more times, getting more and more abusive. The first supervisor got to the office at 7 AM (four hours after all this madness). I reported to him immediately what happened. He pulled the recordings, then forwarded them to our HR, their HR, and her department head. Later, I talked to the tech who took the on-site call. He says she started spewing obscenities at him the second he walked in the door. He didn’t say a word, pushed the power button, marked the ticket closed, and walked straight to their HR. 

Apparently, our three complaints (one for each of us at the helpdesk and one from the on-site tech) were her fourth, fifth, and sixth complaints at abusing people in other departments. Her defense was that she was more important than them so should be able to “boss them around a bit” if they’re not doing their jobs. Fired on the spot.

TL;DR: User’s losing “thousands of pounds a minute” because she can’t do her job of screening her boss’s calls and playing Farmville due to a BSOD. Is able to find the power button to turn it off, but can’t find it to turn it back on. Screams at us over seven “status check” calls in about twenty minutes, screams at the tech, gets fired.

**Replaceable parts**

Hello! My name is Fexeran! I will be your guide through the human history section of this museum.

Humans joined the council later than most species, not for lack of technology, they had been travelling the stars for many years before we met them, it was simply distance they told us, and their star maps confirmed it. Even now their home world probably doesn't know of the human’s activity here their territory is simply that vast... 

I’m not here to talk about their rapid expansion or technology...well I guess I’m explaining a single point of it. It begins with my travels to Prime, the humans ‘core-world’ within council space. Since they don’t have a nearby home world there species is controlled by the core-world councils which in turn send off their decisions to some emperor. Anyway, when I went there I expected a world of luxury strata-scrapers and solar cruise ships hosting to the needs of the elite. Instead I came across an industrial powerhouse, factories rested onto of houses which rested onto of travel lines which rested on top of power generators on top of mines, which intern were being used as more housing. On the contrary most of their surface was actually taken up by greenery and plant life to feed and provide oxygen for the gargantuan population.

Not what I expected, but it got slightly weirder. The average human was just that, average... two arms, two legs, all 10 fingers and toes, the occasional missing tooth. Nowhere were there cripples or injured. People did have bandages over cuts but not a single human was missing something due to accident. I spoke to one who took pride in showing off his tenta-arm made from free moving, controllable, strings of metal... he was also being escorted by security so he obviously had the funds to pay for such an augment but it still struck me as odd that humans in general were not injuring themselves, even when I saw a worker carried off in a stretcher blood pumping from a chest cavity, he did not die...in fact when I checked the news later that day I saw him as a minor text addition detailing a ‘minor’ incident and that he was back to work in time to finish his shift.

So I began digging. Not in there mine’s, I began asking questions and it turns out humans experimented with cloning and gene alteration from ages gone by and mostly through illegal or unsanctioned use of the technology perfected it to the point where a man could have new organs grown within minutes of an injury, or choose to have it augmented for free! There augments were encased under existing flesh or had grafts attached to hide them allowing the human to ‘fit in’ should he desire. Hence my lack of understanding beforehand, they could hide it.

Needless to say I told everyone I could when I went back home. A few were understandably outraged, their religion or ethics standing firmly against such augmentation and modification. When I first heard about it I was mortified as well but seeing how...ordinary... it was made me re-think my ethic of the situation. After all why retire at with 30% of your remaining life span as a cripple, why not buy or grow the body of an athlete for yourself.

They hadn’t managed to transfer consciousness to new brain tissue yet but could replace damaged tissue at loss of memory.

Eventually my message reached some really important people within their respective species and a council was called. Three separate species demanded to know the extent of ‘unholy sacrilege of self’ and another four wanted to know the answer to the similar question “why the hell would anyone willingly cut off their own arm?” although it was more along the lines of “how many of your own people do you butcher in the name of progress!”

In response the human representative detached there right arm and leg to demonstrate the extent of her own modifications. She also stated that at the young age of 35 she had been in an accident and as a result most of her torso was rebuilt. Needless to say the religious zealots of the council demanded holy war whilst the others wanted to put the humans under ‘external governance’ to stop the rampant misuse of technology. They got outvoted on both counts so independently declared war against the humans.

That’s probably the first mistake for the religious zealots of the galaxy, believing in pure of soul and body is all well and good until half your army is missing a limb or two whilst human soldiers using mechanical arms that can literally be swapped around as needed keep charging back to the front lines. Space was a remarkably even match up...the combined efforts of 7 species could hold their own against the humans ship for ship unfortunately as each ship fell about 20% of their crews survived well enough to continue service against the average 60% that the humans claimed.

Replaceable parts...

So able to out survive, out produce and eventually outnumber their opponents the humans won the war. I even served as a medic during the second invasion led by the ‘external governance force’. not once was I injured seriously...it might have been because I had a habit of heading off to human lines whenever I got injured but no one bothered to check. Needless to say, without the religious zealously to keep them going the governance force was pushed back as well leaving the humans with plenty of new technology and valuable resources in the form of peace treaties.

So there we are, a brief overview of how the humans defended themselves against the ‘zealot-core’ and later against the ethical governance forces, they never stuck to a name long enough.

Allow me to introduce you to one of the humans I met during the war. Due to brain damage he no longer remembers his name, we call him Gerald because someone stencilled that onto his exo-armour. Say hello Gerald.

“Even in death...I still serve.”

Silly Gerald. Now onto the next section detailing human conflicts against a species known as the necrons! Come along Gerald!

I have my first round of technical interviews coming up for a summer internship at a big company in SV. I've had a few local internships before and work at a startup, and most of those asked generic HR kind of questions and some simplistic technical questions that someone who took a discrete class and some CS101 could answer.

As I've researched before through glassdoor and various sites, most of the interviews seemed to be focusing around programming questions dealing with data structures. I am just finishing my sophmore year and have not had a data structures class until next semester.

I have pretty solid work experience both in CS and in the Army prior, but that has left little time for me to venture out from a programming standpoint outside of my daily work tasks and class assignments.

Does anyone have knowledge of this process or participated in a lower college level interview? Do you think I am setting myself up for failure in these interviews by not having a strong base for data structures and more advanced programming techniques, or will they be geared toward my expected knowledge level and hopefully take in some of my previous experience into account?

The development team is about 6 members including myself. Recently the lead programmer pulled me aside and asked me to start thinking of what kind of salary I would be looking for because he needs to talk to the boss and wants to bring me on full time. After talking for a while the lead programmer started bringing up that a lot of the current devs got hired on around 30k and that after 3 years I could easily be making 50k. I know the Midwest isn’t the most happening place for software development but those figures seem quite low.  Now I’m not done with school until August and I’m assuming I would be brought on as an entry level developer. I’m also assuming that these two circumstances would be their points on why the salary may be lower than expected. Even for those circumstances to me it just seems low. Just wondering if anyone here has experience with Midwest, MN and WI, smaller company developer salaries and if I should may be looking else for my entry level position.

How do I stop this?,mit_postdoc_climate,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2oi6fr/i_hating_myself_and_wanting_to_do_awful_things_to/,"Basically, did OK in high school, expected to go to my local shitty state school. Applied to a few reaches, didn't get into the first or second (I'm Chinese with parents that don't care and  I have a &lt; 800 Math II), but a classmate got into the second. Still super pissed about that, even though he didn't go, because I wasted about $400 of my parent's money on an endeavor that didn't get me anywhere. 

Not only that, I didn't get *shit* in finaid or scholarships. My parents are paying full in state sticker price, and I feel guilty as fuck. 

Now I'm here, at a state school that is even shittier than I previously thought, that can't even transfer because of not-good grades caused by me dwelling on the past (and me being a moron, that too). The culture is completely different from my interests, despite being an engineering school - we have a disturbing amount of neckbeards that want to do my major (CS) because they like gaming, not because they like theory. Its hard to find people with common interests.   That, and I think its hurting my internship chances - I seem to be put through screens people at nicer universities aren't, and I can't even get into the hackathons I want to attend.

2oi7tv,5,2014-12-06,The Spelling Lesson,hangman_throwaway,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2oi7tv/the_spelling_lesson/,"When you work with children, you learn to ignore a lot of things that would be terrifying coming from adults. Imaginary friends, acting like an animal all day, random threats, these are all actually pretty common, especially with younger ones. One colleague I know said that she once had an otherwise lovely and sweet little girl smile up at her and say she wanted to eat someone’s skin. Yeah, yeah, kids say the darndest things and all. So maybe I’m just being paranoid, but this seems creepier than normal kid behavior.

I’m a first-year Special Education teacher. Right now I’m in a general education 2nd grade classroom with 5 students with IEPs (Individual Education Plans). These are the kids that get services through the special ed program. All of our kids are mainstreamed, mostly kids with ADHD or learning disabilities like dyslexia. Their a bit behind, but are keeping up pretty well, and get along fine socially with the general ed. kids. Except for Chris. 

Chris is a recent transfer with Autism Spectrum Disorder who was placed in my class. I was excited to have him, because I focused a lot on ASD in my internship, but Chris is a peculiar case. He does have a lot of the characteristics of ASD; he doesn’t socialize very well, he likes to spin in circles, and he doesn’t handle changes to his schedule well. He also is very sensitive to bright lights and sudden noises. 

But he acts remarkably differently from other cases of ASD sometimes. When there’s a bright light or sudden noise, he doesn’t tantrum or hit at himself like most children with ASD do when their in sensory overload. He *glares* at whoever caused it, completely silently, completely still, for as long as 5 minutes afterwards. And it doesn’t matter where he his when it happens. Once he was walking toward the back of the classroom to sharpen his pencil when I accidentally dropped a book at my desk near the front of the room. He stopped walking and whipped his head around instantly to stare at me. He just stood there with his head twisted back over his shoulder as far as he could look and his body still facing forward, like an owl or something, as I picked up the book sheepishly. I had to physically go to him to get him moving again. Who knows how long he would have stayed like that, glaring hatefully at the noise.  

Another thing, he has this habit taking his pencil during desk work and tracing it up and down his arms, following the lines of his veins. That’s not totally weird, plenty of kids have self-stimulation activities, but this feels different. It feels like it has a purpose, like he’s...feeling for something? I don’t know. Anyways, he was a bit weird in some of his behaviors, but otherwise was a normal enough kid. He struggled with some subjects in school, particularly language arts skills, so he can be less than enthusiastic in those classes. Which is where this story starts:

We were doing our weekly spelling lesson, and this week I wanted to add a game for the kids to try to bump up engagement (and hopefully scores). I decided we would play spelling word hangman. Looking back, this was probably a terrible idea; the kind of thing some helicopter parent would see and complain about me introducing the children to violence. What can I say; I’m young and inexperienced and I remember the game from my own schooldays. In fairness, all of the kids were having a blast playing. We did a few rounds together as a class on the whiteboard, then I had the kids pair up with their notebooks and play in teams. They would take turns drawing and guessing. Again, everything seemed to be going well. I worked with some of our lower-level readers on their games because they needed extra help, and generally wasn’t focused on Chris at all. Until Amber walked up to me after the activity.

Amber was the little girl I had assigned to work with Chris. She’s bright, bubbly, and social, and I thought she might bring him out of his shell a bit and get him to work hard on the lesson. She was anything but bubbly when she approached me. I’d never seen her so pale and quiet as when she wordlessly handed me Chris’s journal, open to the hangman game. 

At first I didn’t look at it. I asked Amber what was wrong instead. Her lip trembled, and she said that Chris’s picture was scary and that he was mean to her. I asked what she meant. She said that the whole time they played hangman he didn’t say a word, until it was his turn to draw. Amber says that every time she guessed a letter wrong, he would laugh. It made her upset, and the more upset and flustered she got, the more letters she missed. Amber said he laughed and laughed the whole time. Then when the hangman was finished, he looked up at Amber and finally spoke. She said he kept whispering “you lose, you lose” over and over again, until I called for them to clean up.

Now echolalia (repeating the same phrase over and over again) is pretty common in kids with ASD. It can be unnerving if you’re not used to it, but it’s normal enough behavior. What wasn’t normal was that apparently he made eye contact with Amber. Chris NEVER makes eye contact with the other students, it’s a struggle to get him to make eye contact with teachers even with prompting. I told Amber I would talk to Chris about being a sore winner, then sent her off to get her things ready for lunch. It was only then that I glance at the drawing. I could see what she meant about it being scary.

[Here it is](http://imgur.com/a/qziTw)

At first I thought it was Slenderman, which all the kids seem to be fascinated with these days, but I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to be a woman in the drawing. I guess those are birds, crows or vultures or something, around the top. The thing is though, I have no idea what word he’s spelling at the bottom. We’re working on the “gh” blend this week:  high and right, etc. When I let the kids out to go to lunch, I took Chris aside to talk privately for a minute.

“Did you have fun during Spelling today, Chris?” I asked, hopeful smile in place. It honestly depends on the day how verbally expressive Chris is. I got a shrug as an answer, which isn’t great, but at least he’s responding.


“I looked at the game you and Amber played”. A flicker of interest came into his eyes. “You added a lot of details to your drawing”, I hesitated a moment, “um, do you know why the man’s arms are so long?”. 


Now he finally answered “They hanged her up by her arms up so that her would say, so they got stretched out” (Chris sometimes mixes up pronouns, he meant “so she would say”).


Now I was really confused, “Say what, Chris?”


“Say what her could do with the birds. What him did to make her do it.”


“...what did she say?”


Now he smiled, “Her didn’t. So they hanged her by her neck like you showed us”


I winced. That would sound bad to parents. “Chris, this was just a game to learn spelling. It isn’t about real people. It-”


“I’m missing lunch, teacher”. What could I say to that, I had to let him go. Later, I’ll try to bring up him scaring Amber.

During lunch/planning, I was able to do a little research. What he described sounded like strappado, which was an old torture practice. It seems it was rumored to have been used at Salem during the witch trials, where several young women were hanged for suspected witchcraft. So that’s one mystery solved, at least. God only knows where he heard about strappado from, but parents seem more lax nowadays. I know fourth graders who watch The Walking Dead. Still though, who was “Her”, and who was “Him”? What could “her” make the birds do?

What on Earth was he trying to spell?"

So I'm a junior (entering spring semester) biology major right now, with like a 3.6 on the predental track. I'm slowly beginning to have second thoughts tho, especially when considering the insane cost/time needed for dental school (plus the fact that I have no idea if I'll even get in). I was thinking about switching to comp sci. 


I currently go to state university (its only like 9k a year, plus I have some scholarship/tuition remission so I'd pay like 5k a year). Switching/finishing comp sci would put me at like 5.5-6 years of college (total).


I've always been interested in technology and actually tried to pick up coding randomly throughout my past semesters (always ended up dropping it because of how much bio work I had to do). I really liked it in highschool and honestly, I still regret not atleast trying it out earlier.

Do you guys think its still worth it to switch? I've heard many different things about switching this late and finding internships when I'm already 21/22. Also, starting salaries seem to change a lot. What do you guys think? I'm just so unsure of what I want to do right now, and I don't really know how to break it to my parents that I'd be switching away from dentistry this late. "

Computer security vs NET programming?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ojeio/what_class_to_take_computer_security_vs_net/,"Hey guys! I am choosing my upper division CS classes and I have a choice between ""Intro to computer security"" and ""Application programming using .NET"". Here are the descriptions:


**Intro to computer security:**

Controlling the risk of computer security.  Security threats and vulnerabilities in the development and use of computer systems.  Tools and controls that can reduce or block these threats.  Law, privacy and ethics.



**Application program using .NET:**

A rigorous introduction to enterprise application development utilizing the .NET environment. Topics include GUI interface concepts, multithreading, collections and web forms as well as application interfaces to database, web services and networks. The course will have intensive individual projects as well as a team project. 


----------------------

I am pretty interested in computer security. The thing is, the professor for security has pretty bad reviews (old reviews). A student I talked to said his class is ""excellent"". After further research, I discovered the professor specializes in information cryptography so I guess security is his strong point.


The professor for the other class is one of the best professors on campus and worked for IBM back in the day, I've had him before and he was solid.


What do you guys think would be more useful in general for finding an internship? Is knowing security impressive, or is learning application programming in NET more useful?

&amp;nbsp;

After a long final semester at school, I have finally received a job offer in the location I've wanted (Chicago). However, it is in a C# .NET developer position in which I have no experience in. A little background on me, I have a double major in Computer Science and Computer Engineer. A lot of my school work and past internship has been in Java, C++, and embedded work.

My main question being will this job be potentially useless if I decided web development wasn't my thing after a year or so? Could I still easily switch to embedded field or should I keep looking for jobs? Is C# and .NET work frustrating? I will of course keep doing embedded work as a hobby at home because the engineer in me finds it very interesting.

As for the job offer, I do have some interest in the product and problem set it has to offer. I also believe the company has a lot of growth. Plus the 70k+ salary is pretty nice. 

Any insight from you guys would be appreciated! Especially from others that faced this dilemma early in on your career."

I feel like I'd be happier working at a job to support myself while polishing the skills I need to get into a tech career like data science, which I have recently found really interesting. My major is computer science with a security focus and mathematics and I'm still considered a sophomore by my standing. I want to do some of these things regardless of whether I continue classes nest semester or not:  
  
* I plan on reviving my old GitHub account and start writing articles again on an old blog I had a year or so ago.
* I'm currently cruising along in the Data Scientist's Toolbox class on Coursera.  
* I've got an IT internship from 2012 sitting on my resume where I learned networking monitoring &amp; management, some jQuery, help desk things, and improved teamwork capabilities (like Scrum). Probably could obtain my A+ cert with that knowledge.  
* Improve my programming skills (Java, C++, Python)  
    
Is there anything else I can do to make myself not look like a slacker like my transcript/resume probably says when I approach possible employers or when I am networking in the field? I also feel like starting a related project once I figure out what I am going to do with next semester by talking to my adviser soon. The reason I'm iffy on continuing college is that I am about to exhaust my Pell Grant which would take a big chunk of money and make finishing my degree too expensive."

I do need advice but I also want to vent. Edit: please don't mistake any of this as a plea for pity. I take full responsibility for my situation and I'm really just trying to better my state.

I need a job. 

I’m 24 and, apart from obtaining a B.A. in political science from UCLA, I have almost completely failed to be a part of society. I’ve never had a job; I didn’t do internships in college; I’ve never done any volunteering; I did no extracurricular activities in college; I graduated with a very poor GPA; I have no friends. After graduating a little over a year ago, I decided to take 6 months off to make art before I even tried to get a job (completely irrational from an economic  perspective, I know). It was a personal success, but since then my attempts to reintegrate into society have faltered under a haze of drug abuse (it’s bad but not crippling), defeatism and social isolation (I’m actually sociable and have an easy time finding new people to hang out with but I find it almost impossible to maintain relationships). I got into this situation owing to mental instability and a troubled personal history, but that’s irrelevant insofar as I need a job regardless.

Over the past months, I've sent out a ton of resumes, applying to everything from technical writing internships to entry level white collar jobs in finance to stocker positions at grocery stores. I went to job fairs at UCLA. So far I’ve gotten 1 interview and no offers. I suppose this is unsurprising; my resume is almost empty, I have a year-long employment gap, and I have literally no references to give. I have no friends to recommend me for positions and family isn’t in a position to help either. Suffice it to say that I’m desperate.


So … questions:

1)	Would a certificate program help my situation at all re employability? There’s a few from the UCLA extension that seem appealing, like Information Technology Management. But I don’t know whether certificates could actually help if you don’t even have references, much less relevant connections.

2)	How difficult would it be for someone in my position to get a job related to programming/IT? I actually know how to program fairly well. I’ve been doing it for years, I took classes in it that I did well it, and I’m knowledgeable enough that I've read half of the standard CS undergrad textbooks (I'm an autodidact and I'm prone to obsessive interests), and I’ve studied and can implement some fairly advanced algorithms (the sort of stuff you learn from grad school textbooks). I’ve also done projects that involved stuff from information retrieval, data analysis, natural language processing, etc. I haven’t pursued programming because I eventually realized it wasn’t for me and because I figured that without a CS degree or connections it would be difficult to get hired, but atm if I thought there was a real chance of it I’d give it a shot.

Also, I know I should attempt to volunteer so need to point that out."
2omhq1,13,2014-12-08,Be honest with me -- Am I screwed?,AnonymousSeniorUGrad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2omhq1/be_honest_with_me_am_i_screwed/,"So, I am very close to being done with my degree from a very large state school in the midwest (you would probably guess it correctly on your first guess), I have a few project level, senior courses left to take.

This semester was very, very rough for me.  I completed a 20-hour/week internship (very successfully, I might add, at least I have that going for me) and taking courses full time, and I took 2 notoriously difficult courses with professors that are known to fail about half of their class each semester.  My parents got a divorce, I had to help them move out from their home, my car's transmission blew out and I couldn't pay for it, my girlfriend broke up with me and then wanted to get back together--Basically, life fucking happened to me so far this year.  I was just insanely busy and stressed out the whole semester, often pulling all-nighters 3-4 times a week for various reasons, not the least of which was school. But honestly, even just typing those excuses just pisses me off, that is unacceptable in my opinion.  It is 100% my fault for failing the courses, AI in particular I could have studied more for and managed my studies better.

Long story short, I'm about to fail 2 of my core CS courses this semester, operating systems and artificial intelligence.  I need like a 96% on both finals to get a C- or higher.  This means my GPA is about to fall below a 3.0 for the first time in my academic career.  It will be probably around a 2.9.  I am extremely distraught about this because my parents pay for my college, and they will probably cut me off from paying for it after they find out, etc.  I am willing to accept responsibility for my failure and get student loans for my remaining 2 semesters to graduate, that is fine, it won't be a huge loan, and it will motivate me to take as many courses as possible and ace them and graduate as soon as possible.  

However, I'm terrified as to what my job prospects will be now, after graduation.  Will a company really want to hire a noobie grad from a state university with below a 3.0?  I have internship and personal project experience in a multitude of programming languages, techniques, etc.  I completed 2 internships and did nice projects in each of them (an e-commerce website, and a medium to large application used annually by about 500 clients).  

Am I screwed?  Some of my friends graduated in sciences (chemistry) last year and were not able to secure good jobs, having to work in construction.  I'm not even athletic enough to work construction so if I were to graduate I'd probably be back to my high school work of mowing lawns, which really doesn't pay much.  "

My biggest fear has been never having a good time at college. I feel like I will just be forever depressed if I spend the last years of college being forever alone. At this point, everyone already has their friend groups and I would have a much better chance rerolling the dice and trying again next fall.

I am majoring in CS and am looking for a spring internship to have an excuse to to take time off again to work on myself. I've blown 2 interviews so far and I am not too sure I will be able to get an internship.
I have alright credentials, enough to get an interview for QA/IT jobs but not enough to get an interview for good software engineer/dev jobs. I would need a job that pays &gt;=$15/hr in order to be able to afford rent for this option to work. 

Otherwise, I would be staying at my parent's place in the middle of nowhere with no way of meeting anyone new and hoping that I will be able to get an internship in the city in the summer.


What do you guys think about taking a semester off again? I really don't know what I will do after graduating without making a single friend here. I know it will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

If I do graduate college without making any friends, I know that I will resign myself to being a forever alone for the rest of my life. I will end up playing video games and watching anime 24/7 to distract myself from my misery.

* Working knowledge about IT related concepts, such as programming, networking, ERP systems, hardware/software etc.
* The most reputable job I've held was an Account Manager position at a friend's HR company. Held job interviews, managed payroll, day-to-day management etc.

I don't feel I'm completely green when it comes to alot of necessary skills, but I know I am not nearly as advanced as the star players in the field.

First. A little background information:

I have a B.S in Biology, but focused primarily in Ecology, I also have a minor in Geology.

Issues I have with this is that while I have some experience using chemical lab techniques, I didn't focus in any of them, meaning I don't have enough experience using PCR, western blot tests, etc as part of a job. I don't even know where to go to gain that knowledge without going back to college...again.

The geology minor is also not enough for me to apply for geology based entry level positions, even though I have the primary requisite skills. I just have yet to have any working knowledge in the field.

I've worked as a fisheries lab technician at my school for a number of years in an animal research lab, I've also done lab work at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center as a paleontology assistant, and botany field tech respectively. The last internship I had was earlier this year in Cambridge, UK as an Avian Sciences field tech.

The problem is that most of my experiences beyond academia have been too short, for the most part each internship lasted barely over a month. And even still, all I was doing really was taking notes and filing it away in Excel; not exactly resume worthy accomplishments

So here I am trying to figure out I am supposed to do in order to get out of a retail job, a job that is sucking my life away as I type. I feel I have alot to offer, but it doesn't even seem I'm eligible for volunteer positions, let alone internships.

So what do I want to do?

I will be happy in just about any form of science-based position. I have the most experience as a lab tech, and I enjoyed that tremendously. I would also like, at some point, to work at a research lab as an actual researcher, but I know that has to wait till I can afford a masters program.

I have experience as an animal lab tech, should I front the cost and get certified at the AALAS (American Association for Laboratory Animal Science)? Is that an important certification to have?

I am seriously considering paying for one of those multi-thousand dollar ""internship experiences"" advertised around the net because so far it seems those are the only ones that may actually give me a chance to gain real experience. Should I? Has anyone actually went through one?

As for networking, I have been out of school for over a year now, and I've lost touch with most of my college friends. LinkedIn is pointless as I don't know anyone on it, and honestly I can't find myself just cold-calling random people and seeing if they want to link to me. I will if advised but it doesn't sit well.

So I'm kinda stuck in a nowhere zone here. I can't afford to live on my own because the jobs I have been training for I can't seem to land, and the job I can land doesn't pay enough for anything.

Any advice, any at all would be greatly appreciated. While I would love help from fellow biologists, I am completely open to anyone else. I can also offer my resume for critique and questions as well.

Thank you for anyone who's read this post, and especially any who can give me some pointers.

-Cheers

For the moment, I'm desperately trying to avoid having to check my e-mail. I'm sure I will have e-mails from my bosses (I have two part-time jobs) about why I have yet to submit not only my latest timecards but also paperwork I should have finished on Friday. I am also trying to distract myself from my latest research endeavor, namely, looking up how one might go about obtaining a gun (I live in the southeastern United States, if that tells you anything).

But as far as this post is concerned, I’m not exactly looking for advice or even comfort. I guess I just want to share how my last few weeks have been. I know that despair can sometimes breed an urge to give yourself something to do that in some way validates your misery, so maybe by reading this someone can briefly distract themselves from their own troubles. Maybe someone can say “Hey, me too.” Maybe I’ll feel a little better by the time I’ve finished my diatribe. Maybe my brain won’t feel as heavy, as the last few weeks my mind has felt as though it’s been wrapped in a dripping towel, muffling the outside world.

I have a few (somewhat irrational) concerns about posting here:

* that someone from my personal life will recognize me based on the details I share.

* that some reading this might roll their eyes and think, *really? You’re this distraught over a fucking breakup? Over your parent’s divorce? Over graduate school? Fuck you, come back when you’re unemployed or addicted to drugs, you entitled bitch.* (I often tell myself this anyway).

* that people will think because I am a woman, my life is inherently easier than that of men. It’s really curious to me how much I see people on SW bemoan their gender, as though being a woman is so much easier than being a man, under the pretense that women control sex. While SW isn’t the place for my feminist preaching, in a way these arguments hurt my feelings: what am I doing wrong if women are supposed to be more emotionally advantaged than men? As a somewhat attractive person, I have little doubt that I could get sex from plenty of people, so does it make me inherently bratty and entitled to want more? Finding relationships has not really been a problem for me, but getting a guy to stick around after he’s fucked me a few times as used me as an emotional tampon to absorb his pain and problems is impossible after a few short months. But I’m getting ahead of myself here… 

I used to comment on others’ posts here under a different account, often sharing my own experiences with suicide and self-harm. I’ve attempted suicide once before in my life, as a senior in high school, and I realize that alone has significantly increased my chances of more attempts. I am now in my early 20s, and have not even so much as self-harmed since I was 18. However, the voice in the back of your mind telling you that you still have suicide as an option never goes away when you’ve made the serious decision to kill yourself at least once. I think this is part of the reason so many people see suicide as taboo: it is always an option, at all times, for almost anyone. A close friend and mentor once told me that she knew she needed to seek help for her depression when, as she was carrying groceries into her house in the middle of the day, she stopped in her tracks and thought “I could kill myself.”

I guess I should also share a few brief facts about me, for those who are curious: **I am not on any kind of medication at this time; not even birth control. I live alone. I am currently in therapy, and in fact have an appointment tomorrow morning. I have never been formally diagnosed with a mental illness. My mother suffers from severe bipolar disorder. I am physically healthy.**

Most of my friends and family live far away from me. Graduate school has been an altogether unfulfilling, grueling experience. While I’ve always had a passion for learning, I feel like grad school has been a big waste of my time. I started grad school young, taking my first grad class at 19 before enrolling as a full-time student at 20. While my cohort is polite and not hostile towards me, I feel entirely disconnected from them. There are only about 15 of us, and when I try to engage any of the others in conversation I feel like the awkward seventh-grader I used to be. Being the youngest person in my program, coupled with the fact that I come from a low-income background and am therefore poorly groomed for my pedigreed school, makes me stick out like a sore thumb. I have next to no motivation to do my assignments. This semester I got by without doing almost any of the readings for the one seminar I was enrolled in. I have a paper due this week that I am widely unqualified to write, and while I have written papers with even less preparation than this one, the thought of even starting it seems impossibly out of reach for me.

Things took a drastic turn for the worst a few weeks ago when my boyfriend dumped me. (I still can’t shake the irrational, chilling fear that he’ll find this). We were wildly in love with one another, but he still goes to my undergrad school in my former city—a ten-hour drive. He’s younger than me by two years, but seemed committed to making our relationship work. The breakup came out of nowhere. I won’t bore you with the details of our relationship, but I will say that apart from the distance we had next to no problems. I moved mountains for this guy—I bought him plane tickets for two separate visits (one of which will go unused), and made the ten-hour drive there and back in a weekend because I knew he was depressed and missed me. After I returned, I immediately went to work for eight hours, came home and slept for a while, then got up and went to work the next morning. When I came home that afternoon, I found a breakup letter waiting for me in my facebook messenger inbox. What followed was an entirely humiliating, sickening experience in which we wept on Skype with one another for the entire afternoon and evening. He felt sorry for me because he knew I had no one to call and was entirely alone in my apartment, crying and vomiting. I told him that night that I would call him again the next day after I had calmed down. Instead I blocked him on all sites, deleted his number, and have not spoken to him since.

That all happened almost exactly three weeks ago. Every day that goes by I become more and more depressed. I had never told my boyfriend about my previous suicide attempt until he was breaking up with me (I know that sounds manipulative and I feel incredibly shitty about it). My last suicide attempt also came at the heels of an extremely bad breakup with my first love which unfolded mere months after my dad walked out. After four years apart, I got back together with this first love, only for our relationship to deteriorate rapidly and end in another horrendous breakup. I became convinced that everyone I ever loved would leave me. I feel as though some men can sense my daddy issues from miles away and know that I am easily manipulated and taken advantage of. However, once my love and affection becomes too threatening or too trusting or secure, I have the rug pulled out from under me. So many people pity me. I have heard “You don’t deserve this’ or “You deserve better” from just about every individual in my personal life, and this includes the boyfriends who feel bad about their actions but still insist that what they’re doing is for the best (for their happiness, at least).

This is partly why I feel so goddamn ashamed, and where my self-hatred comes from. Despite all the successes I have worked my ass off for, I still come home and cry myself to sleep at night because I am so deeply lonely and feel inconsolably worthless. My friends are just about the only thing keeping me tethered to life right now, and even then I’m holding on by the tips of my fingers. I feel like such an unbearably heavy burden on everyone. I would never in a million years want someone to feel as though they are obligated to stay in my life, as that’s not love, it’s control, but as I grow older I feel like letting go is becoming harder rather than easier. While I’m sure my boyfriend feels guilty about dumping me, ultimately I am trying to preserve the last scrap of dignity I have by keeping the lines of communication between us closed. Every single day, every hour, I think about him coming back to me. He still has my phone number and e-mail address and we share a lot of mutual friends. 

This, I suppose, has what has led me back down the dark path of suicidal thinking. The suffering I feel is unbearable, and I feel inherently unloveable and broken, and no amount of education or professional success will change that. Nor will those endeavors fill the black hole that I see stretching before me as my future. If you’ve ever read *House of Leaves*, I feel like each day that I am alive I am descending further and further down an endless black staircase into an agonizingly empty abyss. Because I feel like I am easy to manipulate and leave behind, I am drifting further and further into black pits of depression and agitated moods.

I talk in circles, often rambling on for hours to my patient friends. I won’t eat for days at a time. I sleep constantly. My apartment is fucking disgusting; I have dishes in the sink from weeks ago and rotting food in my fridge. Concerned friends are visiting me this weekend and I am grateful for the brief human contact I anticipate. I can’t keep track of time or my schedules. For a person with two part-time jobs (one of which is an overnight job), an internship, a graduate seminar, a teaching assistantship, and two volunteer gigs, things are beginning to unravel fast. I might miss a day of work or class, only to be presented with other obligations I must attend later that day or the following morning. I thought that being busy would get my mind off of my sadness, but instead I just feel exhausted and empty all the time. I feel proud of myself when I am able to accomplish things, only to be presented with another past-due assignment or task. While I said earlier that professional and academic success do little to fill up my heart, every moment gushing out more and more energy and love, my failures are doing little to convince myself that I am worthy of anyone’s time or affection. Again, it’s like the slow, steady descent down a dark staircase that I am almost hypnotically traveling.

Thanks for reading. I don’t think I have energy left to continue typing. I'm expected to attend a holiday dinner tonight and then I have an overnight shift to work. While I would rather lie in bed than do either of these things, I'm going to try to scrape myself out of bed several hours from now and go pretend to be a semi-normally-functioning person.

**tl;dr:** I am not in immediate danger presently, but things are pretty bad and rapidly getting worse."

In my country it is possible to enroll into a masters program that facilities the CPA exams as some of the exams will be dropped after having successfully finished this masters program. As I thought I wanted to become a CPA as fast as possible, I applied and now I have to write an entry exam in january.
The problem is that I do not want to do this program anymore because I'm not so sure about the job itself anymore. In fact I cannot even brace up to start preparing. I feel so guilty now because I have the feeling my company expects me to succeed after having signed up and they pay the fee for the entry exam.
Even by now I feel like such a failure and don't know what to do. When I come home I just want to go to bed. I feel really depressed with this situation and even thought about hurting myself. I'm a bit scared that I might slide into a depression because I have a background with psychological issues (suffering from OCD, have been in treatment for several years but) and I live by myself.

1. Pinterest Summer internship, SF.
    * most likely work with the web team, i get some choose in project i'll be working on
    * 12 or 16 weeks, i get to choose

2. Microsoft Summer internship, Redmond.
    * core team, but unknown project (can range from kernel to javascript)
    * 12 weeks, no choice in duration

The pay is roughly equal, and the benefits are roughly equal. But those I really don't care for compensation details since its only the summer. And I've never worked in Seattle or SF (or the States in general for that matter) so I have no real preference for location either.

I'm currently on a co-op term at a startup in which i'm doing something roughly similar to what I would be doing at Pinterest. However, Pinterest is obviously a larger, more challenging company with a different technology stack. Microsoft on the other hand i'm not sure what i'll be work on, and honestly I wouldn't want to work on something that's too far away from my interests (web). But to Microsoft's point they did lineup interviewers whom did work related to web so maybe when they select a team/project for me they would take my interests into consideration.

**This is my last internship before going full-time so I would like to make the best choice in terms of learning experience, reputation for my resume, and networking. Any advice is welcome, and thanks in advance for helping me!**

I'm in a terrible position right now.  I thought I was going to do well this semester, coming back really pumped and motivated after an internship, but I ended up doing the exact opposite.

Some background.  I'm in my third year of computer science.  I'm a terrible student.  My grades are usually C's and B's.  I've only gotten A's from blow off classes, and the highest grade I got for a computer science course is a B+, which is from one of two courses I repeated so far.

At my school, you are allowed to repeat a maximum of five different courses.  If you want to repeat more than five different courses, you'll have to file a request and more I assume.  It's probably not an easy process on the school's end and I'm probably going to be denied the opportunity, given that they see my academic record.  Given that I repeated two so far, I only have three more repeats left.

This semester was supposed to be the semester where I turned everything around but it wasn't.  I thought that having industry experience would really change the way I listened in lectures and the way I absorb information in general, but it didn't.  In fact, I'm in a worse position than before.

My grades came back, and I failed three core classes.   I'm not on Academic Probation because my GPA was good going into this semester, because of all of the blow off classes that I took.  However, since I failed three core classes, I will need to repeat them some time before I graduate.  Thankfully I have three more repeats left -- but that doesn't mean I'm in the clear.  What if I fail another class?  I would not have any more repeats left.

This semester I expected things to magically change, but they didn't because I didn't initiate it.  Basically I have one more chance -- if one thing goes wrong, I'm fucked.


So this brings me to my main question -- would it be better to drop out and start looking for jobs right now, or would it be better to keep attending, given that I sit my ass down and change everything about how I study?

Thank you guys in advance.  I really appreciate it."

2or0wq,0,2014-12-09,Lately I've experienced some weird stuff..,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2or0wq/lately_ive_experienced_some_weird_stuff/,"It all started two months ago when I was going for a walk at night, you see, I am not the happiest person alive if you can say that and lately I've been pretty down so I go on a lot of walks just to think and all that, and since I love stars I go on walks at night. So two months ago I was going for a walk at night, it must have been over 2 am, I wouldn't know since I never bring my phone or a watch. But I had been walking for a few hours, maybe 3 or so hours, and I was on my way home and since it's so late you can walk on the road, so I do that, there's no cars, no people, just me. On the way home I always listen to music but suddenly the sound got really bad, no any static noises, the sound just got really bad. At first I suspected that it was because of my headset being in poor condition which it was but that when I took out the jackstick the sound was still bad. With my phone now off and in my pocket I continued to walk in silence when the street light above just turned off, of course I panicked because I've never experienced that before and it even did it two more times one of the times being outside my home. As you would suspect I stayed inside at night for the next few weeks but lately I've been followed by someone.. It's a guy, probably mid thirties and he's everywhere I go. It's creeping me out. The worst part is that a month before all of this happened he started working on my school's library as an IT intern or whatever it's called..

I can worry about the lights around me going out later.."
2orbb5,58,2014-12-09,"Tech lead left the company yesterday. Manager leaving at the end of the month. I am an intern, and the project is incomplete.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2orbb5/tech_lead_left_the_company_yesterday_manager/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions. 

I am currently working in Shanghai, China as part of my third and final internship, having done two really enjoyable co-ops in the US. I'm three months in, with three months left (co-op program). 

I am currently working as a software developer intern in the company’s biggest project, which is a client-facing project. We are in charge of developing multiple websites for the client - a membership website, an online order website, a news website, and various back-ends for the online order that includes integration with the POS systems of their restaurants as well as an API for the Android and the iOS apps. It's a huge project. It's 75% done, if you consider all the untested bugs that are for sure in the system.

It’s.. not going well with the project. It is a huge one, and as a result of poor planning (and thus poor execution), the project is weeks to months delayed. The clients are growing incredibly impatient, as well as my boss. Yesterday, this project’s tech lead (and only major developer left on our part of the project - the API and online order) left the company to pursue another job. I learned also, that my manager is leaving at the end of this month. The project is incomplete yet.

As of today, I am the only one left on this project for two majors parts of it. I’ve been busy fixing the bugs that were left from previous development, and through testing, we discover even more major bugs. It’s like a game of whack-a-mole, since this is the first time we've officially tested all the development for both mobile API and the online order website. 

I am not afraid of hard work. I’ve been working till 8 - 9 PM nearly daily the past month or two. Leaving at the ""normal time"" of 6:30 is something I’ve rarely experience. And thus, I am not afraid of hard work. But, with my only source of mentorship and help and assistance on the project, that is, my tech lead, gone, I’ve had incredible pressure and responsibility to complete what’s not complete, and fix what’s broken (a lot). I’m stressed out. The project is incomplete, and there is lots broken and left untested. I am just an intern.

After talking with my tech lead who I've became quite close with (who actually logged onto Skype today to help me out on something even though he's officially quit), he told me ""I was/am not satisfied at all with the way the project is handled"", although his primary reason for leaving was mainly because his girlfriend is moving to another country.

I don’t know what to do in response to this situation. It doesn’t seem normal at all that an intern is taking on the role of the sole developer for a large part of the project, and with an exodus of the upper people in this project, it further makes me question what’s going to happen in the future. To add, a project’s not done just even though its initial release is completed; there are still bugs and further improvements necessary, and I don't know about my skill in moving forward without my tech lead who's been patient with me.

I am learning, that’s for sure, but I just don’t know if it’s worth it to be constantly working like this with two major players in the project gone, and to be the sole developer left for a major part of the project that I had no involvement when I joined. I know one or two tech leads are joining the project in some shape or form, but as far as I know, it's not a full-time joining. Not to add, they do not know the project as well as the tech lead that left, who I have always gone to for issues.

What can I do as an intern? 

***tl;dr***: Tech lead left the company yesterday. Manager leaving at the end of the month. Project is incomplete, and I have responsibilities to fix and complete the project."

[30 cops in 2 years...How is this statistically significant?  How do these numbers stack up against other professions?  Seems to be more just piling on to the whole cop hating that is now popular.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmowr5r?context=5)|Unfortunately, there are no statistics of arrests by occupation. I am sure there are more than 30 police in Massachusetts who have been caught drunk driving since 2012 -- those are just the ones I could find by combing through news articles and contacting the largest departments. Prosecutors and courts told me they don't track it. In addition, officers are not always arrested when they are caught, apparently drunk, behind the wheel. But I thought there were enough incidents that it was worth looking at what happens to the officers. 
[Do you have any apprehension about investigating police officers?  If there's one group of folks who could mess with you and get away with it, it would be cops.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmovykn?context=5)|I've had a lot of people (jokingly) advise me not to drive for a while. But I  am honestly not worried. I think we're fortunate to live in a country where it is generally safe for journalists to work. So many journalists have died in Iraq, Mexico and other countries. I assume the worst that will happen to me here is that I'll get some angry mail and some people will look up my criminal and driving history. (They will be disappointed. I've never been arrested and haven't even had a speeding ticket in 15 years or so.)

Journalism is not the highest paying job, but I find it incredibly rewarding. I get to talk to smart interesting people for a living. I am able to learn about new subjects. And I am able to tell important stories that need to be told.  My advice for people going into journalism is to try to get as much experience as possible. Get internships, work for college media. I worked for my school papers and did four internships before I graduated.
[Given the expose done by the globe a few years ago regarding the overwhelming leniency given to OUI offenders in the state of Massachusetts, why would the Globe take this position now? How can you expose the lack of justice to OUI offenders (civilian\) and then criticize off-duty police officers for benefiting from the same system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmox472?context=5)|I was focusing on how police departments handle OUIs, rather than judges. But they do go hand in hand. One of the issues in Massachusetts is that it is one of the few states where the refusal to take a breath test can't be held against you in court. To persuade people to take the test, the state suspends people's licenses for at least 180 days after a refusal. But it turns out police departments enable offices to refuse the tests by giving them paid leave or desk jobs when they lose their licenses for a refusal.
[What's the most shocking thing you've discovered since beginning this investigation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmovam3?context=5)|I was surprised to find so many police officers stayed on the payroll even after they refused a breathalyzer test, causing their driver's license to be suspended for at least 180 days. Police normally need a driver's license to do their job, so I was surprised departments would continue to pay them -- either by putting them on paid leave or giving them a desk job. 
[Have you investigated why cops stay on the payroll?  I would assume it has to do with the cost of replacing an officer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmow5r5?context=5)|That could be a factor. One department mentioned that it probably costs $150,000 to hire and train a new officer. I suspect officers also want to give their fellow officers a second chance. Several chiefs mentioned that officers are people just like anyone else and sometimes make mistakes. 
[I bet said unlicensed officers drove to work, knowing their fellow officers wouldn't ticket or arrest them for doing so.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmox6nk?context=5)|Other people have said the same thing. I don't really know. It's speculation. But it is true that ""professional courtesy"" is so common that the state Civil Service Commission [questioned](http://www.mass.gov/anf/docs/csc/decisions/discipline/keyes-delmont-013108.pdf) whether it was fair to discipline an officer who failed to report a traffic stop of a fellow officer.
[Now that studies have proven most Military deaths are from suicide, do you think a lot of cops experience PTSD?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmovtcs?context=5)|It's a really good question. I believe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is incredibly common among military veterans and many police are veterans. (Plus, police work has its own stressful situations). As you saw in the story, one of the officers fired for drunk driving is now suing the department for failing to accommodate his alcohol problems, which he said resulted from PTSD.
[Can you tell us about any blow-back or resistance you've received from either your employer (did they fully support you?\) and/or anyone on the police's side? Has writing these articles effected your ability to get info for other unrelated articles (lost sources, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmovvto?context=5)|My editors are very supportive of the story. We run a lot of articles spotlighting the positive work police do, but we also try to hold officials accountable when they do something wrong.  There is no question that some people get upset when I write a tough story and stop taking my calls for a while. But I think most people realize that the story will be more accurate and balanced if they do take my calls and offer their side.
[Is there any effort in Massachusetts toward a civilian review board of the police?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmowk4g?context=5)|No. There's no statewide board. (I actually heard from a reader who tried unsuccessfully to start one 20 years ago.) Some cities and towns have their own review boards, but they are not always well known or used. Take the one in [Boston](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/23/few_turning_to_civilians_police_board/), for example.
[How can we get these shitty police practices to change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmow165?context=5)|Think about who police work for. They generally answer to a mayor, city council or other public officials who have to run for re-election every few years and care about what voters think. In the case of state troopers, it is generally the governor and lawmakers (who control the budget). 
[I have a question, would you be willing to do as many stories about good guy cops as the media does bad ones? It seems to me that there is a very one sided timeline of reporting going on that specifically paints all law enforcement in a bad light. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmowa3p?context=5)|We actually wrote a [story](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/19/police-officers-receive-award-for-heroism-during-search-for-boston-marathon-bombing-suspects/yOdnsfX8XvGGeF4NAxUuCO/story.html) two weeks ago about 25 officers who won awards for courage.  I think it's important we write those stories. But I also think it's important we hold officials accountable for wrongdoing. 
[How many times do you think cops that were stopped for drunk driving were simply let go by the cops that stopped them? This is probably the most common occurrence when a drunk cop gets pulled over.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmowd4s?context=5)|I wish I knew. There were four cases in the last three years that I know about where officers have been caught drunk driving but were not arrested, triggering a formal investigation when superiors found out. But I've heard whispers of many other incidents. How do you count something that isn't recorded?
[Do you think that this report will actually have any consequences? By that, I mean, do you think that police officers who should have be punished but weren't will now get at least a slap on the wrist, if nothing else, and may result in future offenders actually getting punished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmow66s?context=5)|Good question. At a minimum, I want to get the conversation started. I want people to think about whether they are happy about the situation. I don't think many people realized so many officers were getting caught for drunk driving and kept their jobs -- and perhaps weren't even arrested.
[Give OP a break. It's not like he writes clear and concise titles for a living.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmp0dzt?context=5)|I actually don't write headlines -- our copy editors handle that -- but I see your point.  Good catch, as they say.
[Why would the Globe hire cops to drive drunk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ons99/iama_reporter_who_investigated_police_caught/cmoxero?context=5)|The Globe doesn't need to. It seems to be happening by itself.

2otyok,2,2014-12-09,I am losing interest in my major and I'm graduating in 2 weeks. I need advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2otyok/i_am_losing_interest_in_my_major_and_im/,"Hi, everyone.

I am currently in BS for computer engineering and 2 weeks out from graduating.  And I haven't felt this lost in my life before.

As for the background, I fell in love with STEM field thanks to FIRST Robotics Competition back in high school.  So I decided to pursue a career in computer engineering since it offered both hardware and software classes.  I loved programming and working on robots. 

But here I am on my 9th semester in college. Feeling unmotivated and doubting if this degree is even going to help me in the future.  My school (I transferred here due to various personal reasons) is heavily focused on research.  All the course offerings for computer engineering were in hardware, not software.  And the college didn't let me minor/double major in CS because CE curriculum is very closely related to each other.  

Software courses offered by the college of engineering were subpar at best.  But that goes for every class I had to take for this degree.  I learned little bit of everything.  But if you were to ask me to elaborate, I wouldn't be able to.  There was no concentration that we could take.  

Throughout my college career, I had little to no motivation for academics.  But managed to get decent grades until I started getting severe migraine for unknown reason.  I've seen several doctors and their diagnosis ranged from brain tumor to brain aneurism but tests came back clean.  So whenever I get bad migraine, I end up taking pain killers which knocks me out for days (inability to travel/commute).  In turn my grades dropped (thank you attendance and certain professors) and now have a GPA of 2.6.

Even with this low GPA, I've managed to land an internship with Lockheed Martin for network engineering.  But this fell through when my cleance didn't get approved on time.  And in the past month, I've had interviews for full-time positions with NSA, Pearl Harbor, and Amazon.  And possibly with Google, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman (in talks with HR).  

For companies I've had interviews with, they all rejected me.  I just don't know enough.  Like I mentioned, I know little bit of everything but not in detail.  What industry expects is not aligned with what we learn in school.  I tried teaching myself from online sources but they are just not the same as learning in class environment.

I love programming and that is what I want to do for living.  But I'm losing motivation and confidence in my skills.  I feel like my degree is going to be useless and I wasted past 4.5 years of my life learning nothing.  I really want to just quit this major even when I'm only 2 weeks away from graduation.  I know I should have switched over to CS but my college made it very hard for me to do so with credit transfer and crap.   

Well I guess it comes down to this - what does the industry (embedded maybe?) expect from a new grad?  What can I do better for landing a job?   What can I do to motivate myself?  Any other tips?

I really want to sit down and study algorithms (more indepth), data structures, etc. etc. after graduation.  But I am not sure anymore.

Thank you guys in advance.  And sorry this sounds like more of a rant than asking for advice...."
2ou4d7,3,2014-12-10,How do I get a reference from a company that laid you off?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2ou4d7/how_do_i_get_a_reference_from_a_company_that_laid/,"While I was getting my MBA, I got an internship at a Fortune 500 company.  They liked me and I got hired.  After I graduated I started working for them in the same department in a separate group.  My boss and I started off great and then things went sour after the 2nd month.  She gave me a poor performance review and then I got laid off in March when the company was going thru mass layoffs.  I believe my poor review and the layoff had something to do with issues she had with me personally, although I'm not quite sure what since I tried everything I could to please her.  We've also had a couple of talks about how we had communication issues, but she knows I am a hard worker.

I'm applying for jobs in a completely different field and industry and the application specifically says they want my manager's name, title and contact. What do I do??

2ou8ak,2,2014-12-10,Your experiences with your school's Speech-Language Pathologist,JillianH,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/2ou8ak/your_experiences_with_your_schools_speechlanguage/,"Hey teachers of reddit!

I'm currently finishing my Masters in Speech-Language Pathology and I'm interning (aka working a 40-hour week in addition to school) at a middle and high school where I've taken over my supervisor's caseload. I have met some AMAZING teachers, and the experience has really gotten me excited to do lots of collaboration and awesome push-in therapy in the future.

However, I've found it interesting that I've still run into some teachers who don't really know what SLPs do and are somewhat resistant to invitations to collaborate. I have a feeling most of the ignorance comes from a simple lack of exposure to what we do and a lack of understanding of how we can help.

I really want to understand what I can do in the future to facilitate positive and beneficial interactions with teachers in my future jobs, so please folks help me out - What have interactions been like with your school's SLP?


Do you know who he/she is?

Have you ever collaborated with them?

Do you have kids in your class/es who get pulled out? 

If so, do you know what they're working on? Has your SLP shared any strategies to use in the classroom?

What resources has your SLP shared with you?

What could your SLP do to make your life easier?

Would you be open to co-teaching a lesson (most likely in English classes) with an SLP or having an 
SLP teach a mini lesson (Any subject really - e.g. note taking strategies, presentation strategies, social language strategies, etc.)

Do you know the signs of a language disorder and what steps are needed to refer at your school/in your district?


I really look forward to hearing what you all have to say. I have learned so much from the discussions here and through interacting with my teachers at my internship. Before starting there, I never anticipated having close contact with teachers (aka all the kids get pulled out). However, I now know that for many kids, pulling them out is not how they're best served and it makes teaching hard. You all are on the front lines day in and day out and you know your students better than anyone else. Your opinions, referrals, teaching modifications, and overall awesomeness are the back on which a successful Special Ed department survives!!! I hope all your support staff realize how important you are in the service delivery model for our students with IEPs.

Thanks everyone!"
2oufor,8,2014-12-10,TIFU by playing Magic with a friend.,EzronKun,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2oufor/tifu_by_playing_magic_with_a_friend/,"So like almost every TIFU on here, this actually began a bit ago, but in about 6 hours from now, I will finally feel the consequences of what I have done, and may or may not be fired from my internship. Lets begin, shall we?

So it's a Thursday night 2 weeks ago, had just gotten back from a nice dinner with a mentor and his family who were awesome as shit. I arrive home, and decided to fix up my magic decks (Magic The Gathering fyi) since I would be playing alot of magic over the weekend with some friends. In comes my roommate who also has recently started to play Magic with me, and we decide, fuck it lets get some matches going. So we did. And then we played again, and again, and again.

By the time we finally end our games, we look at the time. 3:00....in the fucking morning. I had work in 6 hours, but had to be up in 4 just to make it on time. What ever, just set extra alarms, not that big a deal amiright? So wrong. sosososososososososo wrong.

Thinking my extra alarms plan is fool proof, I try to catch the few hours of Z's I have left that night. When I awoke, nothing could prepare me for the shitfest I would begin. So I wake up and please tell me that mother fucking clock did not say 11:00 AM. Oh it did. I am so screwed. 3 or so hours late to my internship, and I didn't even call them, I'm so fired.

So I get a brilliant idea, I'm calling in very fucking sick today! So sick that my friend needs to make the call for me! So sick that I couldn't even wake up, leave my bed, and make a phone call to say I was sick 3 hours ago! Of course, mother fucking brilliant! So we enact that very plan. And it took a matter of 1 minute afterwards to realize how big of a fucking idiot I am. I had been looking at my idea from my perspective, not from my bosses. From my bosses perspective? I sound like I've been out drinking. And of course, I get a call back stating exactly this. So I get another brilliant idea cause I'm just full of em, I'm going to pretend that I'm so sick, I need to head to the hospital! After this, nothing much happens, the day passes by, I think I'm in the clear!

Monday rolls around and I could not have been more wrong. So my bosses wanted to know what was wrong with me. Now, while all my other plans had been shit to this point, I can at least state that this lie was a smoother criminal than Michael Jackson. Remembering what little biology I learned in high school, and remembering what symptoms I had my roommate tell my boss that day (stomach pains, nausea, hot flashes among other things) I told my boss that the doctors said I had a tape worm, something that causes those exact symptoms! Damn I was good, no way to beat me here, I actually had been having stomach problems that last month or so due to eating habits, just attribute those days and tie it with this case and bam, it's legit as fuck! And it fucking was. For all of five minutes. And then my boss asked me the only god damn thing I didn't think of.

""Can I get a doctor's note for the day you were absent?""

Keeping a poker face that would beat even a faceless man, I just said yup, sure, no problem. And some how I managed to avoid the topic of it for the past 2 weeks using various methods of ""I can't go after work, they'd be closed by then."" (which the particular clinic I brought up actually would be) ""Oh I asked them to fax it, you didn't get it?"" and other keep away's. But In 7 hours from now, I face my dead line. I got nothing. Either my boss forgot, and I know she didn't, or I'm returning home jobless.

And all this just because I wanted to play a god damned card game.

Welp, I'll update if and when shit happens, and shit will happen. Until then, I will keep up my poker face, deny all knowledge of anything, and plead the 5th in any case applicable.


**TL:DR Playing Magic was the greatest trap card of all**

All in all, I deserve what ever is coming my way for being a dick and not owning up as soon as possible. I had these people worried sick, and here I was trying to cover my own ass. Welp we'll see if I get what's coming to me.


UPDATE:

So seems like a few questions need to be answered.

First, my internship is both a paid one, and I receive college credits for it, and I have less than 6 weeks before I'm finally finished (adds to the stupidity that is me) 

Second, didn't mention it in the post, but of course I knew tape worm doesn't go away after a single hospital visit. What I told them was, after taking a stool sample from me, and my recollection of where I went out to meat, the ""doctor"" figured I ate some bad meat a month or two ago, and got the tape worm which has been giving me recurring stomach problems (I did have some stomach issues for the last month or so due to genuinely being sick) and told them they gave me anti-biotics that I would need to take over the course of a month or so and slowly kill the worm that does not exist.

Third, I agree with everyone saying I need to fess up. I'm trying to set up a 1 on 1 with my boss asap.

My course runs for 3 years but there is an optional work placement (or internship) year available. After my second year, I would like to undertake a work placement.

Now, most students will take up their places in the UK but it is possible to get an international position. Personally, I am very interested in working in the U.S. but I am a complete novice to the world of work so I am wondering if anybody here can give me any advice?

At the moment, I have no work experience. I have never had a job before but I am currently fundraising for charity and I have been told that is a start to developing the skills that employers are looking for. Of course, I understand that I may need to do more to increase my chances. Since I want to get a placement in the U.S., I understand that the process will be significantly more difficult than getting a European placement.

Right now, I'm considering working in the security field of computing and I've been told that I should start researching now. Any advice given would be very much appreciated."

This program automates the process of verifying parameter settings off the HMI's (Human-Machine Interface) on our production floor, which our floor workers do on a daily basis. We have all these values stored in data blocks through a unique IP + PLC combination, and I've been using open-source software called libnodave to access it with the help of one of the engineers here.

For the most part, the numbers received from the system have either been exactly as expected, or off in logical ways (mostly when they're floating-point numbers that come through as integers, so I just divide by 10/100/1000 and I'm good). One set of numbers doesn't makes sense to me though. One of the machines has a runtime that's supposed to be between 5 and 10 seconds. The numbers I'm receiving for this machine's runtime look nothing like that though. I compared them with the setting in the HMI, and got this result:

8 seconds returns 2048

10 seconds returns 4352

Do these numbers have a recognizable pattern to you? Are they some format I haven't seen before? I know it's not a lot to work with, but I can't change any settings without going through documented procedure, which I'm not even authorized for. I've already bothered the electrical engineer who knows this stuff quite a bit, I'd like to solve this without his help if possible. Thanks guys"
2ovvnd,3,2014-12-10,Life after University.,heatseeker92,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2ovvnd/life_after_university/,"I am going to share with you about my experiences with University and the job search.

A little bit about me first. I was born in Finland to a Finnish mother and a Finnish father. When I was 2 weeks old I moved to Tanzania because my parents have been working there since the 1980s and continue to work there to this day. Kindergarten through my senior year (Grade 12) I attended an international school that was taught in English. The primary school followed the American system and the secondary system followed the British system so IGCSE and A-levels. Higher education is free in Finland and many other European countries. However many of my class mates and people I knew were already studying in the US or were applying. So I applied as well. My parents said I could go if I got scholarships. Sure enough I got scholarships and didn't have to pay much for school at all (around $10K per school year which I get in incentives from the Finnish government anyway). My father has 5 siblings. Him and three of his siblings all hold masters degrees in various fields of engineering and I regard them as very intelligent people and look up to them immensely. I then chose Mechanical Engineering as my choice of study. I will be graduating in 2015 with a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical engineering and currently have a GPA of 3.15. My resume is pretty good. I held the position of an RA for two years where I was responsible for 160 first year students each year. One summer I also had the opportunity to intern at a manufacturing company in Finland. Another summer I interned for an energy service company in New York (they work on energy efficiency and reducing the energy usage of public institutions). Now I have been applying for jobs. I want to move back to Tanzania, my home, after gaining a few years of experience in the US.

My experiences for applying for jobs has been quite difficult and I still do not have a job but I want to share with you guys what I have done so far. I have been applying to a number of oil companies and oil service companies with no luck. There are two reasons I want to work in the O&amp;G industry. 1) I want a job where I can be out in the field, a hands on engineering job (something that oil service companies offer). 2) Tanzania discovered large reserves of natural gas offshore in 2011 and I see this as a good career path for myself. I have also been applying to other jobs in renewable energy (my interests are energy, renewable and conventional). As a student in the STEM field I have 27 months of OPT - Optional Practical Training(of which I have used 3 for my internship in NY). So I have 2 years of OPT left and I keep getting turned down for jobs, don't even get an interview... I know its because I am international student. Also what makes it even more difficult is that I study in New York and all of the O&amp;G industry is located in Texas, Lousiana, and North Dakota and so I'm quite far from those locations. I have thought of looking into jobs in Finland and Nordic countries but from what my family and many others have told me that a Bachelors  Degree in Finland is the equivalent of a piece of toilet paper...you need a Master degree. So applying in Finland is not much use. However I'm keeping in mind applying for Graduate school in the Nordic countries. Another option is to move to Tanzania and start a company. The Tanzanian economy is growing 7% each year and there is large amounts of unemployment making labor cheap. This is something that I would love to do as I want to be my own boss and an entrepreneur. Here there is a problem too though...I have no capital to start an entrepreneurship. So I don't know what I will do...I guess I will keep at it until I find something.

The main points I have learned
* If you want to work in a certain industry (oil for example) attend a school that is close to those locations.
* If school is free and you have access to it take that option rather than scholarships to another school.
*Bachelor's degrees are good in some countries in others they are just a white piece of paper with no value.
* Being fluent in 3 languages is something that people admire but that's about as far as that goes.
* You need to think about the bigger picture (Like opportunities to work after graduating in the country where you are studying).

Sorry if its not interesting and is long or whatever. Just wanted to get it out there. Feel free to comment, bash me, give me advice, critique me, call me a dumb-ass or whatever you want."

I accepted the job without realizing there was a drug test. Long story short, I showed up for my first day and failed it. My boss was very understanding and made it clear that as long as I passed one in a few weeks I would be fine. I wait a few weeks and nothing. Three months later I have one week left with the company and I assume it's safe to smoke. Wrong. With a week left in my internship he tests me again and I fail. I was really ashamed of myself and left the company in poor graces. Now, I am set to graduate college next May and I would like to right my wrongs. I acted very immaturely and I realize that, how would you phrase the apology email? To be clear, the work I did was good and I had no issues beyond the drug tests.


Here is what I have so far:


Hey *Steve, I hope all is going well for you and the company in *my city. I just wanted to email you to apologize for how I conducted myself while interning for you a few summers ago. Looking back on my behavior, I feel as though I behaved very unprofessionally and in a manner that I am ashamed of. While it certainly isn't an excuse, I was rather young and fairly immature at the time and I didn't understand the repercussions of my actions nor how poorly they made me look. I hope that you, as well as *Sarah, *Luke and the rest of staff, can forgive me. That being said, I was wondering if you would be open to grabbing lunch one day while I am home on Christmas break. I would love to buy you lunch and discuss how the company and you personally have been since I left. Again, I deeply apologize for my actions and my immaturity and I would really like to apologize to you in person and attempt to mend some of the harm I caused.

Thanks,

*Ben

Since I don't know much about the field yet I was hoping you guys could give me an opinion on which one is the better program.

The two are https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/ and http://www.codecore.ca/. 


The thing I have issues with is light house lab boast that they have 100% placement rate ""With a 100% placement rate, once you graduate from Lighthouse Labs you will be able to continue your learning and growth while actually working (and getting paid!) as a developer.""

So why is it alarming ? Well Codecore website stated ""Provincial law forbids us from making claims on guaranteed graduate placement rates, but we can guarantee you that we will make every effort in our power to put every one of our bootcamp grads into internships or entry-level development jobs with some of the industry’s top companies."" 

So how are lighthouse labs making claims if the law prohibits it lol.

Other than that I would love some general opinions on which program you feel is better.

I've been reading all of the B.S. vs M.S. threads and what I've gathered from them is that a B.S is for industry (which I want to work in) while an M.S. is for research. UCSD has been kind of ass in accommodating me in taking computer science classes, and my GPA is not high enough to be able to apply for the graduate programs at top-tier colleges such at UCLA, UC Berkeley, etc. If I was to pursue the M.S. route, it'd take me, at worst, 3 years to even consider applying to graduate school because of all the upper-div courses I'd have to take. I'm now deciding on either going for an online B.S. from OSU or an on-site B.S. from SDSU/UCSD (which is near where I live). 

I know that in CS, it's the programming experience and passion that matters, not the degree, but I just want to know if the degree from OSU is even worth it. 

If the degree from OSU is worth it, my plan is to take the 2 year curriculum and also find an internship while I am studying in order to bolster my programming experience

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!"

I am just so lost right now though and would love some advice on where to go. 


Background:

* UC Berkeley Graduate (degree Aug 2014), and I am basically just trying to ride on the prestige. Unfortunately, don't have much clubs or internships to show
* Major in Environmental Economics &amp; Policy
* Only job experience was for a few months when I withdrew from school for 2 semesters, which was a basic retail job
* Been searching more or less since September, searching mostly at analyst roles or some type of management
* Live in South San Diego very near the border (w/ parents), and naturally I search locally, but am willing to commute more up north. Nonetheless, the nature of my searches are more South San Diego, and the positions down here don't really require my education
* Financially stable from parent's support, but they are Chinese parents pushing me to find a job, yet I want to find something decent, definitely not mindless work
* Relatedly, I dabble a little in stocks, but for the most part it is just sitting.

Hobbies:

* I love fitness, but don't see a career route through it. I am at the gym almost every day, and am one of the strongest people there and focus heavily on doing things correctly (form, programming)
* Had small online presence when I used to stream video games, but I am inconsistent and tend to fall off when other priorities come about
* I enjoy cooking and all things food, but mostly home stuff ala Alton Brown

Throughout my job search, analyst positions available have dwindled, and I have realized, I just don't have experience that they require. Now I don't even know what job titles to search for. I realize most people say they find careers outside of their majors, but the positions available are just so vast, that I don't know what to go for, what I'm qualified for, what's entry level, or if I'm underutilized. As I said, the nature of the job positions near me are low-skill, but the ones more up north require more experience which I don't seem to have.

I have had a few interviews and I have been hopeful, but nothing has come through. I am both in a position where I can't complain, doing well physically and relationships, but I feel unfulfilled without a job.

I am afraid that if I don't go for similar positions as other [graduates](https://career.berkeley.edu/major/envecon.stm) my education would be worthless other than for that paper. But without internships, I don't have the experience for such positions, so again I'm just lost.

With the holidays, I have slowed down a lot, and sort of have become lazy, at least with the job search. I haven't found many positions to go for, the motivation to look for new titles aren't there, and I have been organizing things like family and friend get togethers. For about a week prior to Thanksgiving, that's pretty much what my time was spent on: preparing a Turkey and sides for 20+ party. Come Christmas, I will be doing this again, preparing for a large party, but there's also gifts and other arrangements I'm thinking about. 

I've been told I'm very good at things I'm enthusiastic about, namely my gym prowess and when I used to have a decent viewerbase as a twitch streamer, but I wasn't consistent with that. I've also been told I should try learning things on my own time, and I do, but I stop after a few weeks since I'm not sure if it will actually be utilized or I just lose motivation, like learning Chinese, Excel, SQL, or other forms or computer programming. I like IT but never was able to dedicate myself to learning something like python since it hasn't been necessary - yet. This ambiguity on what I might be doing is killing me and making me anxious. So, with that all said, any direction, feedback, or advice, I would greatly appreciate. "

The majority of my work is coordinating, administration, and customer service (a lot of behind the scenes stuff). The pageants system is the largest in the nation and has a huge production team. (It's not like Toddlers and Tiaras.) I got into this kind of work because I was a former competitor and when an internship came up, I thought it would be a perfect summer job. I travelled, got paid very well, and was able to work with my friends. 

I went on working for the pageant every spring and summer for 10 years. It was a great supplemental job for my dreams of becoming a tv producer. My dreams have become more realistic and all I really want is a full-time job. I need a consistent pay check and also to be able stay home with my husband and start a family. 

This is my problem, people HATE pageants. People have very significant opinions and stereotypes associated with them that immediately puts my resume on the reject pile. Trust me, I understand why people have negative feelings about them but regardless, it's really hindering me now that I'm looking for full-time employment. 

My second problem is that while I've worked for this company 10 years, but it was only in the summer months. I also had many small jobs and freelance work in-between, but when I represent that on my resume it looks ""spotty"".

So here are my questions: 

1. How should I represent that working at a pageant has made me an professional asset despite what people think about pageants in general?

2. How do I show that I have worked for one company for many years, while also gaining experience from many freelance jobs?

I'd appreciate any advice. Thank you!

2oxqx4,0,2014-12-10,Am I Just Kidding Myself?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2oxqx4/am_i_just_kidding_myself/,"Some backstory:  I'm studying Computer Science and Political Science, unfortunately I've been on break from school for a year.  I've tried to go back every semester since leaving but with no luck, the reason I am out is due to several medical emergencies (I have a blood disease) which have seriously cost me so much.  I missed weeks of classes and since I withdrew, there were school costs that weren't covered (by financial aid and loans) so I can't register with an outstanding balance past due.  That's the main problem.  

I feel like I'm in a catch 22, staying in school will get me my degree faster (I took extra classes before just so I can graduate on time with two majors, but that plan is out the door since I've been on leave) and it has my loans on hold before I have to repay them.  I'm in school to get a better job, now I need a better job just so I can repay my balance and be able to register.  This year I have been doing retail and fast food jobs to get by, now I've changed my direction and I have been applying to internships and jobs that are at least vaguely related to what I want to do.  Seems like most internships are just looking for entry-level folks rather than students/new graduates that don't have the degree/experience yet.  Am I just kidding myself by applying to them?  I have experience but probably beginner at best, most of the ones I'm applying to are for IT internships.  

My employment is pretty spotty and just generally irrelevant to both my majors, what can I do?  I'm planning to take a few CompTIA certifications to start, but again these take money I don't exactly have (I'm still going to study on my own time, of course, just can't expect to finish a lot of them as I hoped quickly).  I just want a job in IT, call center, programmer, help desk, etc. To make matters worse, I'm homeless...I've been staying with a friend, but that's gone mostly sour so I'm planning to move to back to where I was before things blew up.

Anyone in a similar situation?  How did you get yourself out?  It's only gotten me more down and stuck."

* 26M

* BA in Asian Studies

* I have lived on my own before, but I was either in a dorm or living with a friend

* I've been working at Wal-Mart as a cashier for over a year and dreading it (and only make $8.30 /hour for 30-35 hours a week)

* Around $30k in debt

What I'm looking to do:

* I want to go back to college and major in Computer Science. I've already sent an application to my old community college to reactivate my student status

* If I go back to college, I want to find an internship

* I want to move out of my parents house.

* I want to find a better job than Wal-Mart

* I want to get a car (since getting around my town is impossible without one). Although I'd prefer to live in a city with great public transportation, it looks like that won't be an option right now

If I move out, I don't think I'll be able to find anyone I know to live with since I don't have strong connections with too many people in this area (didn't make too many friends in high school TBH). I'd like to have roommates, though.

I feel like I should definitely be qualified for something better than Wal-Mart, but I keep running into the ""you need experience and have majored in X field"" wall. Since I'd be going back to school, I might work part-time, though.

As for getting a car, this is something I've been wanting and not wanting to do. On one hand, having the freedom to go anywhere I want again without relying on other people is great, but I don't want to push myself further in debt.

I know this is probably a lot to read, but if anyone has any answers for me, I'd greatly apprecitate it!"

I've just started uni, but I should be able to finish ~3 years. I keep reading articles on Europe's shortage of IT workers, and how it will continue to grow in the coming years. However, spending a few hours  reading IWO and it seems even with the shortages visas are still hard to come by. I am hopeful by the time I have finished uni the situation will improve, but if anyone could give clarification that would be wonderful.

I have done some research on the requirements for working in the EU, and it seems Americans have it kind of rough. Alas, I wont be able to qualify for EU citizenship as both sides of my family go all the way back to the early 17th Century. Knowing this I am still undetered by the bureaucracy as I am hellbent on experiencing the Old world.

Let me start off by laying out my pretty abysmal situation.

I started college right after highshool at a 4 year institution with excellent ACT scores and multiple 5s on my AP tests. This school was one state over in Iowa because I wanted to stay with my twin brother, and he was going there no mater what. I realize now that I was not nearly mature enough to perform at the college level, especially in a whole other state without any of my friends. I should have done what was best for ME, not simply follow my brother. Back then however, I was so naive.

Anyways, short story long I did reasonably well my freshmen year with a 3.2 GPA first semester and a 2.9 second with my first c-. Well sophomore year didn't go so well I fell into a deep depression due to lack of friends, and my poor physical fitness left me with little energy to even get out of bed. This semester left me with an abysmal gpa of 2.45 after two Fs and a D.

I stayed at that university for two more semesters trying in vain to fight my depression and retake my failed classes. Eventually I was dismissed with a cumulative gpa of 1.8.

It's been nearly a year now since I've been home, and I'd like to say I've gotten a lot better. I've begun working out and reconnected with my old friends. I'm ready to start building my future, but I look back and have these dark years dragging me down. I cannot get into any state schools with this gpa, and I've already taken so many classes that going to a CC and acing the classes will hardly improve it. I can't even get an internship without being actively perusing a CompSci degree not to mention my gpa.

I really don't know what to do now. I just finished trying devry for the past two months and immediately withdrew after I found out how awful the quality of the classes are there. My only other option now is to try and start over. Get an associates from my local CC with a 3.5 gpa I know I can earn, and hope to god that the state school I apply to doesn't ever find out about my past.

I just feel really sad, not so much depressed as I used to, just sad. I feel like I've already lost at school and lost at life."

For my first semester I took only general education classes and it was horrible. I hated going to school everyday. Paying all that money for things I do not have any passion or interest in was simply crushing, and I do not really know what I can do to escape this.

What I was thinking of doing instead would be to only take math and CS relevant courses from now on and just forgoe all extra classes that I greatly dislike (English, Humanities, etc.). This would mean me giving up the possibility of getting a degree.

I currently work part time (16hrs/week) as a CS intern and have been doing so for a cumulative year.

Could anyone possibly lend some guidance on what to do/how this could impact my career please? I just really need some guidance.

I've been here for just almost a year and everything was going good, more or less.

I moved up here mainly because i couldn't get a job at any of the job fairs that were popping up everywhere. It's hard to shine when 500+ people show up for one position. I also moved up here so I would no longer be a financial burden to my mom, she lived far enough away from the main city that bus stops were a few miles away and walking into the city was an hour and a half long walks. near murderous during the summer.

I was already feeling depressed that my associates degree wasn't getting me a job of an internship, I received my degree in 2010. Every single administrator, secretary and department head gave me the run around about how i apply for an internship. While applying for certain jobs I would be declined a position because I was ""over qualified,"" and ""This position is for those who are new to the workforce"" and stuff like that. At first it didn't bother me, I did try a work agency that put me in a job but every job that came after because more and more demeaning and physically back breaking.

When I could no longer find work I tried asking help from friends to find a job, but that went nowhere seeing that I didn't speak Spanish nor did I have a vehicle. Eventually I got seriously depressed then angry then depressed. Found myself walking around at night in the desert. 

At this time, 2012, I still didn't have a job but i Did get some money to go back to college, Started to work on a certificate based off the extra classes I had to take even though they had nothing to do with my original Degree. Well all was decent until the final semester before my money ran out again. So I tried to rush myself with a 18 to 20 Credit hours and I just burned myself out. I failed two main classes needed to finish And ended up Failing the whole semester, Had to pay back the tuition for the classes as well which was almost $1000. 

Until November 2013. I was just Self destructive depressed And Suicidal, I new I needed a new start so when I was asked if I wanted to go to WA to help my cousin I said Yes.

I was very happy, Every thing was different. I got a second job, it took a while but i made friends, got a roommate + apartment, But now this December I got stuck with $800+ rent Roomie bailed for a month I had to quite Urgently my second job because my mind and body physically broke down And my boyfriend who made me very happy dumped me all in the same day.

I had a bad feeling from the start moving in with my roommate but at first i thought it was just the thought of not being with family that was the problem. but slowly i started seeing things that lead my to believe she was very unreliable. She bought too many things and niknaks, bought 'better' things of what we already had. There were no discussions about the apartment and She Never Talked To Me In Person. always text, even if i'm across the hall. never felt so alone before.

All I needed was help, just a pat on the back, to be in the company of a friend. Every single person that said they would help either wasn't available or just stretched themselves to the point they couldn't help me. the people who are/were my friends turned there back on me. I literally used every single dime i have to keep my bills paid, and now I have no work. Literally, all day today and yesterday I have just been trying to recover from what I believe was a stressed induced anxiety attack, and everyone just decides to abandon me. I've been trying to contact my friends but they are disappointed that i quit when our work was already short staffed ( 6 people total) at subway. I am Alone In a cold apartment, That my roommate (54yr Woman) who i work with didn't leave any rent money. my cousin is on her vacation in Florida, And I just have no one. Can't call anyone, and I'm back to square one again. I've cried all day and i still want to cry just to feel something on my face but can't anymore and now i just want my life to end. I can't sleep and its already the day after. I've done more research into suicides but right now I just don't now what to do."

Help me in understanding whether I really am.,FinickyFizz,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2ozhzn/think_im_getting_screwed_over_by_my_co_founder/,"This guy (let's call him SM) found my profile on angel list and randomly pinged me to work on an idea of his. I was still in college and accepted the same without any paper work. I didn't know SM before this introduction from Angel list and I just trusted him. He seemed to have a team which I later found out was completely built out of angel list. Obviously because of this, all of us worked remotely and I was working and putting in money from my own pocket cause I was a *Co founder* for the company. There was another person (let's call him RM) who was putting in money for the startup. 


This had been happening for about 7 months after which RM called me and asked me how I was feeling working in the company cause he felt, he was also being used by SM cause SM was being very reluctant to raise a very small seed round and at the same time took on the position of a CEO and was refusing to divulge details about the company registration and was not putting in our shares in the company on paper. Through the time I was acquainted with the company, SM had just been recruiting interns from random colleges promising them money and food and accommodation (all paid by RM) and never delivering on the same, so much that he would fire people in the last few weeks and refuse to certify the work that these interns had done. 


Now, I come to know that it had been SM's plan to get rid of me as soon as I finish with the final product which is kinda nearing completion, unfortunately I have shared all the designs with him and he hasn't shared most of the work he has done with me although RM is also trying to get a hold of the work that SM has done with his interns and he is sharing that with me. 


The equity split is like this 
SM : 45%
RM : 20%
Me : 15%
SM's friend who nobody has ever met : 15%
First intern : 5%

SM refuses to get together and work on the product although he tells us that he works on the company 24x7 and we have heard that he has been using the interns paid by RM to work on another project which no one knew until one of the interns confided in RM. 


As an engineer, I find the work that SM is doing extremely unethical but I have also heard from friends who I asked for help that these are the kinds of blood sucking psychopaths you want in your company (they give Steve Jobs as an example). 

If you are still with me after this wall of text, please help me get out of this conundrum I find myself and at the same time use my designs for my own purpose and not really loose everything I have done. 


One thing I thought of was to ask them to pay me for the work and give them the license to use the designs fully (although it is already shared with SM). The other way was to open source my entire work and put GPL type licenses and make it open for anyone to use at any time thus, making it difficult for him to make it commercially and earn money. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

What I changed this year, and my plan for next semester.

I took my classes much more serious this year, however early in the semester I relied too much on others for assignments (group work) instead of struggling through them on my own. This is a major fault. My study habits throughout the semester improved. From mild studying, to not procrastinating and preparing for exams a week in advance.

What I learned? 
-Early mistakes hurt more than later ones. 
-Persistence.
-Read the book, seek knowledge from others.

What I will change for next semester?
-Over winter break, start notes/study spring semester material. I hope to do this to increase early understanding and allow me to reach a deeper level by the end of term.
-Study / review class material consistently once, and alter problems to attempt then again.

I wanted to reach new limits this semester, but did not buckle down until about 1/3 thru the semester. Ended up paying heavily by missing the next best grade by small percentages in two classes. 

7 classes.
Worst case: 1 D, 1 C, 1 B, rest A's (could lose internship (3.1gpa) and grad a year later which I can't afford as I pay for everything) 
Expected: 2C (or 1C 1B), 1B, rest are A's
Mech engr. 

Where I would have been if I didn't make stupid mistakes on the last exam (dramatic effect on exam avg)
2Bs, everything else A's. 

tl:dr 

I worked hard and invested immense time this semester and I don't believe it paid off. My grades won't represent what I have learned or my work ethic. However, I will not lose sight of my goal, and I will stay motivated for next semester!"

Double majoring in two completely unrelated and rigorous fields such as this is my plan so far (or at least majoring in Computer Science and getting all the pre-reqs for med school out of the way).

And most of them really are. I mean, wow, there is some real crap in the Steam store this year with ""Simulator"" in the title. I know, it's terrible, I get it. But there are also some real gems that are definitely worth your money should they come up in the Winter Sale and I'd like to gush about them for a few minutes.

See the Steam curator list here! http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7353613-Good-Simulator-Games/
1 - Tabletop Simulator

Tabletop Simulator deserves to be Game of the Year. It takes us one step closer to the Holodeck and it has a good chance to be a killer app on the next generation virtual reality devices that are currently in development. It is the best Internet Poker ever invented, and it can play almost any tabletop game you can think of. (Not Mouse Trap ... yet) When you first start playing it, you are wowed by the possibilities it enables. But then, as you keep playing it, you find that there are more and more possibilities that just never seem to stop. And just when you think, ""OK, yeah, I get the point of this"" they release an update which adds a new feature that changes everything. Tabletop Simulator makes a big difference to how we think about game design, collaboration, human-computer interaction, intellectual property and everything related to those subjects. ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE WITH A PC AND A BRAIN MUST GET THIS RIGHT NOW AT ANY PRICE.

2 - Surgeon Simulator

It's pretty fun to pretend to be the inept medical intern from Weird Al Yankovic's ""Like a Surgeon"" as the subject of a video game. Think like, a 3D game of ""Operation!"" with bizarre physics bugs that were intentionally left in to make the game more interesting rather than annoying. The difficulty of controlling the game *is* the challenge. Definitely a fun diversion and worth getting, especially if you're into Team Fortress 2 lore, because Valve added an awesome Team Fortress 2 Medic themed level which makes the game worth buying all by itself. Lots of hidden secrets, which I won't spoil here. Just remember that the obvious part of the game isn't the whole game.

3 - Goat Simulator

Goat Simulator is like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, except that you get points for destroying stuff instead of doing tricks, you don't get penalized for wiping out and you never get criticized for not pressing the buttons in the right order. It's splitscreen multiplayer mode is great to try with a friend, although it could use more pvp activities. I'd say it's worth it somewhere around $5-$8 for sure. A free expansion was recently added that makes fun of World of Warcraft called ""Goat MMO.""

4 - Viscera Cleanup Detail

I know it doesn't have ""Simulator"" in the title, but this is most definitely a Simulator game to the core. It is a ""janitor simulator."" And it's very funny, and can give you a good diversion while you're listening to something else. I blazed through a number of audiobooks that would have made me fall asleep if I wasn't also doing something else thanks to this little game. And the Christmas-themed ""Santa's Rampage"" bonus is actually better than the full game.

5 - Artemis Bridge Simulator

Artemis Bridge Simulator is somewhat flawed in it's execution, but it's a great concept. A simulator of the bridge of a Star Trek starship so that an entire group of friends can man the different stations and have adventures like they're all on an episode of Star Trek. Unfortunately, some aspects of it's interface, it's online multiplayer and the lack of variety in the challenges it presents your crew leave much to be desired and seriously harms it's replay value. But if you really love Star Trek and you see it on sale, it's definitely worth trying out at least.

6 - Corporate Lifestyle Simulator

A 2D, 3rd person zombie killing action game. Yes, I know, we're sick of zombies by this point and it's nothing particularly special. But it's very well executed and has great morbid humor. The wide variety of available weapons is a strength for this title.

Haven't tried ""Probably Archery"" yet but it may or may not belong on this list."

So I have listed below technologies that each team at a company (of which I will be interning at) will be using this summer. They have essentially told me ""Tell us where your interests are, and we will push for you to work with that team/project"".  (So I'm like a 7 year old in a candy shop right now.)


I'm looking for some insight on some of these technologies. Do you have any advice/opinions for me? I'm in my Sophomore year in college right now. I want to be careful with my decision. I like programming (Experience with C++/Java (OOP), SQL (Java-Derby), Mongodb (configuration/setup &amp; SOME usage with Javascript driver on Node.js). I like databases. I don't have a preference besides the fact that I REALLY dislike plain web development dealing with the HTML/js/&amp; the DOM.(Maybe it was just a bland project, idk :P)

Everything about the 'Cloud' interests me. Everything about data analytics interests me. I also, would like to be an SDE or SDET at a big name company like Microsoft, just because well, long story short, I am the definition of an 'under-dog' when it comes to achievements in life. And well, It's taken me 365 days to go from ""I don't know anything."" to ""I landed my first internship"", and I don't want to stop. (Also everything I read about MSFT is mouth watering, and I think I tend to have a unique insight on people and users that would make me a key asset for them).


Also: I know the spiel. ""Learn general/big picture ideas, don't obsess over one technology/framework. You want to be adaptable and you don't want to be a burnout"", Having gotten that spiel out of the way, do you see a team below that may help me be the ideal software engineer?

1. Does NVIDIA drug test? I occasionally smoke weed and although I will stop way before my test, I just want to be sure. Also, I have shy bladder syndrome and a urine test is an absolutely terrifying experience everytime I have to get one. Ideally I'd like to not even think about the experience if I don't have to get one.

2. What are the interns like? I'll be living in California, miles away from home, and these are the people I'll be associating with. Is it a good mix of people? This question is kind of wishy-washy, but it has been on my mind.

I'm an undergraduate CS student in my 3rd year, with a 3.5 GPA and a year of paid research experience (in a computational neuroscience lab). Most of my CS electives have focussed on computer vision, AI, algorithms, and databases.
My goal is to eventually pursue a PhD from U Waterloo or U of Toronto (I'm Canadian).

I'm faced with a few options for the coming year, and I'm really not sure as to their relative merits or weights when it comes to graduate admissions.

1. I have only basic math and stats background (first year essentials). I could take summer courses and load up on a fair bit of statistics and applied math before I graduate.

2. I am registered in an internship program, so I could pursue getting a year long internship at some company (likely not research based)

3. I could apply for a summer research grant and try to get some AI/ML research experience (I could potentially take some courses at the same time as well).

Any input is appreciated - I'm a little clueless as to what would count for more.

Thanks!"
2p1edk,2,2014-12-11,I need help on choosing the right server for a small business,canadadryistheshit,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2p1edk/i_need_help_on_choosing_the_right_server_for_a/,"Good morning, afternoon, evening all, wherever you reside in the world

I was recently hired as an IT Intern at a small business through my community college careers office. The job is great, So far I have made people happy attending to their computer needs in our small office. I am the only IT guy there and I'm currently administrating their servers.

However, there remains an issue. Our office is running with x3 Windows Server 2003 and x1 Windows Server 2012. The moment I walked through the door I saw it was an issue. The three Windows Server 2003 servers are very slow and on their way to the electronic recycle can pretty soon. Along with two other servers that are sitting on the side, not being used because they crapped out.

I am new to server administration but I know a bad environment when I see one.

I keep trying to convince the owner of the business (keep in mind this is a business that pulls in more than 2-3 million dollars per year) to start thinking about some server upgrades. He always brushed it off because he doesn't want to spend money. I annoyed him so bad that he wants me to research and make up a proposal to present to him. I'm fine on the presentation side but when it comes to researching a good server to find, I am lost. I contacted Dell today to give me an estimate on a new server after providing them with some details such as ""How many people will be accessing this during the day?"" etc.

------- This is what needs to be replaced

Current Setup: x3 Windows 2003 Servers All Running the Same Hardware Specs

CPU: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU clocked at 2.9GHZ

RAM: 1GB for each Server

Server 1 Features: SQL/Office CRM Software/ 1 Client's CRM Software (including backups from their office)

Server 2 Features: DNS/Active Directory/Storage

Server 3 Features: Storage
----------------------------------------

-------- Below is what the CEO and I want --------
So here's the run down. I'm looking for 1-2 server(s) to replace the three old ones that we have. On any given day 10-25 people will be accessing them for different needs.

Note: We do not have VPN and FTP setup yet because I know we are replacing these servers soon. The CEO would like to have these capabilities on the next build.

Again- Looking for 1-2 Servers to be able to handle the following:

Employees Accessing During The Day Via LAN: 10-15

Clients Accessing During The Day Via Remote Desktop/Published Application: 5

Programs: CRM Software x2

Services that need to be ran: SQL

Features and Roles: DNS, Active Directory, FTP, VPN and IIS

Remote Desktop For Admins: Just Me and the CEO

CALs: No. We have 5 CALs installed on the current 2012 Server.

Storage Space: Atleast 5TB or More (We have a lot of external 1TB drives around the office as well for backup)

RAID: Looking for a suggestion on this

ANY other suggestions please give me some feedback. Again, I am new to administrating servers, please call out any wrongs/possible mistakes within what the CEO and I are looking for."
2p1l6h,1,2014-12-11,Employment gap due to medical issue,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/2p1l6h/employment_gap_due_to_medical_issue/,"Right now I am in college for Advertising and am at the point that I have to get an internship in the field. I am struggling with this because I am not confident in my resume content. 

I went to a small college in CT in 2005. Hated it there, so I transferred in 2006 to a bigger college back home. In 2007, I left due to a medical issue (more on that later), but in Spring 2013, I went back and currently am enrolled part time because I also work a part time retail job. 

Medical issue: it started out as fatigue and snowballed into sleeping all the time. I missed so many classes that I had to drop out. After dropping out, I moved back home with my parents where I went through the process of doctors, medications, etc. Then the unexplained pain started in my arms, legs, and back. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (a sleep and pain disorder) in 2012. Now, I manage pretty well with my treatments. I can work a part time job and go to school part time, so I’m pretty active and busy. Although I do get tired a lot and sometimes am in pain, it’s manageable. 

My work history is not great. In high school, I worked at Petsmart for a couple years. When I transferred to the college back home, I did get an unpaid internship at WHYY TV-12 (a local TV station) because a teacher I had really liked me and recommended me for the internship. That was Sept 2007-Dec 2009. After that, I went back to Petsmart from Dec 2009-Oct 2010 but quit because the new manager was harassing me (to the point that I had to get HR involved). In 2010 is when my medical problems really got worse, and I was in between treatments. If you’ve ever been sick, you know what a pain it is to go through trial and errors months at a time. So I didn’t go back to retail work until July 2012, and I am currently working there now (another pet store called Pet Valu). In between 2010 and 2012 I did volunteer and get paid a little for helping out at the local adult school (where they provide a variety of classes to adults). I created, designed, and edited the monthly e-mail newsletter through Constant Contact. I also got paid to work during registration months (approx. 3 months twice a year). That job was spotty though, it wasn’t a steady schedule.

My problem is I don’t have work experience relevant to the advertising industry. I originally was majoring in film/media arts (that’s why I had the internship at a TV station), but then changed my major when I went back in 2013. With the fierce competition, I’m scared that employers are going to look right passed me. I truly am a hardworker and adapt really quickly to any situation. My parents raised me with a strong work ethic. My other problem is explaining what I did between 2010 and 2012. I had a really rough time trying to figure out what was wrong with me, going to a crazy amount of doctors and specialists, having different medications thrown at me at the same time for months at a time only to find out they didn’t work, then had to change to a different medication, etc. It’s been hectic, and I have nothing to show for it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So I have listed below technologies that each team at a company (of which I will be interning at) will be using this summer. They have essentially told me ""Tell us where your interests are, and we will push for you to work with that team/project"". (So I'm like a 7 year old in a candy shop right now.)

I'm looking for some insight on some of these technologies. Do you have any advice/opinions for me? I'm in my Sophomore year in college right now. I want to be careful with my decision. I like programming (Experience with C++/Java (OOP), SQL (Java-Derby), Mongodb (configuration/setup &amp; SOME usage with Javascript driver on Node.js). I like databases. I don't have a preference besides the fact that I REALLY dislike plain web development dealing with the HTML/js/&amp; the DOM.(Maybe it was just a bland project, idk :P)

Everything about the 'Cloud' interests me. Everything about data analytics interests me. I also, would like to be an SDE or SDET at a big name company like Microsoft, just because well, long story short, I am the definition of an 'under-dog' when it comes to achievements in life. And well, It's taken me 365 days to go from ""I don't know anything."" to ""I landed my first internship"", and I don't want to stop. (Also everything I read about MSFT is mouth watering, and I think I tend to have a unique insight on people and users that would make me a key asset for them).

Also: I know the spiel. ""Learn general/big picture ideas, don't obsess over one technology/framework. You want to be adaptable and you don't want to be a burnout"", Having gotten that spiel out of the way, do you see a team below that may help me be the ideal software engineer?

1) Enterprise Integration/Pharmacy IT – Joint project: should involve mobile, web services, REST, JSON, OAuth, Apigee, CA LISA, Splunk, Android Dev, Cloud principles &amp; deployment

2) Enterprise Data and Analytics/ Enterprise Systems Quality and Availability – Joint project: MS SQL, SSIS or Informatica, Qlikview, possibly .Net or C#, Concepts: Analytics, UI Design, API Integration, Analytic Engine – Qlik.Sense (new product in the market) UI Design – Javascript, .NET (MVC)

3) Enterprise Data and Technology solutions: NET MVC application, UX design, Jquery, WCF services, SQL DB and core .NET technologies

4) Microsoft .NET, C#, SQL Server, IIS

5) Enterprise Data and Analytics - Oracle 12g RDBMS, Informatica Power Centre, IBM Big Insights (Hadoop), QlikView, Unix/Linux, R (possibly), IBM Integration Bus (possibly)

6) Enterprise Data and Analytics -- Hadoop and associated tools (Map Reduce, Hive, Sqoop, Flume, etc.), Python, R, SAS, SQL

7) CRM: IBM Enterprise Marketing Management Data Management: Oracle, Netezza, Informatica, SQL

 8) SalesForce.com, Informatica, Datapower ___

how lenient is admissions on that requirement?

I'm currently finishing my first quarter as a sophomore at a community college, and will be transferring (hopefully if accepted) to a university next year.

Please excuse any ill placed or wrong information, I'm the first person in my family to go to college and have had to handle this situation all by myself.

Anyways down to why I'm posting, I'm a really progress driven person. I suffer from many different forms of anxiety and lately they have really taken a toll on me. I sit in my room a lot and just play games, edit photos, or something else. I feel like I'm not really making progress (in life). I have a 3.35 GPA, which will be going up, it's just being dragged down by one grade that'll be fixed through one of our college programs.

First of all, I'm a bit worried about my GPA. I feel as though it's rather low.

Second of all, I'm planning on majoring in Criminal Justice (Specifically computer forensics) and was wondering what jobs or internships I should be looking into to help myself further down the line. I work 30 hours a week doing a job that is completely irrelevant (similar to valet parking) to my degree, and I want something that'll prove beneficial in the future. 

On top of these 30 hours I'm a full time student, so really I'm just wondering out of all this information that I just ranted about, where should I seek improvement. Most of all, what jobs should I look into intern wise?

Thanks all, I'm sure I missed a ton of info since this was a rant so ask away."
2p2lo8,1,2014-12-12,"Incoming FT offer from an awesome company, but I'm scared I was dishonest with them on my resume. Should I come clean?",paranoidcsthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2p2lo8/incoming_ft_offer_from_an_awesome_company_but_im/,"A company I'm really excited about has extended a full-time offer to me, and I'm planning to accept it. However, I'm worried about the background check. Two years ago when I was in university I did unpaid development for a tiny non-profit during a summer. They have only one or two other engineers iirc and work primarily with tablets and mobile devices. Anyways, it was the only opportunity I had at the time, so I took it to gain experience. I churned out a decent amount of code, had some face to face meetings with the founder during which I presented my work to him, and all in all, it was a neat experience and he enjoyed working with me. 

However, I listed this as a 'Software Engineering Internship' on my resume. Is this an outright lie? It was unpaid, but I guess when I initially wrote my resume I didn't really think there was a distinction between volunteer work and an internship since I only worked over a summer for the founder.  Am I screwed?  Should I tell the company I want to join about this? I'm getting nervous since I'd rather not be unceremoniously rejected after I've come so far.  

It's worth noting I still have all the code I wrote in a private github repository, and I have a random archived email between the founder and I discussing a meeting we were planning to have where I would show my code to him, as well as a position at a different company he wanted to offer me. So I have these two pieces of evidence to prove I did in fact 'work' for him. I just think I've deceived on my resume with the Intern description. I should mention that the rest of my resume is 100% honest.  What should I do? "

- Remotely install apps (not creating a catalog and manually installing but hit a button and the app will install).

If you have knowledge of any systems that hit any of these requirements please let me know. Thanks.

Edit: the current system that I'm using is a combination of Cisco's Meraki and ScreenTime (Android App). It's not perfect, there are a few bugs, but it's a good system if anyone is looking to securely manage a few devices.

I've been working in IT for a while now and I feel like I'm sick of it. Sometimes I'm still interested in the things that drew me to it in the first place, but right now it seems like all I do is put out fires. A few months ago I had an interest in moving to the infrastructure side of things but have since let my work on that trail off. I just feel like starting over for me is not an option - my resume has been a disastrous cobbling of internships, contracts, etc that span retail, to IT to mechanical &amp; applications engineering, back to IT. I feel like I don't have any more time if i want to set myself up to make a lucrative living in a few years if I switch professions again, and nothing seems appealing to me anyway. 

I've read a lot of resources that say that work/life balance is key to avoiding burnout. Well, I have no significant other or family to make it all worth it at the end of the day, and with how much I've moved and the current place I'm living in, a pet is not an option. I have started looking into creative outlets but feel like I'm missing out on a connection with other people. I'm tired of the fact that the only people I know since I moved are my roommates, a friend I barely see, and coworkers. I've led such an empty life until now and I have no idea what to do about it. I'm starting to think my whole life will only be work, because it's the only thing I can at least have some control over. No one wants to stick around me, I don't relate to other young people; it's just me and the machines and now I'm even tired of them, too. 

I'm not in a position to just walk but I feel like that's all I want to do. But I don't even know where I would be walking. I'm sick of my entire life and all the mistakes that I've made along the way that have locked me into a profession that I'm not sure if I want anymore.  I feel like I never even got a chance to lead a real life, and now what? I don't know where to start trying to piece one together, and if I don't shape up soon I'll lose the one thing that was finally going for me. "

I'm 29 and living and working in the south. I'd really love to move to Seattle though. I have a bachelor's degree in accounting. I've been with my current company since 2007. I started as an intern and finished college in 2008 at the height of the recession. I had a terrible time finding permanent work and just stuck on as a temp until they finally gave me a full time position in late 2009. My job is pretty secure for the next few years at least, but I seriously doubt the place will be around long enough for me to retire from here. I work for a defined benefit pension fund that's headed for insolvency in about 15 years. Defined benefit pensions aren't a very big industry anymore, so I doubt I'll get hired on at another fund. I could ride it out, but I really don't want to be looking for work at age 40-45 only ever having worked at one company all of my adult life. 

I'm socially anxious and awkward, but it usually fades once I get used to people. It's more of an issue with interviewing and meeting new people than an ongoing impediment to getting my work done once I'm started. I've been in therapy before, but I don't think it helped all that much.

I've done standard staff accountant stuff like bank and general ledger recons, made journal entries, processed accounts payable, etc. I've done a few internal audit projects to find issues where we've paid people incorrectly. We administer an HRA (medical reimbursement) plan too. In the past I've helped process claims for that, and I still provide participant support for people who have questions about denied claims and need help understanding the rules and getting the correct documentation to get paid. I've made some process improvement suggestions that have been implemented regarding the way we issued payments. I'm good with excel and know how to use pivot tables. I have some knowledge of SQL and can do queries and joins, but I don't know much beyond that. I've also kind of fallen into the role of first line IT, so if someone had an issue, I try to solve it before turning it over to the company that handles our IT stuff. I've also been put in charge of handling the office phone system, so when we get new people or the workflow changes, I reconfigure the system to make sure calls get routed correctly.

I've felt pretty anxious just considering the move, but I know I can't stay here forever. I have about $40k in savings and some more in my retirement accounts that I could access if need be. It's difficult to consider leaving too because my current job, although boring, is pretty low stress. I work less than 40 hours per week and get 4 weeks of vacation. I think I could be useful in a lot of places, but I don't think I have any skills that anyone is going to do a cross country hire for. Most likely I'd just have to up and move without a job beforehand if I really do want to relocate. I know the job market has improved since 2009, but the whole experience of constant rejection really shattered my confidence. I really feel like it's getting to be time to move on, but the prospect just up and quitting terrifies me."

I'm starting a project in about a month. It's basically an internship, however I'll need to complete a single project for a company from start to finish with another student. I'd like to get some practice over winter break, ideally by creating an app or something along those lines that would be worthwhile rather than busy work.


For the project, I need to create a database with SQL (something that I have some experience with), and then pool information from different sources into said database (something I do not have experience with) so that it can be displayed in a meaningful way.


Here are some of the things I'll need to use for the project:

* RESTful API

* JSON/SOAP

* ASP.NET/MVC (I have some ASP.NET experience)

* And the project will likely be done primarily in C#, which I have experience with.

The data will be pulled from MyIntervals, Salesforce.com, and Float Schedule.

I'm going to research each of these things individually, but I'd love some sort of rough idea on a project that I could work on for the next month so that I'm better prepared. 

It was suggested that one of us work on the database and another on  pulling the data. Honestly the latter sounds more difficult to me, and for that reason I'm leaning towards volunteering for that (I'd love to impress the company and get a job out of this, which seems possible considering that this will be software that this company uses daily when complete).

Lastly, here's a rough outline of my experience:

* Procedural and Object Oriented Programming with C++

* Object Oriented Programming with C# and Java

* Relay Ladder Logic

* Assembly Programming

* HTML

* XAML

* Visual Studio .Net

* ADO.NET

* ASP.NET

* SQL using SQL Server

Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions!"

I'd like to help as much as I can without becoming their personal CS tutor. 

I tried to start them the same way I learned in college, by teaching them how to setup the servers locally, how to troubleshoot simple errors with the server, etc. I ended up doing all that for them as it seemed a bit beyond their level at the time, based on their blank expressions when I asked if they had any questions. Right now, I've just asked them to concentrate on simply learning one thing (javascript), and just pointed them in the direction of several self-help books, websites, and other resources like MIT CourseWare's Intro to CS vids. At the same time, I've been trying to be available and helpful as much as I can, by giving them direct answers to stuff I probably googled myself, and trying to guide them to figure it out on their own for other stuff. For example, I tell them their SQL statement is throwing an error because the Query Explorer executes everything when you press the green triangle, and you can highlight and execute to execute specific statements. Whereas if I see a typo as being the cause, I let them figure it out on their own.

Honestly, I have no idea wtf to do with this person, as I've got zero teaching experience. But I'd like to help them since I was in a very similar place once. Any tips on what else I can do, and what I shouldn't do, what has/had helped you when you were learning, or anything else?"

My school has an IT degree that is offered in the same department as a separate program. Long story short I'm having difficulty with the math and assembly language programming. I love programming and appreciate the usefulness of CS theory but in many of the classes I've been getting low grades and have had to repeat Calculus. While I'm confident I can graduate in CS I'm not confident I can do so with over a 3.0 GPA. Looking at other people in the IT program I'm struck by how much easier it is, they only have to go up to Trigonometry and have watered down CS, business, and networking classes. 

Right now I'm at the point where I'm one class away from a minor in Computer Science but only 1 credit hour further away from graduating as IT. Because of the way the prerequisite chain works I'm fairly sure I could graduate 1-2 semesters sooner with a significantly higher GPA in IT. If I switch the classes I'd be missing out on would be Programming Languages, a Compiler class, a Computer Architecture class, a Operating Systems class, and Senior Design, as well as the math classes. I recently ran into someone at my school who accepted a full time offer at Google for Software Engineering and is a Biology major. I also know someone who switched from Computer Engineering to IT and accepted a software internship position at Microsoft.

After I graduate I definitely want to get a full time position as a Software Engineer. Looking on many job postings I noticed that the degree requirements are listed as a Bachelor's in CS or related field. So how critical is it to get a CS degree? Is a CS minor good enough and is it worth delaying graduation by up to 1 year to get a CS degree instead of IT?"

Just as some background: I'm a freshman college student interested in an internship over the summer. I recently received a ""coding challenge"" from a company that I dropped my resume to at a career fair via email. They wanted me to implement a fairly simple linear search function in a language of my choosing (python), which I have down, but it's the following that's leaving me scratching my head:
&gt; Please implement the given function, include functional tests and a 1 page test plan for the function. The test plan should include functional testing and go beyond it to other types of testing.

I implemented a bunch of doctests for it (which I assume are 'functional tests'), but I'm really unsure what I should do for the one page test plan, especially since it should include other types of testing. I read about end to end tests, integration tests, and unit tests online, but I feel like the doctests are already unit tests, and integration and end to end tests are not applicable to my situation. If anyone could shed some light as to what I should do, it would be much appreciated.

Here is the full text of the challenge, if it helps:

I've been working an internship in my field for the last 3 months and was recently offered a job starting next year.

So I'm looking for part time work in my off hours to supplement my income.

(Also really long post of what led up to this predicament, sorry.)",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2p7om2/overdue_final_paper_how_do_i_deal_with_my/,"So, just a disclaimer, I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD. I am getting tested over the break. It's something that my parents considered when I was younger, not exactly sure why they didn't do anything about it, asking them when I get home later tonight. I got good grades growing up although looking back at high school, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that classes are just less intensee and you don't need as much of a nuanced understanding of things, especially when writing.

For the first time I've had almost entirely written assignments for my classes after being in engineering until January of last year. Almost every single assignment I've had this semester has been either handed in late or not finished at all. I've never had this problem. I suck at studying, but when it came down to it, I had to show up for the tests. Keep in mind, I absolutely love my classes and finally figured out what I'm passionate about.

My parents think I overburdened myself (finally got involved in activities/activism/have a part time job for the first time/had to get an internship). In reality, I had enough ""free"" time to get all my work done. I just didn't use that time productively. I've been struggling with the issue of whether it is a lack of discipline or an actual disorder, or both (if someone has insight on this subject of discipline as it relates to ADHD, that would be helpful).

Which brings me to my current predicament. I had a 2 week overdue final paper for one class. Professor gave me extra time (without specifying how much time, just told me to focus on my mental health) because I had an anxiety attack after pulling an all-nighter and not finishing it. Still wasted all of Thanksgiving break not writing it and I didn't even go home. So this cut into the time I had to write my final paper for another class. (This is part of why I had so many overdue papers this semester.) It was due Wednesday and I had changed my thesis a few days earlier. I didn't finish my other paper until Monday night and had a final and presentation due that I hadn't started preparing for both on Wednesday. I e-mailed my teacher asking for an extra day on Tuesday night after studying all day. Slept for 4 hours, made my presentation, almost fell asleep during my final.

So now it's Saturday. What happened in the three days I had to write it?

Wednesday: I really don't remember what I did after my final. I think I tried to work for a few hours and then went to sleep with no success.

Thursday: Woke up early to get work done. Roommate had her last final and left, so I stayed home all day instead going to campus. Every hour, I kept realizing how I hadn't gotten anything done. Finally at 10 I realized how screwed I was and that my paper wasn't 8 pages like I thought, but 12-15; I looked at the assignment so many times, yet managed to miss that. I don't know why I got this idea. And I realize it was irresponsible. But one of my good friends has ADHD and has a prescription for Concerta. He told me I should take two. Holy shit. I have never been able to hold onto a thought for more than a few seconds at a time, let alone not have a ton of competing thoughts. I was actually able to think clearly. I don't think the drugs were the motivator, though they helped me to actually become capable of getting work done. I'm not sure though, stress hasn't even seemed to enable me to get this paper done, though that's hopefully what will happen tonight. Anyway, the problem was that I hadn't done any research, though I had some background knowledge. So I was incredibly productive for a solid 4 hours. But it was on making an outline. Specifically, just picking topics for each paragraph. I wrote almost four pages when 6 AM came around. After that, I got stuck. But I was still focused, albeit starving. Dining halls open at 7, figured I'd write the next paragraph and then eat. Decided to sit for another 5 hours trying to write, ended up just developing my ideas more. Eventually the Concerta started wearing off. At first, I just felt fatigued, but then once I came down, my inability to focus seemed to be worse than usual (which makes sense, because lack of sleep). Still stayed in the library trying to write. Continued to develop my ideas and realize I needed an entire theoretical framework to deal with my solution to the problem. Rework my thesis and write a new intro paragraph. Switch some paragraphs around. Had dinner with my old roommate for 2 hours. Back to the library around 9. Flash forward to 3 AM after trying to figure out how to fit so many ideas together, realize I haven't written anything since the morning and only have 5 and a half pages done. E-mailed my professor explaining where I was in the paper and that I'd get it to her before Sunday since grades are due Monday. Problem is, I missed my train this morning. I should've been home around now, but I still have 2 hours to go. I'm going to try to work on it the rest of the train ride, but I figured asking for some advice might be more useful in the long run. I'm sorry about how long this post turned out. Most of this probably wasn't necessary. 

**TL;DR I'm terrified of writing a sub-par paper and feel like I need to consider every single possibility on top of not being aware of time and being unable to focus. I end up spending more time trying to figure out how to write the paper than writing it. It's worth 30% of my grade. I'm on scholarship probation. I feel helpless, but I need to get it done.**"

Right now, I am confronted with two choices for my first job out of school and hoping to get advice from those wiser than I.
  

  &amp;nbsp;

**The blue pill option:**

* Work for an EPC company in the Toronto area
* I need to sign their offer within the next month
* Diversified range of projects available. I will be learning very professional and relevant industry practices
* Above average pay for a new grad in the Toronto area
* I can live at home to save some money
* Able to gain valuable experience to get my PEng designation
* As professional as it gets when it comes to an engineering career
* This is the option my brain wants

  
  &amp;nbsp;

**The red pill option:**

* Work for a start up company in Silicon Valley
* No offer yet, but they gave me a strong recommendation for returning after finishing my internship with them. Will not be hearing anything about job offers until at least march.
* The work is more narrow in scope but closer to what I want to do as an engineer. The work is less by the book (nature of the start up world) and I'm concerned this will not resonate well with more professional engineering firms.
* Environment is more clean and modern
* Cannot get my PEng designation (It seems they aren't too keen in the US, especially in the start up scene)
* If I get laid off in the future then I will be in a difficult situation. The demand for mechanical engineers in Silicon Valley is dubious, especially for Canadians. Further, I will be at a disadvantage if I return home as all my peers will likely have a P.Eng designation at that point.
* More pay than the blue pill option, but this will be marginalized by the substantially higher costs of living
* This is the option my heart wants

  
  &amp;nbsp;

Both choices are great, and I'm very thankful given the context of high new graduate unemployment. I really want to pursue the red pill option but feel irresponsible at the same time."

Unfortunately, I was both lazy and naive in school and didn't value real world experience so I never got an internship in this industry. I gobbled up the lie that my STEM degree was in high demand in all fields and that I'd have no problems getting a job after graduation so I didn't try too much to get an internship. By the time I realized my mistake, I was too far along and couldn't get anything. And now a year after graduation, I'm horribly underpaid and not using my degree hardly at all in a field I have less than zero interest in. Not to mention it took me 7 brutal, depressing months to even get this job. 

The industry I want to get into is very difficult to break into and I just simply don't see how I'm going to get into it at this point without doing something radical like graduate school. This weighs on my mind constantly. Most of my free time is spent trying to think of new ways to get my foot in the door somewhere. I don't enjoy much of anything anymore either. And if I do find something, I almost feel guilty for not working towards my career in some fashion. If this bothers me this much right now, I don't see how it'll get any better in the future. I'm terrified that I'm going to turn into just another person going through the motions of life because his dreams didn't quite pan out and he has to pay the bills so he sticks with the shit job that lets him barely scrape by. 

Settling for just any old job absolutely terrifies me and I feel like its being forced on me regardless of how much I fight back. It seems that my laziness in college my cost me the career I've always wanted. Graduate school seems like the only path that offers a glimmer of hope right now. I could go back and do it like I should have done undergrad. Get involved in clubs, get an internship, make industry connections through research, etc. The problem I'm facing now is my borderline crippling fear of failure. What if I can't even get into grad school? What if I do get in but can't get myself to do all the stuff I need to? What if I can't break out of my laziness? Basically the life I envision myself having in graduate school would be a complete 180 from life in undergrad and I'm not sure I'm confident in my ability to make such a dramatic change. 

What do you guys think? Should I learn to just be happy with what I have and kind of forget about my old dreams? "

* 29 Year old Male
* Will be finishing community college this summer after 5 years of slogging it.
* Have had 5-10 different jobs. Some with people, some office, some start-up, some bad ones like call center.
* Comes from Denmark. College and University is free, government pays 840 USD/670 Euro per month for studying. Major life upgrade when Copenhagen is currently one of the 10th most expensive places to live in the world.
* Don't know what I want to do in life. Sorta has made me depressed in the last few years. Having a mid life crisis when friends are finishing up their Masters and some are having kids. I'm nowhere. Just floating and ignorant.
* I like graphic design. I've been toying around in Photoshop since I was 12 and have had some fun and solid unpaid internships, but I feel the lack of degree is keeping me from progressing. 
* I did a 8½ film course, that was great. It was practical hands on education, and I loved it. But working in the film industry turned out to be crazy and very exploitative. 
* I was among the last 60 applicants out of a prestigious graphic design programme, that had over 1000 applicants but didn't get selected.
* Am dyslexic, but honestly I have to blame my lack of interest in subjects. I like to learn and am easily distracted. People say I know many interesting things, but I seem to do mediocre in school. Makes sense considering I don't study effectively or spend my time prioritizing school. 
* Only thing I really want to do is to travel and see if I can find myself, but I know that a year of backpacking will put me back where I started. Great experiences, but I've heard from others who have done the same, that it doesn't mean you know what you want to do career wise.
* I'm insecure about going to university because I don't want to have my undergrad when I'm 33-34 when everyone around me are in their early 20s. People tell me that I cannot be hanged up on that, but it's a major insecurity and I am ashamed of it. 
* Some people tell me the art degrees like design are not worth it, and that I should just wing it and build a great portfolio as I can learn everything online, which is true. But as others have told me, many career firms won't look at my resume with no degree because having a degree also shows that you can follow a program, deadlines and be a team player in an institution. That makes sense. I just wish it wasn't true!
* People ask me what interests me, and I always say Martial Arts. But its a passion I have had to give up as I have had horrific chronic injuries that keep me from it. I've been considering doing Yoga Teacher Training instead in India, as its sorta related and is something I could do. It probably wouldn't pay all the bills, but it would be a path.
* Besides being dyslexic I'm also terrible with numbers. So terrible I have problems (anxiety) with standing at a cash register. It's not that I can't do it, or do math in my head, but I don't like it. It's a weird thing to be insecure about, but it has kept me from jobs in retail, supermarkets and such. 
* I've been considering studying at the open university part time. I could get a degree in Design in 6 years, its not free, but its cheaper than many others, I could do it all via distance learning so I could travel, but the perks of being danish - the 840 USD per month are not allowed for e-learning based education and not for education that is part time either. Studying e-learning at the open university part-time costs around 4500 USD per year. It's money, but not as much as a full university would be. 
*I don't wish to remain in Denmark. Maybe I am running away, but I want to get out. I'm wondering if I should use my 25K USD to use to relocate to another country like Australia or Malaysia and start over, while doing my open university degree.
* My parents want me to stay in Denmark and get a degree here, but I am too embarrassed and feel like a loser. My 20s have passed me by half assing it, and I don't feel like I can ever catch up. Besides that I dont know if Design is a good road to pursue.

**TL;DR - Depressed privileged student, feels inadequate about wasting his 20's and half arsing it. Comparing himself to his peers he gives up and becomes so stressed that he doesn't have the strength to go for it. He wants to travel Asia and see the world, but also knows that he needs a degree. The things he is good at (Martial Arts, film) tends to not be jobs that can lead to the stable career he wants. Being Danish, he has certain privileges in regards to free education and monthly allowance from the government if he studies at a danish university. He has 25k from an apartment he is ending his lease on, and while the current plan has been to backpack for a year to find himself, he is now weighing the possibility of relocating to a country like Thailand, Mayalsia, Vietnam or Australia, trying to study and work at the same time.**"

In classes we tend to focus narrowly on one kind of software, like Netbeans, or SQL Developer. But when it comes to self-directed study, the options are overwhelming.

drupal, joomla, maven, gradle, wordpress, intelliJ, sharepoint codeigniter, mysql, hadoop, mongo, access, visual studio, ruby on rails, node.js, XAMPP, aptana studio, linux

That's like 5% of the stuff I've seen mentioned frequently, just what I can remember off the top of my head. I research things individually, but it's very hard to compare things that I've never used and barely understand, or to know their value. And it's very hard to answer some of the most important questions, like:

What is going to help my fundamental understanding of the programming landscape?

What is going to provide me with the best transferable skills?

What programs are the most synergistic?

Which are most in demand in the marketplace?

What general categories of programs should I focus most on learning?

So far I've just been learning languages, and using one piece of associated software. As someone who would like to land an internship fairly soon, what categories of programming software should I be familiar with? I understand things like IDE's and web application frameworks, but a lot of the programs I google I can barely even understand the functions of.

So I guess my questions are:

What are the general categories of programming software?

What are some of the most valuable programs to learn for general understanding and transferable skills?"

2pc0sj,94,2014-12-15,For all feeling frustrated with getting an internship/full time,cowgod2007,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2pc0sj/for_all_feeling_frustrated_with_getting_an/,"Whats up guys, I regularly see on this sub ""help, I'm a good student but a bad test taker"" or ""I suck at these algorithms but I do well in coding!"" or ""I'm horrible at interviews because I can't come up with the solutions quick enough"" or something to that effect. 

Let me say I've been in the same boat.

I've gotten interviews with Apple/Microsoft/Facebook/Google etc you name it. And I did very poorly on most of them. I thought ""I'm a bad test taker"" and ""I can't think well under pressure"". Then I realized I'm not the smartest guy and that was ok. What took someone about an hour to understand might have taken me 2 hours. I just realized I needed to double down my work ethic and get the studying done. I literally surrounded myself with practice questions and concepts for a long time, repeating them and figuring out new problems without looking at answers. (Hint! Don't look at any solution for a week. If you really can't figure it out, take a look at the answer a week later).

I'm not amazing at algorithms/problem solving/etc but I'm still studying hard. Out of college, I got a six figure job in Seattle area. You can do it, you just have to maybe study harder than your friend who get's straight A's and Google internships without trying. And you might land lower. But everyone is different.

Some tricks I've learned:
See a logn in the runtime? Divide and conquer!
Sorts are your best friend.
Know how to black box a lot of algorithms (you can learn specifics later)
Try to come up with your OWN hard problem around a concept (i.e. BFS question: print out every node's value and the level it is on)
Off by one errors can kill you, always check them.

To be honest, a lot of this stuff is SUPPOSED to weed you out. If you're not smart, then your only option is to work harder. Don't feel discouraged about getting weeded out, just show them next time how much you've improved. 

Also for the mods, if this post doesn't belong here, let me know and I'll take it down. Thanks and good luck!"

Socially retarded for 10+ years and now have no reasons to live.,gameoverlife,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2pd289/graduated_and_unemployed_socially_retarded_for_10/,"On the face of it I am doing well: I achieved top grades at school and got a CS degree from a prestigious university and have had two internships at reputable places. I was offered entry into a graduate scheme but turned it down because I frankly see no reason to continue a life of endless suffering.

I am 23 now and in the last 5 months since graduation I have done absolutely nothing. I am living with my mother who I haven't spoken to since my 23rd birthday back in January. I have always suffered from shyness/social anxiety but the problem is peaking due to the current circumstances and I feel even more paralysed. I have never been part of a social circle, I have two good friends and that is it (for the last decade). I don't speak to anyone anymore and know that I would struggle to form relationships on the job as I have been socially inert for too long.

I regret all my life choices, especially thinking that working hard and getting a solid degree would eventually pay off. Yes, I could probably live comfortably but I hate the fact that I haven't LIVED at all - 10 years of birthdays alone at home, studying, playing games and watching netflix while others mingle, travel, work hard/play hard etc. A lot of people my age are beginning to settle down after a fulfilling youth while I have literally 0 life experience. I loathe anything to do with software engineering now, everytime I look at anything programming related it is like seeing the embodiment of what ruined my life even though it isn't really the problem. 

The last month or so has been a breaking point. I punched a hole in the window, kicked down two doors and have suicidal thoughts every day. My mother just watches on helplessly wondering what on earth happened to a boy that was seemingly normal until last year. I saw a psychotherapist who started discussing CBT but I couldn't see it becoming helpful.

I would really appreciate any life advice. I can only see two options: 1) Just get my shit together and apply to whatever socially isolated desk job a mentally unstable CS grad can get and try to live as long as possible. 2) Travel the world, get some life experience (I have the money) and try to gain some social skills before coming back here with a big red flag over my employment history (I took a gap year before university with the ambition to travel but ended up doing nothing productive). 

Neither option is ideal. My only desire is to be part of a network of people. People to talk to on facebook, people to go out with and people to work with. Unfortunately I am so different from other people that it is incredibly difficult. If this isn't going to happen in my life then there is simply no point in living.

I work as an intern at a particle physics lab, and one of the things I do is process large quantities of beam data, and I was hoping to be able to eventually get to the point where I can process data files and essentially set Java up to give me excel files with the specific information I need. However, I am running into tons and tons of problems that get so technical that I don't even know where to begin.

I have been learning actual java code for some time now, but I've never done anything with build paths, or tons of imports, or .jar libraries, and it is all incredibly overwhelming, if anybody could possibly help me sort through these mountains of information you would literally be making my job about 80% easier.

Basically in order to achieve this excel manipulating goal, I have a few questions.

1) Can I manipulate excel files through Bluej? Or will it simply not work, because everywhere I look up recommends eclipse, and I've tried to use it but its horribly complicated and I'm drastically unfamiliar with it.

2)Downloading either jxl or apache poi, how do I do it, where do I extract the files to, and how to get bluej (or whatever editor) to recognize them.

3) How do I know what I need to import at the top of a class? It seems like every example I see has like 10 imports, and it is never explained where they are coming from or why they are being imported.

Basically, as far as I am concerned, if I can use blueJ to create a blank excel workbook, that would be 90 percent of the work at this time. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, or if I'm merely asking the wrong questions that would be great to know as well."

I then worked at a hotel on the beach for the summer doing pool and beach side service for the wealthy upper class. Everyone there was young and reckless and partying after work and hooking up with eachother. It felt like high school...I thought, I kinda liked this.


Fast forward to 4 year college...I had nightmares of trying to get back into computer programming/networking again so I looked for something else to major in. I figured ""I liked working at that hotel this summer, maybe I'll do this major of Hospitality and Tourism Management"". Ill skip the boring stuff but it lead to years of group projects about branding businesses, managing hotels (like you can learn that from a book), 2 required internships working a front desk reception (which was a nightmare) and filing papers and handing out candy at trade shows for a big hotel brand name (some fancy hotel in San Francisco). Once again, I couldn't tell you a single word that I learned from those years of school.

Fast forward about 6 years...I have worked at 3 different hotel chains working the following positions:

* Concierge (1 year)

* Reservations Agent (1 year)

* Convention Services Coordinator (3 years)

The convention services coordinator position was definitely the most professional job I have ever had. However, after 3 years I put in my two weeks notice when my manager left the business to battle breast cancer and the higher ups made me do her work at no extra pay or compensation. The Director of sales told me the hotel could not afford to hire a task force in her absence and asked me to share her work load (at no extra pay mind you, even after asking for a raise). This means I was in control of corporate events of 30 - 200 people at my hourly of $16 an hour! A task that people could easily be making between 45k - 80k a year AND THEY WOULDN'T give me a raise...I stressed, I battled it out in my head, I did it for a while, and I got fed up and put in my two weeks notice.

I now work as a tour guide part-time to (barely) pay the bills while I try and figure out what the hell to do with my life. Don't get me wrong, being a tour guide has some really fun days, but the closer I get to 30 I feel like I'm in high school starting all over again...

To wrap this all up, I feel cornered in the hospitality industry. I am absolutely excellent at it, but the pay is not there unless I decide to become a Director of Sales, CS Manager, or GM but I just don't see myself doing these things deep down inside my heart. I'm scared of paying to go back to school and starting over. I'm scared of working at hotels for under-payed hourly for the rest of my life. I'm scared of diving into my hobbies of photography and music production because they are a ""waste of time at this point"". Two of my best friends are making almost 6 figures at age 28, I feel embarrassed at what  I do. 

I don't know how to grow up and take control of what I want out of life. I don't know what I want in life..."

So I'm a junior CS major and I've had one internship with IBM before (in security) and I enjoyed it. However, I didn't do much software development and that is what I am really passionate about learning and getting better at.

I have a phone call lined up with IBM Extreme Blue and I'm really nervous. The first call is just a screening phone call but after that I have a technical one. I've never had a technical interview before and I am really spooked. I've been going through Hacker Rank and trying to solve problems (à la something like an Amazon data structures-driven interview) but some people I've spoken to about Extreme Blue said that they interview in a completely different process.

This could be both good and bad for me, as I'm not as brushed up on data structures as I'd like to be.

If you have any experience with the IBM Extreme Blue interview process and what I could brush up on to really stand out I would appreciate it greatly! Also, if you can tell me about the internship that would be a major bonus.

Thanks a lot guys."
2pej89,0,2014-12-15,I am thinking of eventually getting my masters in Comp Sci because I hate my job. My undergrad is in Finance. Is there a decent possibility that I can get an entry level job somewhere? What would that type of job look like?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2pej89/i_am_thinking_of_eventually_getting_my_masters_in/,"

Firstly I’d like to apologize if this question isn’t appropriate for this sub. It seems like most of the questions here deal with more specific problems with code and algorithms but I’m not sure where else to ask.

 

Here is my background info:

 

I hate my job and my undergrad is in Finance. I want to get a degree in Computer Science and I discovered from some professors at the University I can attend that getting a Bachelor’s or Master’s would be a similar number of classes because of the way the prereqs work (the Bachelor’s requires classes like physics and other tangentially related classes). I currently don’t have any experience doing “real” coding with a “real” language but I have done a lot with VBA and I love it. I know I’m starting at the bottom in terms of knowledge which is why I’ll be taking up to a dozen prereqs as a non-degree seeking student so I can apply to be in the master’s program. Being non-degree seeking might be a problem because it seems like most internships require the student to be “degree seeking” regardless of the number or type of classes being taken.


How likely would it be for me to get some sort of entry level job in the industry considering that internships might not be an option? What do you think my best path forward might be? I understand that I probably will need more classes and knowledge before finding anything but I want to get any type of job as quickly as possible. I live in Orlando, FL if that matters.

I am a 2013 college graduate from the midwest. I had a programming internship at a small company (200 people, maybe?) during the entirety of my senior year of college. After about 6 months through my internship they told me they were going to offer me a full time job after I graduated. I really loved what I was doing and the people I worked with, so much so, that I didn't really apply anywhere during my last semester of college. As such when they finally offered me a full time position, it was WAY lower than I was expecting it to be. They offered me 32k a year to be a full time software developer. Unfortunately I still needed experience and I figured I could stick around a few months and see what happened.

6 months in, they gave me a 6% raise. About 6 months after that I asked for another raise because I was going to be leading a new project they had scheduled (it was a measly $1000 raise and I was less than impressed).I'm currently a full-time C#.NET Software Developer making $37,000 USD. The problem for me is that I love my job. I love what I'm working on and the people I work with (for the most part) however I could be making almost 20k-30k more in a nearby city. I spoke with a few coworkers and they're making a lot more than I am for doing similar work (admittedly one has 2 more years of experience, the other one has 10 more years of experience).

I have a review in the upcoming week and I am tempted to ask for another raise. The last time I asked for a raise they gave me a 1,000 dollar raise (and to be honest, I was a bit offended by that). Should I ask again at my review? Or should I not give them any more opportunities to hose me and just leave? 

I sort of think I'm being played but I'm really torn because I love the area and my local friend group. I'd hate to leave and miss all of that.

The department was small and and was implementing a new training program.  Everyone told me that I would need to catch on quickly but that had never been a problem for me before.  I struggled and resources that were supposed to be there for me were often busy doing other things.  Eventually, I was told they were not happy with how I was progressing and was let go.

I was only with this company for 5 months.  I feel like I should include the experience and talk through what I have learned.  However, I acknowledge it does not make me look the greatest and was curious if there is some sort of standard practice I am unaware of.

I was sexually assaulted by a boss about 6 years ago, came down with PTSD as a result which literally ruined what I had worked my whole life to achieve. When this occurred I had just gotten out of an internship in congress, had held multiple student council and other extracurricular positions, maintained a 4.0 for the first two years after transferring with a 3.75(after two years) and was making friends of movers and shakers left and right in the District of Columbia. I was really making a promising life, but then I met this guy. He was my boss and owned the cafe where I worked evenings to fit my school and extracurricular activities. This occurred in DC. He took a liking to me, and I knew it, but I always kept him at arms length. When I was working on my final project during my second year at university I had gotten little sleep and was up two days in a row, was stressed out and had been working and studying so much I didn't really have a lot of friends. So he asked me out for a drink, after a month or two of being refused, I finally said yes, thinking that he was my boss after all and things should be fine. He befriended me and after a couple of weeks, he convinced me to quit my job and work for him as a manager in which position I would be making more money and working similar hours, and I took it. It turned out that first off he lied and did not get me the manager position he promised when the then current manager left, as it was understood. Furthermore, around this time, this man would insist I stay after work for a drink, continually fill it, drug me up with cocaine he pushed on me and make sexual advances on me. I really didn't know what to do. I was kind of afraid to say no and I really needed the job. I was afraid to admit it and he genuinely seemed like my friend at first. 

  I have suffered terribly from this. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, have dropped out of school three times following, cannot trust anybody, have a hard time holding a job or finding one, have cut off the majority of family and friends, have $80,000 in student loan debt, can't afford therapy and don't have health insurance, my credit's gotten terrible and I'm hardly holding off a nervous breakdown and suicide like 90 percent of the time and burnt all my bridges in the aftermath. 

But I don't know what to do about this. Do I need to hire a tort Lawyer? I'm terribly ashamed and afraid that I won't be able to emotionally handle the humiliation of a trial. I can hardly write this and it took me six years. Please let me know any legal advice you have and I really appreciate it.

2pfoys,1,2014-12-15,Considering taking a semester off for an internship - would this be a bad idea?,partisparti,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2pfoys/considering_taking_a_semester_off_for_an/,"Hey, guys.  I'll try to keep this post as concise as possible.  I'm not really even sure if this is the best subreddit for this question so if there is a better place for it please let me know.

Essentially, here is the situation I find myself in.  I am currently a senior in college - however, I was a finance major for my first two semesters, and of the 28 credits I earned in that major, only 1 credit (some random elective) was from a class that is also an option for CompSci majors.  That effectively set me back a year in my major (switched after freshman year) though I have done a fair job of getting caught back up to where I would be had I started in computer science.  Partly due to that circumstance and partly due to my own inability to just grow up for some time after, I got pretty far behind in terms of internships and other extracurriculars.  Where most of my buddies had internships during the summer of their sophomore or junior year, I didn't really take charge and get my act together until relatively recently.

So, I finally took the time to put together a quality resume and apply for some internships a few weeks ago.  I was pretty worried because my grades really aren't that great - I'm at about a 2.9 now (to be fair though, my ""technical"" GPA is a lot better, probably closer to a 3.5 FWIW).  I suppose I lucked out, however, as my university has a very good career services network.  I was contacted a few weeks ago regarding a technical writing position with a relatively local company, and after interviewing on site this morning they offered me an internship position this afternoon.

There is a caveat, however, that I only learned about in the interview earlier today.  They are looking for someone to start in January, and given the location it would not be possible for me to continue school and take the internship.  

So I've spent the evening discussing my options with my parents and thinking about what I would like to do and I really think the internship would be an excellent experience.  My uneducated guess is that a technical writing position may not be the best in terms of padding my resume; however, I think it would be a great fit for me personally as writing is another of my strengths (as well as something I really enjoy doing).  Furthermore, the woman who was primarily responsible for designing the software that I will spend a lot of time documenting is pretty brilliant from what I can tell, and I think that the opportunity to spend a lot of time discussing her own software with her would really give me some valuable insight on the thought processes of an experienced member of the field.  In short, while I am trying to be wary of just jumping on the first internship offer I received, I genuinely think I'd be a great fit for the position.

That being said I wanted to bounce the idea off some of you who have some experience not just in the field but really with careers in general.  I've always been under the impression that the work experience from an internship is vastly more helpful than most of the stuff I will learn in the classroom, but I could be wrong about that.  I'm just a bit nervous to make the decision because after going 7 consecutive semesters it feels pretty strange to be considering taking a break for one, even if it is to do an internship.  I have to admit however that my living situation this year is what I would call ""sub-optimal"", as my roommate basically sits on the couch smoking and watching TV all day and I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't like to get out of that environment.  I don't want that to influence any feedback you guys can provide, however; mostly I just mention it to demonstrate that if there were an ideal time for me to change things up for a bit this would be it.

To be honest I'm kind of having trouble coming up with reasons that I shouldn't do this, which is why I'm making this post.  The main drawback obviously is that I will delay my graduation date by a semester which only leaves more time for the ever-increasing volume of graduating CS majors to take jobs, but given that my current experience with an actual job related to the field is approximately zilch I'm inclined to believe that the trade-off is worth it.  I'm hoping you guys can provide me with some perspective as far as that is concerned.  I don't know if this is much of a factor, but as a result of my efforts to get caught up with my degree I'm currently slated to graduate in December of next year, and the internship would push that to May of the following year.  I have heard that graduating in December can sometimes be less than ideal because a lot of companies aren't recruiting as heavily at that time.  Again, however, I don't really know how this works in practice but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Since I've already failed to keep this post relatively brief I'll just wrap it up there.  Thanks in advance for any advice you can give, I really appreciate it.

**TL;DR:**  I'm a senior but I'm essentially ""junior status"" in my CS major as I switched after freshman year.  Haven't had an internship or any job in the field and I have just received an offer for one which I think will be well-suited to my strengths, but it starts in January as opposed to being in the summer so I would take this semester off school.  Is it worth delaying my graduation in order to get some much-needed experience in an actual work environment?

**Edit:** Really quickly I want to gloss over a point I forgot to mention in my original post.  One thing I have heard mentioned and been warned about regarding this issue is that oftentimes students who do this will end up being offered an official position with the company they interned at which leads them to not go back and finish their degree, often having bad results down the line.  While it is impossible for me to predict the future I just want to mention that I am very aware of this possibility and I have *every* intention of returning to school immediately after completing the internship, and I have discussed that briefly with the manager as well.  While I maintain that I believe this is an excellent opportunity for me I still don't think I've even scratched the surface in terms of what I could do with my degree and I would like to explore as many different options as possible before making any long-term decisions.  Like I said I do know this is something that happens often to people who are in my position but I have simply invested too much of my time and money into my education to even consider dropping it or even indefinitely postponing it in lieu of an early full-time position."

2phaoj,9,2014-12-16,The 7 most important elements to consider when selecting a program,MBALink_Lawrence,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/2phaoj/the_7_most_important_elements_to_consider_when/,"Selecting an MBA program is no easy task. There are lots out there, and lets be honest... going by the info that the school's put out, it can be pretty tough to find meaningful differences. Ultimately most of us will end up applying to a number of programs (my recommendation is at least 5 (will explain why in another post)) and end up letting the schools do a lot of the thinking for us.

Here are some handy shorthand tips on the most important things to consider when selecting your program.

1) Duration

With some exceptions, MBA programs based in the USA are going to be 2 year programs beginning in August or September and ending in the May or June with a summer in between where you'll have the opportunity to do an internship.

Most programs outside of the USA will be 1 year programs, beginning in the fall or in January. There are a number of reasons for this, but the key thing to understand is that these are fundamentally different programs.

For one thing, the average age at 1 year programs will be higher. 1 year programs are designed for people who are typically more advanced in their careers, have more industry and possibly management experience, and need less support in their job search. They are also relatively cheaper, especially from an opportunity cost perspective.

2 year programs offer better opportunities for networking, tend to have stronger school culture, better learning opportunities and a more transformational experience overall. Of course, you have to spend 2 years there, and if you're already 33, the 1 year MBA may be a great option.

2) Location

The location of a program is going to have a massive effect on the culture of the school and the kinds of opportunities you'll be exposed to. Location will also have a massive effect on how much you enjoy your time at the school and going back for visits, which is something lots of applicants probably don't consider!

If you're applying to a school in a location you're not familiar with, visiting the location is definitely ideal, but at the very least do PLENTY of research. Aside from the broader culture of the location and its influence on the school you'll be attending, realize that schools in urban and rural environments offer pretty vastly different experiences.

3) Class size

This can vary a lot, and seem to be trending upwards across schools on the whole. HBS is typically considered to have the largest class size with its 900 students, although INSEAD and HULT have more across their various campuses.

Smaller class sizes tend to offer more cohesive cultures with the opportunity to build closer and more meaningful relationships, while larger class sizes offer more diversity and probably even more importantly, a larger alumni base with better coverage in niche industries.

4) Associated University (if there is one)

I think this is a hugely important factor that is often overlooked. I won't name names here, but we all know that there are some MBA programs that are considered very strong that are held within Universities that are, by most other measures, pretty unexceptional. Similarly, there are some ultra elite universities that have MBA programs that are considered just ok. There are also standalone business schools that are not part of any University at all.

All of these need to be considered carefully. When you go to a business school, you will definitely have opportunities to collaborate with people in other schools. Especially if you are entrepreneurially inclined; the eager, brilliant and business skill lacking students in other grad programs and even undergraduates can be a gold mine of collaborative opportunity. This is not even to mention the chance to take some really awesome classes you wish you had taken in undergrad!

But perhaps even more importantly, when you get an MBA from a school associated with a University, you are a legit alum of that university for life. Applicants know this, and the selectivity of schools often contradicts their rankings for this reason.

5) Ranking

You'll notice how low on the list this is. It's not an accident.

Look, let's not be naive. Not every schools is created equal and you should always try to go to the best school you can get into, but within some fairly well established tiers, you're WAY better off selecting your school on other criteria. I think this is a topic that has been covered to death so I'm not really interested in going too much deeper on it here, but happy to share thoughts in the comments if prompted.

I will leave with this though, don't form a preference for a higher ranked school because of its ranking. If you don't understand the reasons why it's a superior school you are being played by magazines for ad money.

6) Culture

Each and every school has a unique culture that is influenced by all of the factors mentioned here, as well as their history, leadership and a million other nuanced factors. Being able to express a nuanced understanding of a school's culture and accurately identify what makes you a good fit is one of the skills I teach that lets applicants punch above their weight.

I'll go into just a little more detail on how to do this in my next post, but for now I am assuming you are early in the school selection phase and just trying to narrow down your choices. To that end, I believe there is one continuum along which most schools fit that will have the most dramatic effect on their culture.

That is the collaborative/competitive continuum. Every school will claim to be collaborative while no school will use the word competitive, but in reality schools tend to fall more so on one side or the other.

Collaborative schools are more communal and reject rock star personalities (either in the application process, or during the program itself). They will have, on average, more ideologically liberal students and alumni. Competitive schools are more individualistic and aggressive. Certain softer personalities can get overwhelmed in such an environment. Competitive schools will have, on average, more ideologically conservative students. Larger schools tend to be more competitive while smaller schools tend to be more collaborative, but not on a 1:1 basis and there are exceptions.

You probably don't need me to tell you which schools are which, but I'll weigh in if appropriate.

7) Specialization

Contrary to popular belief, most of the top schools do a pretty good job of being well rounded. Yes, Wharton definitely has a strong reputation within Finance and Kellogg is well known as a leader in Marketing, but unless you are both a super strong candidate and very sure of what industry you want to spend your career in, you shouldn't be using this as a top consideration.

That said, when looking at the non-elite schools it can make a world of difference. There are schools outside of the top tier that have very respectable footholds in certain areas of specialization that can really increase the value of the program if you can't get into the very best programs. This can often take a little more research as some of these opportunities are not obvious but they are out there!


Looking forward to your comments and feedback

It's my first internship so I was very excited about it, but I'm starting to really dread coming here. I feel like it's not the best work environment. The boss yells at people when they don't do things right and he can just be really condescending when you don't know how to do something.I haven't been yelled at but it is extremely uncomfortable having to listen to him yell at others, and it makes me afraid to ask for help because I feel like he'll make me feel stupid. I literally just sat there once for thirty minutes wondering if I should ask him a question and I was literally terrified and was freaking out inside. I've also been working on the same task for five days and haven't been able to figure it out and it's driving me crazy. Like I'm not a genius programmer but I've done decently in all my programming classes but this stuff is just not coming out the way it's supposed to. I guess this last part isn't a good reason to hAte my job since I know that being stuck on something comes with the job sometimes, but I m starting to physically hate working ok this. I have a summer internship lined up with a big company, but I figured having two internships would look really good and be good for experience but I am so tired of coming to this place.

I'm on track to getting an internship at Facebook this summer as a Production Engineer. I made it through the first interview (coding, algorithms, data structures) and will be taking my final interview later this week. The final interview will be on Systems Admin.

Here's the position I'm interviewing for: https://www.facebook.com/careers/department?req=a0IA000000CzJQhMAN

How would you guys recommend I prepare for this interview? Its definitely not a coding interview and my recruiter suggested that I brush up on load balancing, NFS, SQL, SSH, DNS, Security among other topics. It seems to be vastly spread out all over the place, so I'm not sure where to begin.

Has anyone gone thru a similar interview/position before? If so, how did you prepare?"

I have had 2 different jobs since graduating with my Master's degree about 3 years ago.  My position in these jobs has been as an application/design engineer.  During my time in each of these positions, which has been for 2 different companies, I have been a hard worker and always accomplish all of my assigned tasks on time or ahead of time.  I follow all the expected rules.  I get along fantastically with all of my coworkers, who all assure me that my quality of work is excellent.  Despite all of this, all 3 of the managers/supervisors that I have had seem to have had some kind of grudge against me.  Other coworkers notice it as well and all are just as stumped as I am.

My question is, has anyone else ever had a similar experience?  What was the cause of the grudge?  What did you do about it?  I tried to have a talk with one of the managers at one point.  Nothing really changed.  Luckily, that manager left the company and I was shifted under another manager, who I had thought was previously pleased with me.  Now that I am under him, he doesn't seem to like me either.  I just don't get it, and it makes work miserable.

Also, this only seems to be an issue since I have entered the professional world full time.  Bosses from part time jobs and internships have all loved me."

In addition, there are tons of opportunities that are not advertised very well such as certifications, specializations, etc. I know that if I were to do it all over again know what I know about the process of being successful in engineering school, there are a lot of things I would look out for, take advantage of, and pursue.

The program is a 2 year rotational program (consisting of 4 rotations) with an emphasis on IT and leadership. I still have another semester of school, and I'm seriously considering declining this offer to hold out for something that requires less travel (and ideally more money).

My main goal is to work in security, and I'm concerned about this program because although it will provide a lot of technical breath, I won't be developing a security specialization. 

The alternative to this position would be to try and lock down a security analyst job before graduation. I work as a security intern so I don't believe this would be too difficult to do.



I would really appreciate some wisdom from you IT vets, and would love to hear from people who have gone through similar programs."
2pib1j,1,2014-12-16,"Had perfect job, need help dealing with less-than.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2pib1j/had_perfect_job_need_help_dealing_with_lessthan/,"I have a bit of an odd career history.  Dropped out of college, worked repair counter for retail stores, then a regular hired me on in I.T.  Almost entirely self-taught Sysadmin for 9 years (very small firm, roughly 30 seats/3 servers/2 locations), went back to school 6 years in and got a CS degree.

Got an FT internship offer that was a step up in pay, more flexible about working around school schedule, and a dev position.  My Sysadmin and retail backgrounds allowed me to speak to support staff and customers about technical details without needing a translator.  I wasn't the most productive developer, but my code reviews went well, and my support hours went well enough one customer still sends me LinkedIn messages asking if I'm coming back.  The other devs were helpful and encouraging.  We all got along exceptionally well, spending nights gaming after work, spontaneous weekend trips, etc.  The product actually helped people in a way that made me excited to be even a small part of it.

Then I had to move for personal reasons.  Found a job with a company wanting to duplicate an old 3rd party ASP Classic app in the same Java frameworks I was using at the old job, and offering a step up in pay that covered school loan payments.  Released our first feature set (new feature talking to old app backend) then everything fell apart.  Project has been in PM hell all year, with senior management considering staying with the ASP Classic (because boardroom politics), but not making a decision so we can press on.  In the pieces we'd need either way, I'm hitting roadblocks due to my under-experience, mostly around design concerns, but feeling pressure as the few user-visible parts may unlodge management's decision if done well.

I feel I'm underexperienced to be lead developer on this project with the time constraints management is putting on me and my 2-day/week intern.  Certain design concepts escape me.  (For example, I grasp MVP as an abstract, but can't quite figure out how to separate V and P without just making things more complex.)  I have no training budget, just got a new boss who is against remote-work (cutting down the time I can spend back home), and am frustrated enough with the situation that I've gone from 5-6 hours/day productivity to 6-8 hours/week.  (Despite this, I still feel I could do a better job from-scratch than the ASP Classic app, given enough time.)

But going to a different job scares me, too.  I've learned a lot about what I don't know in this job, but the only real new skills I've picked up is JSR303 (which took all of a week to learn and implement) and Redmine administration.  I'm in that awkward space of having 5 years' dev experience on paper, but only 3.5-ish ""real"" experience.  (And same with the sysadmin role.  9 years on paper, but a lot of that was just maintaining what I put in place my first two years, as risking breaking something to improve/upgrade was normally kiboshed.)

Between a touch of impostor syndrome and actually being under-experienced, yet feeling like I under-sold myself on salary and vacation time, I feel like any move I make is going to be bad.  What do I do?"

I'm currently a 2nd year student in a Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree. My major is Business Administration. My specialization will be in Operations and Information Systems Management, and I'm working on a minor in Applied IT.

--

That being said, I'd really like to have a computer science aspect to my degree. I think it would give me more technical skills than what I'm getting now. I was thinking of switching to a double major program in business admin/comp sci. However:

1. If I do that, I won't get to choose ANY electives
2. If I do that, the course load is a LOT harder and I might be overwhelmed
3. If I do that, I won't be able to specialize in anything
4. If I do that, it's going to take me an extra year and a half to graduate (5 and 1/2 years total). Additionally, I'd only receive the Honours B.Com degree with two majors specified, it isn't two degrees. 

The alternative route is this: 
I could finish my business admin degree with my specialization and minor. After, I could take a fast-track Honours B.C.S degree, which would take 2 and 1/2 years. So I'd spend 6 and 1/2 years total in undergrad, but I'd end up with the Honours B.Comm with the specialization and minor, and an Honours B.C.S.

----

Financially, we have money set aside for the H. B.Comm degree, but not for anything after that. I could probably pay for the 2nd degree myself though (it's only 2 and 1/2 years. I have a job right now, and I'll be getting internships since I'm in the co-op program for the B.Comm).

Is this a good idea? Or a waste?

First job offer ever, having a chat about the offer soon, possibly room for some negotiation before the decision deadline but salary is lower than my target range. The job seems OK (nothing special), but deadline is early, as I kind of want to continue searching for other job opportunities especially throughout next semester. 

All Za Background Info:
I'll be graduating with a BS in CS (top 5 US CS univ) in 6 months.   
I got around to applying to different places (i'm still at it), and after 3 rounds of interviews this one company said they'd like to have me there. They said they'll offer mid 60's, and maybe high 60's with some negotiation...    Also, apparently no bonus until I get a senior position, but then again I don't even know if bonuses are that important :v 
EDIT: the offered position is in Chicago

I looked at many other career/salary threads and whatnot, and it seems to be generally all over the place- some guys landing 100k+,  and others landing below 60k...   
Thus I have no idea if my standards are reasonable, so feel free to fix my views if I'm overrating/underrating myself.

All in all, I want a minimum salary in the 70's for a less difficult job (like this one), and preferably up to somewhere in the 90's for a more difficult job with an expensive location;

As for my skill set, I have a 3.3/4.0 GPA, lots of in-class projects and extracurricular/personal projects (though nothing big,huge, or successful), pretty much all the standard language/dev experience (c,java,py,sql,webdev,android,etc.etc.), and great teamwork experience/skill. Unfortunately, I slacked off my junior year in searching for internships, so I never really had any previous work experience.

While all that's going on, I've had an interview with one of the big 3/4, where for whatever reason, the guy got back to me and said I can't move on to the next rounds but he enjoyed the one we had, and he'd like to keep in touch and asked me to let him know if other offers come up or something. So that's a possibility too... unless that was a polite way of saying ""no"".

Current Thoughts:   
Should I just decline this job offer and keep my doors open for next semester? (Oh, and there's the stuff with accepting the offer and continuing to search for other jobs... and there seems to be a lot of conflicting opinions on that topic)   
Or is this really valuable and I'm just dismissing it too easily?

2piw2x,3,2014-12-16,Rutgers NB ITI major in need of serious advice!,[deleted],rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/2piw2x/rutgers_nb_iti_major_in_need_of_serious_advice/,"Hey everyone.  I'm a frequent reddit browser, but I've just recently made an account because you guys give the best advice!  I'll try to keep this background info on me short and to the point.  I'm currently in my third year of college.  I attended county college for two years before transferring into the Rutgers Business School in NB.  After a change of major at CC and losing quite a few classes through transferring (bullshit), I arrived at the RBS in August with just 42 credits completed :(



After switching my major from nursing to business during county, I ended up taking several businesses courses that didn’t transfer to RBS due to being just shy of completing an associate’s degree.  That was my mistake, but I have to move forward from that.  After having a (mini) academic life crisis this fall, I decided that I no longer want to pursue a degree in finance or accounting like before.  After speaking with family members and friends, I plan on completing an Information Technology and Informatics degree.  To sum things up without detail, multiple factors influenced my decision.  Factors include posts on reddit, friends involved in the major, IT employment connections that I possibly already have, an interest in computers/technology, promising job outlook, etc.



After this spring and summer, I should have 75 credits completed (42+12+15+6).  This would include the SAS core reqs, a shit ton of randoms + business classes, and three required ITI classes.  As soon as possible I will be applying to school-school transfer from RBS-SAS, then apply to the ITI major after completion of 547:103. I have some questions and concerns that I really would appreciate advice for!  


----------What minor would you suggest I pursue?  I’m considering: 

Business Administration simply because I will only need 4 more out of 8 classes to complete it, and I already spent two semesters studying business. 

Computer Science to fill the technical gaps apparently left out of the ITI program to enhance my IT skills.  I don’t have time to pursue this as a major because I’m paying for school solely with student loans. I'm also pretty bad at calc

DCIM was suggested by a friend.  I don’t know too much about it though. 

Health Science is a strong possibility.  I studied health sciences for almost a year for nursing pre req’s.  I’ve been employed at a children’s rehabilitation hospital for over a year as a nurse’s aide.  I’m interested in IT for healthcare/hospitals as a career.


----------Quick questions I can’t find a straight answer to:
-Can classes from Rutgers be “transferred back” to county to complete an associates? (Only because I’m literally 3 classes from AS of Business Administration, with one req already finished here and the other would be used for the Business Administration minor anyways at RU).

-On NJ transfer’s website, can I look up BCC course equivalences from the Rutgers course code, as opposed to the other way around? (It’s tedious to search for satisfied requirements from a list of BCC classes) 

-It is my goal to complete as many credits as possible at county over the summer sessions because now each academic year at RU puts me roughly 27k in debt.  If anyone has any suggestions with how I could plan my schedule accordingly I would appreciate it.  Even a recommendation to a credible advisor would be great.  I’ve visited several at Rutgers and never felt helped.  I was always sort of rushed out the door or given hazy generalizations.

Sorry all of that was so long, I’m just incredibly stressed right now.  If anyone is a graduate of ITI or a current student and you’d like to chat, that would be awesome!  I’m planning on joining the ITI council in the spring and whatever other organizations I can scoop up.  I know securing an internship and getting real experience is the key to this major.

I only need to take two classes so that means I could take three classes that I got a C on and do much better.

The problem is I'm wondering if I should? In a CS student, I don't really think I'm going to be able to get an internship because my only real project is a compiler I wrote all i'm really good at is C++.

 Plus I'm going to graduate so my search should be shifting from summer internship to an actual real job. Right now I'm only taking four classes two of which i've already taken so my semester should be fairly light. I can use the free time to work on open source and personal projects to add to my belt and then in the final months of the semester I can really try to find real work in the professional world using open source projects as my experience. That's the plan at least. 

I know for a fact the homework does not change on any of these classes I plan to retake. I still have all the  homework assignments stored in my personal server and I know all these homework assignments netted me 90s and 100's. It was just the tests and final projects that got me.

Right now my GPA is like a 2.974. I cannot afford a single C if I'm to bring my GPA back up to the 3.0 section and some jobs are already filtering me out because of a below 3.0 GPA.

So the story is in the title. Basically I want to work at a bay area startup as a software developer when I graduate college next year since I live nearby and it would involve interesting work with real responsiblity. 
But I keep hearing from people that startups are always tight on money and need experience immediately, so junior developers just won't cut it. I really hope that isn't true, as I would love that work environment.


So What should I do to make myself more attractive to startups?
Assume I'm good with algorithms, a clear communicator and a friendly but awkward person. And I go to a top 50 school.


Should I learn a web stack? Any specific one will do I'm assuming?
What kind of personal projects would woo startups?

 
Do I need to be extremely outgoing? I'm nice to all people I work with, but I will never be the guy in the break room always telling stories and cracking jokes all the time while roaring with laughter.


Does my GPA matter? Right now I work as an dev. intern and go to school, so my GPA isn't very high..


Will I be limited to web dev work or making in-house apps only? I feel that is a waste of my degree, and would like to work on real products.


I have sent out my resume to a couple of companies but have not heard anything back from any of them in a month, so I'm worried about my future...



Thanks for reading!"

I wrote a post on how Gagan Biyani, the founder of Udemy and Sprig, found their first 1,000 course instructors. 

I wrote this for a couple reasons: 

1. Building a marketplace is stupid hard - so it was really helpful to hear how Gagan did it.

2. Gagan is a no bullshit attitude that I find extremely refreshing. My favorite quote os his is ""do not advertise in the beginning""...which I think many people try to do...and fail. 

Anywho, here's the link and video: [http://www.hustlecon.com/build-marketplace-gagan-biyani-founder-udemy-sprig/](http://www.hustlecon.com/build-marketplace-gagan-biyani-founder-udemy-sprig/)

If you don't wanna click off reddit, I just copy and pasted the article below:

How Udemy Found Their First 1,000 Instructors…Tips For Building a Marketplace with Gagan Biyani – Founder of Udemy and Sprig
BY SAM PARR  16 December, 2014
How Do You Find Your First Users When Building An Online Marketplace?
Background: Gagan Biyani is the co-founder of Udemy, an online marketplace for learning with over $48 million in funding. Currently, Gagan is the founder of Sprig, a dinner delivery service with $11 million in funding that’s immensely popular here in San Francisco. Between founding Udemy and Sprig, Gagan was an advisor at Lyft, the ride sharing behemoth we all know.

Why am I telling you this?

To show you that when it comes to turning your startup into a fire breathing, high growth machine, Gagan is your man.

This post describes the presentation Gagan gave at Hustle Con where he explained exactly how Udemy found its first 1,000 course creators.

This post is for you if you want to learn:

How to create a scalable process to find your first customers
How to build an online marketplace
Why you shouldn’t focus on advertising when first starting out.


When it started, Udemy struggled to get instructors to start teaching on their platform.

Gagan spent first 6 months of the company cold calling instructors and asking them to put courses on their platform. Udemy had no reputation or success stories of instructors making a living on their site. Because of that, none of the instructors Gagan called created courses for Udemy.

So the Udemy team decided to create their own course as a case study to show how much potential instructors could earn using their platform.

Raising Capital For Startups
Gagan’s course, Raising Capital For Startups, was video content from a conference he hosted featuring Udemy’s investors as speakers. Gagan recorded their talks and used them (along with the PowerPoints) as content for the first course. Then, Udemy sold the course to as many channels as possible.

The first course made generated around $30,000 in just a few weeks.

And BOOM – their case study was born.

With the case study in hand, Gagan created a 3 step funnel to find potential instructors and convince them to create courses on Udemy:

1. Finding The Leads:
Gagan needed a huge amount of leads. He accomplished by outsourcing the lead gen process for $3 an hour to data miners in the Philippines using Odesk. In the past, Udemy used college interns but switched to outsourcing to increase efficiency. Udemy had 5 to 10 outsources working on lead gen at any given time.

What did the outsources do? The lead gen teamed searched “learn python,” “what is python,” and any other search term related to a learning python (or any other topic Udemy wanted a course on). When the data miners found a relevant site, they’d copy/paste the web page author’s email. This amounted to 100’s of emails a day that the outsourcers would put in a Google doc.

2. Getting The Leads To Talk To Them
Once they had the emails, the data miners would email, one by one, each address. Gagan didn’t used Mailchimp or any other mass email service because it looked sketchy. The outsources sent a a variety of emails Gagan wrote beforehand and tracked which emails received a response. After 500 emails or so, the team would switch to the winning email.

3. Closing The Lead
At this point, the data miners successfully had hundreds of instructors signed up for Udemy. But there was still a problem: the instructors rarely finish and launched their courses.

So Gagan got creative.

Udemy emailed any instructor who didn’t finish creating their course and said “Hey, we wanna run a promotion for your course in 3 weeks…can you get it down by then?”

This email increased convinced instructors to finish creating their course in a few weeks. It also increased the conversion to get people to create a course in the first part.

Important notes from Gagan’s talk: Advertising is a growth accelerator, not a growth cause. If you’re startup with less than $2,000,000, don’t advertise. Also, don’t bother A/B testing your emails if your only sending 100 at a time.

Some time last fall, I decided I wanted to double major in CS to better understand data structures and the like.

I'm pretty ahead in IS credits, so I can graduate early (2 semesters more) from IS.
To graduate with a double major in IS and CS it will take me 2 more years.

This year, I received internship offers from Cisco, Apple and GE and several others. Many of my offers were Software Engineering and several were in IT.

I signed with Cisco as an IT Engineer Intern(for Big Data Work) late September because of the pressure from their deadline, but soon after Apple and GE offered me software engineering positions. 

I want to get into Big Data work, and I feel like I'll learn more in a real position instead of staying in school. 

If I'm already getting Software Engineering offers from big tech companies, do I really need to finish up the CS degree, or can I just graduate with the minor? 
 
**TLDR: If big companies are offering me Software Engineering positions do I really need a CS degree? or should I just stick with a minor?**"

So a few months ago I was traveling and instead of bringing my laptop with me I brought my Asus transformer book. It went through security at the airports fine and work perfectly for a few flights. 

After one flight the battery died and when I charged it and turned it back on it only goes into BIOS. Now I looked at all the settings and nothing changed except the option in boot. There is no boot options (doesnt show hard drive exist) I figured maybe the drive was corrupted/the xrays at the airport had erased it so I tried booting from usb. It wont boot but just goes back to the BIOS. I have also tried plugging it into my laptop and it recognizes that it is plugged in but says that the device cannot be recognized. I would have tried taking the hard drive out and replacing it but I cannot get the thing apart (no screws and just a flat back and I dont want to damage the touchscreen forcing it apart). 

I dont want to send it to a factory because I had some sensitive documents from and internship on it at the time and even though the drive they are on is encrypted I have it partitioned with the other partition holding lots of pictures and work from when I was in Europe. 

Does anyone have any experience taking apart tablets/know how to get an OS on to the Hard Drive, (I cant launch fileshell from BIOS either)? What is my best option. 

P.S I dont care if I need a new drive I had everything backed up I just want to be able to use it for more than a fancy mirror."

Is it likely it'll be the mother of all tech interviews (and I should study like every culture's worst sort of demons are after me) or I've somehow made a 'bye' on the tech interview round by getting a rec? I was expecting the last one to be the tech interview, since at past internships there's usually been a short HR phone call, a personality interview with team X, and a technical interview with team X (pick any ordering you like.) 

Basically, I'm just wondering if I should spend the next two weeks re-familiarizing myself with everything I've ever learned about topics related to this company's focus or if I'm being ridiculous at this point.

- Cisco I and II, Network Security, and Windows Server 2012 at a community college.  I did not complete the associates degree.

I enjoy IT a lot more than the intense theoretical CS I was doing.  I hated it.

I'm a CS major at a top 10 University in the US. 

I know that everyone says that internships are super important, which is why I'm in a dilemma. I have the opportunity to go on a fully funded service program where I get to pick a country (I'm looking at Tanzania!), pick a project, and go for 6-8 weeks during the summer all-expenses paid. However, by doing this, I'll most likely have to give up a computer science internship since the timings for both overlap during the summer. 

Here are my major concerns:

-Having this sort of traveling opportunity, where everything is sorted out for me and I don't have to worry about the cost, will probably never happen again - it seems like a once-in-a-lifetime experience

-I don't have any internships so far, but I have around a 3.5 GPA 

-This upcoming summer is the only time I have left, so I won't be able to do an internship at any other time

What are my options right now? Should I give up the traveling if the internships are that important? Or should I stick with the traveling program? 

Are there any options for internships during the school-year?

I know that I have a wonderful ""problem"" to consider (and I'm super grateful), but I'm just a little lost right now and I can't make up my mind. Any advice?"

It's an unpaid internship and looking at the office it kind of looks like a small place. Is it worth my time and effort to do this internship or should I be looking for either a paid internship or job?"

So I'm a student at 20 years of age. I just started CS program at uni this autumn. I have about ~2-3 years of experience with programming. My knowledge and experience has increased exponentially since 1 year ago, when I started getting serious with programming. I've so far only dealt with high level languages (mainly Javascript, but also  e.g. Ruby, Python, Bash, Java, PHP, a **lot** of UNIX/POSIX stuff).

When I was 19, earlier this year, I got an internship at a big, global, communications technology company. I did well, learned things very quickly and was very motivated. I think I surprised my mentor &amp; manager &amp; colleagues as I was offered a summer job (unusual for my age &amp; not being enrolled in uni), and consequentially a part-time job which is my current employment.

I have a feeling they see potential in me and want to ""reserve"" me, in a sense. I've been asked about future summer jobs and such.

My question is.. how do I continue? Should I keep accepting job offers from the same company and essentially securing a job position when I graduate? Or should I look for other possibilities elsewhere? I love the open source community and the spirit/idea of start-ups.

How good is my CV for my age, and what can I do to improve it?"
2prn9c,2,2014-12-19,Startup or Blizzard Entertainment?,FullMetul,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2prn9c/startup_or_blizzard_entertainment/,"Hi Everybody,


I’m a new graduate and I’m kind of in a unique position. I just graduated from a lesser known university on the East Coast. I graduated through a combined program and got my Master’s in Software Engineering and Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I have an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) and an internship at a well known software company in Manhattan under my belt. I’ve maintained good grades and even deved some iPhone and iPad apps in the App Store. With all of that said, I’m about to go into the workforce and I have two great offers but I’m conflicted on which to take. 


The first is at a new and small company in Wayne PA (outside Philly). The location is great because I live within two hours of Philly so holiday travel and visits to the family would be a breeze. I would also be able to maintain better professional relationships with all of my classmates, who intend to stay on the east coast. I would be working as a developer building their new software suite from the ground up to act as a portal for risk analysis and performance metrics for banks, insurance companies, and other larger corporations. I would be the first actual software developer they’ve hired aside from the founders and I would be put into a key management position moving forward as we hire more people. I realize theres a lot of opportunity here but also a lot of risk in a newer company as well. I wasn’t offered any equity though, just a profit sharing program.


The other company is Blizzard. They want to hire me as an associate software engineer. It’s always been a dream for me to work for a company like Blizzard (namely Bungie, Valve or Blizz) and I’m still sort of in shock that I’m sitting behind an official offer letter signed by Mike Morhaime. I really think I would enjoy working at Blizzard (company culture and my manager seem awesome) but they are offering me 20% less in terms of base salary in Irvine, CA which has a higher cost of living than Wayne. It's also a lot farther away from friends and family but I've been preparing to move to CA since I started getting my degree. They say the compensation is lower because it’s an associate level position but I would be a part of their new grad initiative to be trained to move into a mid-level manager type position after the first two years. 


Honestly I can see myself working at both companies but I’m really conflicted on which to take. If anyone has any advice they could give I would really appreciate it. Either from working in a startup-like environment or working at a larger gaming company like Blizzard, any advice would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks Everybody!"
2prrac,6,2014-12-19,Trying to start an IT career...need a reality check and advice,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2prrac/trying_to_start_an_it_careerneed_a_reality_check/,"Hi,

I'm feeling very discouraged at the moment but I'm not sure if it's reasonable or if I'm just depressed. I'd like to hear other perspectives on this situation. So if you have the time and the inclination, I would appreciate a word of advice.

&amp;nbsp;


**The backstory**

I graduated with a BA in psych over a year ago. After an internship and a couple of months working with clients of mental health services, I realized that I was in the wrong field. I looked back on my favorite courses, problems I've solved, and ways that I've helped people and I saw a common thread. Programming courses were fun, fixing laptop/PC hardware and software issues for friends/family was a great feeling. I loved learning new things along the way. Tinkering with technology on the software side of things to solve problems, and go beyond the predefined box that the manufacturers have set is really something I enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;


**The current situation**

Now I'm enrolled in a 2 year community college program for computer systems. It's designed to enable graduates to challenge for CCNA, CompTIA, A+, Net+, MCP and install/configure/troubleshoot software, network devices, and networks. I figure a structured, formal education is the best way to plug the gaps in my knowledge. It also can't hurt to have a computer related diploma on my resume. From what I've learned so far, sys admin is what I want to do/what I'm aiming for. In my spare time I can play around with some android development. I'm currently learning java...though it's hard to stay motivated when I feel so far from being able to produce/contribute to something meaningful.


&amp;nbsp;


**The challenges**

It's been a little over a month since I started this career switch and I moved across the country to live with family while I try to get my life together. I need the extra support at the moment (I suspect I might still be a bit depressed from my divorce). Anyway, I'm noticing that there are tons of opportunities for IT work just a few towns over, but nothing in my immediate area. It would take 2 to 2.5 hours to make that one-way commute if the stars aligned perfectly. This is a frustrating situation, as I don't want to go back to a retail job that really just sucks my time and energy away from where I want to go. There aren't even any help desk positions around.


&amp;nbsp;


A bunch of ideas have crossed my mind, but I'm tired, I'm really tired. Life has been a very big struggle for a while now. So before I pull the trigger on something and invest myself in it...I'd like to know from people in the field, if it's realistic or possible. I feel like I'm some hungry national geographic animal sizing up whether or not I should use the last bit of energy I have to chase a certain rabbit or hope for a dumb/injured one to show up.

&amp;nbsp;


**Possible plans of attack:**

**option 1.** Contact local businesses (computer repair shops) and see if they could use a hand. I could help them with their workload and marketing in exchange for getting some experience on my resume and a reference for a future employer. Maybe they'd hire me if they find my services valuable.

&amp;nbsp;


**Pros:** Experience for my resume, learn a few things, network with someone in the field, reference for future employment, possible employment

**Cons:** Running down the wrong rabbit hole and end up derailing career plans, pigeon holed into doing computer repair and never moving from a little repair shop, graduate from my program with no experience doing any sort of network admin stuff and all I can do is fix individual computers

&amp;nbsp;


**option 2**. Continue applying for volunteer and entry-level network technician/IT support positions that open up in the area

&amp;nbsp;


**Pros:** everything, it makes sense and is the right way to go

**Cons:** opportunities are rare, and I'm seriously under-qualified for everything that pops up, my resume totally sucks for it cause I have no relevant work experience or anything to vouch for my technical skills other than anecdotes, it's discouraging to keep up this part of the job search when there isn't even anything I can attempt to apply to, 

&amp;nbsp;


**option 3.** Create a goal/project for myself

I'll keep slogging away at this java/android thing and move beyond the hello world app. Find a way to monetize my efforts.

&amp;nbsp;


**Pros:** build portfolio, build relevant and marketable skills, perhaps become self-sufficient and start freelancing/consulting

**Cons:** Incredible amount of sustained effort and motivation to pull this off. Though I know this would be possible if I believed in myself, I suppose that I don't at this point. At this point, I'd need a friend to do this with me. If I fail partway through, I've just spent all that time and effort and I'm back where I started with nothing to show for it

&amp;nbsp;


**Other considerations**

I have no interest in web development and only a minor interest in software development. I've played around with a few web pages, but I certainly don't have a good eye for design. I'm more of a problem solver than someone who creates/designs. This causes me some worry about the viability of option 3.

For example...writing a small function I can call from the CLI to disable/enable my touchpad was so much more enjoyable and fulfilling than trying to get a blog looking decent.


&amp;nbsp;


**Conclusion**

Writing this all out, it seems like I should just keep sending in those applications/resumes for option 2 and start knocking on some doors for option 1. Maybe I need to figure out how to write a proper resume for the handful of skills I have at the moment. Maybe that's the biggest issue...my resume sucks and I only have anecdotes about my technical skills. 

&amp;nbsp;


**I'm crazy**

Ok, I'm starting to go off the rails a bit. Maybe I should go to sleep.

Thanks for listening.


&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** aiming for sys admin/network job feeling discouraged, I seek guidance as to a viable way to start IT career...I have two main ideas:  offer my basic troubleshooting/technical skills to computer repair shops as an intern while I continue applying to entry-level/volunteer network admin positions  **or** really dig into moving beyond the hello world android app and find a way to monetize these efforts


&amp;nbsp;


The biggest challenge is staying optimistic about this while feeling like an unemployed loser that's destined to fail. I don't want to graduate with only a diploma and a retail job to show for these next 2 years.

2prrxd,5,2014-12-19,College student in need of some advice! Apologies for the wall of text.,Looking4halp,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2prrxd/college_student_in_need_of_some_advice_apologies/,"Hey everyone,

I am a junior at a trimester school (recently finished my first junior trimester) and I just discovered data science after I found that finance might not be for me (not necessarily due to the difficulty, but rather the topics, my level of interest, and nature of the work that deterred me after speaking with many people currently in the industry). I study a math/statistics/social science hybrid of sorts (all one major) and economics (my second major), along with participating in a competitive finance certificate program. I am debating on keeping the math/statistics/social science major but changing my economics major to a statistics major (although there might be some overlap with my current major, there are actually a lot of additional courses in the stats major not covered in my current major and I also get to skip a few courses due to my current major) and adding on a computer science minor.

To give some background on my interest, I love working with data especially when it pertains to social settings. Statistics was one of my favorite high school courses, and my college courses on mathematical methods in social analysis (pretty much econometrics) have increased my appreciation of the power behind numerical analysis. Data science is interesting to me because it really seems like it is a profession on the frontier of modern social data analysis. I understand that data science involves much more than just math and statistics, and would appreciate any advice in what CS courses or online resources in specific would be very helpful to understanding exactly what data science entails. 

However, the issues start with my recent change in interest. I only studied preliminary java in high school, and have very little coding experience outside of that class. I am starting my computer science minor next trimester, but it seems awfully late for me to immerse myself into the field before I apply for jobs my senior year. Here are a few of my questions:

1) In finance (specifically investment banking) and consulting, internships seem rather critical especially your junior year summer prior to going through recruitment your senior year for full time. Does a similar ""requirement"" exist to be successful through recruitment in the data science field as a recent college graduate? (I would guess not due to the novelty of it and the nature of the work, since a lot of it seems to be based on knowledge rather than experience).

2) Should I pursue an internship in data science this next summer given my level of knowledge by then? By then I will have learned some fundamentals behind computer programming in C++ (and possibly another language, but not R) and have taken some additional statistics courses (I can give further details if someone is curious!). 

3) If I cannot find an internship in data science, should I spend the summer simply learning more about data science, or wait for my next year where I will be taking a lot of critical courses in CS that would help towards the field? I forgot which courses in specific these were, but things such as data structures and machine learning were involved.

4) Am I in over my head, and should I be pursuing a masters in data science instead? Would I be able to join a masters program in data science if I only minor in computer science? 

5) What are the best sources for learning more about data science, and gaining the essential skills?

and finally:

6) What is one question/concern that I haven't asked yet, that I should really be asking at this point, given my situation?

Thanks a ton to whoever takes the time to read this and provide some advice. I understand it's quite the wall of text, but I can really use the help!"

To make a long story short, I've shot myself in the foot with this CS degree. I ended up forcing myself through it, got bad grades, and generally I hate life. I finished 95% of it before this semester, and it looks like they are going to kick me out of school.

I have a lot of experience. Five internships at the same Fortune 500 company, a stint as a GIS technician for the State Government, and I have an ongoing position at a medical clinic doing an XP to 7 migration project and some general IT work.

My education has been:

    95% of a BS in Computer Science at a great state school. The courses I didn't complete was the final abstract CS theory course, programming language design, and linear algebra.

    Cisco I and II, Network Security, and Windows Server 2012 at a community college. I did not complete the associates degree.

I enjoy IT a lot more than the intense theoretical CS I was doing. I hated it.

So my questions are:

How do I market myself?

How do I phrase my almost-degree on my resume?

On the plus side, I have as second-round phone interview with a contractor for ""Major Search Engine"" IT on Friday. It would be a 6 month contract with the option for a direct hire at the end of it.

Honestly, at this point, I just want to work. I'm done with school. I dread every second of it. I've been working on this degree for 6 years.

2psbo6,3,2014-12-19,Worth Adding on CS major (to Physics) to get Career - current junior,Rusty389,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2psbo6/worth_adding_on_cs_major_to_physics_to_get_career/,"I'm a junior studying physics with a minor in CS, but I know that I want to go into programming after college. I have done some number crunching and I could finish college within the four years if I take some full course loads the rest of my college career. I would plan on double majoring and I am just a handful of classes from a physics degree.

My question is if it is worth it. I already have a CS minor and my physics degree requires a concentration in a field, which I have chosen as CS. This concentration already gives me the majority of the CS core classes and I will continue taking more just for understanding.

I also already have a programming internship set up this summer and a friend of mine in the field says that experience is one of the most important factors anyway.

So would it be worth it to add this major at the expense of significantly increasing my work load (and probably hurting GPA). Or even completely switch majors (last resort)? It's a pretty major decision and I don't want to leave without a CS degree if it's pretty necessary to get the jobs."
2psd56,10,2014-12-19,Hitting a crossroads in the early stages of my 'career'.,ballinlikewat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2psd56/hitting_a_crossroads_in_the_early_stages_of_my/,"Hey all,

So currently I am employed as an intern at a large steel mill in my hometown. I work as a programmer. The technical term is Level 2 Engineer and if I stay on board the rest of the year, I can start working full-time. I have already been offered the position. I love the job. It is very relaxed and the culture of the company is awesome. I also love my coworkers. If I stay on full-time, I will be expected to do some IT work. No biggie, simple stuff. 

One issue with the company is that it uses a dead programming language called Powerbuilder. Although I love my job, the language is very boring. I also am afraid that this skill will not be very useful for future employment (if I wish to ever leave the company). I fear that I may become complacent.

So this upcoming Monday, I have my second interview at a startup. The startup does software engineering for local businesses and has two government contracts. The first interview was nerve wrecking. They were very professional and asked a lot of technical questions. I obviously did well enough to get a second interview. I am concerned that I may hate this new job and become stressed out. Or that I will be incompetent and get fired and be unemployed. But, if I do enjoy the job, I will get very good experience for the future.

Also, I still have a year left of school, so I have to go to class and get decent grades.

I guess the TL;DR is should I stay in my happy, comfortable job that won't give me applicable skills for the future (atleast until I finish school???)? Or should I throw caution into the wind and take this new job and risk failing and becoming unhappy (potentially)?

Thanks for reading. I know it is a block of text but I just had to get my thoughts out.

2psg59,62,2014-12-19,"TIFU by not making a move, and letting a Greek-Goddess walk away.",iwishiwasindie,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2psg59/tifu_by_not_making_a_move_and_letting_a/,"So, parallel to the plethora of FU’s posted on this thread, my FU actually happened a few months ago.  I’ve told this story to co-workers and friends alike, and they seem to each get their share of entertainment out of it. But, it wasn’t until today, an excruciatingly boring Friday at work, that I decided to share it with you all. No throwaway, because fuck it. The story is a tad long, I apologize, and it may get buried. But if you need something to occupy your time, I can happily oblige.

In September, I wanted to do something sorta special for my birthday. I’ve been living in Europe for the past few months, and I’ve always wanted to visit the UK. I figured the b-day was the perfect opportunity to do so. I found out that I’d be flying solo on this one, because my co-workers AKA ex-friends all had “more important” things to attend to. So after cutting ties and swearing my disloyalty to them, I decided I’d hit up England first, and then spend the majority of my trip in Scotland. 

Fast forward to my first day in Edinburgh. I’ve just gotten done with the castle, and I’m standing at the top of the Royal Mile, when I think “I want – nay, need to – hear more Scottish accents.” Any and all, I just want to hear them speak their minds about anything.  Then it hits me: Parliament. I’ll go listen to a debate for a little while, thus hearing Scottish politicians give speeches that could possibly be entertaining.

Listening to a debate on a vacation is unusual, I know. But my goal was the accents. Sure, I could have gone to a pub and strike up a conversation, or people watched out in a restaurant. But the introvert in me wouldn’t allow such things. I’ve been getting better and better with each passing trip at going to social scenes like that. However, I’ve never really gone to a pub whilst flying solo. Moreover, I’m still improving on my game that I so foolishly ignored throughout all of high-school. So something independent seems like a better move. 

I make my way to the parliament building, get inside, get my ticket, and get ushered up to the visitor stands. I see there are maybe less than twenty or so politicians in session, debating back and forth about public housing or what not. There aren’t too many visitors, but there are enough to fill up some of the bleachers. The usher leads me to the emptiest one, where there’s only one other person occupying a seat, a girl who appears to be in her mid-20s. She looks up, and shoots me a smile.

Calling this girl “hot” would be doing her a disservice. In my honest opinion, this young woman was absolutely, undoubtedly beautiful. Her long, sandy-blonde hair was tied into a ponytail that professionally complimented her black and lavender-colored business dress. Her snow-white teeth shined when she smiled, one that stretched adorably from dimple to dimple. Bronze freckles dotted her face like flowers would in a meadow. And her eyes. Gee-fuckin-golly-gee her eyes, ladies and gents. Azul as the Mediterranean itself. Her eyes could surely captivate even the most bewildered of people.

This is what Helen of Troy must have looked like.

She returns her attention to the debate, and I grab the seat behind her. I figured I would be a fool to pass up an opportunity to speak to a woman like this.  Solo trips like these have always proven to be great tests of my social skills, and this was no exception. I sit there for a few minutes, letting some time pass, until I finally tap her on the shoulder and ask, “Excuse me, miss, but do you know when they’re going to start throwing punches? It’s to my understanding that’s how they solved arguments here.” (Queue the hatred/love, you know this would be fucking awesome if it were true.)

She laughs, and tells me to give it a while. We start talking back and forth, and I learn that she is also a fellow American, not much older than me, who had been travelling Europe, until she got an internship here in Scotland. She was just taking notes when I walked in. 

We talk more, exchange jokes and such, until the debate starts to draw towards to an end. I ask her what I should do next, when all of a sudden she blushes. “I think you should go get dinner,” she says. A flag of opportunity is slowly raised inside my head. I ask her where she prefers, when she tells me “I don’t really know. I just got here a week ago, and I’ve been living off of frozen pizzas. I don’t really cook if it’s only going to be me at my loft.” That flag is now most certainly waving in the wind.

Now, I may be new to this game, but I can catch a hint. Either **A.)** She’s looking for a free dinner. Which, fuck, I don’t mind. I’m on vacation. Or **B.)**  *Something else.* Why she gave her attention to me I shall never know. But nevertheless, I caught on to ""what could be.""  The debate ends, and we get up together to leave the hall.

We’re talking about God knows what while we walk down the stairs, but all the while I’m thinking *Ask her when you get to the lobby. You know how to do this. You’ve got this.*

We enter the main lobby, and she formally introduces herself to me. It’s a bad habit, but when I’m focused on something else (such as asking out this young woman to dinner), I tend to space out when listening to someone’s name. Rookie mistake, I know, but I cannot remember this girls name for the life of me. I’m positive it starts with an “L.” But that’s about it.

The moment of opportunity is upon me. I know what to do, I know what to say. My mind is so confident it’ll work, that the little office-working Spongebob’s in my head begin to celebrate in anticipation. I have the question formulated in my head, and only have to ask it. A little bit of adrenaline starts to pump through my veins, and I quickly sense that sophomoric version of “flight-or-fight” all young men have felt once in their careers. The past hour or so of talking has all come down to this folks. A true testament of my skill.

For reasons I have yet to fully understand, **I. CHOOSE. FLIGHT.** 

My body doesn’t receive the signals my mind is transmitting. I give her my name, tell her it was a pleasure meeting her, and wish her goodbye. She smiles (with a hint of disappointment), wishes me farewell, and walks towards the offices. I don’t even get the common sense to watch her walk away. 

Self-hatred, criticism, and anger flood my head, and that office scene in my mind is quickly set ablaze. I exit the building, cursing myself under my breath, dumbfounded by what just happened. Outside of the parliament building is a group of hills that’s supposed to have an excellent view of Edinburgh, and the surrounding lands. I decide to climb the peak of those hills, for a scenic lookout while I further analyze what just happened. 

The rest of the trip was awesome, with plenty more stories to tell. But that event will never cease to make me laugh. If you happen to be reading this ""L"", I love frozen pizzas as much as the next guy, but I should of taken you to dinner. 

For everyone else, if you stuck with me throughout the entire story, you are a trooper, and I love you. If not…

**TL;DR** Met Aphrodite in Edinburgh, caught on to her hints, fucked it up, climbed Arthur’s Seat for self-reflection.

I am currently working on my resume to start applying for summer internships, but I am having a great deal of trouble getting the one page filled in. I am in the middle of my sophomore year, and I haven't partaken in any internships, personal/open source projects, and I am also not (I think not) proficient in any programming language/framework/etc... The most relevant CS classes I have taken are C, Python, and Discrete Structures. I will take Algorithms and Data Structures and Java this upcoming semester. But I feel like I honestly don't have much to offer (yet), and I wan to hear you all's opinion on whether I should focus more on building my resume in the meantime, instead of focusing on what I already have. If the former, what are some steps I can take to do so (learn what technologies or partake in what kind of projects, etc...). 

As a side question, what makes you proficient in a language? I have taken Python and C classes, but I don't feel like that gives me enough qualification to put that down on a resume. 

Thanks for all the answers/help/advice in advance! "

First, I just paid off a $160 bill to my old appt. complex from 6 months ago (it was over some damages to the unit left by maintenance) and I'm worried that could hurt me in a credit check. I tried contacting the managers multiple times to dispute the charges, but was completely ignored and never had calls or emails returned, so I just sucked it up.

Secondly, one of the firms I worked for and listed on my resume was a well known startup, but for tax purposes I have a staffing agency as my employer of record. Everyone I report to works for the startup and I have a corporate email account and whatnot and they said they'd gladly vouch for me, I just don't want to get dinged for dishonesty.

Thirdly my current internship is unpaid and as far as I know I've never even given them my social, so I don't know if it would show up on a background check. Granted the current project they put me on may have some associated payment, so this could be a moot point.

So am I worrying over nothing or do I need to start some damage control?

I applied to this company because I knew they were hiring from my uni, and while it is a position as a software engineer, it's much lower level than I want to be doing and I know I'd leave after a year or two, especially because it is in the middle of nowhere and I want to be in the city. Now I feel a lot of pressure to accept the job offer, especially because I don't know how long it would be before I got another one if i keep looking, or if i would even manage to get one with my lack of relevant internship experience.

I guess my question is, how hard is it to switch between jobs in different fields of cs? I want to be doing more webdev and full stack development, maybe mobile apps, but I'm concerned that it would be pretty difficult to make the switch. Would it be smart to accept the first offer I got..?"

Today I wanted to ask a few questions about college admissions from high school as well as applications for graduate programs. So I am a sophomore at a private high school in Texas that is well known among the nations colleges (For example 45% got accepted into the university of Texas instead of the public school standard of 6-9%, also 20 kids got accepted into Notre Dame out of a class of 250 last year). I am pursuing degrees in finance and economics and plan on getting my MBA, followed by me being an investment banker (Hopefully!). Now that you know a a broad background of me im going to give some details about my grades, test scores, and extra-curricular activities. 

Freshman Year:
This was probably one of the most pointless years of my education (I'm the one who is in fault). As a fourteen year old immature kid distracted by girls, video games, and other personal interests, my grades were very low. I was irresponsible at the time and honestly i might have screwed my self. My accumulative GPA was a 3.31 at the end of the 9th grade, and on a side note, I scored a 26 on a practice ACT test that was administered to the freshman class. 

Sophomore Year (This year):
Ever since elementary school and middle school on my free time I would, on my free time, sit there on my iPad and research careers and colleges. Originally I wanted to be a petroleum engineer, then I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, freshman year I became infatuated with physics and wanted to be a theoretical or particle physicist, next was a stock broker, now I want to be an investment banker. I came to this decision after trading one the stock market for 4 years since the age of 11 (set up by my grandma). I love it. The thrill of trading and the complexity of economics are a few reasons why. I'm getting off topic, back to the reason for this post.
My life has completely turned around. Over the summer and early part of the year I spent a lot of time thinking about my future and realized how much of a slacker I was. So I planned to get really good grades this year. After the first semester (which ended yesterday), I had a 4.0 GPA and aced all of my finals. This puts my accumulative at a 3.65. (At the beginning of the semester i had a 3.4 and had a personal revelation and hit the grind to get a 4.0, I plan on getting a the max grade next semester which is a 4.38, trust me I can do it) Also, I just received my PSAT scores and i got a 172 on it (I could have done a lot better). 

Extras:
- I will be in NHS this year (couldn't last year because of grades)
- Have around 60 hours of service work
- Go to Wharton school of business camp hosted by the president of the school in Switzerland (plan to get a letter of recommendation from him)
- Not in any student council position
- Friends with president of the investment club and hoping he will pass down the club to me when he graduates.
- Getting internship at an investment firm over the summer
- Am in the max amount of AP courses (3)

That's about it...

Now that you know EVERYTHING (almost ;]) about me. I have a few questions.

1. Since I am bringing my GPA up it should be around a 3.9 or low 4's at the end of high school. What are my chances to get into UT Austins McCombs school of business?

2. What colleges do you think I am capable of getting accepted into? (Keep in mind I am business oriented)

3. How hard is it to transfer into Harvard or Wharton to get an MBA?(If you graduate from there your automatically a candidate for lead positions in about any company)

4. How good is an MBA from McCombs, compared to Harvard or another ivy league school?

5. Do you guys think I am on the right track? Please give me some advice! It would be much appreciated.

Thanks guys and girls and wish me luck."

I'm a 20 years old male who works in healthcare as a nurse practisioner. I'm done in a few weeks with my internship and will be graduating in March upcoming year hopefully. 

Here's the situation. Few weeks ago, a new girl showed up for her internship and she totally swept me off my feet. I'm not a total loser in love. I had my relationships, been around and fooled around with a bunch of girls, I dare to admit to say I have a smooth talk. But this girl is honestly different. I know it sounds really cliché, but the attraction I feel for her is way different than ever felt before, even my exes who I thought to be in love with. She makes me blush, stare, silent, I'm nervous when she's around and think about her all the time.

Because flirting is really hard, considered it's my workplace and I can't fuck up because my graduation will depend on it, I'm just trying to be as casual as possible to her. Maybe just a little bit teasing. I dont know if she's aware of it though. 

I asked another student I work with to go and try to see what she was in to, if she had a boyfriend, etc. she asked in a way less subtile way than I meant what she thought of me 
and the girl said she wasn't looking for a relationship and stuff, and saw me as a friend. I know this is not a good sign, but I also think that I may increase my chances if I could really 'game up', but I'm doubting if I should since being on workspace and stuff.

However, when graduated, I totally want to ask her out. I have her facebook, her number, and have talked outside work for a couple times now.

Yet again I know it may sound like a really cliché story but please help me, fellow redditors. I'm looking for advice online, and if you told me this before I met this girl I'd probably laugh at you. Am I too blind to see that this obviously wont work out or should I step up my game and in what way?

I appreciate every advice you people give! Thanks a lot and sorry for the bad english, I'm not a native speaker!"

Operations engineer job details include --&gt;
 ""Contribute to repairs, upgrades, decoms, deployments, cabling, etc.
Troubleshoot, diagnose, and repair production servers and networking equipment.
Identify trends for machine failure, report bugs, and work with remote teams to resolve them.
Troubleshoot copper and fiber cabling.

I really don't know how to do just about any of that, but I am a fast learner... But thats not the point of this thread.

What should i do? Should i go ahead and accept the job interviews, and try my best, and work over the summer for them if i pass? (it pays 21 an hour ~~ - glass doors)

Should i ignore the email?
Email her and ask about positions with software development?

My question is if I take an offer from the mid-sized company instead of one of the Big 4, how will that effect me later on? Will it make it harder for me to get an internship a year from now? Will it be harder to get an interview/job when I'm ready for a full time position?"

Essay Topic Plan: My dad was adopted into a middle class family in Houston. He attended Stephen F. Austin as a forestry major, decided that wasn't for him then went to The University of Houston to get a degree in graphic design. Through a chaotic series of events he ended up being the global manager for a travel company that deals with oil and gas companies. About 7 years ago we decided to go on a search for his real mother. We found her and she lived in a trailer home in north Texas. It turns out that he had a brother who was homeless in Miami, and his mom had married 4 different men since she had my dad. Since my dad was given a better opportunity in life, he is able to afford things like private school and college. I would like to help others who have a chance to better their situations. I am able to attend private school because of my dad and it is the thing that I am most thankful for. My dad's life compared to the lives of his real family is a drastic difference that demonstrates how ones life can change through education. (Since I will the owner of the charity I will make my essay on this) Education is the most important thing to me and I would like to share that.

Note: Yea so I might include something like this in my essays. Education is truly the thing I am most thankful for and wouldn't trade the world for the things my dad has provided for me.

The reason I am considering moving out is that I need to become more mature and for (at the risk of sounding overly dramatic) me and my mother's sanity. The reason I say that is my mom is very emotionally unstable, she is a long term user of benzodiaphines and is highly irritable, over the years I have come act the same way. For example I'll be relaxed and driving to school, another driver does something that bothers me in the slightest and within an instant I'm swearing away. Everyday is a fucking emotional rollercoaster. We have been living on our own together since the summer before I started high school when she got a divorce and in that time it seems like almost every single night we get into a huge fight, half the time its something trivial. I find myself in complete dread every time I'm coming home from work. I've always told myself to just tough it the fuck out until high school is over but I'm at my wits end. I really don't like coming to school in the morning with a shitty mood over what happened the night before and it impacts my motivation/grades/willingness to pay attention in class.

I currently work 20 hours/week on weekdays at a paid internship that I leave in the middle of the school day for. I make around $660/month post tax and could potentially make around $1000 a month if I get a min wage part time job and work 2 x 8 hour shifts on the weekends. With that being said I think I can handle myself financially.

I plan on going to college in September, but right now I don't feel like I'm mature or stable enough to handle doing all the studying and homework. I can barely handle piss easy school as it is.

Is it worth it and do you think it would actually help and prepare me for college?"

I know the basics of web development, and am pretty OK in Python (learned it in a month and a half, and just finished developing a side project I was working on that used GUI and web automation and whatnot). I am definitely willing to travel anywhere in order to get an internship. I may be reaching for the stars right now, but I really really do want to intern for Google. I don't just want to intern there because of the resume builder, but I truly love what they try to accomplish and would love the experience. I see many many topics here about people getting interviews and internships and jobs there. My question is, how does someone who is a total beginner like me get my resume to be noticeable? I'm good in other aspects besides coding, like doing volunteer work and keeping my grades up so far, but I haven't gotten to the point where I'm actually taking hardcore computer theory classes yet, so quite literally everything I know thus far has been self taught.

Any tips? Thanks in advance btw! Just started frequenting this sub and have already learned a lot from you guys!"

2px58p,0,2014-12-20,How to recover from a low requested salary when I strongly suspect they would have offered more?,boxgirder,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2px58p/how_to_recover_from_a_low_requested_salary_when_i/,"So as many new jobseekers probably have done, I naively made the first move regarding money. In my first phone interview the HR person asked my desired salary. I said $50k. I realized after the fact though that the average is more like the [upper $50k](http://swz.salary.com/SalaryWizard/Structural-Engineer-I-Salary-Details-Seattle-WA.aspx) range.

They have now made me an offer for $26/hr- so about $52k. While this is actually more than I said in several months ago, there are some things making me think there is money left on the table:

* I know that they offered a guy ahead of me who declined the offer. He said they offered him around $60k. It is possible he is inflating this number, but why would he do that if he declined?
* There were two openings one here and another an hour or so away in smaller city. They gave the job here to someone else and asked me if I would do the one in another city. I didn't want to move so I said no. Now it looks like they are making the second opening in this area instead.

It seems like a good gig, but I actually have a temporary city job extended for me after my internship was up. This job would be for up to 11 months (though nothing guaranteed), and it pays $29/hr. I was kind of hoping that the new job would be able to match that. 

Is it reasonable to think that they have a little more room to raise the salary because they don't want to start a new search for candidates? If so how should I phrase my request?

**Update:** So I went ahead and counter offered with $60k-$64k. They came back and said that $54k is the best they could do. After that I went back to my friend and asked him specifically how much he got.

Well he actually *also* got $26/hour. It turns out that he was factoring in overtime to the salary! After I knew that the offer was the best they could do I accepted. I think the thing that really helped me was I knew they were pretty desparate to get someone to accept, so I knew I had some room to work with.

TLDR; Make sure to breakdown what composes a salary when you ask someone. Be sure whether a company has anyone behind you to accept the offer if you try to negotiate too much."

A friend told me that [Caterpillar Financial](http://finance.cat.com/cda/layout?m=94307&amp;x=7) is looking for MIS major interns who are guaranteed a job assuming the 9-week paid internship goes well.

I am currently a second year CS major looking for advice on how I should best spend my time for my month long winter break this semester. I know there's a lot of directions to go and I should stick with something, but there's so many options that I find myself unable to decide what's best for me. Advice is appreciated given that:

1. I'd love to recruit and look for an internship in the coming semester. I had a few interviews at some companies around the Bay Area these last few months, and while I've made second round for most of them, I find that I can't pass in the end because I don't come up with adequate solutions to some of the more challenging technical questions within a reasonable time period / with an optimal runtime. One option for me is to spend the month prepping for upcoming interviews by reviewing these concepts.

2. I want to explore a personal project. I know I can put this on my resume and build something I really enjoy, but at the same time I feel like one month might not be enough for some of my more ambitious projects. Would it be better to start something big and enjoyable but potentially have to put it off til summer to finish or later? Or maybe I should tackle a smaller project that I think I can finish before the time frame?

3. Learn miscellaneous skills that would all around make me a more solid programmer. Just browsing this subreddit has made me aware of all the things I don't know and I want to really get the hang of version control (we used a little bit of it at school), maybe some web dev, etc.

I've only taken 2 classes in college so far, one in Python and one in Java and the latter is my preferred language. I could also maybe spend the time and really get to know one of these languages in depth. What do you guys think? Any advice is really appreciated and thank you for your time!"

(If you wanna skip the yada yada, go to **Now here comes trouble**)

Little background: I'm an IT student currently on internship. I get some nice pay (375 euros a month) and I want to use this to upgrade my laptop (as in buy something new). My total budget is 1875 euros. I live in the Netherlands by the way.

As I am a gamer, I want something quite high spec. Maybe not top shelf but something quite strong that will last me a while. As prebuild laptops like MSI, ACER, ASUS, Lenovo etc. mostly do not offer the full package I would like, I have been looking into getting a laptop build. I ended on a UK builder website, and with this as a base: [preffered laptop base](http://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/notebooks/vortexIV-17/).

Now onto business, these are some specs I want and/or consider:

*Screen: 17 inch, hd, 1920 x 1080. (The standard on this model)

*Processor: I7-4610 M dual core 3GHz (part of my problem, will get to it later).

*RAM: 16 Gb, Kingston DDR3 1600MHz.

*Graphics card: NVidia GeForce GTX 880M - 8.0GB DDR5 Video RAM - DirectX 11 (also something I have questions about, will get to that later)

*Hard drives: 1TB Serial ATA HDD With 8MB cache (5400 rpm) for storage + 120GB Kignston SSDnow (550MB/sR + 520MB/sW) for startup.

*Sound card: Intel 5.1 channel high definition audio. (model standard)

The rest is all model standards.

**Now here comes trouble.** The processor options I have within my budget are:

*i7-4610M (dual core, 3GHz, 4Mb)

*i7-4710MQ (quad core, 2.50GHz, 6Mb)

*i7-4810MQ (quad core, 2.80GHz, 6mb) Anything above this is beyond budget.

*NVidia GeForce GTX 880M - 8.0GB DDR5 Video RAM - DirectX 11

*NVidia GeForce GTX 970M - 6.0GB DDR5 Video RAM - DirectX 11

So, my question is, which processor to pick, the i7-4610 or the i7-4810? And which graphics card to pick, the 880M or the 970M?

I could use some help of people here since I do not know alot about this hardware. Any vendor recommendations/website recommendations are also much appreciated.

I am in my last year of CompSci undergraduate major in college and having learned mainly Java (apart from Lisp, SQL and some other stuff I have not used in practice yet) I am wondering if I should specialize in the M.Sci major in something close to Java or go into a completely different direction and learn something closer to hardware level (i.e. C/C++ and embedded systems).

Can you please tell me if it is possible to make real money (i.e. 100k+ $) after a few years with Java and if yes what development methods, frameworks (EJB/Hibernate/Android) or general aspects (REST, Security, ...??)

But the money is not the only aspect bothering me.

2q2iuy,277,2014-12-22,Entrepreneurial Lessons I learned from interning at The Colbert Report,detales,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2q2iuy/entrepreneurial_lessons_i_learned_from_interning/,"Hey reddit, when I was in college 6 years ago, I interned at The Colbert Report. It was the start of a TV career that lasted for several years before I transitioned into startups. Ever since, I've found myself referring back to my experience at TCR for help in navigating the startup world. Over time, I've realized there were many similarities between Stephen Colbert/TCR and the entrepreneur/startup world. 

Seeing as how Colbert has just aired his last show before going on to take over for Letterman, I was feeling a bit sentimental and decided now was a good time to write up some of these lessons. Also feel free to ask me any questions on my time there. 

[Here they are:](http://qork.it/blog/5-entrepreneurial-lessons-i-learned-from-interning-at-the-colbert-report/) 

**Company culture can lead to greatness**

One of the most poignant memories I have of my time at TCR was the company culture. Ridiculous artwork of Stephen hung on all the walls, and props rested on all the shelves like historic artifacts. Staff and crew ate together in communal spaces and went out for drinks nearly every Thursday night. There was mutual respect among everyone, a feature that began at the top with Stephen himself who would know the name of every employee and intern that worked on the show. The result was that we were united in our obsession with the product being great.

At one point, a script supervisor told me very seriously “This is the greatest place in the world to work, it never gets better than this.” The intense love the team had for working at the show, where people were cool and the product was great, is one of the main reasons the show succeeded.

**Work Hard, but be Prepared to Pivot**

At one point I worked with the prop master. His job was often unglamorous, but it was crucial, and he could work for an entire day on a prop only to have the writers cut the bit because it wasn’t working. But Brandon took such occurrences in stride, knowing that sometimes painful decisions have to be made in the pursuit of greatness.

The staff and crew at TCR were never afraid to pivot. Sometimes a show would be written and taping only a few hours away only for some news to break that we had to cover. Instead of taking the easy way out, the team would go into emergency mode in order to pivot to take advantage of the news. If a show can pivot so dramatically 2 hours before taping, a startup can pivot to take advantage of new tech or trends as well.

**“Bunt” even when everything is working**

At one point, TCR was gliding smoothly with high ratings and numerous awards, but that didn’t stop the team from trying new things. When I was there, I helped the web guys with a bizarre project to create a kind of secret TCR website full of conspiracies, mysteries, and satirical occult references. The project never took off, but it was a cool idea to engage fans, and it represented the willingness to try crazy new ideas.

Some of the side projects that did work include the book I Am America and So Can You, the Christmas Special, the Rally to Restore Sanity and much more.


**Hire People Who are Smarter Than You**

Stephen Colbert is a genius, without a doubt in my mind. But he didn’t let that get in the way of hiring people who were smarter, and perhaps even funnier, than he is. Some of his writers were truly prodigal in their ability to write jokes, and Colbert would encourage them relentlessly. During every “commercial break,” he’d have a stable of writers and showrunners go up to his desk to give him notes and Stephen would listen to everything they said before continuing the show.

One time during a taping when a pre-filmed segment was airing, I watched Stephen talk to one of the showrunners and ask about who wrote that bit. He was utterly impressed and a few months later, that writer was promoted to head writer. This kind of no-nonsense thinking is only possible when ego is taken out of the equation and you're allowed to admire other smart people.

**Your Brand is Everything**

Stephen Colbert is perhaps one of the great brands of this generation. He has invented words (“truthiness”), commanded rallies of over 200,000 people, MC’d the White House Correspondents Dinner and even had a space treadmill named after him by NASA. And this is a very short list. The funny thing is, that Colbert has very little public persona outside of the character he built. The reason all of this was made possible is because he has branded a character so powerfully that somehow it all made sense. Whereas it would undoubtedly seem pretentious and uncool for a normal celebrity to pull such shenanigans, the Colbert brand makes it funny and awesome.

I'm a senior in high school taking an advanced computer class with a few of my close friends. We took an all day field trip to Progressive last week to tour their IT department and to be scouted for an internship. To determine who they'll choose for the internship, the employees take notes on each of us based on how proactive we are and how well we represent ourselves.
Anyhow, halfway through the tour they took us in groups for a bathroom break. One of my friends, Andy, was mid piss when he asked, ""Hey Dom, is there a handicap stall?"" Dom, who is another one of our friends, replies, ""Uhh..yeah...why?"" Andy then revealed he had a secret to share with us, and that the handicap stall was the perfect place for a ""team meeting."" Used to his antics, we waited until everyone had cleared the bathroom, and proceeded to cram ourselves into the stall.
Once all four of us we were in the stall (another friend was with us), we urged Andy to hurry up before anyone else came into the bathroom. For safety reasons, I wont divulge the details of the secret, especially since its irrelevant to the story. In an attempt at making a joke, I say loudly, ""Let's cross swords!"" Dom didn't like my joke, and told me he was going to punch me in the dick if we didn't get out of the stall immediately. As I push open the door, I'm greeted by a Progressive employee, who in a concerned voice says, ""uhh...what's going on in here?"" Shocked by his presence, I say, ""Er..just having a team meeting."" A disgusted look spreads across his face and he quickly turns around and makes a bee line for the door without saying another word.
We leave the bathroom in a fit of laughter. Dom, however, is not amused, and (jokingly?) tells us he hates us all. We proceed to join back up with the rest of our classmates. Throughout the rest of the day, the employee was making a visible effort to refrain from making eye contact with any of us. I also caught him whispering into a few of his colleague's ears what I assume was our awkward encounter. Needless to say, I don't think any of us will be getting that internship."

2q4jpi,2,2014-12-22,6 years for undergrad or just graduate already? Need some guidance.,akaryi,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2q4jpi/6_years_for_undergrad_or_just_graduate_already/,"Hey Reddit,

Long time lurker, first time poster. This might turn out to be a long wall of text but I have a dilemma and I'd appreciate any amount of advice from you guys since this thread has been a joy to read. 

Background: See, I originally came into college as an intended Computer Engineering Major but soon switched out of it after my first semester due to bad grades, one of which was in Intro to Programming. Being a lost freshmen and still somewhat passionate about computers, I went into Management Information Systems through the School of Business. I took all the prerequisites which were pretty easy so my GPA went back up and I actually retook all the courses that I did bad in in the first semester during my sophmore year of college. But the thing was that I wanted a challenge that comes from engineering and felt that my study habits were the reason why I did so poorly back then so I went into Industrial Engineering since some of my business classes counted as technical electives thereby allowing me to graduate in 4 - 4.5 years still with the exception that I took 19 and above credits each semester which I was determined to do. Don't get me wrong, I researched everything I could about the major and was initially impressed and in fact, I did pretty good in my courses that third year at 20 and 22 credits in the Fall and Spring respectively which comprised of typical engineering prereqs like Chemistry and Physics. I'll mention that I took my calc 2 and 3 during the summer after sophmore spring once I made up my mind to go back into engineering. So by the end of junior year, I landed an awesome internship with GM in the summer which I am so lucky and grateful to have to this day because it led me to an internship offer with GE for the summer of 2015. But that graduation in 4 - 4.5 years turned into 5 due to the realization that the upper level courses were limited only to specific times what with it being a smaller major plus I figured I'd do 5 years while picking up a minor or even a second major. Since I enjoyed the Operations Research aspect of Industrial Engineering, I decided to pick up Math (general barebones BA) to supplement that with the hopes of taking courses like Game Theory, Numerical Analysis, Combinatorics or anything related to Optimization. I'm also attaining a minor in management due to all the prereqs I took before along with a minor in statistics.
Now the problem is that while I like Industrial Engineering, by this time around I started hearing things about Mechanical Engineering what with them having more opportunities and being harder since ME students typically switched into IE which I was not the case but I'm starting to feel a little inadequate as a result. By the end of this fall semester, I've already taken a couple of my 400 and 300 level IE courses along with Statics (a little late but whatever) which wasn't bad at all subject to all the rumors I've heard. 

In any case, I've been thinking that I want to do Mechanical Engineering now or at some point in my life, either by doing another Bachelors or a Masters of which none of them would be a problem since I have taken the core science and math courses. I can do so now at my current college and stay another year (6th year) since some of my IE courses count as electives for ME or should I just graduate in 2016 (5th year)  with a double major in IE and Math with minors in Statistics and Management? I've already made up my mind to go back to school for ME at some point in the future, hopefully at my employer's expense but I'm alittle uncertain that'd it take me longer than if I take this opportunity to stay back another year to have both an ME and IE degree. I guess I feel like an ME degree would do me wonders and open more doors for me. Not to mention, I'm starting to tend towards product design little by little as oppose to process design/improvement. But at this point, I'm just kinda sick of school right now and just want to get into the real world with hopes to travel in between graduation and starting a full time job.
I guess I may also be ranting a little, lost, need a little reassurance, or this seems redundant but what do you guys think would be the best path for me? Please be nice and thanks!

P.S If it means anything, I was planning on taking the FE exam for IE sometime in the near future and get certifications in SAS to be better in terms of statistical analysis (I do like stats and I'm good at it) in an attempt to better myself in terms of employment."

I am an undergraduate in my senior year at the University of Washington in Seattle. I am not majoring in CS, but Economics, as I discovered my interest in CS a little late in college. However, I've tried to get involved with CS as much as possible. By graduation, I'll have a decent background in CS coursework. To give an idea of what I've dived into, some classes I will have completed by June 2015: Data Structures/Algorithms, Database Systems, Algorithms/Computational Complexity, Web Programming, Artificial Intelligence, High-performance scientific computing, software engineering concepts, and a few intro CS classes. I also just got a research position to do front-end development for a department on campus, which I'll be starting in a few weeks. I also have a portfolio website where I talk about my background and personal projects I've worked on and a GitHub that I contribute to an ok amount.

My goal is to be a front-end developer upon graduation. My concern is that I will struggle to get a full-time job as a front-end dev as I of course will not be graduating with a CS degree. I'd ideally want to stick around Seattle, or go to SF or NYC. I read on here all the time so I know that it's possible to crack into the industry w/o a degree in CS, but I am worried that my experience will not stack up well to the other people applying to the jobs I'm also applying to. I feel like everyone else on here has 2-3 summers of internships and far more impressive experience. 

A tentative plan of mine is to delay graduation till December 2015 so that I have one more summer to hopefully get an internship, and then so when I graduate in December 2015, my chances of getting a full-time job will be greater than if I graduate in June. 

Anyway, as you guys can see, I'm pretty unsure of what to do. Any insight would be great. Thanks."

2q7s12,2,2014-12-23,Driving cross country with an expired inspection,disruptioncoin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2q7s12/driving_cross_country_with_an_expired_inspection/,"I live in Vermont, and my inspection ran out in February. It's registered and and insured however. I've been putting off getting it inspected because I knew it was going to need some work to pass, and I have practically no money. I just finished what was supposed to be my last semester of college and I was going to head to my moms in California to find an internship and finish my degree requirements. I was planning on stopping in Indiana to spend christmas with my dad and sisters. Obviously making this trip with a valid inspection sticker would be a good idea, so I finally went and got it looked at once I got back from school, and it turns out I can't afford to get it to pass inspection. 

The first shop I went to said it needed a new exhaust, fuel tank (both have a bit of a leak), left front ball joint, and a few other things. He said it would be 6 hours of work. He didn't even bring up the rust holes around my rear wheel or my cracked headlight, but I went to this place specifically because I know other people with rust who passed inspection there. Well I brought it from there to my local salvage yard because I know they have some old Honda Accords sitting around. They went on to add another 10 or so things to the list of reasons it wouldn't pass inspection, including bits of body work. They couldn't give me a quote yet but said it would be a couple days of work. I simply cannot afford this. The little bit of money I have I need for gas and a motel.

So I was thinking, what if I just risk it and drive with an expired inspection? It might actually be cheaper to get tickets in each state I pass through instead of getting my car passable. Most states don't impound for an expired inspection, although I'm having trouble figuring out which ones do (Virginia impounds for it). Apparently it varies by city as well (Boston impounds for it). Two of the states I'd pass through on my way to California don't even have vehicle inspection laws. Chances are I could get pulled over at some point, but I doubt I'll be pulled over in each state. However, If I do get pulled over twice, and I already have one ticket, would that make it worse the second time I get caught? There's also the worry that a cop will impound my car even if it isn't required (apparently if they deem the car dangerous they do this, but my car looks like it's in half decent shape...) 

I'm waiting to hear from the salvage yard what parts they have and how much everything would cost. I know I won't be able to get it totally fixed, but I want to fix whatever is most safety relevant so that I actually make it to California. It's been a great car so far and only have 50k miles on it so I have faith. I simply have no other choices at this point though. Even if the mechanic does call today with a quote (he said he would last week) I bet he's closed the rest of the week, which means I won't make it to my dad's in Indiana for christmas. I'm currently staying with an old friend but I initially told him I would only be here for a few days last week while I got my car inspected. If the mechanic doesn't call today (and they close very soon) I might just take off tomorrow morning and get the essentials repaired once I'm at my dads. 

So is this a bad idea? Does anybody have any resources for inspection laws in different states? What states should I avoid? I found which states have requirements but it's hard to find whether or not they impound or just give a ticket. How likely am I to get my car impounded on christmas eve with my entire life packed into my car?

TL;DR I'm driving cross country with an expired inspection. Any advice?"

However, of course he doesn't want to leave school before he is employable. He was wondering what the best way to learn more about data mining is without spending a lot of time on the theory. Are there any good resources that teach data mining from a more practical stance?

All I have been told is that, at some time of my choosing in the next 3 weeks, I will be given 4 hours to ingest and operate on a sizable data set using my statistical programming language of choice. I assume this involves some statistical modeling. So, how do I best prepare? My machine learning background isn't terribly extensive -- I have more background in the kind of inferential stats common to psych research.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you think the economy is artificially inflated right now?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn5qkuy?context=5)|Be careful with your phrasing when asking that question. The economy is not the same thing as the stock market.
 |That being said, I think both the economy and the stock market are inflated beyond fair value. Corporate earnings appear to be at record highs but much of that is due to the massive cost-cutting (i.e. layoffs) that has taken place over the past 6 years. I also firmly believe that GAAP accounting rules are far too lax and that companies can manipulate their earnings numbers fairly easily.
 |I think a similar problem is affecting the economic data that is being released. Unemployment appears to be very low but that doesn't tell the whole story. If you look at the labor participation rate (imo, a more accurate indicator of job creation), you will see that our work force is the smallest it's been in decades. Combine that with non-existent wage growth and it's hard to see why the markets should be making all time highs right now.
[Why not just forget about your sense of morality and try to make as much money as possible? It sounds like you had a golden opportunity and your threw it away. Are you making as much money at your new job as you did at your old job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3jj79?context=5)|Forgetting my sense of morality is what scared me. I hated myself for what I was doing to my clients. I took no pride in my work whatsoever. Eventually it was such a struggle just to go in to the office that I decided to take a good hard look at my life and make a change.
 |Also, my GF said that I was always combative and generally not pleasant to be around. That all stopped when I left.
 |I am making more money at my current job than I did as an advisor, but the overall earnings potential is less. There are successful advisors out there that can gross $2-5 million annually. Realistically, I don't have that ability at my current job, but I couldn't care less.
[How much are you making annually now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3mkza?context=5)|Approx. 175k depending on performance.
 |I was only an advisor for 3 years. My first year, I made about 40k. The next I made 70k, and in the third year I made almost 110k. Its the growth potential that really attracts people to the position.
[Hey man, could you give me your best / go-to intro line when you got a customer on the phone? Like .. that would you start with and what would you say if he responded in a way that you did not expect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3o53t?context=5)|For an existing customer - ""Hi Joe, it's AmadeusFlow. I don't have a lot of time, but I needed to get in touch with you. A FANTASTIC opportunity just got put on my desk and I want to run it by you."" Then I start pitching the company.  Take this with a grain of salt. Any salesman will tell you its not what you say that matters, its HOW YOU SAY IT. That's what separates successful salespeople from everyone else.
[It's funny, that sounds just like a line Jordan Belfort says in Wolf of Wall Street.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3q9gm?context=5)|When I was getting trained we had this book called the ""Golden Pitch Book"" that was filled with those lines. I heard rumors it was based off the script that Jordan used to use.
[Edit: Giving english another try.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3q9gm?context=5)|Google Golden Pitch Book and you'll see plenty of examples.
[I just met someone what works at Goldman Sacs.  Been in the business 30 years.   Got to tour the stock exchange floor.   He described stock brokering as just trying to scam someone.   How would describe it?  What are the unethical things you had or were doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3k5xm?context=5)|To say that stock brokering is a scam is an over-simplification. Without brokers, no one could invest at all! I don't think that's a good solution.
 |From my experience the real problem is how the industry is structured. Most of the rules and regulations are totally ineffective. It's just too easy for a broker to pull a fast one on his clients and get away with it.
 |I saw tons of unethical practices while I was in business. I regularly saw brokers forge signatures, make statements that they knew were untrue - they would even remove the last few pages from a prospectus that had all the scary ""risk"" disclosures.  
[How do you envision changing the regulatory landscape to deal with this? All of what you've listed is already illegal under the '33 and '34 Acts or SEC regulation, I would imagine. Do you think a more principles-based regulatory structure (described simply here by Matt Levine\) would help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3mhgc?context=5)|I think that would be a huge step in the right direction, but I think how advisors are compensated is a bigger issue. It doesn't align the advisor's interests with the client's.  If there's a REIT program that pays advisor a 7% commission or a great low cost mutual fund paying him 1%, which do you think he'll choose? This is the biggest problem as I see it.  Things ARE starting to change as more and more advisors move to fee based systems where they simply charge a flat % on total assets under management.
[How would I go about finding the right broker/company to invest for me?  What would you say is the lowest justifiable amount anyone should invest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3oub1?context=5)|I would go find a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA). They are held to a higher standard of conduct because they legally act as a fiduciary. Brokers, in the traditional sense, are not held to that standard.  Some brokers may be registered as RIAs, so its not a clear line. I would ask immediately how they are compensated for their services. RIA's charge an annual fee based on a percentage of what you send them. IMO, this is better than a transactional business where the broker charges you per trade.
[Would you answer my second question too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3pkax?context=5)|I'm sorry, I totally glanced over it.
 |I'd say the minimum if you want to start building a nest egg is $1,000. However, you wont really see meaningful gains until you hit $5,000 or so.
[Do you think asset management is all that much better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn4hd32?context=5)|I do think that the asset management side of the business is much better. There are some really crappy mutual funds out there, but even those still protect the client through diversification. Very rarely do mutual funds have their value cut in half.
[Especially if you work for a load fund family, or even one that charges relatively high fees - I think they just take peoples' money with a little more gentility.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn4hd32?context=5)|We have an aggressive fund with high portfolio turnover and fees but we have consistently beat the benchmark, net of fees, for the most of the firm's existence. I truly believe that we create a great product and, maybe more importantly, we sell it properly.
[Are you worried that ever since the early 80s and the explosion of the derivatives and bond markets, among other equity markets since then, has really created a short term outlook for most brokers? The vast majority of investors have extremely long investing horizons, not somebody looking to get in at 32 1/8th and get out when it hits 32 3/8ths later that day. My question I guess is that, do you think most of your clients/any client really understand the volatility versus gain/loss of a specific recommendation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2q6z5i/i_am_a_24_year_old_former_stock_broker_i_left/cn3kjkl?context=5)|You raise a great point. My background is in trading based off of technical and fundamental analysis. In my opinion, trading based off of fundamentals does not work in the current world. The market is driven by technicals. I believe the best investment strategies are long-term index investing and short-term momentum trading. Momentum trading is very hard to do well though.

 |When you buy stock, you are buying a piece of a company at a price set by the market. It's basic supply and demand. If more people are buying than selling then the price will go up, and vice versa.

One thing I've seen recently is TV and radio ads for penny stocks. These ads are legally considered ""entertainment"" somehow and therefore aren't regulated. People see the ad, buy the stock, and the price goes up. Eventually the mastermind behind it sells his stake and the price comes crashing down.

If you want to get in on Wall Street, you NEED to intern there. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA and I had good connections through some clubs/programs at Rutgers.
[Did you get hired into wallstreet as soon as you graduated? and if so, what fancy qualifications (high college gpa, certifications, knowing people on wallstreet\) did you have? ___ With the knowledge that brokers have on the stocks (or at least pretend to have\), I would think it would be easy for them to play the stock market better than most people.

Right now, I'm a college freshman at a small liberal arts college who might be double majoring in CS and Business.

Anyways, one thing I've learned from reading here is that internships count for a lot, but unfortunately, although the opportunities are there, a few things are making it hard for me to apply.

For one, I'm still working on my skills and I'm not sure how to keep moving forward, besides practicing python that I know before my OOP/Data Structures class in the Spring. Secondly, my college says that freshmen can't have internships for credit, and being an international student, I can't take it off credit.

The only bet I have right now is working at my school's IT department  and although I've worked an IT job before, I don't feel as if this would be CS related experience. I'm still going to take it because of the cash I get.

So now I ask, what can I do in my summer that will be beneficial in not only getting a job in a CS field, but also internships in subsequent years?

He's an architect and a gamer (at least he was until his former machine became obsolete about 4 years ago). He does a bunch of rendering and animation, hence the hefty CPU, GPUs and memory. Already has Windows, storage, periferals and monitor. The only thing missing is an SSD but it's not a priority.

I have about a 3.2 GPA from a pretty top-tier school, if not top-tier for Computer Science. 

I have no real internship experience, other than a campus job maintaining the website for an International Relations organization. I got into the major too late to get anything after sophomore year, and last year I was given the opportunity to travel around the world for a month or so, and could not turn it down.

I've taken classes, beyond the basic requirements, in web programming, data visualizations, security, and will be taking an advanced web programming course and a databases course next semester. 

I have limited personal projects outside of class, but am planning on taking a lighter semester so I have time to work on something. My first thought was to make an app that keeps track of my workouts, as health is very important to me. I do however have a few decent sized projects from classwork to share.

I've done work mostly in C, Java, C++, and Javascript, and consider myself a decent programmer.

I'm trying to set out a schedule of studying for technical interviews, working on personal projects, and the like. Does anyone have any advice on where my priorities should be? I feel very stressed out that I won't be able to find any work in the field. I don't expect to make six figures, I just want someone to hire me!"

2qcfim,1,2014-12-25,"I've become avoidant, deserted many people, and scared of facing the consequences; just want to love someone",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2qcfim/ive_become_avoidant_deserted_many_people_and/,"I'll start with some background info and try to be concise. I graduated high school four years ago (2010) and had a rough time beginning college due to a manic episode and subsequent bipolar disorder diagnosis which made me miss a semester. I was able to do well the next couple of years even though I was initially behind. In the summer of 2012 I had a really good internship at a large company, and I left a good enough impression that my manager gave me the option to continue part-time during the fall (the company was close by to my college) which I accepted.


That's when things began to go downhill. I was working part-time, had an overloaded class schedule, and involved in extracurriculars. Didn't get along with my roommates and had way too much stress to the point where I had a mental breakdown during finals and even spent one night in the hospital (though it was voluntary, and more of an observation area than inpatient unit, not as bad as two years prior). My grades were terrible, I got placed on academic probation and was honestly thinking about dropping out of school at that point. I stayed, did much better the following spring, but gradually got more and more depressed. I decided to take summer classes, almost felt obligated to do so because I didn't have any internship. I got even more depressed to the point where I just left, withdrew from the classes I was taking, and took a leave of absence.


That summer (2013) I was actually suicidal, or at least had suicidal ideations, and didn't want to do anything. I eventually signed up to take a few classes in the fall as a visiting student at a nearby in-state college (my previous one was a private school out of state, didn't feel like going back). I did fine in those three classes. One thing I was doing to keep me busy besides classes was working on a smartphone app with a friend of mine from high school who was going to the same college. That was pretty much the only social activity I had, when he and I were talking about the app. I had been regularly checking Craigslist for jobs and in mid-December got hired to build an app for a company. By that point, I had applied and got accepted as a full transfer student for the college I was attending. So for this job, I told my boss I could work full-time until the start of the semester in January, and part-time from then on, which he was fine with. And he said I could work from home some days if necessary, since it was a one hour commute from where I live.


I started the spring (2014) semester taking five classes while working part-time, which I knew would be difficult but I was looking forward to the challenge. Things slowly but surely got out of hand. By February my boss had me start working on another project, and by late February even another one. I had already withdrew from two classes that I knew I had no chance in passing and so I could focus more on work. That last work project was with a client and building a site that became impossible to build and got me sooooo angry. In March I had made arrangements to move to my dad and his girlfriend's house after my semester since it was half the distance to work than from my mom's house (where I was living). I always hated my dad growing up for a variety of reasons - my mom kicked him out of the house when I was young, and they've been separated since. He's been with his girlfriend for at least 6 or 7 years now, and she has turned him into a better person. I sometimes look up to her as a mother figure. She said I could move in at the end of June once her daughter's school year ended. 


I eventually gave up at school, failed the remaining three classes I was taking, two of which I completely left and didn't show up for class. The third was a foreign language class where our professor let us choose what we wanted to do for the semester project. I chose to build an app (turned out to just be a prototype of an app) which my two non-technical teammates thought was really cool. I stayed all the way until the end of that class mainly for the project, even though I knew I was going to fail overall.


That was mid-May, when I started to go back to work close to full-time. But by then, the client project I was doing had taken such an effect on me that I felt like quitting. I even asked my dad for advice then, and he said getting fired might be the best thing that could happen to me. By then end of May I had enough and quit without telling anyone. I had a huge amount of guilt for doing that, and somehow managed to avoid telling my parents. My boss never even contacted me back, only one co-worker did, who texted me 15 times in a row asking if I'm dead. I responded by saying no but never explained how or why I quit. I still moved into my dad's house in June, which was almost pointless by then since I wasn't working. I was able to fabricate a story about how I was working part-time and would eventually quit. When I left in the mornings I would usually go back to my mom's house. I started going to tech meetups earlier this year and was telling my parents how they are much more valuable than college, and the same with MOOCs. That had become a major source of conflict between my parents and I, with me being very adamant about how I'd rather learn more practical skills than take classes just for a degree.


Another issue I'll mention (and this one feels much worse now than what I've written so far) is how I'm basically afraid of women, or at least approaching women I'm interested in. I started online dating last year and was initially frustrated over how I wasn't getting as many responses as I wanted. Last December I was chatting with one girl who went to my school and that really got me excited. She lived out of state, so I never felt any pressure to ask her out on a date because once I could tell we both liked each other, she was already home for the holidays. We were sending messages back and forth every day, even did some video chats in January so I was really looking forward to meeting her in person when she came back for the spring semester. That day eventually happened - we had lunch and she even invited me to her dorm room afterwards because she said her roommate wanted to meet me also, which I thought was funny. We went back but she wasn't there, so it was just us talking more about random stuff, with me becoming increasingly more nervous/uncomfortable. After a little while I said I should be leaving soon, and she asked ""could I at least have a hug?"". I hugged her then left, wishing I could do more but was just too afraid. Looking back, that was the best chance I ever had at doing it. We were still friends and had lunch together a couple more times but a week later she told me how she got accepted to another college and would be transferring after that semester. So when I asked what she thought of the possibility of being a boyfriend/girlfriend couple, she said it wouldn't be worth starting a relationship only for it to end in heartbreak once she moves away. I was fine with that, mainly because she still wanted to be friends - that essentially meant I got to continue to chat with her about online dating (she gave me advice on my profile and even when I went on a date with someone else - that was more like a fluke) but all of this soon became worthless once I realized it didn't matter how much time I was spending on online dating because none of it changed the fact that I didn't have the courage to ask anyone out.


That whole embarrassing fear of women issue led to some huge irony - that last project from work which I mentioned early was building a niche dating site. I had told my dad about it earlier (which is when he said getting fired might be the best thing that could happen to me) but never told my mom because it would have been WAY too awkward. I think in June and July I cried more than I ever had before in my life due to all of this. Then to make matters worse, my grandfather was hospitalized in August with pneumonia (he already had lung cancer) and died less than a month later. It was only during this time that I actually told my family members that I quit my job because I couldn't fake it for much longer.


I spoke with a school advisor the week before my grandfather was in the hospital and made plans to take a reduced account of classes, but by the end of August I dropped those classes and took a leave of absence before the semester that I could barely think straight by then and reasoned that it would be safer for me to do nothing at all instead of messing up even further. I was actually part of a computer club which had just formed earlier this year and went to a few of those meetings then stopped because I started feeling like I didn't want to exist. All of the guilt and embarrassment from everything became too much. I even have almost completely stopped talking to my dad. That's my most immediate concern now given that it's Christmas. Even though I'm celebrating with my mother's side of the family, I usually call him but I don't even want to this Christmas. I've been delaying posting this because I feel like it could go on and on forever. I started seeing a therapist a couple months ago and that's helped a little bit. Was able to contact my former boss to briefly explain / apologize why I left as well as sign up for classes starting next semester but never got around to discussing how to talk with my parents about all this.


This past Thanksgiving was the worst holiday I've ever had to participate in - I never before felt like I just don't want to live. I don't want to feel the same way when I wake up tomorrow. Already crying, but with tears of happiness, knowing someone will read this and give me hope.

2qcqfe,1,2014-12-25,Entirely too much money for first real job in the industry?,username_6916,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qcqfe/entirely_too_much_money_for_first_real_job_in_the/,"I know, I know.... This sounds like a first world problem. But I it does have me genuinely concerned. 

So, about a year ago I graduated from an entirely average CSU with a degree in computer science and a C+ GPA. I've got a pair of internships that involved programming, but nothing particularly notable. Both were local subsidiaries of larger, known but not 'tech-famous' companies. In short, I'm not some any sort of 'badass ninja' programmer who contributes to the Linux Kernel in his sleep.

I managed to get an interview with one of the 'big 5' in San Francisco. On the application, I put my salary expectations at around $65,000/year. I somehow got an offer for nearly double that when we include all bonuses and incentives. 

Again, I have not had a full-time professional job in the last year since I graduated. I am entry level. I'm worried that this is entirely too much money, and that I will not be able to deliver what they expect for that amount. The HR person I talked to was reassuring when I raised this concern, but I still can't shake the feeling that I'm just an idiot who just 'tricked' a multi-million dollar company into hiring me. 

So, how realistic is my fear? What can I do to be productive at this job? And is the market in San Francisco really that utterly insane? I'll be earning more at the start of my career than my parents did at the end of theirs.  "

I partied a bit with my co-workers and got a bit of notoriety as a hard-worker yet can enjoy himself. I made a lot of friends there including my boss and ex-coworkers and I was told by a sales friend that they would vouch for me if needed. This year I've been laser-focused on my studies and raising my GPA in order to maximize options for either grad school or a future job. However, an opportunity has come along where another startup in my school area, is doing pretty much the exact same service. However, my company or any of the others leaders in the space don't really compete in my market since its not profitable or viable yet like the largest ones. My only concern also is whether I signed a non-compete (I was essentially an intern, contractor-status) which would prevent me from pursuing it.  In addition, tax season is coming and I need to get my W-2. I know this seems like a bunch of unrelated things but my questions are:

1. How do I ask for a W-2 from my company?
1. Will asking whether I signed a non-compete be looked at suspiciously, and harm my future chances of coming back at the company?
1. If no for the 2nd question. How do I ask respectfully?
1. How do I maintain my connections for when I do decide to begin my job hunt in 4 months? (I'm FB friends with most of my old co-workers, connected on LinkedIn and I chat with a few from time to time). 
1. Anything else you think I should consider?

Feel very strongly about my OOP capabilities and overall programming know how, in my comfortable environment; that said C++ and Visual Studio is far from my comfortable environment(Eclipse/Sublime and all associated technologies).

Starting a new job first Monday in January, while I've had several internships it will be my first full fledged Software Engineering position. Curious if you all knew any tutorials/sites for people already familiar with the fundamentals of programming but wanted to get language specific tips and tutorials/exercises? Perhaps even a Visual Studio tutorial? I feel for a lot of C++ I can just take my old Java projects and completely rewrite them for practice, Ruby on the other hand I'm a little more lost with.

Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated! Happy holidays!"

My university seems pretty good at its career infrastructure for engineers, and I do plan on doing internships in future summers. 

That being said, I have a bit of a travel bug, I definitely want to go bike touring or backpacking this summer, and the way I see it, internships after my sophomore and junior years are worth a lot more. 

I don't know how I compare to other candidates, but I do have some pretty good engineering extracurriculars: designing a solar power system with my university's chapter of engineers without borders, I have attended a hackathon this past fall and plan on doing a few more this spring, and I tutor math to a high school student. My GPA is a lower this past semester than I would have liked, however it is quite acceptable (though not quite ideal) for engineering-- how detrimental would not looking for an internship this upcoming summer be?


Edit: apparently grammar goes to shit when you type on your phone. Still ashamed of the title. "
2qhghb,2,2014-12-26,A few questions about CS from an undergrad,Blackbelt54,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qhghb/a_few_questions_about_cs_from_an_undergrad/,"I'm a sophomore undergrad double majoring in CS and math. I love programming, but my real passion is the math behind it, i.e. algorithms, complexity, proofs, etc (I'm a CS guy but NOT a tech guy). So, as of now I plan on going for a PhD and becoming a professor. My first question is, what is the best summer work for me to do? I'm applying to some NSF-REU programs, but with no prior research experience that will be a long shot. I'm also applying to software development internships, more as a back up plan though. Even then, I don't really have the right experience, which leads me to my next question. Maybe it's just my school, but why are software dev jobs centered around Ruby on Rails/JS/HTML and stuff like that, when we don't learn anything about any of that stuff in any of my classes?

So my main questions are: 1. What should an aspiring PhD with no previous research experience do for summer after sophomore year? 2. Why do we not learn web stuff in core CS classes? 3. People who are or have been in a similar place as me, any tips to put me on a path to grad school? Is academia the only place for someone like me?"

I also worked on a project for one of my classes involving bitcoin data. 

Am I screwed when it comes to looking for jobs because I never had an internship?

• Is it even worth it to apply for internships after freshman year?

• Are there internships geared towards less experienced students?

• Did any of you get internships after freshman year? How did it go?"

This coming semester I am taking Data Structures and Algorithms, Calculus II, Discrete Mathematics, and an English class. I want to be in a good position to get an internship by the end of the semester. What should I learn in my free time to make that happen? My current options are: 

1. I have an android phone so I could try mobile development, 

2. I have some working knowledge of html and css so I could also try and pickup javascript and some library and django,

3. I also have a small application that grabs data from from a website and converts the data into a csv file. The application works but I have to manually grab the html, so to fully complete the application it could make some http request to login and use jsoup or something to grab the html then extract the data as usual. 

Which one of these options seem like the best route for this coming semester, or is there an option that I haven't explored yet?"

So I'm pretty much competing with the world for the best internships, a majority of which are US-based. 

On top of that, while the program I'm in has a strong faculty, all our core CS courses begin in sophomore year. So I just finished with discrete math and programming in C++, and am going to take algorithms and data structures in spring.

I'm a fairly bright student. Messed up first semester but caught up quickly in the next two.

Question: What can I do to catch up this summer when it comes to skills? Every top-20 company seems to be looking for something completely different, so what should I be studying? Is it okay to study a little of each or focus on a few skills?

I'll be applying to as many places as I can next year, so any knowledge you can throw at me would be useful. Thanks!"

Looking to polish up my resume to continue the internship hunt for this summer. I'm using the same LaTeX template as a fellow in the Resume Round Table thread used as I do have some familiarity with it. Would greatly appreciate feedback in general and for the following questions. For reference, the blurred out section on the top includes my name, LinkedIn url, email, and telephone number. The rest of the blurred sections should be self-explanatory.


Is the profile summary acceptable?


Is the skills section relevant and applicable to internships I will be applying to?


What should go in the extra space I have circled? Options I have considered are activities/societies/clubs (some of which I hold leadership positions in, but not all are engineering-related), academic awards/scholarships, design projects (however, these projects all take place within general engineering classes that all engineering students take; I am currently working on an independent design project, but not enough work has been done on it).

I don't know what happened but I failed so many classes that I skipped through all phases of academic probation and am out for good. 80grand in loans.

Trying to keep it short, my girlfriend comes from a rich family they'll convince her to leave me soon. My own family was kind enough to cosign my student loans, but now faces huge debt if I can't pay them myself somehow.

2qixwu,10,2014-12-27,Rant: Feeling really stressed about the upcoming semester (internships),nlman0,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2qixwu/rant_feeling_really_stressed_about_the_upcoming/,"For the past year my main goal has been to get an engineering internship or Co-op for this upcoming summer. Time is running short and now I'm feeling really stressed about accomplishing this goal.

Some background: I'm a sophomore in electrical. Im a quiet one and im pretty socially awkward. Pretty high GPA but didn't have a lot else before last summer. Last summer I realized that a good GPA alone wasn't going to do anything, so I started doing other stuff. Learning some programming, some arduino, design team, volunteered at a lab a few times, heck I even managed to get a small leadership position in my university's robotics club. I genuinely never thought I could even manage to get a leadership position. Point is, I've been trying to gain some relevant skills and experience.

This past semester was the first time I tried getting an internship. I applied a good amount online and went to my school's career fair. I've only got one response so far, but they sent me a form to fill out requiring references that could account for my ""technical abilities"" before they could do a phone interview. I didn't know any of my professors and I was too shy to ask them despite not knowing who I was. I ended up not filling out the form so I never even got to the phone interview. Meanwhile a lot of my friends have already gotten internships and coops for the spring and summer. At the same companies I was targeting at my career fair too.

I'm back home right now for Christmas break and I'm honestly feeling really stressed about the whole thing. I've been spending a lot of the break reading PDF textbooks on classes I'm never going to take and trying to learn a programming language and reading an arduino project book (I would be doing the projects but I accidentally left my arduino back at my university). It's 6 in the morning here and I can't sleep because all I can think about is ""I gotta make sure to learn how to socialize with professors and recruiters"", ""I gotta figure out what personal project I can do to bump my resume"", ""I gotta send emails to random professors asking if I can do undergraduate research for them"" and a bunch of other annoying things. 

I feel like my last chance to accomplish my goal is at my schools spring career fair at the beginning of February. I honestly feel really unprepared, especially in the socializing department, and I feel like a blast furnace about the explode just thinking about the day of the career fair. 

Here are the kind of responses I was hoping to get:
Success stories about people who had trouble finding internships.
Advice about how to relax and chill out from all the stress.
Reassurance that I'm going crazy over nothing and life will go on if I don't get an internship.

I apologize if this post seems self-indulgent but I feel like I don't really have anyone else to turn to. I've talked to my friends and family at length about this and they're getting tired of me moaning about the same thing over and over again. So instead, I've decided to moan on reddit. Lets see how that turns out."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So I'm sure in your time you have seen many individuals as a result of drug use, either by them or a member of their family, close friend, etc. and so I'd like to ask a few questions about that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|Here comes the drug questions! I have/do see drug use concerns from time to time and counselors today working with most any population need to be aware of how to manage these situations.
[Does the facility you work have specific policies in relation to drug use by those teen in the facility? Do you require a certain clean period from drug use before they can arrive? Do you allow people currently suffering from withdrawals and if so do you take actions to prevent serious withdrawal symptoms, such as the provision of Suboxone to manage opioid dependencies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|Let me start with this: Whenever I'm working with a teen that may be dealing with a drug use pattern from casual consumption to full-blown addiction, I'll inform the parents/family that this feature needs to be addressed first and foremost before shifting to other behaviors. The chemicals are impacting biological and neurological features of this individual and spending time on anything else would probably be wasteful.
[There has been a lot of talk about the medicalisation/decriminalisation/legalisation of cannabis and the effects this will have on teen usage rates, do you have an opinion on this? What do you think is the appropriate action to be taken with regards to teens and cannabis use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|If somebody were to enter our facility clearly under the influence of anything to the extent it inhibits their ability to consent to services and respond to basic mental status evaluation questions, they need to be taken to a medical facility and cleared by a physician (with written proof) before they can be admitted. If they go through withdrawals and cannot participate in the program due to simply feeling like shit, then we recommend for the teen to return when if he/she can reach a sustained level of sobriety as they cannot use anything while in the program other than prescribed medications. No exceptions. We cannot provide any specific services tailored to those coping with reactions to drug use or withdrawal.
[Do you believe that drug abuse should be treated as a medical issue or as a criminal one? In your opinion, do harm minimisation policies such as needle exchanges, safe injection sites and heroin provision programs lead to better or worse outcome for teenagers who are drugs users or at risk of becoming drug users?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|Regarding teens and cannabis use: it's going to happen and will continue to happen regardless of the the laws and how they may or may not change in the future. However, if I get the sense that a teen is using in order to self-medicate for something other than a pure desire to use the drug, I try to hone in on that. It can be a good coping skill, and that's just the way it is. Some folks drink away their sorrows to numb the pain and some grab a bong. It makes sense. The tricky part that I try to reveal to these individuals is that the cannabis use is a temporary solution to a permanent problem that can lead to a permanent consequence that isn't worth the trouble. I don't focus on ""Bad kid, why would you smoke that wacky weed?!"" because they're going to shut their ears immediately and think I'm just another adult giving them a hard time. I level with them...""I understand it helps and you don't see a problem with using. That's fine, but what I'd like to figure out is if there's something else you can try that can also help you cope that doesn't need to be inhaled assuming you always have some nearby you can use when you need to."" I think it's appropriate to find out what's initiating the behavior. Behaviors have motives; therefore, what's motivating the cannabis use and how else can that feature be addressed by other means?
[If you could make any changes to drug policy effective tomorrow, what would you change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|I try to stay out of the medical/criminal debate. I don't use drugs, never have smoked anything. Never have drank anything, other than O'Douls, simply by choice and not motivated by any holier than thou beliefs. I realized that drug use is an issue for folks, young and old, and that treatment options should be available. I was looking into working at a regional methadone clinic earlier this year and I think places like that are great opportunities for people to get treatment they can use. However, not all those who can use the help really want it. That's the issue at the center of that debate, in my opinion.
[Sorry for the shopping list of questions, thanks for doing this AMA! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jnvo?context=5)|Any changes to the policy? I don't know where to start. I think legalizing cannabis wouldn't be a bad idea. I don't know a whole lot about the political side of things but appropriate taxation seems like that could help get some areas of the nation back on their feet. All I know it, whatever happens, I still wouldn't use it. But I realized there's always folks who will and I want to be able to help them if they're ready to work. 
[I might be late, but what is your background in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6tpoh?context=5)|I have a B.S. degree in Psychology and a M.S.Ed. degree in Mental Health Counseling. My programs required me to complete supervised practicum and internship hours in a local site, and the one I went to hired me after I completed my academic requirements. If you're just a pure volunteer coming off the street, I think it would be harder to get in to some agencies as they may favor people housed under a college/university for liability reasons (unfortunate as that is). My advice is to be rather aggressive (but respectful) when you contact agencies and express your interest in working for them.
[How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6tpoh?context=5)|My studies haven't helped to prepare me for this position. Some stuff was relevant, the theories of psychotherapy mainly, but overall it provided a basis for which the knowledge I gain from in-field experience has been built upon. Schooling and degrees can open doors, but no textbook will get you though what happens after you walk in.
[What were your studies in, and what have you found to be most relevant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6tpoh?context=5)|This facility isn't designed as a punishment provider. We serve mainly to help those that need a chance to regroup and evaluate how to improve their relationships with family as well as anything else that is current causing them discomfort and distress. This program works best for those that are ready to make some changes but just need a little bit of help. The punishment-style facilities, juvenile detention and whatnot, are helpful for those that have either broken the law or at risk of completing such behaviors. We've worked with teenagers that don't respond to our program and require an environment such as detention centers to get them to a point that they can evaluate their lives while being safe. Somebody actively ready and looking to fight others isn't creating a safe environment in the program I work for. We don't have guards, cells, tasers, guns, pepper spray...nothing like that.
[How does the facility operate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6tpoh?context=5)|As behaviors escalate into more and more serious events that can cause harm to the perpetrator and/or others, incarceration (follow-up with reintegration services and support) can be helpful. I don't like that this is the case, but there are disturbed youth that need that level of intervention in order to prevent them from getting into a hole they can't climb back out of.
[How do to feel about the recent move towards incarceration with troubled juveniles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6tpoh?context=5)|The most common diagnoses disorders I've seen and worked with are ADHD, ODD, Depression, Bipolar, PTSD, Borderline Personality (always fun), and Adjustment disorders. I have worked with Autistic children, but our program is not very suitable for that population and their direct service duration with us is generally pretty short compared to most others. We find other resources in the area and help connect the families to those agencies for further support.
[Thank you very much for the answer! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn7jg8s?context=5)|(thumbs up symbol)
[I have been dealing with some problems of my own, depression, suicide, etc.  I am 18 and I currently have no money of my own.  My parents dont have a lot of money either.  I have talked to a therapist and she actually recommended a inpatient place, but I dont think I could pay for it.  I was wondering if you knew what my options may be?  Im moving back in with my dad, and probably pausing college for a semester, but I still sometimes feel like I would be better off dead.  I already tried once.  Not sure where to go from here.  Thanks for your time :\)  ??? Is that enough punctuation automod XD ???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2qiqax/iama_overnight_crisis_counselor_for_teens_ama/cn6jlv0?context=5)|Well, bad news first. You're 18. You're legally an adult now and if you live in a place like I do it's a good idea to get accustomed to the fact that there are limited services for you that you don't have to pay arms and legs for. However, it's not a bad idea to get in contact with your region's human or social services department to assess options.
 |If you're dealing with a history of suicidal thoughts, some current, take a step back and focus on what's important right now. List the top three things you want to work on/change/improve right now and see what lands there. Take a break from college if you need to in order to refocus. Likewise, if you have health insurance on your own or through your parent(s), give them a call and see if they cover services though local agencies be it group counseling, individual, or otherwise.
 |Do you have any healthy hobbies you enjoy? Do those things. Don't have one? Find one. The first steps toward making some positive, long-term changes always seem impossible or damn near. I'll leave you with a bit of perspective that I'll share with the teens I work with: People don't do things that change their lives because they're comfortable. When you're comfortable, you don't risk it because what's the point? If you're feeling down, and even question your own life, I'd assume you're not comfortable in your own skin. Use that to motivate yourself to do what it takes to make some positive changes in your life. Use some of my suggestions or keep looking elsewhere for something that sticks.
 |Final thought/tip: Start daily journaling today; track what you do each day to improve your life. Something great happens? Write that shit down. Something bad happens? Write that shit down. Work on finding trends in what you like happening as well as trends in what you don't like happening. Find the way to best cut off those bad things and maximize your chances of running into good outcomes using your own experiences as the foundation. You got this!

2qjidc,13,2014-12-27,Normal salary for an entry-level dev at an NYC startup?,recentlydiscovered,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qjidc/normal_salary_for_an_entrylevel_dev_at_an_nyc/,"Hey guys, I wanted to get some opinions on this.  I just graduated with a BS in Comp Sci this past May, and have been job searching for the past few months.  I recently got an offer from a startup in NYC, but it was lower than I had been hoping for/expecting (low 40s).  Although I realize that I can't expect TOO much from a startup, especially right out of college, it still seems like the offer was pretty low.  Based on the preliminary research that I've done, it seems like somewhere in the 60s is more typical, especially given that this company seems to have pretty good funding (according to CrunchBase).  So I wanted to ask here what you all think would be a typical salary to expect, to help guide my negotiation so I don't ask for too much or too little.  I know there are some other threads that discuss salaries, but not a whole lot of information about this specific scenario.

EDIT:  I should also add that I have internship experience and that I would be relocating from DC.  And also that my CS experience isn't perfectly aligned with what they're looking for (it's front-end/web development, whereas most of what I've done is Java/C/C++, with some Spring experience).

EDIT 2:  It looks like they've gotten Series B funding.  One question I have is, in general, how much higher it's possible to negotiate from an initial offer?  I know this depends on a lot of variables, but obviously I couldn't negotiate to $100k or something, so what's the upper bound on that?"
2qjrw8,1,2014-12-27,[Build Help] Struggling to figure out how to affordably upgrade an obsolete tower to a strong gaming/work tower one part at a time while still allowing me to use the tower the whole time.,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2qjrw8/build_help_struggling_to_figure_out_how_to/,"(Note: I've typed this whole post out for /r/buildapcforme and then realized that the sidebar encouraged discussions of smaller upgrades to /r/buildapc instead. Since I am talking about upgrading one part at a time over a long time frame, I felt that it may be more appropriate to post here. I'm also not exactly sure which tag to use for this entry so I hope that [Build Help] are the right one.)

This is probably a rather unusual /r/buildapcforme post but this is done out of neccessity. Basically we are broke. My wife and I left college for personal reason. So right now we are stuck in a transition trying to find an apartment and whatnot. In the meantime, we are staying at a rented room of an okay place. Anyway, Because of how much more affordable the PC gaming can be compared to our current Xbox 360 and the fact that a lot of my personal business (trying to sell photography) are very computer dependent, I feels that having a strong PC tower that can encompass both gaming and graphic works would help us save a lot of money in the long run especially since our laptops are simply not able to perform very well for our need at the moment. I am planning to sell my laptop and Xbox 360 once the tower gets strong enough.

So my post here are more of trying to build a foundation of info for me to work from. I have had build two computers quite a long while ago and loved the experience. I know how to put a tower together. My only dilemma is that I simply do not know what parts would be good to upgrade one at a time while still allowing us to be able to use the computer the whole time. My knowledge of what components are out there is very obsolete.

Right now the tower is weaker (can barely play PS1 level graphic) than my laptop so I am OK with not being able to use it at first but it will have to be back in working order asap so I can start my works on it (and to start convincing my wife to sell the Xbox 360 for extra cash). I am also not too worried about the non-essential part of the computer. The only components I am asking for assistance with are the motherboard, processor, RAM, and GPU. I can figure out everything else from there on easily. 

I plan to upgrade every single parts several times as time goes on to build a top of the line computer as we can afford it but still maintain functional use of the computer the entire time.

---

TL-DR, I need a rough idea of how I COULD upgrade this tower so I can start from there in my research in the future whenever we have an extra influx of cash.

Thank you for reading up on my post. Any input would help us plan our budget accordingly and help us out so much.

---

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* I'm a photographer so I would love to be able to easily use my Adobe CS6 Master Collection + Lightroom. I have also been very interested in 3D modelling (primarily via Blender3D) and possibly some programming for Android. I also like gaming and would actually like to eventually convince my wife to give up on our current Xbox 360 and switch to more PC gaming. I do not have too many resource-heavy games but most of them can't run on my laptop ATM. I have about 99% of my games via Steam. Here's a list of the more powerful games I currently own on Steam;

1. Borderlands GOTY
1. Left 4 Dead 2
1. Metro 2033
1. The Witcher: Enhanced Edition
1. Fallout 3
1. Bioshock
1. Oblivion Game of the Year Deluxe
1. Guild Wars: Trilogy
1. Zeno Clash
1. Mass Effect
1. The Orange Box

* Most of them are unplayable unless at minimum settings on my laptop. Some still just simply do not play at all (The witcher are a notable example).
* I am also interested in possibly dualbooting various Linux distros via a second drive (I don't NEED to do this so if a motherboard are not very linux friendly, I don't mind skipping out on this dualbooting capability)

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I essentially do not have a budget for this PC because it will be a part by part upgrades over a long period of time. It is my hope to eventually replace the current tower completely part by part into an ultimate PC tower for gaming and graphic works. I'm very sure that the first purchase would be the motherboard and the processor but I do not know how expensive a future-proof motherboard would be. Due to this, I just cannot really give a budget. All I ask is to keep the fact that the more expensive a part is, the longer I will have to save up for it.

* My best estimate is probably just a few hundreds a year. Maybe around $300 a year? It really depends on how lucky my wife and I am with jobs and whatnot.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* This is a long term project. I am aware that most parts will be very obsolete by the time I can finally afford the parts. This is more for giving me a starting ground to research the next parts when the time to purchase the proper parts come.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Motherboard, Processor, RAMs, and GPU. Maybe PSU if needed for GPU?

* This is the current parts to be upgraded.

1.   Mainboard : Dell 0GC068
1.   Processor : Intel Pentium 4 640 @ 3200   MHz
1.   Physical Memory : 2560  MB DDR2-SDRAM (3 x 512MB sticks and 1 x 1GB stick)
1.   Video Card : NVIDIA GeForce 210

* I would like it if the top 3 of these four parts are compatible through upgrades. Like upgrading to a new motherboard is possible with certain CPU architecture and RAM. My goal for RAMs is 8GB at a minimum. Obviously the higher is better.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Currently in VA, USA. Can head up to NoVA/DC area if the saving are significant enough offset the cost to drive there rather than ordering it online (like some sale events). There are times where we may go to DC or pass through that may allow me a chance to grab what I need.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* Here is where most of you may cringe. This is an extremely OLD computer tower ([an Dell Dimension XPS Gen 5](http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-dimension-xps-gen-5/)) that I plan to use as a starting ground. I have grabbed parts from other defunct towers when I worked as an Intern. I simply do not have access to anything better and do not have the money to purchase anything better right now. I would rather focus on upgrading the essential components first once I manage to save up for it. Everything listed below here will be upgraded separately on my own from this post once the core upgrade have been done.

1.   Video Card : NVIDIA GeForce 210
1.   Hard Disk : Maxtor 6Y080M0 ATA Device (80GB)
1.   Hard Disk : Maxtor 6Y080M0 ATA Device (80GB)
1.   Hard Disk : Maxtor 7L250S0 ATA Device (250GB)
1.   DVD-Rom Drive : _NEC DVD+-RW ND-3530A
1.   PSU: Generic but really oddly shaped 460 watts (must be upgraded alongside the case at the same time)
1.   Case: Same case as the XPS Gen 5 but with the exterior plastic removed (need to be upgraded asap, use cases from secondhand computers from thrift store if needed)


&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I have never overclocked before but I am very interested in doing so. If I have to wait until later down the road, I wouldn't mind as long as the initial CPU upgrade are strong enough.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* A lot of USB ports and the more of them that are USB 3.0, the better.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I would prefer mid-tower to full tower. The focus here are two thing, ease of locking it up (heavier cases are not easier to steal) and space for future upgrades.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* I generally prefers the latest supported windows. I do want to try dual-booting linux for fun and learning.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

I pretty much listed most of the info along the listed questions above and a short explanation on the top of the post. I just wanted to put my explanation up there so people are aware of what kind of a project this is before investing time into the research for the parts.

Thanks"
2qjw9u,4,2014-12-27,CS or OR degree?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2qjw9u/cs_or_or_degree/,"I'm having trouble deciding between majors.  Initially I entered college doing Computer Science, but now I think I might be better suited for Operations Research.

CS is nice because it is generally seen as the more rigorous curriculum.  Additionally, it has spectacular job placement potential, with salaries of graduates from my college averaging in the mid 90k range.  Internships, I've heard, aren't difficult to acquire in the summer.  Also, I've worked with code ever since the seventh grade, so it is the more familiar major with me.

However, I'm getting afraid that CS might not fulfill me as much.  One thing I've found out after taking an object oriented programming in Java course is, I really don't enjoy programming as much if I'm not working on projects that I like, using tools and languages that I do not love.  I'm also concerned that the scope of the degree is narrower than the scope of OR, which is considered to be the ""liberal arts major"" of the Engineering school.

Operations Research is also a reputable program, though also seen as easier.  Yet, I've heard that the Financial Engineering courses that upper level students of OR can take are one of the hardest courses in the entire college.  Its job placement record is not as good as the CS, according to graduate exit surveys.  I probably would have to get a Masters of Engineering degree, where I would study for one more year.  The courses involve mathematics, probability, statistics, and databases, all of which I would be ready for.  

I'm attracted to the OR major because of its breadth, as I feel like CS is a very specialized field (with required courses in Operating Systems and Algorithms, Functional Programming, etc).  Still, the CS job potential and the imminent growth of computer jobs in the coming decades also lures me very much.

Does anyone have any ideas or pointers?

I have never had to worry about money in a serious way just how to pay for stupid things. I attend a state school and have carried above a 3.5 GPA for all four terms now. I have had multiple internships at major companies in the ECE field since I was a sophomore in high school. I haven't had a successful relationship since my junior/senior year of high school but that was a year long relationship. 

It seems that everything I do, ever text I send, every action I take, I seem to regret or freak out about till something happens that reassures me nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Even talking to my friends I over analyze and freak out that something that is complete unnecessary. I consider my self a well liked person who instantly will drop anything I do to help others especially my friends. I have always said I think logically and act emotionally my friends have always laughed at that. Even locking something or packing I will check and check again a million times just to ensure I have everything or locked everything.

I am just concerned I've been living this way since I was a freshman in High school an it is driving me to Whits end. I hate the thought of my friends being mad at me for something I didn't mean but rarley is that the case. I hate thinking about what will happen to my house, car or belongings when nothing ever happens. Please give me advice on how I should approach my problem! I don't want to live this way anymore but I can't stop thinking this way!"
2qkepr,3,2014-12-27,Hey parents... I think I'm old enough to drive by myself now.,Resmell,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2qkepr/hey_parents_i_think_im_old_enough_to_drive_by/,"I have been alive on this earth for 19 years and 4 months. I got my learners permit close to 16 years of age. I got my license close to 17 years of age. To this day, my family still does not trust me to drive by myself, and it annoys me so much.

I don't have a car. I'm fine with that. We aren't the richest family, I don't expect to have my own car any time soon. However, we do currently own two cars, one for my father and one for my mother. They use their respective cars to go to work during the day time. However, during the night time, and usually on the weekends, the cars just sit there in the garage. If I ask if I can drive somewhere, like a friend's house, a store, etc., they'll reject the idea of me driving alone. The only way I'm allowed to drive at all is if either of my parents are sitting in the passenger seat.

Say I'm going to a friend's house. My dad will not let me go unless he drives me there. Ok dad, that is a waste of gas. If you drive over there, then you take the car back home, you have to drive BACK to my friend's house to pick me up, then we would have to drive BACK home. We use up twice the amount of gas that we should have used. How about I just go alone, and I drive to my friends house, then I will drive myself back when I'm coming home?? I hate forcing my dad to waste his own time, he has better things to do than to drive me to my friend's house. OK THEN LET ME DRIVE BY MYSELF.

Basically the exact same scenario with any place I wanna drive to. Movie theater, restaurant, grocery place, etc. Anywhere I wanna go, my parents gotta drive me or sit there watching me.

Their excuse for never letting me drive myself is usually something along the lines of ""it's too dangerous out there"". Fine. Assuming that is true, then why do you drive? Why are you driving if it's ""too dangerous"" like you say? Why not take a bus everywhere? If your answer is ""I have more driving experience"", well then tell me, how can I build MY EXPERIENCE if I'm never allowed to practice driving alone?? How will I ever learn to drive at night, in the rain/snow, if you never let me do so? I've never been in an accident, I'm generally a great driver. I use turn signals, obey all signs, always. Sure, I've come close to accidents. But really, who hasn't?

They'll always use the other excuse ""you're too young"". Really...? I know high school sophomores who have parents that let them drive. Sometimes when I wanna go somewhere, I have to call my friends to come and pick me up. Usually these friends are like 2-3 years younger than me. High schoolers are currently driving me, a college student, around. I hate doing that to my friends. I live so far from most people I know, and my friends get annoyed when they have to come all the way to me to pick me up. I have a reputation for being that kind of person, someone who always needs a ride and is usually something like a hassle. I blame my parents. All they need to do is let me borrow their car for the night. Then I'll just drive over to where I need to go myself. But nope. It's never that easy for me.

My parents always say that they ""don't trust me"". What the actual. I have never once done something that would cause them to not trust me. When I say I'm going somewhere, I go there, and nowhere else. I have no secrets to hide from them. What reason do you have to not trust me. And when/how will you trust me?

Today, my brother wanted to go to a nearby store. Literally a mile or so away. Not far at all. I could have driven there myself with my brother. But nooooooooooope. My mom said she would go as well. Then my dad decided to tag along. Again. You guys don't have to come if you won't be buying anything. And please, let me get some experience driving without my parents. Can't even drive to a store that's so close to my house.

This isn't the first time I've posted a rant about my parents and me driving myself. I've gotten suggestions in the past about how maybe I should save up and just buy myself a car. Yeah, I'll do that the day I decide I wanna die. If my parents ever found out I made a purchase as big as a car by myself, I wouldn't hear the end of it. They'd probably call me an idiot or something for doing that, then make me give back the car. In the miraculous scenario where they don't make me return the car, they would still prohibit me from driving myself. So yeah, problem not solved there. 

I'm just so worried that this is gonna ruin my future. With very little experience driving, how will I survive in the future? I'm currently in the process of getting a summer internship for this summer. There is a 99.99% chance it will not be in the state I currently live in. I'll have to stay by myself for a few months. Assuming I get an internship, how will I commute to work? Fine, I'll take the bus. But how will I go to other places I need to go to? I never want the day to come, but what if the day comes that you guys aren't here to help me anymore? What am I supposed to do then?

As a 19 year old college student, on the deans list, never disobeying you guys, always putting safety first, I beg you both, my parents. Please start trusting me and please just let me drive by myself."

I tell everyone that I'm fine but that's a lie. I have no reason to live anymore. I've always been depressed, for as long as I can remember. I've only ever had four reasons not to kill myself, and they're the same as I'm sure a lot of people's. There was God, my family, my girlfriend, and my group of friends. 

I stopped believing in God a while ago, so that dropped to three pretty quick. I never realized how fucked up my family really was until my alcoholic mother pointed a loaded gun at my face in high school because she thought I was going to take her alcohol away from her. That left me with only two.

After high school, my group of friends I've known all my life almost abandoned me, but ended up keeping me around. Things were improving in college. That didn't last though. I went on a spring break trip with my girlfriend, and got a wonderful job offer for an internship. Over break, however, I found out she'd been cheating on me when I saw some of the things a guy was messaging her. I was devastated. I drank until I couldn't walk, then snorted coke so I could keep going. I made the mistake of smoking and I couldn't pass the drug test for my job offer, effectively hitting rock bottom.

I recovered with the help of my friends, and eventually became involved with the same girl. As one would imagine, she cheated again, and I almost killed myself there. At least I still had that one thing though. Now I don't. They don't want anything to do with me. I have nothing stopping me now.

I hate myself. I'm weak, I'm lazy, I'm a hypocrite, I'm a terrible person. I just want everything to be over, and I'm scared I won't be able to stop myself anymore."

I realize there is a wide array of questions that could be on the interviews, but I am self learning as much as I can right now. I am focusing on the core Data structures (Arrays,Linked List,Stacks,Queues, Trees, and Hash Tables) and a few algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort and different types of tree traversals). 

I got a hold of the Cracking the Coding Interview book and the CLRS textbook and plan to use those too. 

Is the material I am planning on covering enough? I read some stuff about System design, but it seems like there is a ton of information that I have yet to learn, and I only have about 25 days. I was hoping to get picked for the Engineering Practicum(Freshman &amp; Sophomore internship) interviews, but they deferred my applications to the Software Engineering Internship (Junior to Graduate level) because of my experience."
2qm42h,19,2014-12-28,Experience requirements in the games industry,_amaranti,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2qm42h/experience_requirements_in_the_games_industry/,"I'm a student currently studying computer science and, as an avid gamer, I'm hoping to enter the games development industry one day. Casually I've been browsing job opportunities at AAA studios and apart from their individual programming language requirements, their all usually require a few years (generally 3 or more) experience in the games industry. I was wondering how one acquires this experience and whether or not it has to be as a full time position in a AAA studio or if it can be a smaller role, such as an internship. I've noticed that quite a few of the larger companies are becoming more flexible with requirements, particularly [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/jobs/job_postings.html) and [Blizzard](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/roles/engineering.html), who clearly outline what is ideal in an employee and how to get the requirements you need in order to be the best candidate for the role. Thanks in advance for any comments and advice! 

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful comments everyone! Of course I realise that I won't work at a AAA studio straight out of study, I was merely curious as to the standard one needed to have in order to work there later on in a career."

For a little background, I am a one man technology department for a k12.  This includes: almost 700 users, 110 chromebooks, 225 desktops/laptops, a few tablets...as well as helpdesk, all servers, and all network equipment.  

I received an awesome reply about letting the intern acquire the hardware as part of a lesson and I am totally going to do it.  I've also been putting together a mediawiki 'lesson plan page' so the student can work through them at his leisure with acquiring and justifying the server as lesson one (well 0 cause thats where I chose to start).

I am asking for a few more ideas on lessons that I can come up with.  Because I am always terribly busy I am attempting to stay ahead of things for him to do and learn while I am on a bit of a break.  Here is what I have so far:

* acquire hardware
* learn to run cable, crimp, test, tone, and understand some basic network protocols and create his own internal network
* configure a virtual OS (probably esxi as that is what I am most familiar with)
* create some vm's
* build an AD environment
* Create users, computers, &amp; apply policy to them in a series of lessons
* work through some of the 'learncodethehardway.org' lessons.

The student wants to learn programming as well but I am a *****NOT***** programmer.  So I am compiling a few resources for him to work on coding himself.   (In fact 11 years ago I swore off technology career due to my 'intro to programming' class at college)

Any thoughts on things I can develop into lesson plans for the student would be greatly appreciated.

Beginning my summer internship quest I sent emails for one at a few places.. A few of the software company's did not have big fancy online applications. Simply just asked for an email, and sending a cover letter or a resume. I sent it roughly two weeks ago and haven't heard back. Maybe it is just their subtle way of saying no, but going through life and reading biographys ( sounds silly but true) I have learned that in situations like that you have to try and take every shot. I would assume that if it was a no they would at least send an email back and let me know. When is it professionally okay to resend an email or try again? I don't want to harass them but at the same time I want them to know that I really want it.

Any other tips on hunting internships in general?

I'll be starting this Spring as a freshmen. I won't be having any intense classes (two programming classes, two math classes, and gen eds) which leaves me with a lot of spare time and what better way to make use of that time to prepare for my career? 

A couple of days ago, I spent an afternoon planning out my 2015 goal. I've broken it down from my yearly goal to monthly goals to weekly goals. I've edited it based on some suggestions and advice from /r/cscareerquestions. If you guys have any suggestions or input, I'm more than open for them! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask away.

* **Goals**

I want to be a competent software engineer with a good grasp on computer science, not just programming. Not just that, but in order to start my career off on the right foot, I need to secure an internship. How awesome would it be to secure an internship between my sophomore and junior year? Me being the ambitious person I am, I want to aim for the best; If I'm going to go down the road of becoming a software engineer, I'm going to want to intern/work for one of the best companies in the industry.

My first half of the year tends to follow the same strategy: 3 weeks of reading and small projects with 1 week of reviewing and programming challenges from reddit, hackerrank, and other resources I may come across. 

The second half of the year serves as a huge practice +review, getting ready for internship interviews. I'm aiming for the Big 4, but if I don't manage to land one, I'm sure I'll land something. In July, I'll be dedicating three weeks to algorithms and one week to design patterns, each week supplemented with whiteboard practicing. August will be used as a whole month to dedicate to a small side project. I'm not sure what it'll be yet, but I'm sure I'll think of something by then. September will be the month of really preparing for interviews. I plan to read the Programming Interviews Exposed in its entirety and practice some more on the whiteboard. October through December will be the months I work on an Android application, an idea I've had for a couple of years now that has yet to be implemented.

This plan is ambitious. This plan requires discipline. This plan requires drive. Will I succeed? I don't know, but it'd be a lot easier to fail if I didn't have a plan.

* **Resources**

[Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208)

I'll be using Head First Java because not only did I enjoy the style of writing, but I feel like it caters to my learning style. It's also a huge plus that this book has been heavily recommended by many experienced programmers.

[Algorithms, 4th edition](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419798961&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=algorithms)

My original plan had the Introduction to Algorithms book as opposed to this, but I felt like Algorithms was a bit easier to understand. It was also recommended to use this as a my source and use Introduction to Algorithms as a reference.

[Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419799004&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=head+frist+designs)

The design patterns book by GoF is the one that's highly recommended, but I decided to go ahead and read this first and touch on GoF after the year ends. Again, Head First's style really caters to my way of learning.

[Google Android Training](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html)

I figured I'd go with Google's training as opposed to a book, but if I do run into any difficulties, I'll definitely find a book to help me out.



**Note: I am not experienced in any way and this plan is based on what I want to do and with resources I feel comfortable with. This was created with the help of friends, family, and users on the internet with programming experience.**"
2qngwy,2,2014-12-28,Grad School Letters of Recommendation,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2qngwy/grad_school_letters_of_recommendation/,"I'm in the year before I graduate and I'm starting to think about my plans after college. While I have an internship right now, it's not very fulfilling and I'm starting to think it's not going to give me a leg up on the competition for internships (of which there are very slim pickings at my university in ChemE). Because of that, and because of my GPA (&gt;3.9), I'm starting to think that grad school might be necessary. Also, I've noticed that a lot of the engineering jobs in the field I want to enter require some sort of advanced degree (Master's at the least if not a Ph.D), and that there aren't many jobs in the industry in this region available to BS holders. (As an aside, I fucked up in choosing my major not realizing that all of the jobs were in places like the Gulf Coast or the Midwest, and had I known earlier, I probably would have gone Electrical instead, but it's too late to switch.)

However, I've noticed that everyone stresses the importance of letters of recommendation. I don't know any of the professors, as I haven't really gone to office hours (haven't felt the need to, and I've gotten this far without it). My university does offer a combined BS/MS program, but it also requires these letters and I'm not sure how I can obtain them in time for the deadline (Spring quarter). Am I going to be unable to get into an MS program despite my GPA because of this?"

Around the same time I applied to Google for their SWE internship, but I was denied roughly a week or two later. I considered myself to be a top contender, top 5 CS school undergrad, non-terrible GPA, a decent amount of projects, and some leadership activities. Nothing that stands out as a red-flag.

Everyone I know got a first round interview and the consensus is seemingly that a referral is a free phone interview basically. Does anyone know what might have happened? I asked my friend again to make sure and he is certain that he e-mailed his recruiter. My thought is that maybe the recruiter didn't get to me fast enough, and I was assigned to a different recruiter who thought I wasn't strong enough? Or maybe the recruiter forgot? I understand that the deadline for Google is over but this has been lurking on my mind for quite a while now.

**Some basic information about me**: I'm a sophomore in college (CS major, minoring in mathematics). I go to a top 20 public university in the eastern US (it's ranked in the lower half, nothing really prestigious).


**School stuff**: my GPA's been all over the place; I got above a 3.0 my first semester, below 2.0 my second semester, and a 3.0 for my third semester (most recent). My cumulative GPA is ~2.7, which I know is pretty bad, it's going up bit by bit. Outside of class, I have an executive board position in my university's Society of Women Engineers chapter, I work for the CS department (doing coding projects for open houses, etc), I help maintain a section of the engineering school website, and I'm a tour guide for the engineering school.


**Internship stuff**: the summer after my freshman year of college, I somehow got an internship at MathWorks in their Technical Computing department. It was mainly coding (robotics and image processing using MATLAB and a bit of C++) and some technical writing. I felt I was in over my head and pretty out of place (I didn't meet many other undergrad interns, and definitely no other freshmen, they were all from prestigious schools, and most of them were doing their Master's or PhD), but I really enjoyed working there, and my manager invited me back for an internship for next summer. But to be honest, I didn't have any ""real"" coding experience going into the internship (mostly scripting, barely any object-oriented programming), so I'm not even sure why they hired me.


Object-oriented programming scares the shit out of me. I try to do something like app development, and I'll get overwhelmed once I open up my IDE because although I understand conceptual stuff, I have no clue where to start once it gets to actual programming. I like scripting because it's easier, but I really want to get better at object-oriented languages because it'll be helpful. I have no idea where to begin if I want to get better at it. I understand concepts really well, but I usually have no idea how to put them into application. I wouldn't even know where to begin. How do I get better at applied computer science and programming? How can I continually improve my skills to the point where I've mastered them?


**Present**: As of now, I have a summer internship offer from PG&amp;E out in CA, and a return offer coming in from MathWorks in MA so far. I'll have a few more offers coming in by the end of April, so I'll have some companies to choose from for this upcoming summer. I'm surprised I have offers, and I'm grateful that somebody wants to hire me. But I want to start narrowing in on a specific sub-field where I can really develop my skills. I like data analysis/big data/statistics, and I like robotics/automation, and I want to get a feel for software development/app development (mostly as a hobby). The only thing I have any useful experience in is robotics. I don't know what kinds of internships I should be looking for, but the ones I have right now aren't really where I want to be going with my career. What specific companies/positions should I be keeping an eye open for? How can I boost my resume despite bad grades I got freshman year?


I'm using my winter break to pick up R and Python (and learning how to use GitHub), but I really want to ""stand out"" and be a competitive applicant. I have no idea how to stand out when it has to do with data or robotics, especially given my lack of experience with it. What kinds of projects should I be working on? I want to enter competitions and hackathons, but I have no idea where/how to do that, or how to get enough experience for them. I have friends who go to big-name schools, are doing some really cool research, get to travel all over the place for engineering projects and other things that I don't have opportunities for at my college, and they're getting internships at Microsoft and other companies that are difficult to get into and it's really making me doubt my own abilities once I see what other people are achieving. Sure, I want to intern/work at places like Google, Quora, Palantir, and SpaceX because I like the projects they're working on, but I have no idea how to get myself to that level where I can confidently apply and have a shot of even an interview at those kinds of places. I'm not anywhere near competitive for those positions, and I have no idea how to get there.

That means I have 3 months in between my last two semesters.

I did an internship for the first half of this year instead of attending a spring semester, so I have 7 months of experience going into my last year. 

I didn't try too hard this fall looking to line something up for the summer, I did get a couple interviews but I didn't click with any of them (aka I got too nervous and they were bad)... I'm still trying to figure out what to do with those 3 months. I guess I'm still waiting to hear back from quite a few applications that still have deadlines in feb/march.

The way I see it, I have a few options:

1. (my plan right now) Keeping searching for a summer internship; if that fails, do something engineering relevant... or a summer odd job or splurge and do some travelling or some shit.
2. Try to find some sort of research assistant position? I think that sounds sorta interesting and I'm considering it
3. Search for full-time positions that start after I graduate? Would it be too soon to do some of that this coming semester instead of my last one? But that doesn't give me something for the summer...
4. Be a summer bum, wear bro tanks, grow my hair out and do drugs by the beach. ^^jk

Unfortunately due to a buy out of the company that I worked for this past spring, by the time my contract expired the engineering department all got laid off and is no longer existent... so there's no going back there. Fucked up right?

Right now I'm thinking of filling out more summer internship apps online over winter break... There's a career fair in February anyway, so I'm also banking on that for possible opportunities.

I made this post for myself because I like to write what I'm thinking, but I put it here cause there's got to be some of you on here that have been in this same boat? What are your plans, or what did you do?

That said, it very much looks like I will be taking over our classes full time in the Spring without much help.

I don't want to sound like I'm whining because I know that in this profession unexpected things happen all the time so I'm just trying to be prepared. I'm approaching this with the mentality that I am basically a first year teacher but I am only half trained. Everyone in my university program seems confident in my future, as does my mentor, but having just found out about this I am shaking with fear and nervousness at the thought of having to do this without a mentor on top of my university school work, preparing a portfolio, going to job fairs, somehow trying to make money to pay bills, etc.

It *looks* as though I will have to assume full time duties as if I were a first-year teacher but without pay. I say looks because I only got the email from my mentor about 30 minutes ago - so no response from my university or the school administration yet. I know several other English teachers in the building and they can help but I don't have my own curriculum for any of our classes. Three of the classes that we are teaching are ones my mentor hasn't taught before or that had to be drastically altered so she doesn't have very detailed plans for them either.

The classes are:

English 9

English 9 Honors

Creative Writing x 2 (which I know nothing about, I took no CW in college)

AP English 12

Both of my 9th grade classes and AP I am at least very familiar with, having been with them this Fall. CW, which as I said I know nothing about anyway, is a semester long class so there will be new students. It's also my mentor's signature class at this school - she created it, everyone knows it's hers and expectations are high and I'm sure I'm gonna disappoint sixty kids who just wanted to be in class with my mentor and not her student teacher. She is wonderful and has an excellent reputation and many students sign up just based on that.

What does 9th grade even read in the Spring besides Romeo and Juliet and To Kill a Mockingbird? I love Shakespeare but I've never taught him! How do you introduce it? What do you focus on? How do you monitor thirty or more students trying to write their first research papers? How do you differentiate grading those papers when half your students have IEPs? Will parents get mad about an intern teaching AP? What do I do with the kids who write suicide poems in creative writing? How do I critique creative writing pieces in meaningful ways? What if my program decides to just drop me from the student teaching roster since my mentor will be gone? What if they assign me to somewhere else? How will my own schoolwork suffer? I really want a 4.0 I'm grad school and what if that doesn't happen now? How will I find time to work on my stupid portfolio, which is required by my program? 

I'm also not great at time management. My lessons either go too short or too long. Tips on that, especially?

This isn't how the student teaching year is supposed to go. I guess I'm all for learning the hard way, that doesn't bother me, but I worry that my being thrown into the fire will have a negative impact on my students. That's just not fair to them. Not just academically but personally - I'm can't offer them the same mentorship or disciplinary guidance that my mentor can. Not yet! Some of these kids are just 14 they need real adults teaching them, not interns who don't bring the kind of experiences to the table that a real teacher does.

I guess I'm coming to this community for advice, support, resources - anything and everything you can give me. Teaching resources for 9th grade, creative writing exercises, last minute classroom management tips (22 y/o M, if that helps) now that I won't have my mentor to bail me out in management situations, AP guidance...my high school did not offer AP. I took classes at the local community college in high school so I do not know what the AP expectations really are as the plan originally was to keep me relatively uninvolved with that class so that they would have a higher chance of doing well on the AP exam.

I wasn't given a building key so I can't go in over break except on the one work day. Tomorrow I will spend all day mapping out semesters as best as I can. My mentor said I should never hesitate to contact her by email but I'm sure you're all aware of the difficulties and limitations involved in that.

Advice? Lessons? Free tools to make this easier? Sample curricula? AP resources that can be digested in under a week (school starts on the 6th)? General advice regarding teacher decorum that I won't be able to get from my mentor? What do I tell the students? How do I keep the fr blowing me off as not the real teacher - I am not worried about this for my freshmen or APE students but creative writing attracts a...different crowd. The kind of student looking for an easy English credit. Hard to motivate.

Gosh there are so many things I was planning on having her help me with. Rubrics! Research methods and sites! Classroom management! Appropriate discipline! How do you handle angry parents? I'm kind of a brusque person and I don't smile a lot so I don't want to come off the wrong way. How do you handle the confrontational students? I don't believe in being the super authoritative guy who writes referrals left and right or sends students to the office on a whim. I believe in talking things out, being honest, open, sympathetic - something that's much easier with a mentor around to back me up. I worry now that this approach will be mistaken for not being serious. 

**TLDR** - Student teacher thrown into more responsibility than usual, seeking any and all advice to make this semester go as smoothly for everyone as possible. It seems like nobody's student teaching year ever goes like it's supposed to. At least it'll make for good experience. "

I have a question about an unpaid internship offer that I recently received. To avoid repeating myself, here is a snippet of the e-mail the employer sent me: 

&amp;nbsp;

""The project that we want to have you work on is the development of a software program that is web-based tool that manages your online activities.

The tool would include the ability to post to all social media sites, schedule posts to all social media sites, allow emailing, blogging, advertising, sales, SEO and web analytics.  We also want it to have a ecommerce as well as SMS capabilities. 

Each option needs to work independently as well as with each of the others as we will have several subscription options.""

&amp;nbsp;

Mind you this is a project that probably extend through the next six months, and for that reason as well as the fact I'll be starting school again soon, I'm really second guessing myself on this one. 

Also, if I do decide to take this on, I was considering recruiting my friend to share the workload with, assuming that the employer is okay with this. 

Given that this seems to be my only option until something else pops up, should I go with it and see where it leads me or focus on other side projects and skill development until I graduate in the next six months? Advice would be greatly appreciated."

2qrn7f,25,2014-12-29,25 and loosing hope of finding a career,fueledbyjannie,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2qrn7f/25_and_loosing_hope_of_finding_a_career/,"Hi there. Looking for a little advice as to where to go now. 

First my background. Received my undergrad in 2013 in Media Studies with a certificate in Public Relations. Interned during this job with my local City government and absolutely loved it. I worked in the Communications department and created posters, billboards, speeches, e-mail templates, brochures. It was extremely fulfilling and I loved my boss and the people I worked with. I never experienced a bad day and enjoyed going into my internship, despite never being paid for my time there.

Received a job (thanks to a friend) in a telephony position about 6 months after my graduation. At that point I was desperate and just wanted to work. My friend lied to me about the history of the position and that the person I would be directly working with had cycled through people in the future (7 people in 3 years).  Learned that I have no interest in going into sales (at least in telephony equipment) and that I do not want to be any sort of assistant. I have a hard time respecting people who don't respect me. Making meetings and calling people back kind of squashes all hope of that for me.

At this point, I decided to get my Masters (in Public Relations). I went back to working part-time retail for about a year. Started applying and received a government job, in my field, about two months ago. I was ecstatic about this job. I had interned in government before and loved it. Being a Community Relations position, it seemed right up my alley. However, I should have taken heard the problems before. About six months before I started, major changes took place. The Director of my department (who had worked there for over 12 years I believe) was fired on a Wednesday morning after a Council meeting). Only a few weeks after I started, a variety of gossip was shared with me (yes, I know, grain of salt). My bosses were purposely trying to overwhelm me. People who had been there for almost 20 years were trying to leave. My position had experienced at least 4 others in the past year. There were tensions not only between the bosses and the employees, but the employees themselves. I received no training. I interned in City government for about 5 years, but I was never handed RCA, RFQ, and a variety of other acronym-ed documents to create. I feel that I am trusted with thing way beyond my mental capacity (i.e., I've not taken a math class since high school, but am trusted to enter $14,000 worth of acquisitions?). I was told off by a superior (in front of the Assistnat Director) for being disrespectful because I asked a question and mentioned that i was overwhelmed. Admittedly, I was irritated and it appeared in my voice. However, I did not say anything wrong. The only thing present in my voice was frustration because I was, once again, not given any direction. I decided that night that I no longer wanted to work there and applied for over 15 jobs the next day. I feel that I have been set up for failure, and am once again leaving to go ANYWHERE but where I am now.

I have an interview for a retail position on Friday. I am beyond desperate to leave, and thankfully still live at home and can afford to take such a drastic pay cut. I have never felt as disrespected as an employee working retail, than I have in an office setting.

Am I wrong to want to be respected, even as an entry level employee? 
Am I overly picky? Or have I just been handed two extremely crummy hands?
I was always told that school is the way to find happiness in your career, but I'm getting nothing but heartbreak. Should I even continue with my Masters (I'm about a year in, not due to graduate until 2017)?

I want to work hard. But I want to be happy where I work. Is it wrong to expect the same amount of respect I had while doing my internship?

I'd appreciate anything you have to share. 

TL;DR - I've worked two full-time jobs, both lasting under 4 months. Is it me? Or is it a crummy situation?"
2qro4f,549,2014-12-29,TIFU by driving four hours to help my sister.,tkc80,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2qro4f/tifu_by_driving_four_hours_to_help_my_sister/,"So, a little bit of background. My sister has an internship 6 hours from home, I am home over break doing a whole lot of nothing except for playing videogames. Sister was home but leaving at 5am to drive to her internship and stay there for two weeks. 

It is 5am, me and my buddy are still awake drinking at my house when she wakes up, gets in her car and heads out to the job. I go to bed at around 7 and we wake up to a phone call at 10, which was my sister saying her car broke down halfway and she needed a car brought to her. She already had hers towed and was waiting at the dealership. It sucked and I had other plans for the day, but alright, I'll drive one car, buddy offered to follow me and drive us back home, easy fix. 

We are both running on three hours of sleep, the first two hours were fine. We give her one car and my buddy is tired so I drive his car. I am EXHAUSTED at this point. No, the alcohol from the night before isn't a problem. The red bull is not kicking in, but I figured I can stop and find some sort of tobacco when I fill his car with gas after the first hour.

I get back into the car, buddy is still asleep in the passenger seat so I take off. About twenty minutes later I get pulled over. The cop asks me if I was at certain gas station and I think to myself ""oh shit I totally forgot to pay"" ... but it was prepay so I was really confused. I asked him why because I knew I paid and he just points back to the back of my car. For the past 20 miles I had been driving with the fuel pump and ~10 feet of the fuel hose still attached to my car. Had to turn around, pay to replace the hose, and receive plenty of funny looks. Doesn't help the place was busy when I was fueling up, too... I still don't know how I didn't realize it...

TL:DR- Sleep deprived, have to drive 4 hours, fill up with gas, rip gas hose out of machine, get cops called on me after driving down the interstate with this thing sticking out of the car for 20 minutes.


Edit: People are getting mad about the fact I was driving. I keep defending myself, but seriously I wasn't going to leave my sister stranded in the middle of nowhere. "
2qs0bg,3,2014-12-29,"I[20F] feel like I'm completely lost. I want to change several things in my life. Namely, how I deal with my friendships, romantic relationships, etc.",hadbeenthrown,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/2qs0bg/i20f_feel_like_im_completely_lost_i_want_to/,"[x-post from /r/relationships]

Quick rundown:  
-20F, upper-middle class, sophomore at flagship BIG10 university (3.4 GPA in liberal arts area, looking at internship and fellowship).

-Diagnosed with Asperger's at 10, anxiety disorder throughout my life.  Therapist and I are considering ADD-PI to add to that list (yay conditions!).  Have sought therapy throughout my life.

-Have had ~4 relationships in ~4 years, can never keep a single group of friends.  

I've always been socially awkward, and a bit of an oddball in terms of my humor, interests, and ways of interacting with people.  The Asperger's is the main function of that, but lately I've also been feeling emotionally unstable.  I have gotten much better at it in the past 2 years alone, but I feel like the ""natural""-looking part of it will never come to me.  I feel as if, while I'm finally developing the ability to socialize and hang out with people, that they don't like me.  I met a group of friends my first semester (Spring 14), and they seemed ok/cool/nice.  Mostly the active nerdy type, lots of arts (film, etc.) and comm. majors, and they like to talk about comic books, movies, etc. a lot.  Started hanging out with them towards the end of the semester (that semester was a wreck with a bad roommate, my anxiety disorder out of control, and grades).  Kept trying to hang out with them this semester.  But I feel like whenever I try to hang out with them, especially the more stubborn/headstrong girls of the group, I'm the awkward runt who never really fits in.  I don't know where to jump in on the conversations; they have all of these in-jokes and ways they all interact with that.  I feel like a total outsider.  It seemed to be going well at first, but now it's just......it feels really contrived and awkward.  Partially due to the not being there at first, but also because my lack of social skills.

But then there are the people that either want to hang out with me, or it feels like they're trying to fake being nice to me.  I keep pushing them away, even though, realistically, they're nice people, and they'd probably be good friends.  But instead, I keep either avoiding them because a) they're the *weird* kind of weird.  Which I probably am too, I just want to accept it.  or b) because it's like.......I don't know how to keep up with people.  How do you invite someone out to something?  Keep up conversation without sounding weird?  I usually talk to more people if they're in the caf, their rooms, etc.  I never actively seek out people......which is probably a problem.  I desperately crave them, but I have no idea how to.

I'm also super negative.  Like......I'm getting better at carrying on conversations about their interests, but what's pushing on my mind is the negative stuff, and I keep talking about that.  How I had a bad day at work, how my test sucked, etc.  I realize that's offputting too, but I can't seem to change the dialogue in my head.  I can also change moods depends on what happens, almost at the drop of a hat.

I also feel like I don't have stability with boyfriends.  I've been dating since 16, now 20.  I've had 4 boyfriends (depending on how you define it).  Yeah, young, experimental, whatever.  But it feels like I can't not have a boyfriend.  Let me explain.  I broke up with Addison in August, right before I came back.  We were getting irritated with each other, and I initiated it.  I start dating Finn in mid-September, even though I tried to tell myself ""I need to take time for myself"".  Admittedly, I'd mentally broken up with him in May and I'd known Finn for over a year, and there was a mutual attraction.  But I feel like........there's this pathological desire that if *I'm not with someone, then I feel so lonely*.  I'm not terribly clingy (I'd hope....), but I tend to focus my attention a lot more on my boyfriend a lot more than my friends, especially at first.  Finn is great.  He's sweet and kind, not bad-looking, but I feel this nagging sense of being able to do.....better, and it's not fair to him.  He's getting a research position soon, and he's been working on himself.  But I feel terrible because I want that guy who's hotter and has more of his shit together, even though Finn is on his way and absolutely kind.  He has depression, and doesn't have many college friends (he keeps in touch with some people from high school).

I've been feeling shit about that a lot.  I've also been overloading myself in work just to feel like I'm doing something.  If I'm not drowning in work, I don't feel ok.  Never mind the fact I can't start anything until last minute.  I pushed back voluntary research for over a month and a half because it had no actual deadline.  Nothing is done until panic, unless I have an inspired flash of energy and then I whip out something, though it's never what I actually need to do.

Yes, I have a therapist, but I feel like she was a great help in Spring Sem., but this past one she wasn't.  I need concrete solutions.  I feel like I have to keep up a certain expectation with her, that I'm doing fine/perfect, or whatever.  The problems feel shallow.  Idk.  Yes, I realize that's not the point of a therapist.

As a result of this and work,  I feel tired/burned out right now, even 2 weeks into break.  I feel like there's all this pressure.  I want the friends, I want the perfect internship, I want satisfaction.  But I have no ""legs"" to get it.
---   
**tl;dr**: More of a confessional than anything, but I feel completely dissatisfied with friends, boyfriend, etc.   I feel like I need to do better constantly, but don't have the motivation/means to achieve it.  There's probably not going to be a clear cut answer, but maybe someone who is/has been similar can offer advice?"

With how much detail do I need to know certain data structures?,Thounumber1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qseoo/preparing_for_google_interview_that_is_in_about_2/,"So I have a google interview coming up for the software engineering intern position. I have taken a data structures class and an operating systems class, and I have been reviewing for a little over a week now (I have been very busy and struggled to find time to study, I have had a lot of stuff on my plate). 

Do I need to know exactly how to implement every single data structure that is discussed in that interview preparation document (slideshow) that they give you? Or is it more important to simply know what they are conceptually, and know the big-O for the main operations? 

I ask this because currently I am teaching myself about red-black trees, and I understand the basic properties and why we use them, but the implementation seems pretty complicated. Will they seriously ask me to implement an entire red-black tree in an interview? The deletion operation in particular seems a bit tricky on a red-black (in my data structures class we only covered AVL trees, not red-black, and we never actually implemented them, we just covered the rotations and how they work). In the interview preparation document though, it says we should know how to implement at least one self-adjusting binary search tree. 

I guess I'm just getting nervous, I'm not sure I'll be well-prepared enough come the date of the interview (January 14th), and reading stories about people who have been rejected makes me even more nervous. Currently I have reviewed linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, and hash tables. I am comfortable with implementing these and I can discuss the big-O tradeoff's and such. 
Right now I am reviewing graphs, as well as self adjusting trees. I don't remember exactly how AVL trees work other than that they use rotations to re-adjust themselves so that they are height balanced, which guarantees the O(logn) lookup time. RB trees are somewhat similar too. I also haven't taken an algorithms class, so I don't know about dynamic programming, or divide and conquer, or any of those sorts of things, and I also need to review some sorting algorithms and operating systems details (I am fuzzy on those). And I still have yet to practice some problems from cracking the coding interview. Am I screwed? How can I conceivably be prepared by January 14th (at least prepared enough to pass the interview)? I also have to study discrete mathematics problems (specifically combinations and permutations, which I kind of suck at)

I don't know, this whole thing is very stressful, I don't know how I can pass at this rate. The interview preparation document listed sooooo many things, and I'm sure only a subset of these things are going to be asked in the interview, but the thing is I dont know what subset that will be. I guess I'm just really intimidated by the sheer volume of all of the stuff in that document. I'd say I'm a good programmer, I have a fairly decent resume and a good GPA (3.9) and I have done well in my CS classes but this all still seems very daunting to me. ahhhhhhhhhh........... I know this post has been somewhat incoherent and tangential, if someone else who has prepared for an internship interview like this could give me some advice, I would appreciate it. "

I just wanted to ask you guys any tips or advice on how best to approach getting into a solid masters program.

About myself:

Graduated from a good school as a civil eng major with a concentration in geotech in May 2013.  However, I kind of drowned between the work commitments of engineering and being a student-athlete, which was a 40+ hr/wk time commitment.  I make it out alive but have a ~2.6 gpa with no internship experience (also due to sports)

I figured that wouldn't be the best time to apply to grad school so I pursued work experience and ultimately ended up with a field position for a premier geotech firm- given my situation I don't think it could've ended any better.

I figure this work experience would be a valuable asset in a grad school application, and if I can combine this with a strong gre score, maybe I can get schools to see past my undergrad gpa.

So while I'm still on square 0 in terms of planning this whole thing, I wanted to reach out here as well and ask for any tips that may be most helpful in getting into a strong masters program.

I just got hired as an intern at a small, but rapidly growing company and have been tasked with creating an inventory process from the ground up.

As of right now, I'm working with MS Access to create a somewhat rudimentary database with forms for easy data entry. However, all I seem to be able to do with it is make one static list of which assets are tied to which user and another for what assets are in storage. I don't know enough about Access to figure out how to make checking an asset out of storage and assigning it to a user part of the process by any way other than simply deleting the record in one table and re-entering it in the other. I know you can use SQL with Access, but I don't know nearly enough about it and I'm not sure if it would even be able to do what I need.

Does anybody have any suggestions for making this work better? I really feel like I'm trying to reinvent the wheel here."

I fucked up one test, the grading was harsh, there was no curving whatsoever and I ended up with a damn D after spending every single weekend of the semester working on stupid lab reports for this class.

I don't even understand what these professors think but anyways, all I can do is keep moving. 

These IE classes are for the most part total and complete bullshit, so from here on,  I am just going to focus on getting a 2nd internship or co-op and hopefully have a few job leads before I graduate.

I'm interested in applying for this program. I have a few questions for those who are in the program and greatly appreciate any answers.

1. I attended JC before transferring to a 4 year school, will I be required to submit both transcripts? Also does anyone know the average GPA to get into the program?  I saw the minimum GPA requirement on the website, but often schools list a minimum GPA, but the average GPA for competitive majors and programs are quite a bit higher.

2. I plan an working while doing this program. I want to do the 2 year track and am wondering if it is realistically possible to balance a 9-5 job and this program.

3. Has anyone tried to get  internship and where you asked about how you were obtaining the CS degree. In other words are there negative feelings toward getting a degree online rather than the traditional method?

4. Has anyone gotten any info on how this program prepares you to get admittance into a masters program or will more coursework be required (not just a few classes,but a lot of classes after)?

Thanks a lot for any feedback!"

2qvz0c,1,2014-12-30,I'm always going between engineering and IT can someone help me choose and weigh in on my other current career building choices?,Sheehan7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qvz0c/im_always_going_between_engineering_and_it_can/,"I am currently in my first year of community college majoring in Computer Information Technology. The program I am also in is a transfer program and as long as I keep a 2.5 gpa I get automatic entrance into any state school (my dream school is included, one of the top computer science schools around) so that isn't too hard to get. The thing is I keep going from IT to engineering and I just can't decide. I have taken both a turbo CAD class and an intro IT class in high school and I loved them both. On one hand I want to build and fix computers but I don't really want to deal with stupid people (retail has made me sour to that aspect of the job). On the other hand with engineering I want to feel like I am making strides in society and would love to be on a team developing new technology that will change the world (specifically robotics which I have always found fascinating and awesome) However I am not very creative but I LOVE building things like legos and some robotics kits I have and I usually build things pretty fast, not sure if that is an aspect of engineering. I'm not a fan of math but I believe if I try hard enough I can accomplish any math challenges. 

Now onto my current career building choices. I am currently employed at a comic book store and I HATE it. It's a very hostile work environment (my manager constantly tells me to quit college and stay in retail forever) and I believe I am just more suited for things that arent working a register or taking out trash. I have been applying for internships and entry level technology and office jobs and I actually landed an interview for a clerk position at a law office in Boston. My question here is will this be at all beneficial to me or will it be a waste of time? My only other experience is my current retail job so I figure the addition to my resume will at least be a bonus. 

I would really, really appreciate advice on this. I just don't want to transfer to a 4 year university only to find out IT isn't what I want to do in life or vice versa. Also if I am currently making correct choices. Thanks a bunch"

2qx9fk,8,2014-12-31,Application Developer / Dev ops,throwawayDevAcc9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qx9fk/application_developer_dev_ops/,"I've searched a bit on this sub the past few days and didn't see anything in regards to this type of position. 

**the tl;dr**
My question is, where do I go from here? It seems I have a lot of choice in my career direction.  I'd like to hear from more experienced vets of the industry what they think is the most rewarding (personally/financially, both perspectives is fine) path is.  Doing work as application developer, good knowledge of operations. For right now I'm extremely happy with my work, but I want to be proactive in what to learn and best markets/skill sets to hone. 

**Quick relevant details:**

Job Title: Application Developer.  Develop full-stack applications as well as scripts for my entire department. Very well versed in various linux enviornments. Working mostly in python, ruby, js, php, perl, bash. Frameworks are all in python (Django, Flask).  Front-end stuff is css/js/html/bootstrap/jquery. I've worked with mysql (percona) and sqlite on the db side. CCNA (from internship, they paid for the testing, I studied hard).

Salary: 65k + Bonus structure at work (~3% or higher raise yearly during reviews).

Experience: &lt;1 year professional experience with development. 1 year internship experience total doing operational work with network engineering in an enterprise setting.

Enviornment/Location: Enterprise level company (&gt;50k employees). NorthEast US. Love the work, good work/life balance.  Regularly work hard because I want to, not because it's required. Good management (at least on the teams I've been on). Cool projects to work on.

**Little more detail:**

I just got hired recently to be an application developer following dev ops methodologies.  I got hired as I demonstrated during my internship my aptitude for programming and scripting.  Some of my work is writing quick scripts to help automate many, many parts of our operations. I also build full-stack applications as tools for other departments. I get to work with a gigantic array of different types of technologies, hardware/software wise so I am learning a great deal here. I do 0 ticketing work, although I work closely with those guys/gals to help develop tools they'd find useful. I do development work 100% of the time, but my good knowledge of operations helps me develop network applications well as I have a very good understanding of low level protocols.

I regularly go home and work on my own projects to help me learn frameworks, cleaner ways of coding, I regularly read books relevant to the field and practice what I learn. 


So where do I go from here, what are some opinions on what skills to develop/hone?  Any general advice for a mid-twenties guy who really enjoys development work?

I know java, visual basic, and a little C++. Right now I'm thinking of making a chat client in java, with the ability to send files. If I have time I may get into android and port it over (idk how practical that is). I think a file/chat client between android and Personal Computers would be kinda cool. I took networking already and that program would be a direct extension of what I already know. 

Nontheless, I would like to hear ideas from other people. Thanks in advance!"

The contract is for a year with an optional one year renewal with no promise, though there's a decent track record, of receiving an offer to be a full time internal employee.

**My question is**, to ensure my future employability is it better to deep dive into one domain, in this case Android, or to diversify my skill set? 

I'm extremely happy working on Android and wouldn't mind doing it forever. Java was my first language and is my only fluent one though through school I've picked up a decent amount of c++. My own hobby projects are going to require me to learn some back end server coding (probably RESTful) and c++ on the pi."
